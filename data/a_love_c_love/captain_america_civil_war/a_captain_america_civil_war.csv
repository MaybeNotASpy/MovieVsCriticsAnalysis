Mar 24 2024,positive,spiderman that is all there is to say
Mar 22 2024,positive,yeah this is peak marvel top 5 movie
Mar 20 2024,positive,another great marvel sequence i was hoping for this to be another solo captain america movie as iron man had three of its own but this movie focused on captain america and what he believes is right and wrong and how this will cause rifts for other characters giving them more rounding and arc potential this also sets up tom holland and his take on spiderman as we will eventually see

Feb 19 2024,negative,captain america and buckys romance kills this film they shouldve just married
Feb 18 2024,positive,captain america and iron man are the stars of this eventful layered adventure that keeps you entertained and invested with the help of some familiar faces and some fascinating new ones too
Feb 17 2024,positive,fascinating it never loses focus on captain america despite this turning into a teamup movie the final battle turns more intimate 1on1 for the better but still feels a little less exciting after all the crossovers earlier and the teamup being limited to 1 location undersales the idea of this being a war still the stakes are high
Feb 14 2024,positive,one of the greatest marvel movies made
Feb 7 2024,neutral,i liked how more mature it is but just not very interesting overall the whole fighting each other is kinda pointless
Jan 31 2024,positive,love the winter soldier and captain america friendships the fight scenes are incredible love wanda 
Jan 22 2024,positive,best captain america movie that was made
Jan 21 2024,positive,very interesting movie i was getting into it no problem got a little bit of issues with this movie spiderman really i dont understand how he fits into this whole storyline he almost seems like hes just a fluke that they threw in for the fun of it secondly whats with wakanda did we really need him brought into the film he didnt do much to make the film any better or any worse we could have kept this film perfect if we just kept it like it had been in the past i guess i got to see the next one to really understand the storyline i definitely would watch this again but the storyline sucked they really could have done better thats just my opinion
Jan 14 2024,positive,a great edition to the mcu franchise
Jan 10 2024,positive,this  movie  is  epic
Jan 1 2024,positive,the conflict between iron man and captain america drives a wedge through this community of heroes and they fight in one of the most joyous cinematic superhero battles ever filmed the closest thing weve seen to an onscreen splash page
Dec 30 2023,positive,one of the better mcu films worth watching once or twice
Dec 26 2023,positive,one of if not my favorite mcu movie purely for nostalgicpersonal reasons its the movie that got me back into the superhero genre and has cemented me there i can recite this movie word for word ill also never forget how spiderman was brought back home to marvel in this movie its not flawless of course but damn is it good and i love it to death
Dec 24 2023,positive,good setup but execution did not deliver
Dec 9 2023,positive,never before have comic book characters felt such like real people and never before has a marvel movie ever actually made me question whether the avengers were good people or not
Dec 5 2023,positive,the most serious that an mcu movie has gotten to this point having the characters we love face off against each other brought something fresh to a genre that was starting to get repetitive
Nov 26 2023,positive,great story line and conflicts
Nov 17 2023,positive,good movie the direction is very good here it has great action a very messy script but i give it an 810
Nov 16 2023,positive,if you can come out of this movie where you and your friends are debating which side was morally correcti  think youve accomplished what you set out to do with this film
Nov 15 2023,positive,at the time i watched this movie was way more superb then anything else i was on the side of iron man obviously because who doesnt have the same feelings as iron man the execution of the movie was wonderful and the introduction of new characters was perfectly shown spidermens introduction was the best thing here and black panther nailed his role here
Nov 13 2023,negative,not really entertaining
Nov 12 2023,positive,one of the best movies of all time
Nov 10 2023,positive,another amazing avengers movie  more please
Nov 7 2023,positive,a highgrade illustration of an inside conflict showing that even the good guys arent perfect and beef with each other sometimes but anyways the russo brothers did justice with the famous comic storyline having made a heavy final product
Nov 7 2023,positive,this movie does well what it tries to do and introduces great characters to the marvel repertoire   but it sometimes fails to have a two sided plot
Oct 31 2023,positive,it was ok also didnt iron man literally retire at the end of iron man 3 so confusing
Oct 28 2023,positive,this was so good it felt like an avengers movie
Oct 23 2023,positive,best captain america movie ever made
Oct 20 2023,positive,the mcu at its peak even better movie than infinity war or endgame
Oct 15 2023,positive,not your typical superhero film captain america civil war doubles as an action thriller
Sep 27 2023,positive,though the movie may portray this as a captain america movie this is most definitely avengers pt3 zemo is not a simple physical villain he is a threat due to his iq and meticulous planning spider man is introduced well and tom holland brings the lovable charm of peter parker the events in this movie does have consequences as it leads to the avengers success or failure in infinity war
Sep 6 2023,positive,a movie that has the appeal of an avengers film yet still manages to progress steve rogers character a somewhat more mature outing it explores themes such as the balance between personal agency and freedom as well as the need for oversight and accountability it also deals with the need for unity and understanding as shown between the characters
Sep 3 2023,positive,incredible love this movie   nuff said
Aug 24 2023,positive,perfect movie to end the cap trilogy and i believe this is such a perfect format for marvel gotta agree with cap tho hes always right
Aug 24 2023,positive,this is how you do a vs movie batman v superman  it makes sure that the characters that are disagreeing with each other very personal and effective that we care about the characters fighting and makes not want them to fight and also what i really loved is the character arcs between captain america and iron man iron man feels very personal for his actions in the avengers and wants to put the avengers in check meanwhile the best character in this movie and in his trilogy is captain america a man who wanted to fight for whats right for america and achieves while he was in the ice he discovers the government is not to be trusted and now in this movie since he knows how government can be corrupt and dangerous he does not want the avengers to trust the government and the people who wants to choose where they fight that is such a fantastic arc for captain america overall for me its a 1010
Aug 22 2023,positive,civil war is gripping and expansive in addition to being the third captain america film it effectively serves as a third avengers and a fourth ironman film that kind of range makes civil war big and exciting but also reduces it to a franchise movie that relies on other projects to be relevant
Aug 8 2023,positive,loved this damn movie team captain america forever
Aug 5 2023,positive,an incredible movie better then winter soldier and age of ultron loved how this was a mini avengers movie and a cap movie at the same time fantastic way to start phase 3 of the mcu
Aug 4 2023,positive,one of the worst mcu movies for sure  the inclusion of all those characters is stupid and they dont feel like the characters that we know from the comics  there is a scene where captain america tries to murder spiderman by dropping a 27ton truck on him in a follow up scene bucky barnes tries to kill spiderman and throws a big rock at him and then spiderman responds by trying to decapitate bucky with the rock he just threw at him this movie is bad for so many reasons the fight scenes were nice and black panther was probably the only good character in the movie  my main complaint is how none of the characters act the way you think they would cap would never throw a truck on a kid nor would spiderman ever try to decapitate someone
Aug 4 2023,positive,i for sure loved how they managed to get the avengers to split up into to factions lead by the the ones who hold the mcu together iron man and captain america although winter soldier is still slightly better this movie is in my top 10 really enjoyed the action especially the iconic airport battle and final fight
Jul 31 2023,positive,a n amazing film from marvel the writing and characters were top notch
Jul 27 2023,positive,this movie was really good the whole civil war idea in marvel is so cool the action and high stakes were fantastic in this thriller
Jul 23 2023,positive,captain america civil war delivers a thrilling and emotionally charged superhero showdown with its complex character dynamics and actionpacked sequences making it a standout instalment in the mcu
Jul 15 2023,positive,its very intense and i would not watch it with  kids under 7
Jul 12 2023,positive,this movie is fantastic seeing our heroes fight each other is something we both want and dont want to see the mature themes of the story and riveting world building make this entry pure edgeofyourseat fun the debut of black panther and spiderman push this movie into perfect marvel film territory
Jul 7 2023,negative,boring af one of the worst marvel movie like its si boring u fell like its 5 times longer that actually is
Jul 7 2023,positive,perfect movie love fights between heroes
Jul 5 2023,positive,this impressive movie is a vital part of the mcu that develops many characters
Jul 4 2023,positive,on the one hand its nice to see a film where the avengers have to come to terms with what their actions have done to others and the possibility that theyre actually engendering the danger to the world just by existing     on the other hand captain america is basically presented as being in the right for rejecting a un treaty instead supporting the narrative standin for american exceptionalism and the right of the avengers to act unilaterally in the face of what they deem as a threat without oversight and without facing the consequences of their actions in any bigger way than doing a sad face about it which subtexually says america has the right do what it deems to be necessary for the good of the world and invites the audience to assume that when the usa does something like invade a developing nation based on fabricated intelligence and a propaganda campaign that it must be for the good of the world and that definitely blows
Jul 3 2023,positive,this movie makes you choose a side and those who have chosen a side can normally defend it elaborately decrying those in the opposing camp this movie shook the mcu and delivered a taste of what was to come in terms of huge crossover movies by this point the team behind the marvel movies has mastered the art of witty banter and cgi fight scenes while still delivering an impactful story and an ending worth remembering
Jul 1 2023,positive,captain america civil war starts phase 3 of the mcu with a bang as we see all of our favorite characters as well as a new one in the mcu go face to face in an epic battle i can really feel the tension when all the characters interact
Jun 28 2023,positive,i really good movie loved it one of the best marvel movies with the comics were better but still one of the best marvel movie
Jun 28 2023,positive,amazing scenes especially when we got a full blown battle royal with spider man
Jun 19 2023,positive,thought provoking and a new intriguing direction bolstered by captain america the winter soldier captain america civil war takes a new route in a grounded and more gritty approach that addresses a main complaint about superhero films and poises a new era for the mcu as a whole
Jun 16 2023,positive,i feel like if everyone were to simply sit down and talk things through things could have been solved without so much division that having been said it is a good movie it introduces some of my favourite characters and it certainly impacts the rest of the infinity saga
Jun 11 2023,positive,civil war divides the audience in an intentional way and it works it takes what bvs couldve been and takes it to an 11 although i simply cant understand why anyone chooses ca side when he didnt tell tony stark anything that he knew
Jun 9 2023,positive,what a way to start phase three civil war is surely one of mcus best movie with its great action sequences and performances
Jun 8 2023,positive,once again a great captain america film again action sequences are literally jaw dropping climax was incredible as a christopher nolan
Jun 4 2023,positive,basically avengers 25 rather than a captain america 3 features a civil war between the avengers as two teams of avengers fight each other in a german airport fighting over whether or not someone did something very bad or not also introduces us to black panther
Jun 2 2023,positive,a civil war of a soilder  who struggles between 2 sides being his pals  team 
May 29 2023,positive,this movie takes the characters we love and puts them against each other thats just simply awesome
May 26 2023,positive,this movie is cool and good
May 24 2023,positive,i just have one thing to say if this wasnt a captain america movie tony would have won without a problem
May 21 2023,positive,definitely team cap this was an awesome nonavenger team up plus it introduced our favorite web slinger
May 19 2023,positive,might be the best mcu movie
May 16 2023,positive,captain america civil war is as close to perfection as i have seen in a film it has everything that i look for in a superhero movie there is character development realistic action appropriate humor and above else heart the pacing of civil war is wonderfully crafted as you learn the why behind each individuals actions honestly the motivations of every single person that takes place in the civil war are explained the russo brothers even go back to explain tonys character arc in im3 and aou where most ensemble films have a problem with screen time and balancing character subplots captain america civil war overcomes this problem with ease and is the best mcu film because of it not only does civil war do a great job of balancing character development it also has stunning visuals emotional pulling moments and suspense i was on the edge of my seat every minute of this film even on a rewatch this film has everything that you can hope for in a film and more
May 16 2023,positive,captain america civil war is an incredibly gripping and emotional story that very ambitiously pins its heroes against each other besides some shaky cgi moments it continues marvels streak of amazingly choreographed and visually stunning action sequences
May 13 2023,positive,a bit darker more mature take shows that even marvel superheros can have disputes over the correct course of action a movie where your favourite character can actually die or get hurt is much more thrilling
May 9 2023,positive,this was one of the best mcu movies when it came out my only down fall is i feel like it takes away from the captain america story with them having to introduce two new mcu characters i also wish they hadnt called it civil war as the comic story had a much larger lump sum of characters in the end it still holds up as a good mcu film just dont watch it too many times or youll see the magic wear off
May 8 2023,positive,captain america civil war is an awesome movie honestly this should really be an avengers movie this movie is the long awaited battle between captian america and iron man as they cause the avengers to take sides this movie introduced spider man i highly recommend this movie it also makes a good conversation with your friends about which of these two would actually win in the battle if you like batman vs superman well this is basically the marvel version of that
May 6 2023,positive,once again anthony and joe russo did a great job id think this is the perfect face off film since face off 1997
May 5 2023,positive,rdj as iron man  chris evens as captain america and the goat tom holland as spiderman in the same movie uh yes please best captain america movie of all time and for sure one of the best comic book movies of all time
May 3 2023,positive,wow is the first thing that comes to mind insanely good movie plus the introduction of black panther
May 1 2023,positive,it was so good that it could have been an avengers movie
Apr 30 2023,positive,one of the better mcu movies there is so much going on in this film that its almost hard to keep up the story gets twisted to the point you dont know who to cheer for and you just hope for the best 
Apr 28 2023,positive,small villain sometimes is work better rather than big villain
Apr 23 2023,negative,i kind of like the movie the acting and the action is great but the center story that drives this the sokovia accords is the most fabricated biggest bs possible the explanation given by ross the secretary of state is new york wash dc sokovia and lagos is billions in damage and loss of life  they need to be controlled the first three were a percent of what would have happened if it had not been stopped and the fourth was an accident in which more would have been killed in the marketplace than were killed in the building and it was still an accident like i said an excellent action movie with a weak center piece
Apr 20 2023,positive,the greatest mcu movie in my opinion definitely oscar worthy
Apr 18 2023,positive,personally one of my favorite superhero movies easily a top 5 mcu film 
Apr 17 2023,positive,a great movie that makes your emotions swing all the way through
Apr 9 2023,positive,dark and shocking captain america civil war is a stand out film that puts the heroes we all know and love in a fight and impresses with its story and character development    rating 85
Apr 8 2023,positive,it had its moments
Mar 31 2023,positive,one of the top 5 best mcu films sets the stage for the rest great flick
Mar 21 2023,positive,this movie is phenomenal this villain zemo whats the avengers dead but knows he cant take them on so instead gets them to be mad at each other so then they can kill each other i love how they fight its super interesting and entertaining they introduced spiderman antman and black panther witch those are some of my top 5 favorite superheros 
Mar 16 2023,positive,love this movie cap vs iron man awesome
Mar 13 2023,positive,an all time classic the acting action scenes and special effects are the highlight of this being first rate throughout this film is perfectly paced also despite being on the long side which i never felt once the only minor complaints is the music while very good isnt as good as winter soldiers and the editing while very well done bounces around a lot there is way more characters in this and it borders on being an avengers film more than a captain america film at times but i never felt that was a hindrance because it never really has many subplots to it it just has more characters involved in the main plot also the villain is kind of forgettable as well as he gets lost in the shuffle of so many other characters at times anyone should give this a watch though a great way to close on of the best trilogies ever made
Feb 28 2023,positive,i like the differences of each avengers character in this movie
Feb 22 2023,positive,to me this is the least playitsafe movie in the entire mcu maybe besides guardians or iron man to have the world you built over 8 years torn apart when a threat coming that they can only stop when united this movie has dire consequences zero however does not need to be in the film this movie did not need a villain and even though he is his plan doesnt make all too much sense it is completely a result of coincidence regardless the pain and emotion in this story help me forgive its flaws
Feb 21 2023,positive,captain america civil war directed by anthony and joe russo is a thrilling actionadventure film that pits members of the avengers against each other in a conflict over government oversight and personal loyalty    the film benefits from a strong ensemble cast with standout performances from chris evans as captain america and robert downey jr as iron man as well as newcomers chadwick boseman as black panther and tom holland as spiderman the dynamic between the characters is compelling and the film effectively balances character development with highstakes action sequences    the cinematography and special effects are impressive with thrilling set pieces and fight scenes that showcase the characters unique abilities the films themes of personal responsibility and the consequences of unchecked power are thoughtfully explored adding depth to the films fastpaced action    however the films complex plot and large cast can at times feel overwhelming and some characters dont receive as much screen time or development as others the films humor and lighter moments can also feel out of place at times detracting from the films more serious themes    overall captain america civil war is a thrilling and wellexecuted superhero film that delivers on action character development and thoughtprovoking themes while it may not be perfect its a standout entry in the marvel cinematic universe and a mustsee for fans of the genre
Feb 20 2023,positive,cool adaptation nice entry for spiderman
Feb 18 2023,positive,fantastic  a triumph  this and the winter soldier are modern day story telling at its best 
Feb 18 2023,positive,superpowered friends breakup because they make politics their personality    mcus twist on civil warits not as grand as the comics but it has loads of battles and characters never talk politics with friends
Feb 17 2023,positive,incredible it takes everything good about the winter soldier and cranks it up to eleven while bringing in the other avengers
Feb 16 2023,positive,without a doubt best mcu movie ever
Feb 15 2023,positive,captain america civil war isnt just a captain america movie its also an avenger movie and its overall an improvement to both sides
Feb 14 2023,positive,joe and anthony russos second addition to the evergrowing marvel cinematic universe is an explosive globetrotting affair that cant help but feel like the unofficial third avengers film    when political pressure from numerous sources overflow the avengers receive an ultimatum sign the new sokovia accords documents that mean the avengers will obey a committee that decides when where and if they can fight crucial battles or retire this deeply divides the team captain america chris evans believes heroes should remain free to operate without government interference whereas tony stark robert downey jr disagrees and states the avengers need to be put in check but when it appears to be bucky barnes aka the winter soldier sebastian stan who is responsible for an attack on the un building during a meeting for these accords steve must jump into action and find bucky before someone else does their disagreement then escalates into an explosive intense feud that will create a longlasting rift between the two sides    the film is full of both emotional moments and in classic marvel fashion perilous fight scenes the russo brothers also bring in props and characters from some of their previous jobs  for example jim rash makes a cameo as a member of the mit team due to the vast cast and variety of subplot viewers could argue that captain america civil war is an unofficial avengers film anthony mackie even referred to the film as avengers 25 as well as dealing with numerous subplot and storylines the russo brothers were put in charge of black panther chadwick boseman and spidermans tom holland debut into the mcu they give each character enough time to be introduced to viewers without their debut taking up chunks of the film the russos leave enough unexplained to build up the anticipation for each characters solo films that were to come in the later years spiderman homecoming released in 2017 and black panther released in 2018    like any other marvel film captain america civil war sets up the future of the mcu both avengers infinity war and avengers endgame are influenced by the events of this civil war the casting as always is brilliant chris evans plays steve rogers as the honest protective man that he is robert downey jr brings back tony starks arrogant humorous personality to viewers resuming his role as the billionaire playboy natasha romanoff acts as a midpoint between the two sides joining tonys team only to end up letting cap get away eventually joining him on the run tom holland brings peter parkers nervous nerdy presence to the screen his casting also makes him the youngest person to play the iconic webslinger holland was only 19 during filming daniel brühl also makes his marvel debut as helmut zemo the first nonenhanced primary antagonist in the mcu brühl brings his slick charm to the character presenting zemo as a cold calculated man on a mission a mission for revenge    henry jackman once again lends his composing ability to the film jackman creates a score that features intense climaxes and compliments the action onscreen jackman also features and reworks the themes of heroes like spiderman captain america and the iconic winter soldier theme trent olapochs cinematography is impressive he captures the feel and aesthetic of the previous marvel movies while still providing new and unique imagery    if you look at civil war as a whole its clear to see that all the subplot and plotlines come together almost like a jigsaw puzzle theres a myriad of themes and ideologies floating around the film including grief accountability and responsibility the dominant theme that looms over the film is choice each character chooses what side they fight on steve chose to help bucky knowing it made him an enemy of the state and zemo chose to go after the avengers to relieve his grief    overall captain america civil war is an impressive piece of skilful filmmaking that features great performances detailed storylines and a brilliant score the russo brothers prove that they can wrangle such a large cast and create a complex film that deals with powerful themes and ideas
Feb 13 2023,positive,the russos have made another action packed solid movie for marvel  but its not perfect more 
Feb 10 2023,positive,i think that this movie is pretty good it has action and a twist that i wasnt expecting i think that this movie has an ok plot i think it needs a little more elements of spiderman in it i think that the ending  was a little different than what i thought it would be overall a good movie 710
Feb 9 2023,positive,civil war gives you the introduction of spiderman to the mcu which is something that actually turned out to be the most amazing and over the top experience for any fan in the theaters we screamed trust me we screamed we also got the introduction of black panther which just as great as spiderman we got the legendary movies to follow i think the battle between captain america and iron man was greatly done and the russo brothers deserve more than just a clap and a happy ending they are legendary directors when it comes to these films and deserve anything that they ask for this film is definitely worth watching ive already watched it again this year and it seems to be a yearly thing with me
Feb 3 2023,positive,a fantastic movie which is essentially avengers 25 the main issue with this movie is the motivations for dividing the avengers are contrived and there are no consequences either its still very fun but it had a lot more potential
Jan 31 2023,positive,i think this marvel movie was probably the best one actually the emotional interaction and fight between cap and ironman over caps best friend was powerfully moving  towards the end  the introduction of the black panther and spidey to the mcu was also good a real emotional rollercoaster for stark in this more avengers 3 like movie  lots of true to the comic book characters personalities shines thru everyone of the actors in this movie
Jan 24 2023,positive,9510 somehow was able to top the other captain america movies great marvel movie
Jan 19 2023,positive,great action sequences in the movie the way the two teams come at each other is done in a way that is believable and one can understand both perspectives also a great way to introduce black panther and spiderman into the mcu this is one of my favorite mcu movies due to the exciting action scenes zemo is also one of the best villians ever introduced because despite not having any superpowers actually achieves his goal of trying to split the avengers apart and his motivation for doing so makes logical sense
Jan 17 2023,positive,greatness at its finest in the world of captain america
Dec 30 2022,positive,the story is a bit up and down with some glaring plot issues but the star power and stellar action makes up for the films weaknesses
Dec 12 2022,positive,better than i expected they gracefully made the conflict and the action is great
Dec 6 2022,negative,fanservice nothing else to say
Nov 29 2022,positive,so many twists and turns that lead to the eventual clash between the two main heroes of the avengers in many ways this is written as a tragedy even with the actionpacked fight scenes you see two friends that have united against great foes to clash in a brutal conclusion to their story the writing is amazing and works well to support the heavy load that has to be carried in this film robert downey jr and chris evans do well to portray the conflicts they have with each other as well as within themselves an amazing ride whose only flaw is that certain characters dont fit perfectly into the story and instead seem to be thrown in to increase the spectacle of one fight scene even with that it is an example of what great storytelling and world building can do for film
Nov 22 2022,positive,yes finally the moral dilemma that ultron could have been and the answer to questions posed by more realisticallyminded watchers of past films who saw the chaos left behind not only that it pits iron man and captain america two fan favorites against each other simo is exactly the kind of villain that the avengers have yet to face  a quiet and brooding one rather than the earthsmashing kind must watch for superheromarvel fans
Nov 19 2022,positive,best of captain america very fun action sequences
Nov 18 2022,positive,recommend worth watching
Nov 15 2022,positive,while i prefer the films where the avengers unite and thrive as a team the sweetness of introducing new characters and adding them into the actionpacked mix with the team splitting apart and fighting is very original plus the last 2030 minutes of the film gives us one of the best and emotioninducing fights of the entire mcu
Nov 14 2022,positive,captain america civil war brought its audience a captivating film full of emotion that people who have kept up with the mcu thus far truly felt it was written exceptionally with amazing characters who we have previously loved dearly overall an outstanding and exciting film
Nov 13 2022,positive,marvels best ensemble film that manages to be one of its most personal
Nov 10 2022,positive,one of the my favorite marvel movie i reccommend it

Oct 26 2022,positive,a cinematic masterpiece civil war makes a realistic story that pits the avengers against each other introduces a human villain that is a nice break from crazy space aliens and robots with no motivation other than world destruction civil war sets up the next stage of the marvel universe with a bang
Oct 24 2022,positive,absolutely amazing i cant tell which i like more this or winter soldier its a tie but since this one has my favorite superhero spiderman imma say this one chadwick boseman was amazing in this rest in peace
Oct 19 2022,positive,i like this one was a tough choice for me picking sides between the billionaire industrialist and the aryan ubermensch
Oct 15 2022,positive,civil war is just the beginning of the great war later it is a fun movie with a thrilling battle throughout the movie with a great conflict in it
Oct 7 2022,positive,this and winter soldier are two of the best nonavengers mcu titles in the infinity saga
Oct 5 2022,positive,one of the greatest superhero movies of all time captain america civil war functions more as an avenger movie with all of its classy characters battling the living daylight out of each other with tom holland making his first appearance as spiderman civil war breaks emotional height includes the best action and depth of the entire mcu and has an allstar cast each with an iconic and unforgettable role

Sep 17 2022,positive,despite boasting the arrival of spiderman in the marvel universe and the cinematic debut of black panther played with urgency and nobility by chadwick boseman as well as a bombastic super hero showdown civil war is an often sombre and tense affair while the chilling but relatable daniel buhls zemo might be billed as the villain the catalyst for conflict is a difference in ideology between the avengers the russos talent for managing ensembles makes what could have been avengers 25 a quintessential captain america movie but also giving iron man an antagonistic though sympathetic role with downey jr at his absolute best with a beaten down emotionally exhausted and guilt ridden iron man evans plays the titular hero as stoic as ever while wrestling with his past demons in the returning winter soldier and his own inner turmoil around the ability to do the right thing while also battling the accountability for that power the film deals with the consequences of conflict the very human cost of victory and the politics of intervention where even our heroes hands arent clean while still allowing for entertaining action and the odd one liner and massive super hero cameo though they feel natural rather than forced in everything on screen feels vital as the russos expand on their thriller motif from winter soldier with surprisingly affecting results they arent fighting aliens or robots they are fighting conflicting ideas of how to do the right thing the right way an ambitious and powerfully executed and never bettered instalment of the mcu that frankly has no business being as excellent as it truly is
Sep 13 2022,positive,will hold a special place in my heart
Sep 11 2022,positive,mcu over dc everyday all day
Sep 9 2022,positive,strong action movie with some interesting themes
Sep 7 2022,positive,the captain america trilogy is the best
Sep 7 2022,positive,captain america civil war is a standout film in the marvel cinematic universe delivering a compelling and emotional story thats filled with incredible action and dramatic conflict the movie features a great ensemble cast with chris evans captain america and robert downey jrs iron man providing a gripping central conflict that divides the avengers the iconic airport fight scene is a standout moment with the heroes showcasing their incredible powers and abilities in a thrilling battle the films climax is both heartwrenching and emotionally satisfying leaving a lasting impact on the audience overall captain america civil war is an exceptional superhero movie thats both thrilling and thoughtprovoking solidifying its place as one of the best films in the mcu
Sep 5 2022,negative,here are my main issues  the big fight between iron man and cap which the trailers teased as the main focal point only lasted 5 minutes frustrating  captain america was whiny like ok i get you dont trust the government but for once its not all about you the sokovia accords werent actually all that bad if steve had put some actual thought into it he mightve realized that it would have covered more of the cost of a mission  gone wrong or prevent more people from dying as was demonstrated in the opening sceneno hate to wanda i know she didnt mean it   iron mans anger was completely justified i mean you find out that one of your friends knows the man who killed your parents and is using your money to keep him hidden away  uh yeah i think id be mad too  natasha what the hell  where you thinking i get steve is your friend and admittedly a better person than tony but girlie i think you need to tell cap to strap on his big boy pants and find the bridge and get over it
Sep 1 2022,positive,as with other such films i wanted to watch this purely for the escapis it offers and i wasnt concerned about followingunderstand the plot intricacies so i review this as a piece of entertainment only its a fairly decent watch with plenty of battle scenes good cgi and a decent cast there are moments of suspense and i thought it was somewhat gripping so it was a good film i dont think theres much more i can say other than it was interesting to see so many individual superhero characters together on screen id recommend this film personally yes although as i say i dont know the whole background to the story so i cant comment on how accurate it is to the original stories
Sep 1 2022,positive,fantastic comic book movie well made movie with a great story and some of the most iconic scenes and movie history
Aug 31 2022,positive,great movie and good lord they just throw introscameosetc at you like its a major blockbuster or something it was an awesome way to do that storyline for sure
Aug 30 2022,negative,their stupidity in fighting each other and continuously causing more harm for no reason hurts to watch i dont care if they have different opinions thats interesting but stop fighting
Aug 26 2022,positive,as of 2022 this is the greatest mcu film and one of the greatest superhero films of all time the story of the internal conflict of the avengers caused by their past actions and steve rogers effort to protect his friend and the brilliant nonsuperpowered villain zemo this film is one of very few mcu films with serious tone throughout except for the jokeridden airport battle but thankfully it doesnt ruin the film
Aug 25 2022,positive,my favourite marvel film
Aug 24 2022,positive,the third captain america film sees our heroes on opposite sides as the world is tired of all the collateral damage from the avengers actions over the past few years the worlds governments enact a registration act for all superheroes causing a divide from those that will sign and those who wont essentially making them outlaws  loved this story in the comics  this film also introduces us to tom hollands spiderman and chadwick basemans black panther  fantastic action sequences and fight scenes populate this great marvel flick
Aug 22 2022,positive,a truely excellent  contribution to the cinematic world in general and maybe the best chapter in the mcu to date the story line is almost completely seamless and their are no failures in the acting performances this one of my top thre movies only behind rouge one i really love this movie
Aug 20 2022,positive,this movie is unique in that two sides of a political idea are honestly explored with both merits and drawbacks discussed honestly and openly  one of the great movies of our time
Aug 15 2022,positive,movie and the vfx are great overall a must watch film watched atleast a 30 or 40 times coz captain america is my favourite
Aug 10 2022,positive,closes out the captain america trilogy in style what differentiates this from an avengers movie is the personal moments for steve rogers throughout the movie including the death of peggy carter and the ongoing conflict with bucky barnes his best friend
Aug 8 2022,positive,you should watch this movie before the avengers 34 because it brings back the our hero spiderman and the avengers got forced into join iron man or captain americas team the fighting scene was so hyped
Aug 7 2022,positive,this was another decent entry into the mcu while it was more of a avengers movie than captain america it was still good the villain was defiantly forgettable
Aug 5 2022,positive,i got so confused lol
Aug 4 2022,positive,civil war is a unique marvel movie its not about cap its about everyone in the movie and they play it out well the plot the action sequences and the script are all emotional and well written and i think this could have been called avengers civil war and i wouldnt have minded in one hand tony is a narcissistic proud genius who blames himself for creating ultron and cap is a man who has seen the government get so corrupt that they tried to kill him when they both clash both arent right or wrong it makes you choose a side and that side commits awful things and so does the other    civil war rating a  great movie great plot and a effective script
Jul 27 2022,positive,its a civil war in true sense
Jul 27 2022,positive,a great kickoff to phase 3 that sets up infinity war and endgame very nicely
Jul 23 2022,positive,mature hypeworthy and thrilling captain america civil war is one for the history books smashing away the cap series first installment and onpar with its second it deserves all of its praise its not really even a captain america movie but more of an avengerslevel crossover event
Jul 23 2022,positive,my rating for the film is a 8610
Jul 15 2022,positive,a political thriller superhero movie that balances a large amount of characters and provides an intense climax that pits two of our original characters tony stark and steve rogers against each other     the action is great it sets up tons of future events in the mcu and it introduces some great characters as well as adds to previously introduced characters stories
Jul 14 2022,positive,a great story of friends coming to blow watching the film it is understandable to be on any side whether it be iron mans or captain americas as they both have great arguments for why theyre doing what theyre doing the fights also are just as great especially the final duel between cap and iron man which was full of emotion but the movie looks a bit dodgy in the cgi especially in certain scenes with iron man and his armour but the cgi doesnt really affect the experience overall i enjoyed it
Jul 14 2022,positive,although it is definitely my favorite captain america movie i just dont know why its a captain america movie definitely felt more like avengers civil war other than that  awesome movie the story was a bit more complicated but it made sense to me and was very impactful very action filled and very entertaining
Jul 13 2022,positive,one of the smartest comicbook adaptions
Jul 9 2022,positive,yeah this is better than cats
Jul 9 2022,positive,captain america civil war deserves to be called avengers civil war a large cast of our favorite heroes partake in this epic headlined by steve rogers and tony stark focusing not just on action and humor though there are plenty of both civil war tackles darker more serious elements in the marvel universe playing out as both a family drama political intrigue and spy thriller civil war is wellrounded and emotional both fulfilling and heartbreaking at the same time while the villain baron zemo is one of marvels weaker ones his unique way of waging war on the avengers helps save his character the third captain america installement is one of marvels best doing a great job brining back returning characters and introducing new ones as well as making them all complex and multilayered a mustwatch
Jul 8 2022,positive,this was my favorite marvel movie for a while it is really good and action packed
Jun 27 2022,positive,great movie with great plot and acting
Jun 27 2022,positive,civil war is a movie that in the same time i like and i dosent like because the story behind that makes war happen is amazing bu part of the war is so bad because in the same time that hate each oder the like each other so they are fighting but they are not fighting the only reason that this movie exists is for introduce spiderman give a arc for black panther for his own movie and finish the story of captain america and the winter soldier in general this is a captain america an the winter soldier 2 with fan service but i like it
Jun 23 2022,positive,iconic for what it does for the future of our heroes and memorable for some unforgettable gutwrenching moments civil war is another example of how amazing the mcu can be
Jun 22 2022,positive,the thing i have to say about the captain america trilogy is that each movie gets better and better this is my favorite caption america movie just over captain america the winter soldier the action was amazing in this movie but the plot is that best part in this movie and i really like the bad guy in this movie and i really like how this was like a avengers movie 9510
Jun 20 2022,positive,i really enjoyed this movie i treat civil war as basically another installment of the avengers as this movie shows that superheroes specifically the avengers themselves have feuds against each other and have different views on other people too the fanbase was also split between team iron man or captain america amazing debuts of peter parker and tchalla i was so hyped about this movie and it doesnt disappoint the airport scene is one of the iconic scenes in superhero film history this movie is up there in the greatest mcu films of all time i recommend another watch to yall if you havent seen this movie in a long while
Jun 15 2022,positive,a movie that makes you so happy and angry at the same time this is why i love comic book movies
Jun 10 2022,negative,this movie takes all the worst elements of age of ultron and iron man 2 and slaps them together in an awful mongrelization of film
Jun 9 2022,positive,should be way higher
Jun 7 2022,positive,its the next movie before avengers age of ultron about the mcu its amazing the special effects and the music
Jun 5 2022,positive,i could watch this all most days
May 30 2022,positive,one of my favorite mcu movies with great action and storytelling marvel did a great job in laying the groundwork for the fall of the avengers here the acting was also topnotch from everyone definitely a mustsee mcu movie
May 29 2022,positive,this is easily one of the greatest movies of 2016 and possibly that of the decade thrilling action strong characters a fascinating and engaging story and an effective commentary on political corruption and the consequence of segregation perfect
May 25 2022,positive,it isnt perfect why would peter parker make his spiderman debut by fighting against captain america but captain america civil war was upon release probably the best serious comicbased film since the dark knight i particularly love how it plays to genre expectations of teamwork and forgiveness and then delivers a gut punch evans and especially downey jr deserved oscars for making the iron mancaptain america feud seem natural and realistic instead of an arbitrary commercialized gimmick
May 10 2022,positive,man marvel knows what to do with there movies ok i really love this movie the action is the main thing i love about it the airport scene is maybe one of the most epic fights i have ever seen in my lifei love all the characters in does movie are amazing bringing in ant man was amazing just everybody was good even spider man does new one is greati dont think does is the best marvel movie in does probably has the weakest action not at of all but it doesit does not even feel like a captain america movie they could have probably called it avengers the civil war that would have been better but whateveri love the story and that final fight omg was amazing with iron man vs captain america it touched me hard it was hard to choose which one i really wanted to win the suspense is pretty much high for does movie honestybucky is great probably to you toblack window helped them out i was mad when war machine i thought he was going to died i was like oh no please god no this is great sorry of what about to say but avengers age of ultron sucks sorry but everytime i watch it i get bored are just annoyed but this movie was awesomei dont want does review to long but you get picture this is amazing movie i will give it a 810 for now might be a 7 but its a 8 by the end of the daygo watch it right now
May 9 2022,positive,captain america civil war is basically an avengers story it is interesting to finally consider some of the collateral damage and civilian deaths caused by the massive amounts of destruction caused by fights that the avengers have participated in the arc of the story quickly turns to that of superheroes battling other superheroes the plan is a good one by zemo and it is a kind of cool choice that he is never masked up     im curious now to move on to the next movie  black widow  and then to black panther and see what fallout there is from the civil war film  i forget how the world at large reacts or if that is even dealt with    the fights are cool in this one and the effects are top notch  i love spidermans character best live action spiderman by far where is nick fury at this time the team thor stuff is funny the banter between characters is good i forget why vision is tied to wanda already by this time
May 8 2022,positive,captain america was right about the accords but wrong about not telling iron man
May 7 2022,neutral,just watch the airport scene and a summary i cant decide which is more boring civil war or age of ultron at least this one had spiderman i guess
May 3 2022,positive,hahahahahahaha but also oh my god never gonna stop thinking about shes a kid and protecting wanda at all costs but then dropping a jet bridge on peter 1010 makes me laugh every time because what the heck
Apr 28 2022,positive,i kinda wish they waited a bit before doing a civil war story but its still good
Apr 28 2022,positive,whoo thats exactly how i felt while watching this compelling human drama thanks kevin
Apr 28 2022,positive,everybody knows this movie is spectacular my small issue with it is that i dont really think that it needed a villain they could have just used iron man and captain america as the respective villains based on the side that the viewer agrees with zemo doesnt do too much and too much of his plan is coincidence with the sokovia accords his plan relied too much on something that he would have never knew was going to happen either way this movie is still amazing and deserves its top 10 spot
Apr 25 2022,positive,story and the battles are amazing but zemo wasnt really that interesting before falcon and the winter soldier
Apr 20 2022,positive,4355 clearly overrated but its still amazing
Apr 19 2022,positive,dont care whos side youre on it shouldve been andrew garfield
Apr 19 2022,positive,the best captain america film
Apr 16 2022,positive,very good movie i was satisfied from start to finish with it
Apr 3 2022,positive,shouldve been an avengers movie but an overall awesome film
Apr 2 2022,positive,great movie worth a watch
Apr 2 2022,positive,a battle over different feelings civil war twists the team to fight each other like no other and has breathtaking moments that people will never forget
Mar 18 2022,positive,top tier mcu the russo brothers prove you can direct a superhero epic without a buffet of mediocre cgi in the third act and a lack of action its a shame this is really captain america  iron man feat the avengers civil war as opposed to a true steve rogers story
Mar 16 2022,positive,to sum up this movie its like if you take a kid and all his toys and separated the toys in half and have them go at each other to see which side onethat would be this movie  two sides one that wants super heroes to be responsible and have government oversight and one that doesnt want that  so it splits the avengers and they start recruiting like a ton of characters to both sides like jam pack it full of heroes  so many that they have to have them briefly appear or it will cost hundreds of millions to produce this showoh wait it did cost like 275 million to make  it was a mess but a fun mess to watch
Mar 14 2022,positive,this is historically my favorite marvel film and so far during this rewatch it has kept that spot i love the action and humor i think the villain is interesting and fresh for the mcu     rating  brilliant
Mar 13 2022,positive,great movie and a great concept which i know fans were dreaming of before this came out there is a perfect balance of comedy along with violence and really makes the audience struggle to really find the bad guys one of the best marvel movies of all time
Mar 13 2022,positive,the first captain america film was a lot of fun and winter soldier taking a bigger bolder and darker approach while not forgetting the entertainment value was even better    civil war is not quite as good as winter soldier but its a little better than the first film in my opinion it may not be quite the spectacular extravaganza that this reviewer was expecting from reading the critics reviews but it is very solid fun still great entertainment and in the top end of marvels output even with its faults    granted civil war is not perfect so the detractors can think again before accusing me of being someone paid to write a positive review this is actually somebody who saw the film enjoyed it thoroughly but realises that it has flaws is anybody going to point out to marvel detractors that people can enjoy marvels films without feeling like its a criminal offence to and have been giving good reasons for doing so so parroting out ridiculous and easily disproven conspiracy theories that have often come close to violating terms and conditions is only making them look like the idiots and the ignoramuses sorry to point out that irrelevant note but this attitude keeps cropping up in the increasing user and critical condescension wave that imdb is facing and imdb who seem shockingly oblivious to it should come down harder on it    as with what was not quite right with civil war there is an overstuffed and occasionally undercooked feel at times civil war has many subplots and characters and while actually it deals with a vast majority of the subplots and characters are dealt with incredibly well there are a few subplots that appear a couple of them abruptly introduced as well and not enough is done with them as far as being completely forgotten about after ten minutes or being rushed through to get to the next one zemos story is lost within everything else and would have fared better within a film all on its own because the potential was there a vast majority of the characters are all interesting with engaging indepth personalities but war machine is somewhat sidelined while one appreciates the complexity given to zemo there was the sense that he wasnt as completely crucial to the main story as he could have been and while spiderman really grows on you his entrance is a bit clumsily done and makes one think does he really belong    however civil war also does a huge amount right it looks amazing for a start the gritty but audacious look of winter soldier makes a welcome return while the cinematography is stylish the editing crisp if slightly and occasionally confused in the airport action sequence and the special effects as extravagant as they should helped by thunderously authentic sound despite really not being a fan of shaky cam usually it is not abused here doesnt cause visual discomfort and gave certain scenes even more raw tension than they already had the music again has much rousing excitement and haunting intensity while being no less memorable than the music in the previous two outings    the action sequences in civil war are strong too the opening sequence starts the film with a bang with its tragic consequences being genuinely affecting while the airport scene is tense enormous fun and thrilling though because with so much going on the cameraediting does at times struggle to keep up best of all is the climax which had much more intensity and was surprisingly rich in conflict and emotion the direction is astute and deftly balances all the different conflicts and tone shifts while the script is very smartly written with the lighthearted moments like with spiderman and antman being witty and hilarious while not once being at odds with the more thoughtprovoking and serious elements which never get bogged down in too much talk the story while a bit overstuffed and undercooked in places is never dull never feels too stretched or thin always makes sense even with parts that needed more development and is endlessly riveting right up to the end which is an achievement for a two and a half hour film with this much going on likewise while some characters are more interesting than others which is standard for any film with a cast as large as this the characters are very intriguingly and engagingly written with distinct personalities and realism    there are great performances across the board with the one oddity being marisa tomei as aunt may not a big role but not small enough to give the impression that tomei in age and manner did not fit the character much of the film however is dominated by robert downey jnr and chris evans both of whom are noteperfect as iron man and captain america elizabeth olsen is flawed but sympathetic scarlett johansson is wonderfully fearless paul rudd is a breath of fresh air with his introduction actually feeling like a character who belongs tom holland brings endearing enthusiasm to spiderman paul bettany and sebastian stan are authoritative presences daniel bruhl has the right degree of arrogance and is able to convey menace while only doing as little as a whisper and chadwick boseman characterises black panthers wounded pride with dignity and gravitas    overall very solid fun if just missing out on being the spectacular extravaganza expected 810 bethany cox
Mar 7 2022,positive,great mcu movie love to see the conflict between cap and tony
Mar 3 2022,positive,a  very exciting and actionpacked movie this could have easily been called avengers civil war but i guess they couldnt call it that because not all the members were present regardless i enjoyed the unique take on a villain who uses his intellect rather than any type of brute force and it turn causes the most damage to the team at this point in watching the movies almost all the action kind of looks the same but thats pretty much my only gripe with the film
Mar 3 2022,positive,solid story but wtf wanda and vision do in the airport scene they could destroy everything to make it easier lol
Feb 28 2022,positive,strong action movie with some interesting themes
Feb 13 2022,positive,best mcu film in the entire canon
Feb 7 2022,positive,perfect from the beginning to the end
Feb 1 2022,positive,a fierce battle between friends over ideologies    directors anthony and joe russos superhero espionage actionthriller captain america civil war 2016 their striking intensity for the intriguing espionage of sleeper cell agents like the winter soldier is fascinating in the midst of chaos within the avengers greatest argument the action is creative and thrilling as our beloved heroes use their powers in new and inventive ways against one another i was laughing and concerned for these characters despite knowing no one would die from this artificial conflict producers stan lee and kevin feige were right to give the russo brothers the directing gig for civil war as it nicely follows up on the winter soldier plot    writers christopher markus and stephen mcfeely make you care about each hero and their opinion i love how you do believe captain america and iron man each have real motivations to fight for what they believe in as the avengers face un oversight versus freedom of choice i definitely sympathize more with captain americas thinking as why would the avengers ever trust the united states government let alone a nebulous political body like the un to guide their superpowered actions captain america chooses to do what is morally right while iron man wants to be responsible for all of the destruction the avengers cause let alone the death toll i enjoyed zemos complex scheme as why fight the avengers when i can get them to kill each other is a better plan than most marvel villains    chris evans is steadfast as the moral man with stars and stripes steve rogers evans captain america hits hard with killer action choreography but its evans performance as the kind and thoughtful captain america that will not give up on the winter soldier still having buckys personality and mind in there somewhere i like how evans shows he is not guilty but proud to value freedom of choice as an american value in regards to not allowing the avengers to assemble as government stooges robert downey jr is excellent at expressing his heartbroken emotions over his parents untimely demise as well as his conflicted feelings over the avengers operating unrestricted    scarlett johansson is amazing as the ruthless fighter spy black widow and really earnest as natasha romanoff her ability to convince you that black widow would side with iron man then realize that captain america is only doing what is right speaks volumes about her character sebastian stan is cool exciting and devastating as you watch bucky get tortured until hes a sleeper cell agent called the winter soldier anthony mackie is very casually funny as falcon as is paul rudds antman antmans enlarged form steals the show and rudd is so charming as this oddball hero     don cheadle is touching as the veteran war machine and cool during the crazy airport battle jeremy renner is fantastic as hawkeye with a weary and funny performance as the artful archer chadwick boseman is immediately cool and mysterious as black panther his combat is mesmerizing let alone his commanding gravitas paul bettany makes vision feel wise even when hes wrong you believe that vision wants to protect wanda but he does not trust her with her own powers elizabeth olsen is moving as the hurt wanda maximoff while awesome as the magical scarlet witch emily vancamp is endearing as agent 13 or sharon carter     tom holland is likable and funny as the young peter parker and spiderman his quips and nervous manner feel like comic book spiderman daniel brühls antagonist zemo is understandable in his vengeful rage and sinister in conversation with the avengers frank grillos crossbones is intense in the action opener while william hurt packs a dramatic punch as the voice of the un not authorizing the avengers to operate of their own accord martin freeman is funny as a government stooge marisa tomei is gorgeous and playful as aunt may john kani john slattery alfre woodward jim rash and stan lee all have nice cameos    editor jeffrey ford cuts swiftly between character point of views and gives each person time to speak naturally in gently cut conversations the action is fast and sharp as opposed to the steady and engaging dialogue jeffrey ford civil war does not feel like 147 minutes long as it just grips you with exciting action immediately then follows through with its promise of marvels mightiest heroes doing battle    cinematographer trent opaloch comes up with innovative ways to shoot the action with wide shots and real stunt performers going from black widow taking out guys in style to ant mans shifting sizes is really neat with creative cinematography civil war has a lot of attention to detail with sharp panning shots and nice framing for a change with some marvel movies the cgi is amazing for visions lasers scarlet witchs red aura magic and antmans size changes    composer henry jackmans somber score cuts deep with civil wars torn characters his exciting and playful side comes out during the action with sweeping music and melodies bringing in this massive hero brawl costume designer judianna makovsky came up with cool contemporary spiderman and black panther outfits that look modern    overall civil war is one of marvels most entertaining and interesting movies
Jan 30 2022,positive,i loved it seeing all the heros except for thor and hulk together was insane black panther was a great addition to the story and man my friend screamed to the top of his lungs my friend doesnt watch trailers so when the music started and it said queens he was like yeaahhh and it was even crazier when he showed up and took caps shield god this was amazing
Jan 28 2022,positive,just perfect i recommend it
Jan 18 2022,positive,introduction of the new spiderman
Jan 15 2022,positive,one of my favorite mcu films
Jan 14 2022,positive,superb moviemade by amazing performers in all aspects of the finest work
Jan 14 2022,positive,minor spoilers ahead     another amazing captain america movie absolutely loved the introduction of spiderman and black panther this movie had a lot of characters but they didnt overdo it
Jan 13 2022,positive,another hit from marvel studios this is  as entretaining as you would expect while adding new intresting characters in a grounded stroy that is always captivating and feels fresh
Jan 11 2022,positive,was a good movie however it did not feel like a captian america movie
Jan 9 2022,positive,captain america civil war goes a darker direction than previous captain america films by introduing a political conflict between the members of the avengers instead of an out of earth menace or an evil genius i think this movie could have been marketed under the avengers name but for some reason they decided not to maybe because it was too soon    not a lot to say about this movie it has good action scenes and a well written story is not a remarkable movie but sure it is above average
Jan 8 2022,positive,arguably the best mcu movie this movie is a captain america film but contains a large portion of the avengers at that point in the timeline this film sees the heroes split down the middle and fighting eachother this makes for a actionpacked story that doesnt slow down once it gets going this is a must see for any superhero fan
Jan 5 2022,positive,the characters have feelings problems and contradictions one the finest of the mcu 810
Jan 2 2022,positive,the question becomes why did captain americas movies get chosen to be the most poignant and analytical of these movies in many parts of this youll start to feel that the mcu has no place being this dark and uncomfortable even while still keeping us feel a little too safe for this world
Jan 1 2022,positive,really good film manages to interject a fair amount of levity into some otherwise darker material marvel does a really good job developing how each character interacts with one another     visual effects are solid and look amazing in the imax enhanced version on the disney app     great movie definitely a must see for mcu fans
Dec 31 2021,positive,this movie was really fancy due to the amount of interesting characters present great story and iron man  captain america scenes
Dec 29 2021,positive,this is probably my favorite marvel movie and for good reason to keep it short everything about captain america civil war feels real exciting and emotionally deep
Dec 28 2021,positive,top 3 superhero film of all time
Dec 28 2021,positive,top 10 in the mcu ride for sure one of the best written storys in the mcu with one of if not the best score knowing the natural tension between the heros in the first avengers and age of ultron this is a beautiful payoff while tying in character arks like bucky killing tonys parents was an amazing ride introducing black panthers character was the cherry on the top
Dec 24 2021,positive,the first and third act are some of the best in the mcu for both character and action  the second act isnt bad but that airport fight leaves a bad taste it feels forced presents itself like some grand showdown when it really isnt and the characters make jokes with each other in between am i really supposed to feel worried for anyone when this conflict is supposedly meant  to shatter the team dynamic  also i do not like zemo his plan is to get rid of the people responsible for protecting the earth from existential threats that have showed up at least twice already i guess i understand his motivations but again it feels forced  the character work for steve and tony is great in this i never doubted that they would make the decisions that they make but a lot of the supporting cast do not have compelling reasons to be in this fight  tom holland and paul rudd and tchalla steal every scene they are in great additions to the cast
Dec 22 2021,positive,a great film with real stakes and a very bleak ending that is very much perfect for this movie brilliant performances from chris evans and robert downey jr make this movie a tense action extravaganza that also sets up stories for new characters as well as expands the arcs for the already established characters we know and love
Dec 22 2021,neutral,while watching it it seemed cool it was thrilling in retrospect everything about cw felt forcedthe plot the characters motivations the outcomes it all felt like marvel was aggressively snapping things into place rather than letting an organic story happen this may sort of get away from the point a bit but i dislike the airport scene because of how it ties into the much larger issues the movie has the airport scene is exciting the first time around but it feels hollow purposeless and like i said before completely contrived which is how i felt about most of the movie i personally thought civil war failed because the conflict between steve and tony never once felt right and i couldnt buy into it since neither of them really seemed to be acting like themselves for much of the movie     i thought it actively ruined tony and steve with staggering amounts of stubbornness and idiocy it turned cap into a petty backstabbing manipulator who was willing to risk the lives of so many he cares for people who he knew would never turn him down if he asked for help rather than actually attempt to have a real discussion with tony tonys sudden 180 into being progovernment control is so sudden and out of established character that i just never bought it yes hes usually a touch of a hypocrite but his distrust of governments and bureaucracy has been one of the most persistent and clearly defined elements of his character     it really felt like there was a movie missing somewhere which brought them both to this point and the instances during the movie which rapidly led them to this point felt seriously artificial the movie is written in a way to make these characters fight when these characters would have tried to find another solution or at least make a serious attempt at talking things out the story was seriously forced for much of the movie and i really was disappointed in it hell there was no actual character reason at all that natasha was proaccords it was only done so that they could have her fight hawkeye and so she could suddenly switch sides the fact that these people would ever endanger the lives of people they care for to the extent they do and come to blows in the way they did was honestly kind of a disgusting bastardization of the characters     the only part i thought actually worked in the movie was cap and tony at the end when tony learns what steve had been hiding from him about bucky and the fight they had that was the only thing in the movie that actually felt real and i absolutely loved that it was much very impactful personal and significant because there was emotion and stakes behind that fight
Dec 20 2021,positive,one or the best super heros stories ever put on screen it feels real and feels emotional while it being totally fictional   this movie is an event that will take maaaaany years to forget in super hero community  much more to be said but ill leave it here
Dec 19 2021,positive,pretty eventful start to phase 3 an incredible movie full of action 55
Dec 16 2021,positive,there is a lot to love about captain america civil war but there is also a lot going on in general with so many plots going on in this movie it does tend to feel a bit rushed at times and with such a huge cast in a movie with a central focus on a single character the dispute feels very onesided there is a lot of story to tell in civil war and while a lot of it is done right it still feels like this is two movies packed into one it is still very enjoyable and almost a required watch if going through the marvel cinematic universe again in preparation for end game the events of this movie probably have the largest impact on the future of the marvel cinematic universe leading up to infinity war
Dec 14 2021,positive,quite possibly the best mcu movie its thoughtprovoking intense and actionpacked its a more grounded personal avengers movie and thats incredibly interesting to watch
Dec 6 2021,positive,what can i say action packed with the best action marvel has to offer yet a simple but smart story and very funny in the second half leaves marvel captain america civil war the best one yet everybody had a good amount of time to shine especially spiderman who was funny as heck and black panther who is the sht in this film ant man was very funny and black widow hit harder than the dudes in here damn excellent film
Dec 5 2021,positive,after years i still dont know if i am team cap or team tony thats how you know this is a good movie
Nov 26 2021,positive,the mcu really knows how to take the heroes to the next level
Nov 19 2021,positive,dont ask me how many times ive seen this movie
Nov 19 2021,positive,very good movie pretty long but they manage to keep you interested and also introducing spiderman into the mcu was pretty cool
Nov 17 2021,positive,while fans like to see heroes fight each other so they can brag about their favorite hero being better than someone elses favorite hero im no fan of heroes fighting each otherespecially serious fights there are nonmeaningful fights like bucky vs black panther or even the airport scene in this film but the final fight here between cap  iron man is a meaningful fightand simply sad especially as baron zemo watches from a distance with pleasure id much rather see villains fight against each other doctor doom vs magneto vs ultron vs loki vs thanos vs carnage anyone  what was cool was introducing spiderman and black panther and going deeper into vision  wandas relationship the plot was generally fine even if you were semifamiliar with the comics version of the plot but the circumstances causing the final fight seemed contrived  im probably in the minority but this was a mostly downer movie the only uplifting moment was discovering the other supersoldiers were dead
Nov 16 2021,positive,its a good movie expect good stuff its great
Nov 15 2021,positive,a nice change of pace in the mcu captain america civil war brings along some new touching elements and some mature themes that help elevate it above the standard marvel movie the action is done fine the cgi is good and the villain was creatively written however where this movie lacks is in the motivations where both the heroes and the villain to do what they do and i think that if they had held off on the idea it couldve been more grand however this film is still good and the themes it touches upon are definitely something different but in a good way
Nov 14 2021,positive,a very good marvel movie centering on captain america
Nov 12 2021,positive,my favourite mcu film  the action the smart villain the introduction of black panther the relationships between friendsits all fantastic
Nov 12 2021,positive,great movie i personally couldnt choose between team cap and team iron man i think ross is an idiot so i wanted to side with cap but i understand iron amns team too anyways it is so dramatic and funny when spiderman or antman is on screen i love who this feels like avengers civil war the final act is so dramatic great fightingacting and character development 100 the best part of the movie  must watch
Nov 12 2021,neutral,an actionheavy spectacle that suffers from incomprehensible character motivations and inexplicably reverses everything that had been developed about captain america and ironman up to that point
Nov 11 2021,positive,we all love the marvel characters and movies but to me this movie was excellent in that we saw how they can be driven a part and who you would side with and being government controlled or not great performances all around and that end fight was magnificent
Nov 11 2021,positive,this movie is answer to dcs bvs with compare bvs this movie looks not so effectively why people think that this movie is destroyed bvs after cw movie i wanted to sleep if people still discussing about bvs meanwhile people forgot about civil war   i was hope this movie will release after infinity war and endgame where we could see not only 6 superheroes
Nov 5 2021,neutral,this plot couldve been avoided if the avengers had actually talked to each other and realized the problems arent the accords ie miscommunication but of course this movie had to happen because kevin feige wanted to beat dc to the punch before batman v superman released    otherwise the action sequences were entertaining but the cgi couldve used some additional work
Nov 2 2021,positive,captain america civil war has the best fight scenes in mcu i have seen so far i didnt expect this film is that great the enormous performance by chris evans and robert downey jr plus the tremendous directing by the russo brothers resulting an outstanding comic book film this film is a totally toptier mcu film
Nov 1 2021,positive,such a clever plot good introduction to new characters especially spiderman and a huge twist with bucky and a great action sequence at the airport scene and throughout
Oct 29 2021,positive,while it suffers from being overstuffed at times civil war is strong based on the relationship between cap and iron man
Oct 28 2021,positive,big government vs freedom at its core
Oct 28 2021,positive,civil war has all the mcu production qualities and action scenes you would want from a marvel flick but also has quieter moments when the characters philosophize and argue amongst themselves  i really enjoyed this in age of ultron and to some degree here but the talking here seems artificial to promote the highlight of this film where each side poses before fighting the other side  the disagreement over the sokovia accords seemed just dumb and both tony and steve seemed like they were on the flip side of where they should be  really  tony is going to not go save someone when a bureaucrat in belgium tells him not to  i get character growth and guilt and all but please  and the fight scenes while visually appealing were just stupid  bat each other around no problem until someone gets hurt then everyone is like omg dramatic moment  are we five and on a playground
Oct 28 2021,positive,captain america civil war consolidated itself as my favourite mcu film alongside black panther steve rogers and tony stark disagree with each other about something although steve is the protagonist tonys point of view is also explored developed and comprehensible that makes the movie almost impartial which was a superintelligent idea because everybody could be a villain the action sequences are spectacular and the introduction to new characters added to the development of existent and returning ones are perfect tom holland peter parkerspiderman and chadwick boseman king tchallablack panther are two of the best characters of this universe and the comical timing is superb possibly the best of the whole mcu credits to holland and paul rudd the story is complex and incredibly written turning this film into marvels bravest and most human one simply lovely
Oct 19 2021,negative,i think this is a good cinema if you just care about the quality of animation but if you really dont care then bring a pillow because it drags on and on im pretty sure i fell asleep twenty minutes in when it came out
Oct 17 2021,negative,barns killed people including starks parents yet  captain america defends him regardless  sure he was under someone elses control but where is barns remorse where is captain americas sense of law    i know this is about the moral question of who controls ultimate weapons and if the avengers should be responsible for their actions but the characters dont hold true
Oct 6 2021,positive,one of my favorite superhero movies of all time featuring one of the best action scenes and a great villain
Oct 1 2021,positive,a perfect introduction to the 3rd phase of the mcu  the story dialogue and action blend in a perfect stew of good times
Sep 26 2021,positive,whenever i see this movie i always absolutely love it 1010
Sep 10 2021,positive,good movie to follow the story arc a few issues with the fight scene with all the heroes vision disappeared through most of it conveniently and i hate watching iron man and cap fighting but its got to follow the arc i guess
Sep 2 2021,positive,i love the fact that the avengers go against each other very satisfied with the movie 8510
Aug 30 2021,positive,easy to empathise with both parties and motives one of the best portrayals of characters abilities great handling of all the characters with black panther and spiderman better written than for their respective films
Aug 26 2021,positive,while the movie itself has some flaws all of it is worth it for the airport showdown
Aug 25 2021,positive,great actions and characters with a great story making it a fantastic watch and a great fit into the mcu
Aug 25 2021,positive,825  best moment everyone getting on a flight at the airport
Aug 23 2021,positive,wow its cool really cool
Aug 12 2021,positive,compared to the source material this movie was underwhelming i understand changes had to be made do character ownership even so the motivations and the split of the teams seemed extremely forced     the comics in comparison set up and crafted a more intriguing and realistic character divisions filled with a complex weave of moral and political ambiguity
Aug 9 2021,positive,83100really good movie
Aug 8 2021,positive,oh boy where do i begin with this mcu film this is the first time we seen the avengers fighting each other would be better if the hulk was there but sadly he is missing its has a nonchildish plot great setups and dark moments
Jul 26 2021,positive,captain america is a series that constantly remains one of the best with an excellent trilogy bringing in different aspects and concepts to tell a compelling smart and tragic story making you cheer and choose between your favourite superheroes the heartbreaking truth with smart explanations and introductions amazing fight sequences and engaging humour fantastic cast and visuals will have you at the edge of your seat till the final moments
Jul 23 2021,positive,top 5 mcu movie  who didnt want to see the avengers go at it
Jul 21 2021,positive,captain america civil war is my favorite film in the mcu it delivers on every front possible and has fantastic performances from every substantial cast member whether lead or supporting the fights and action setpieces are some of the best youll see in a marvel movie and raise expectations for future films the dialogue is top notch and the writing and directing overall are superb this is a culmination movie but is structurally very different from the two avengers films that came before it this works well to its advantage since it gives us a big breath of fresh air this is the first movie in the mcu that really focuses on the consequences of actions and references previous installments in the process of doing so via this civil war is one of the most realistic and believeable movies in the franchise other than the abilities of some of the characters civil war forces the avengers to ask important questions about themselves as a team and their role in the world and in doing so puts them in difficult positions that have massive ramifications for the avengers as an organization the avengers have had fights and disagreements before but this movie takes that to another level and its fascinating to watch them as they attempt to work through it the writing and directing allow for multiple different storylines to converge without taking away from any of them and they combine really nicely to add depth and emotional impact to the film daniel bruhls zemo is one of the more complicated and convincing villains in the universe and his performance as the character is great making zemo a worthy yet unique adversary to the avengers civil war highlights key character changes and furthers arcs for many of the avengers beautifully setting them and the team up for next outings civil war is also a great blend of humor and seriousness and introduces some big new characters smoothly overall the film has a lot of finesse and is one of the most enjoyable and complex ones in the whole mcu and is a mustsee for marvel fans
Jul 18 2021,positive,not my favourite but some solid scenes   enjoyed it
Jul 17 2021,positive,i feel like if everyone were to simply sit down and talk things through things could have been solved without so much division that having been said it is a good movie it introduces some of my favourite characters and it certainly impacts the rest of the infinity saga
Jul 15 2021,positive,mcu is really in stride hero vs hero internal drama friend vs friend people pulling their strings and pushing their buttons the comic was great the movie is great
Jul 14 2021,positive,a nearly perfect superhero film that blends action humor and tension between characters beautifully
Jul 9 2021,positive,this movie is a dream come true for marvel fans your favorite characters fighting against eachother and this movie actually has consequenses for the rest of the mcu the conflict between tony and steve is really compelling you understand both sides and sympathize with both men a must see if you are a mcu fan or an action movie fanatic     floortje l
Jul 6 2021,positive,one of the mcus almost flawless movies
Jul 6 2021,positive,could have been even more better if cap got the focus a bit more after all its captain america civil war not avengers  civil war but overall the movie is completely action packed and some unexpected twists excelsior
Jul 5 2021,positive,this movie explains so much it is packed with great dialogue and even better character development
Jun 22 2021,neutral,it is one of the worst mcu movies ever  they really could have made it better they just shoved a lot of characters in this movies tried to make money off of it and it is so inferior compared to the comic  i think civil war is the most annoying movie ever im not kidding captain america tried to murder spiderman  can you imagine captain america trying to murder a 15 year old dressed up as an arachnid  he is lucky spiderman didnt go splat
Jun 16 2021,positive,back when i had watched batman v superman and captain america civil war for the first time my verdict was absolutely clear batman v superman is clearly the superior one of the two in batman v superman i wanted batman to win and thats what happened while in captain america civil war i wanted iron man to win but he lost so i had already made up my mind  i was gonna hate every scene every character and the whole story of this movie i completely ignored what made this movie so great just because it showed captain america win i had initially given this movie only 3 stars but now that i gave it a rewatch i have realised how wrong i was    the thing that made this movie so great is what the stakes were after the destruction that had happened in age of ultron the sokovia accords were introduced by convention anyone would think that steve rogers will support it being the patriot that he is while tony stark will oppose it being the capitalist that he is and if that had happened the entire movie would have come crumbling down but instead the opposite happened steve opposed it since he had seen what the nazis were capable of while tony supported it since he was feling guilty of what happened over there so here instead of their differences being created on the basis of their superficial ideologies it changed to their personal ethics    the team that they assembled was not based on similar reasons though spiderman war machine black widow vision scarlett witch falcon  all of them took their sides based on their likeablility peter and rhodes for example liked tony so they took their sides while wanda and clint liked steve more so they took his side as a result the airport battle resulted in black widow changing sides if she had taken sides with personal reasons shed have never done this black panther was the only one who had gone against captain because of his fathers death and he wanted revenge    zemo was also a great villain he was very underappreciated until falcon and the winter soldier came up he really deserved a lot of praise for his master plan he made the avengers fight among themselves tortured officials and finally made tony try to kill bucky unlike ultron who was the previous big villain zemo actually seemed like someone who could do something on his own because he had a complete idea of what he was fighting and what all could be put on the stakes if he really wants to create a rift among the heroes    the fight scenes are the only thing i have a problem with all the fight scenes which have black widow or hawkeye in them always have tons of jump cuts this was quite visible in the fight from the beginning of the movie in the end however the fight of the winter soldier alongside captain america against iron man was pretty well choreographed the makers of this movie didnt make it seem like iron man was weak the situation was created such that iron man couldnt win his suit was uncharged he was emotional they were in close range and he only wanted to incapacitate captain america if it had been a proper fight tony wouldnt have wasted a second to turn them both into pulp    and finally what satisfies me the most is the comeuppance captain america and everyone who sided with him got arrested it felt so good seeing black widow get what she deserves this is probably one of the only mcu movies that actually had a consequence something which only started happening in mcu after this movie took the bold step the bad things that happened in this movie affected what will happen in the future otherwise one only those characters used to die who had been introduced in that very movie bad guys always lost the characters who had died came back to life looking at you infinity war especially loki and gamora    now that i have learnt to appreciate the good movies i ahve seen that captain america civil war is actually a very powerful movie this is a term i use for movies which look great and are great overall a masterpiece its one of the most memorable and impactful mcu movies out there im really sorry about trashing this movie previously now that ive grown up ive also grown into liking it
Jun 15 2021,neutral,this movie was mediocre in my opinion first of all the sokovia accord did not get overturned second division and third they made zemo into a tragic character even though in the comics he was a nazi scum endgame was way better than civil war why because the heroes win just as they should have
Jun 14 2021,positive,i miss the old iron man  captain america
Jun 13 2021,neutral,the two stories of cap and bucky and the sokovia accorda never quite gel iron man becomes very unlikeable in this luckily he got it back in some later movies and since we know that he is wrong when it comes to bucky for a lot of it its hard to see both sides the sokovia accords rules are slightly too vague especially when it comes to later movies maybe im stupid but i didnt fully understand that the rule was that they only needed permission to interfere with other countries needed to register until looking it up later and it doesnt really make sense theyd be so willing to work with the government after events in previous movies i think if they centered the fight solely around what to do about bucky and even had him actually be the one to kill black panthers dad while hypnotized causing a more interesting dynamic with justifications on both side it would have been better the action is amazing in this movie however so if youre looking solely for that you will be satisfied
Jun 13 2021,positive,my 5th favorite movie of all time and this is one of the best mcu movies too  i am a extremely big marvel fan and this film is truly amazing when your talking about how the russo brothers were able to create such a story were over the past films you have seen the characters change and grow through that awsome character development its like you are there how the they argue and it gets really emotional but how the final fight is amazingly shot and lots of great effects and really fast paced action the point of this fight scene is to be emotional and is delivered really well this is a very important film in cinematic history
Jun 12 2021,positive,there comes a lot of pressure making a movie associated with a comic and then theres making a movie association with one of the biggest comics of all time i dont know how the russos did it but this movie is really good and it shouldnt have been there are three conflicting storylines in the film three any other directors wouldve cracked under pressure but not the russos they were able to make one of the best marvel films ever great action scenes great writing its not as good as the original comic but its dang good
Jun 9 2021,positive,a very good movie great fight scenes and the story is good but its kinda rushed and have a lack in characterization especially captain america
Jun 6 2021,neutral,i like the airport fight scene but im sorry the story just feel like a mess winter soldier was far better
Jun 4 2021,positive,versus movies normally is a one sided character movie and the other is wasted but civil war is a battle of ideology between 2 well developed characters civil war is a masterpiece
Jun 4 2021,positive,this film blew my mind when i saw it even tho i was the only one in my family who thought so both my parents and my sister thought bvs was better but as much as it pains me to admit as a dc fan and a snyder fan this is the superior movie
May 27 2021,positive,captain america civil war is one of the best in the mcu this movie has a fantastic plot and brings all these characters perfectly on screen the conflict between steve and tony is written so well zemo is also a good side villain in this movie the action scenes were wellmade all in all i give this movie a 55 stars
May 23 2021,positive,this movie is the setup of what happens in infinity war which makes it one of the best
May 23 2021,positive,i wanted to enjoy captain america civil war but i couldnt while the action scenes are stellar it introduces great characters quite well and the villain is highly original and sympathetic all the other scenes are just talking and not talking about interesting stuff this is in my opinion is one of the weaker mcu movies
May 14 2021,positive,great movie not quite as good as the winter soldier
May 4 2021,positive,this is my favorite captain america film yes i like this one more than captain america the winter soldier for three reasons black panther spiderman and antman these three characters really stoled the show the best part about them is that they naturally fit in when i watch this film every time that there on screen i love it i have a blast every time spiderman and antman talk i get chills every time black panther had an action scene now that tchalla is gone due to chadwick bosemans recent passing i rewatch his scenes in sadness on a brighter note this film has incredible character development every single characters disagreement is valid and it fits their character when they all end up fighting each other at the airport you know why their fighting and know exactly why theyre there youre not constantly asking why all the time you understand why there doing all of this this film is also thrilling from beginning to end and you actually really dont  know whats going to happen until you watch it until the end the only problem that i have with this movie his zemo his motivation is understandable i just thought that he needed to be more interesting but they do fix this latter in the falcon and the winter soldier overall really good film and i can watch this one over and over 1010
Apr 25 2021,positive,one of the most entertaining and exciting editions of the whole marvel cinematic universe   the set up of the ideological aspects of government oversight versus the belief that good people left to their own devices will always prevail is well executed in the rivalry between iron man and captain america  great characters   some great action  a lot of fun from the opening scene  the winter soldier continues to be an interesting character in the set up for the falcon and the winter soldier series  the addition of tom hollands spiderman and chadwick boseman are both winners
Apr 24 2021,positive,outstanding great story amazing action and emotional at points
Apr 18 2021,positive,perhaps the most thoughtprovoking superhero movie to date
Apr 13 2021,positive,this movie successfully balances a lot of plot points most impressively i think it succeeds in being a strong sequel to the previous captain america movie on top of it being a story about conflict within avengers the action is very entertaining and the dark moments hit when they need to the villain was also refreshingly different from previous films
Apr 11 2021,positive,the russo brothers strike again with another great installment to the captain america franchise even if it feels more like an avengers movie it is a great film that answers a lot of questions left by previous films daniel bruhl as zemo is great and the final fights at the airport and in siberia were both amazing too watch however at times it feels like another setup movie with the introduction of chadwick boseman as the black panther and tom holland as spiderman who were soon to get their first movie overall a really good moving with little to no flaws
Apr 8 2021,positive,this movie stars almost all the avengers this movie is a story of how our heroes turn on each other because of events from the past there is amazing choreography and fight scenes and chase scenes and great stunt work but at the core of this movie its a film about friendship and vengeance this film was serious
Apr 5 2021,neutral,barely watchable due to the obviously exaggerated ie retimed digital camera moves very herkyjerky fast shutter speed sequences that lack weight or natural movement convoluted plot the movie connects events before the movie to installments after the movie without much more theme or gravitas than a digital tv show plus the inherent blandness and rather obvious flat ground plane for the main cgienhanced showdown at the end of the film    picture also features some details about a shadowy russian operative plot elements about the antipathy between captain america and iron man and a few product placements for upcoming installments of black panther and spiderman     this is a film that provides escapism in the worst sense rather than enchanting viewers it overloads the senses at various points with frenetic action thats oddly bloodless and forgettable franchise entry pic employs legions of nonunion cgi contractors while downey jr walked away with excess of 40 million for his participation in captain america civil war amusinglydistressingly the united states would infact be involved in efforts to suppress a reallife civil war some three years later
Apr 2 2021,positive,convulated plot but who cares about the plot when the heroes fight each other in an airport for 1520 minutes
Mar 31 2021,positive,its surprising how well it convinces me my favorite superheroes would fight each other this is a great follow up to captain america the winter soldier that gives emotion and heart to every scene the action is some of the best in the mcu this movie is fantastic
Mar 30 2021,positive,so you wanna tell me this isnt just a cheap way for marvel to not allow cap america getting overshadowed by batman v superman thanks geoff johns
Mar 27 2021,positive,are you tony stank    ahhh the actions just keep getting better and better but now we had more superheroes fighting each other of course the best was spiderman who was both funny and charismatic     as entertaining as the action i felt the story wasnt as strong as in winter soldier however its still a good story that led to awesome fight scenes    for sure one of the best trilogies 910
Mar 26 2021,positive,captain america civil war is the movie that made me an mcu fan i was so hyped for this movie and it didnt disappoint and it was so good that i went back and watched all of the movies i missed this movie is near perfection
Mar 24 2021,negative,pile of crap stinking garbage
Mar 23 2021,positive,i could watch it over and over and wouldnt get bored great plot villain and action only problem is iron man he takes up too much of caps third movie starks storyline sucks compared to steves tony is a bum head and cap is a much much better superhero
Mar 22 2021,positive,copied dc and it worked liked bvs more but both films are in a special place in my heart
Mar 21 2021,positive,great movie love zemo character the way he broke down the team cap  bucky vs ironman epic
Mar 21 2021,positive,probably one of the best mcu films huge problems with it but it was all worth it since we got this actual dark toned film with the characters fighting one another as if weve never seen this before avengers 1 anyway the film changes everything the mcu has been doing so far and finally delivers something different that doesnt feel too safe and childish and a forced comedy film like all the other films with this gigantic universe we at least get to see this for once
Mar 19 2021,positive,the trailer broke the internet and the wait broke me but the movie put me back together again
Mar 17 2021,negative,its a trash  rotten   055    one of the worst comic book movies ever made
Mar 16 2021,positive,a very interesting story that gives motivation for each character and makes you feel for them no matter what they do overall its a very surprising and action packed movie
Mar 14 2021,positive,the best captain america film in my opinion probably have seen it 10 times    iron man vs captain america was done to perfection the ending fight was great    superb introductions of spiderman  black panther
Mar 14 2021,positive,found it a bit of a slog saved from being a five by the inspired intros of black panther and spiderman
Mar 8 2021,positive,this movie is in my top 5 favorite mcu movies the captain america movies keep getting better and better
Mar 1 2021,neutral,this movie is a copy of batman v superman only without the touch of drama that it deserves their fights show that they dont take it seriously and that they are just playing in conclusion a mediocre movie
Feb 26 2021,positive,the russo brothers did it again a superb story that kept me engaged even on rewatching it some people say that that this should not have been called captain america i dont see the issue considering the main plot point of the movie is about caps friend bucky and the story continues from the winter soldier the set pieces were amazing and the choreographed fight scenes were the best yet in the mcu fantastic introductions to the black panther and spiderman heartwrenching scenes that make you feel for every character involved the only negative is introducing the idea of more winter soldiers just to have that be thrown away to further the plot everything about this movie is engaging grade 94 a
Feb 26 2021,positive,i didnt like this film as much as the others in the avengers cu i was confused why would the avengers divide it was executed great but the plot i didnt get
Feb 19 2021,positive,the 13th film in the mcu is truly something special for long time comic book fans the story dialogue characters shots and sequences are all what marvel movies are about marvelous films
Feb 18 2021,neutral,the movie isnt terrible as some suggest but bringing together the two most iconic superheroes of our time should have delivered more the ultimate cut is superior and tells a better story compared to the choppy narrative of the theatrical cut the batman rescue scene is superb and the introduction of wonder woman is iconic the music though it has its highlights falls short of its predecessors
Feb 11 2021,positive,one of my favorite movies ever the entire backstory and plot is so engaging and will keep you on the edge of your seat the acting is done very well the movie is a mustsee and one you will never get tired of watching
Feb 11 2021,positive,captain america civil war is iconic it will be remembered as the go to example of how to have two protagonists two good guys fight each other while keeping their characters consistent it already has larger studios trying to imitate its success and failing to reach the high bar it sets it perfectly executes the story it wants to tell however i feel that everything besides the narrative and characters were unmemorable and unnoteworthy      creating a realistic scenario where the just patriotic noble steve rogers and the reformed changed tony stark and not making it feel forced is no small feat full credit to the russo brothers for masterfully crafting this narrative the key to that narrative being the main antagonist of the film zemo     zemo is definitely in the upper tier of marvel villains a masterful performance by daniel brühl combined with a masterful script and backstory come to make a compelling villain when it comes to villains in an action movie brain will always triumph bron a smart clever villain will always be leagues more interesting than a villain that is simply buff zemo is the perfect example of this he reminds me of heath ledgers joker or light yagami a smart villain with a genius planhis charisma is nowhere near the level of light and his look and performance is no where near as iconic as heath ledger but his plan is absolute genius     aside from the villain every side character gets fleshed out as well throughout the movie black panther is introduced and given a stronger character development than in his stand alone movie wanda and vision start to develop a  very cute relationship that im sure will never ever be exploited through a dated tv show on a barely relevant streaming service spider holland is introduced black widow continues to be true neutral in the mcu alignment chart hawkeye is here enough said     taking a step back from character analysis my overall takeaway is that the movie succeeds in what it sets out to do with flying colors it sets up a civil war between ironman and captain america explores both their characters further and delivers solid action scenes so why isnt this movie a 1010 honestly as sad as it is to say its because its part of the mcu the movie doesnt do enough new things to shake up the mcu or its characters looking at it you may disagree spiderman and black panther are introduced wannda and vision develop a relationship tony stark and steve rodgers fall out and dont speak to each other for years its everything else that feels way too similar nothing except the characters stand out the music is unmemorable the sound design as a whole is bland and flat camera work is once again unmemorable lighting is flat and set design is boring the best word to describe everything besides the characters and narrative is unnoteworthy its not deserving of scorn but not deserving of praise either     ultimately civil war is a great story with good production value no major changes would be needed to improve captain america civil war just smaller tweaks would have made a world of difference
Feb 10 2021,positive,captain america civil war is an exciting actionpacked movie with fantastic performances and a strong plot
Feb 10 2021,positive,although i recognize some of its qualities i think this film is very weak again its action sequences are very good and i really like their final sequences however some plots and characters are there just for pure fan service
Feb 7 2021,negative,just flat out boring
Feb 6 2021,positive,one of my favourite marvel movie the russo brothers know how to direct a movie captain america is my favourite hero so i love what marvel the russo brothers and christopher markus and stephen mcfeely are doing with this character the action in this movie is some of the best ive seen in a superhero movie the writing is so brilliant this movie has to do so much and it pulls it all off perfectly the last act in this movie is perfection it blew me away you dont know whos side you are on it was great great movie
Feb 6 2021,positive,this movie felt more like an avengers movie than a captain america movie i loved it the airport fight scene is one of the most epic battle scenes in the entire marvel cinematic universe
Feb 6 2021,positive,this is the best film of captain america series i really love it avengers fought with each other the villain was mastermind he said i cant win from avengers but if they fight with each other then they will be ruined it would worth your time and its a must watch
Feb 5 2021,negative,no i dont like this movie it should have been called avengers civil war it doesnt count as a solo movie it only counts as a solo movie with only captain america in it and not some of the avengers you know like iron man black panther hulk thor scarlet witch vision antmangiant man im afraid to say it but i think this movie makes the 1990 captain america look better to me
Jan 31 2021,positive,a film that unlike bvs earns its rivalry so emotional and impactful because of the previous films this is an example of why the mcu is an amazing franchise
Jan 29 2021,neutral,the special effects are great the fighting is incessant but good the usual not as smart as it thinks quick and lame wit is on display as all marvel films the plot is thin the themes barely explored its just an excuse for lots of superhero fight scenes and it gets really tiring very quickly im not a marvel fan as you can tell its an early teenage wet dream concept and it never changes or surprises
Jan 29 2021,negative,this script was so forced i could barely force myself to sit through it
Jan 28 2021,positive,shows that division is present everywhere
Jan 24 2021,positive,so much fun id love to see an invaders movie
Jan 23 2021,neutral,one of the worst mcu movies
Jan 23 2021,positive,exactly what i expected
Jan 23 2021,positive,if you were found avengers age of ultron underwhelming captain america civil war is a more than worthy film to be considered an avengers movie new and innovative action sequences along with updated drama and conflict turn what shouldve just been an average sequel to the previous two captain america films into one of the best marvel films ever
Jan 20 2021,positive,awesome my new favourite so far at least    what an absolute joy captain america civil war is it made 147 minutes feel like so much less great action enthralling story sharp humour and some impeccable use of the many many characters even introducing two new faces to the mcu i wont spoil who but they are massive additions and i love what they give to this    it gives the perfect amount of screen time to all involved there is noone i wanted to see more or less of  it all felt very natural too big kudos for that chris evans is terrific this is his best performance as captain america thus far in my opinion robert downey jr continues to impress as expected    sebastian stan as bucky also sticks out i didnt love that character in his preceding appearances but in this i really did connect with his story anthony mackie and don cheadle remain good fun while daniel brühl plays his role very nicely elsewhere paul rudds inclusion is amusing    the whole film as is normal in these productions looks stunning they are incredibly well made as noted at the top this is more new favourite from the mcu  surpassing captain america the first avenger i guess theres no hiding who my standout avenger is eh    the only but i have for this is the title its practically an avengers film im not saying its an illfitting title i get its the titular characters arc but i feel like it does the film a slight disservice  its impacts much more than captain america    thats not a big deal at all though no doubt in my mind this is superb
Jan 17 2021,positive,a superhero movie where you take time to think which team to choose both have reasonable sides filled with emotion and highly choreographed action sequences the russos has done it again
Jan 16 2021,positive,captain america civil war is a fantastic adventure that pits our favorite avengers against each other in the most satisfying way possible
Jan 15 2021,negative,in what is essentially a copy of batman v superman this movie fails to deliver the conflict between the characters quite obviously very forgettable villains did not help too
Jan 6 2021,positive,captain america civil war is one of the best marvel movies in this movie we get to see characters like scott lang aka antman meet the rest of the avengers he provides a lot of comedy to what could be a very serious movie
Jan 3 2021,positive,great classic marvel formula never ceases to squeeze a laugh and a thrill out of me the only points ill take off are for the movie not being able to decide if its an avengers movie or a captain america movie because in the end its neither doesnt take away from how good it is its just lost opportunity
Dec 31 2020,neutral,this movie was big disappoint meant because they could have made this movie a lot better and serious and made just as good as the civil war comic  the positive about this film is there few of good scenes in this film 
Dec 28 2020,negative,this is a shitty bad and horrible copy of batman v superman
Dec 26 2020,negative,the whole plot doesnt make sense for me while i like iron man i cant sympathize with this moron of captain america and his team nearly nonwatchable garbage for nonamericans
Dec 22 2020,positive,great assumable and very conflicting story help the characters sore although this feels more like a small avengers film and even tho the story revolves around bucky and steve very funny and left a great direction with a lot of ideas of where they could take the story
Dec 19 2020,positive,marvels as ive come to know lot of gadgets and special powers and fight scenes avengers are fighting each other this time because society wants to control them
Dec 11 2020,positive,6 bags its hard to decide if this or guardians is my favorite mcu movie this one made me a cap fan for sure wait i already said that about ultron i get all these movies confused now they probably made too many but i loved civil war just like axl rose said whats so civil about war anyway he also threatened ppl to fights and told kurt cobain you tell your bitch to shut up or im taking you down to the pavement cap and iron man never said that to each other no matter how much they disagreed so besides not playing civil war by g n r its still a 6 bagger for being so actionpacked and intense and tragic and exciting and world building
Dec 10 2020,positive,maybe im just achieving superhero fatigue it is good but there are just so many
Dec 8 2020,positive,thoughtful compelling wellacted nearly flawless hilarious dark political and psychological are all words to describe one of if not the finest mcu film of all
Dec 4 2020,positive,well told story and motives as well as high octane action what more could a comic fan ask for
Dec 2 2020,positive,captain america civil war is a true masterpiece in the light of 2020 its even better or maybe disappointing im not really sure this movie has a really good balance between emotional moments and action all the characters are really good developed and there are a lot good lines of course its about two sides in the avengers group one side who follows the governments of the world and the other side who wants to do what their feelings are saying but if you look closely its about a group of friends with different ideas about good and bad im very positive about it and this was my first mcu movie i had ever seen so this is really iconic for me personally why did i say in the light of 2020 its a bit a point of discussion well captain america is so good as gone now but his biggest group of enemies is still not defeated this is probably his last movie in the captain america series so in my opinion it should have happened in this movie on the other hand its better with the knowledge of now spiderman and black panther have their entrance in the universe i think the biggest questionable point of this movie is that this movie really cant stand on itself almost all the other mcu movies can its not really a problem but it explains why i gave it 4 stars instead of 45 or even 5
Dec 2 2020,negative,i fucking hate this stupid fucking movie
Nov 28 2020,positive,what a watch introducing two new characters in black panther and spiderman our first proper look at antman working with the rest of the avengers cast it grips you from the first moments to the last
Nov 26 2020,positive,a fantastic action scene on an airport surrounded with an entertaining movie that moves fast and produces some good laughs    definitely worth watching
Nov 18 2020,positive,the most emotional mcu film with an epic airport battle scene and just awesome in general
Nov 12 2020,positive,there is a conviction of purpose that infuses every aspect of captain america civil war be it within the characters or the script or the lensing confidence in purpose abounds at every turn our entire marvel cast in pinned against one another with new characters to join in on the fun the set pieces here are all that a super hero film should hold to a standard at the end of the story its not what side the characters are fighting on its who they are fighting for
Nov 11 2020,positive,i could watch this movie over and over and over it never gets old
Nov 9 2020,positive,the best standalone mcu film it asks such interesting questions of responsibility and accountability and justice and it does so the way a good story should through the lenses of the characters all of whom have come a long way since their first appearances
Oct 29 2020,negative,was looking forward to seeing this at the time in 2016 after the fantastic 2nd entry captain america winter soldier and then hearing that the 3rd movie was going to do the civil war story i was stokedthen i watched the film only be to be let down again by another movie with a poor payoff and misleading title that was only used for 5 minutes then completely discarded and replaced in what is now considered as a parking lot brawl and love triangle between tony bucky and steve the whole scenario of tony eventually realising that bucky was in fact brainwashed for years and had no control of his actions yet still attacked him regardless was pointless resulting in a 2 on 1 handicap fight what we have here is expectation of a civil war story from the comics resulting into complete collapse of a movie about a playground disputei like him he is my friend i like you more than him i dont like you now i hate you now you hurt my friend can we be friends again i want my toy back as my dad made it stupid
Oct 28 2020,positive,action packed exciting blockbustercivil war stands out as the best film in the mcu
Oct 25 2020,neutral,what is a complete mess felt brainless not as good as the other two captain americas
Oct 20 2020,negative,aside from the fact that i hate to see the main characters fight each other instead of the enemy they were losing popularity based on their destructive tendency what do they do after they are told the public are starting to get sick of it fight each other and destroy an airport if the goal of this movie is to show that super heroes are dicks they succeeded my least favorite in the marvel franchise
Oct 13 2020,positive,captain america civil war is a terrific final installment of the captain america trilogy it wraps up caps story nicely with his quest to save bucky and question his role as a tool for the us government honestly i felt like it was a better avengers sequel than age of ultron with this being the culmination of the ideological clashes between steve rogers tony stark and the rest of the avengers the cameos from black panther and spiderman are icing on the cake of this exciting clash of superheroes the action scenes are a lot of fun especially the creatively epic fight sequence from the airport scene while i do have issues with captain americas antiaccountability stance and tony starks hypocrisy with projecting his own past of irresponsible actions that got people killed there is still enough interesting discourse between the two philosophies that creates an engaging ethical cash between the two heroes
Sep 28 2020,positive,civil war is one of mcus best works and represents when the story in these movies really started to feel like it mattered the cast and writing are on point the action is so so good it introduced black panther and made him way more interesting and badass than he was in his own movie all the stories and relationships the mcu had been setting up finally pay off in a huge way did i mention how great the action is about as good as superhero movies can get
Sep 21 2020,positive,this movie changed the direction of all future movies in the mcu it was brilliant how they managed to create a story that is different from the previous marvel studios films we observe how the avengers suffer the consecuences from the fight against ultron avengers age of ultron and they are forced to decide whether to be controlled by the government or not actionpacked and a very interesting story make captain america civil war one of the mcus finest movies to date
Sep 19 2020,positive,well besides the well known characters this movie was fine it did not have anything special and the last fight scene between captain america and iron man was a bit dragged out nothing much happened the only reason to watch this is to be able to understand a small part of the plot from the later movies
Sep 5 2020,positive,enjoyable nice to see new characters
Sep 4 2020,positive,action is amazing plot is solid enough with only a few hindrances here and there like any grand villain plot it requires some susension of disbelief that they can assume so much will happen to get to the end result     chadwick bossman as tchalla was a strong addition as well as tom holland as spiderman     i feel the biggest flaw in the movie if i had to get picky would be the driving core of the movie the idea that all the past actions of the avengers somehow drives the nations to restrict them seems stupid in all instances the result of their intervention saved more lives than were ended even the inciting incident with the explosion of the african consult is a much better result than crossbones getting away with a deadly virus that could kill millions     i was worried that with so many characters the idea that this was a captain america movie would be lost but honestly cap and bucky are at the core of this story as they should be neither get over shadowed and as such the heart is properly centered
Sep 3 2020,positive,the captain america train is losing no steam whatsoever after winter soldier this film breaks all the rules but paves its own successful path
Sep 3 2020,positive,its good focus on characters more then other mcu movies
Sep 1 2020,neutral,i was very disappointed with this movie the first time i watched it sadly after watching it again the disappointment didnt go away i really wanted to like this one it felt more like avengers 25 to me than a captain america movie the action bored me the dialogue made me cringe at times and the stakes felt very low the entire movie i came to dislike it even more when i learned it was thrown together in less than two years in an attempt to rival batman v superman wouldve rather seen the original project which was captain america serpent society sounds cool doesnt it
Aug 30 2020,positive,what did i think of captain america civil war check out my full review below  
Aug 29 2020,positive,in my opinion the best captain america film ever this film is amazing its cool how you got spiderman introduced into the mcu in this film it is my 3rd favorite mcu film and my 2nd favorite film of 2016 1st being hacksaw ridge
Aug 22 2020,positive,the best heroes vs heroes movie ive ever scene with cool action and emotional scenes that fit perfectly in this movie
Aug 22 2020,positive,the film is entertaining and emotionally powerful but its mostly downbeat tone is jarring compared to the rest of the franchise
Aug 17 2020,positive,with its emotional core and intense narrative it will make you struggle to pick sides
Aug 12 2020,positive,it was amazing better than avengers endgame more action a little bit emotional
Aug 11 2020,positive,this movie just made me so excited
Aug 10 2020,positive,i wish the mcu stayed this good yknow why couldnt the russo brothers keep that magic for endgame 9510
Aug 8 2020,negative,this movie is boring with a cheap plotline that goes nowhere
Aug 8 2020,positive,after the brilliant emotional and thrilling ending brought to this universe in infinity war and endgame going back through it is still civil war that hits me hardest every time the character dynamics the dialogue the strife that breaks these friends apart the humour heart and even the surprisingly for movies known for good action scenes original breathtaking action scenes that actually propel the story and characters forwardall of it serves an impactful narrative the movie abounds in pitch perfect performances apologies to those who hate aliteration with evans and downey in particular killing it in every last scene the end is truly gutwrenching people have their own feelings about how the marvel films are nowhere near the artistry of the nolan batmans which i love but just because a film has comedy in it doesnt mean it isnt art or doesnt take its world seriously speaking of humour paul rudd in this movie was genius in every single line reading i am sure many would ridicule me for saying so but i loved daniel bruhls zemo as a villain his plan made sense and came from his own personal loss not to mention other than thanos he is the only villain to succeed in his goal fighting the avengers in fact he even surpasses thanos in that he manages to break the bond between these friends that ultimately leads to thanos being able to win in infinity war his role wasnt as flashy as many marvel villains but it was meaningful and if all this wasnt enough this movie brilliantly and succinctly introduces us to spiderman and black panther both wellportrayed by holland and boseman respectively my favorite marvel film and one of my all time favorite trips to the cinema ever
Jul 17 2020,positive,civil war was quite good but i was a little annoyed how at the end the iron man joined captain america but started fighting him again immediately i would watch this again
Jul 13 2020,positive,this is one of the best mcu movies it has deep emotion smart storytelling and memorable action scenes
Jul 8 2020,positive,this is hands down one of the best marvel films for its complex and emotional storyline along with the ability to handle so many superheroes in a film without losing focus on the main characters captain america and iron man it gives fan service and also shows a very complicated and thought out story without making it seem like just a traditional marvel movie personally my favorite out of all of the marvel stories told thus far and i hope that one day marvel can make another film that rivals the success of this one
Jul 5 2020,positive,8 years after iron man and as the massive superhero franchise that is the mcu started to become somewhat formulaic and stale we see in this movie the seeds planted to begin phase three taking the often ignored havoc and destruction caused by superheroes in the course of their duty and turning it in on itself ideologically dividing the heroes and turning them against each other while ultimately starting to set the stage for the biggest payoff of any movie franchise  ever this is the movie where the mcu began to expand and reinvent itself
Jul 3 2020,positive,so good made my emotional
Jun 27 2020,positive,avengers 25 is my 3rd favourite mcu film    i have heard a rumor that feige greenlighted civil war instead of serpent soldier because of bvs this the reason why i love compitition  goodness for fans    the more i watch this film the more i like this might be my most watched mcu film and i have half of the dialogues memorised the dialogues are so rich and filled with easter eggs reference to older films and sets up that i find something new everytime i rewatch    this movie got us black panther and spiderman russos and mm got them so right tchalla had a arc for vengeance while parallely stark was beating cap for vengeance for parents  zemo was also taking revenge its a story about multiple revenge stories interlinked with smart storytelling vengence has consumed you it is consuming them and i am done letting it consume me    peter parker was perfect smart way to introduce with tony but sony played with tonyuncle ben too much spiderman leaving quips movie reference and taking taking taking throughout fight sequence teenager looking to impress stark the first thing peter said when he heard he got selected as a stark intern was ask if it was paid classic peter     vision line of our very own strength invites challenges challenges incites conflict conflict breeds catastrophe is the most underrated line in history or mcu party because it is long but i have it memorised mcunerd    now about the real deal  if you look at steve and tony from a 3rd perspective they both are right and wrong at the same time flawed characters tony was driven by fear in ultron now he is driven by guilt captain america lost hope in institution because his shield was inflantrated by hydra their roots of motivations arises from the progression these characters have been taking from their past films i loved their arguments in avengers 1 but here it crosses the line for the final battle    peggy dieing and sharon carters words of peggy saying to stand on your ground for cap to inspire hits hard black widow betraying tony to let escape steve was worth it as she knows where steve is coming from    scarlet and visions love story grows a little bit more while other side characters like antman being for laughs clint to pit against his classic widow and rhodey injury feels hard but him dieing would have been much better for more consequences of actions    the registration act feels natural given the amount civilians death from past films the airport sequence is iconic and i love that the characters are fighting but still pulling their punches they were friends now are fighting against each other    tony as villain is believable but you feel bad for him at the end zemo on the other hand is one of my favourite mcu villains love how he pulls all the strings and he succeeds to break the avengers apart also making way for thanos to win this plan is always 1 step ahead but his plans seems too much fictional if you step back and thing about everything its a con but the other great things i gets from this movie just blows this point away    one major nerdy point this movie had multiple times say  mission report december 16 1991 dec 16 being starks parents death while in iron man 1 2008 showed a newpaper saying starks died on dec 17 this just proves people making this movies actually cares about these characters and wants to make quality movies and not just cashgrabs every single character gets there moment to shine and doesnt get neglected by the big cast
Jun 27 2020,positive,the best captain america film ever this film is amazing its cool how you got spiderman introduced into the mcu in this film it is my 3rd favorite mcu film and my 2nd favorite film of 2016
Jun 25 2020,positive,it had a lot of people in a captain america movie what else could you want 
Jun 20 2020,positive,civil war is top tier marvel because unlike many mcu movies this one actually feels like it has stakes its not exactly the fun uplifting experience most mcu movies are when two of your favorite heroes are engaged in a brutal beat down instead it has something many mcu movies lack real gravitas and drama and if you are looking for the funfilled marvel the airport scene is one of the best action scenes in any superhero movie ever
Jun 17 2020,positive,captain america civil war directed by the russo brothers had some big shoes to fill after the winter soldier and they absolutely exceeded expectations pushing the mcu films to new heights undoubtedly civil war is a huge fan service film but that doesnt discourage the fact that this film is one of the best of the saga thus far having so many relatable themes and memorable scenes the russo brothers set this intriguing serious tone for the majority of the film creating amazing tension between the characters while they interwove their brilliantly written humor the russo brothers do such a great job keeping the continuity going from the winter soldier and the first avenger while also tying into the saga beautifully setting up some great exposition one of my main issues i have with civil war not that there is so much going on but the way they structured and balanced the scenes the way the scenes were set it didnt make the sequences feel as cohesive as they couldve with some plots becoming underdeveloped    even though this is a storydriven film the russo brothers stephen mcfeely  christopher markus allowed for countless brilliant character moments allowing each character to shine and get a little more depth every characters motive is understood and fleshed out well because of the good writting and the set up films prior giving every character a few more layers the only issue i had with the characters is that the creative team set themselves for some balancing issues strictly due to the additions of a couple of cameo characters but they made the absolute best of it with this being a captain america film you know hes going to have a lot on his plate and the writers and chris evans handled and balanced everything great his character was the main focus being really well written expanding on his genuine bond with the team and reaching a new level of banter with tony stark his argument was described so well where you can whole heartily get behind him and completely back him up tony stark runs the same lines his character was another main focus being well written and having the best character arch of the film robert downey jr nails his role once again being a standout in someone elses movie tom holland absolutely crushes his role as peter parkerspiderman this is such a fresh take on his character being nailed to a t tom holland seemed to get almost all of the best lines stealing every single scene hes in holland brings an extreme likability to the character and i cant wait for his solo film chadwick boseman also gets introduced into the mcu as the black panther and he is another standout of this film his character is also well written having a nice character arch being one of those characters you can instantly care for boseman puts on a great performance proving he belongs in the mcu we get one of the most highly anticipated characters make his return in paul rudd as ant man he doesnt have much to do but he makes the most out of all of his screen time scarlett johansson returns as black widow and returns as one of the most grounded of the character bunch her character gets a little more importance here but she doesnt have that much characterization elizabeth olsen favorably returns as wanda witch having one of the best potentials coming into the film mcfeely and markus tried to give her some importance but her character was sadly sidelined compared to everyone else paul bettany runs the same lines as wanda getting a little more to do but i needed more from the both of them sebastian stan don cheadle and anthony mackie all return as their respected characters they all had their minimal time to shine but they were just left in the background for the most part helmut zemo is in the top three for most controversial villains of the mcu i believed that zemo had a purpose in this film being a subtle villain but if they were to scratch his character the narrative wouldnt really change all that much if anything it would probably tighten up the narrative    the screenplay by stephen mcfeely and christopher markus shines in most aspects but they couldve trimmed down some things and gave it to the characters that needed that extra time to develop if they did that and maybe added another decent risk or two this film would be close to flawless    with the action being handled by the russo brothers you know its going to be a hit but this was a grandslam they incorporated so many great shots with the right amount of shaky cam being one of the most notable films for the action the russo brothers always know how to bring tention during these action sequences and it was handled extremely well    overall captain america civil war is probably my second favorite mcu film and i think its more than fair to say that this is a film that belongs at the top of the list
Jun 17 2020,positive,my only problems with the film is the bad cgi at times and lack of hulk and thor  still a great movie but the comic version was better
Jun 17 2020,negative,captain america proves to us once again that he can never grow us a character and stands on hypocritical lies if he had told tony about his parents a while ago things would have been resolved in a much better way hated this because of steve but tolerated it for tony stark our savior
Jun 10 2020,positive,great movie with cool action scenes
Jun 9 2020,neutral,a little bit overrated the third act is worth it but the rest of the movie is dispensable the scene in the german airport is the worst part of the movie it is too long slows the pace of the movie without a reason also this scene has some of the worst dialogue lines i ever saw in a movie
Jun 8 2020,positive,captain america civil war is a welldeveloped action film that portrays the confrontation between heroes well the film has an incredible villain perhaps the most dangerous of all the mcu zemo daniel brühl furthermore the confrontation between the heroes is well developed throughout the film the action scenes are very well choreographed and the direction of the russo brothers is fantastic in my opinion captain americas best film only has one thing inferior to the other two the soundtrack
Jun 7 2020,positive,always a great watch i very much enjoy this movie and i will continuously go back to watch it one of my favorites of the mcu i definitely recommend it
Jun 5 2020,positive,only thing to say see this movie
Jun 4 2020,positive,very great conflict every side has their motivations and reasons it makes for a natural argument between friends the fight or argument between the avengers was good enough to carry the plot but the villain was so amazingly incorporated in the story he managed to pull something of that not many villains could he is no thanos loki hela or ultron they are all very powerful zemo doesnt have powers which makes him interesting his plan and reason was understandable he tore our favorite heroes apart black panther and spiderman are in this movie for the first time in the mcu spiderman was so fresh young funny and entertaining black panther went through a transformation in this movie too this film was just so incredible highly recommendable
Jun 2 2020,positive,at the time of release this movie was hands down the best mcu movie that had been made with only one real competitor of the winter soldier civil war is a movie that had been built up to for 12 movies before it so it may be hard to understand if you havent watched another movie like age of ultron or winter soldier but civil war is marvel at their best it shows the state of the avengers about a year after the events of age of ultron while this is a captain america movie hes not the only one that has a great arc in this movie the avengers all have different opinions on how they should continue after they are presented with the sokovia accords saying the un will be in charge of them each of their decisions make sense tony stark supports the accords because he has seen what has happened when he is given too much power he created the biggest threat that the avengers had ever faced and he feels responsible for the death of many especially after a woman tells him about her son that died in sokovia steve has just seen a government be taken over by hydra and how government control can lead to terrible things he knows that if they dont do what they do things would be worse by agreeing with the accords they would be giving up the right of choice rhodes supports tony sam supports steve black widow supports tony because she hopes that if they support the accords they will be allowed to continue this is the only family shes ever had and she wants to keep it together vision tries to look at it logically and supports tony but his logic is flawed because he assumes that the world ending events will stop if the avengers stop avenging one of the most amazing things about the movie is that it has an enormous cast of 12 superheroes and yet still doesnt feel cluttered or overloaded the narrative focuses around steve tony bucky and sort of natasha but every character has their moment to shine this movie also has some of the best action sequences in the mcu and the airport scene is probably one of the best action setpieces in a superhero movie along with the spiderman 2 train sequence and the dark knight car chase its also amazing that both steve and tony are right in their own ways which is why even though iron man is an antagonist many people still support him because hes also right in many ways i personally am team cap but i see why others are team iron man the part in the airport scene where the avengers are lining up to face each other is awesome spiderman and antman are so funny and make the movie enjoyable in civil war we know why every character does exactly what they do and then we have zemo zemo is a very underrated villain he is the one of the most effective villains as he was the only one besides thanos that got what he wanted he has clear and understandable motivations the avengers killed his family in sokovia and so now he wants revenge on them many people dont like zemo because of his plan requiring a lot of luck but it didnt require that much luck zemo just improvised in his plan as he went along for example his original plan was to find out about siberia from the hydra guy who he found out about after black widow released hydras files to the internet in the winter soldier he had already read about the what the winter soldier did in 1991 in that hydra book he knew that cap and bucky were best friends and what cap would do for bucky as he had been following and studying the avengers for a year his plan was to get to siberia and get cap and bucky to follow him the movie doesnt focus on the parts where he had to improvise as much because it would just be boring to see that especially since the film focuses more on the heroes he knew that stark would do anything to make things right as wanda said in age of ultron so he put the real doctors body and fake mask for bucky in the tub and told the hotel service person to come in so she would find out that bucky was framed and iron man would see that cap was right about a fake doctor and bucky being framed and the other soldiers steve and bucky would follow him to stop the winter soldiers tony would follow to make things right with steve civil war also has one of the best twists in a superhero movie ever zemo is the most subversive villain and i was shocked when i saw tony and steve looking at the recording it was such a good twist we were supposed to think that december 16 1991 was important because of the super serum and that tony steve and bucky would face an army of winter soldiers but instead of being big and meaningless the russos decide to make it small and powerful tony reaction is understandable because it is how any normal person would act when they find out that the ones they thought were friends were actually the guy that killed his parents and the guy that lied to him about it the final battle is a gut punch we all want them to stop fighting but they cant civil war also has a great end for steve rogerss arc he looks at tony stark as a bully thats trying to hurt his best friend and he needs to stand up to that bully he says the same thing he said to the bully in that ally all those years ago i can do this all day bucky protected steve when he was young and steve would save bucky now and when steve is hitting tony with the shield we can tell that tony thinks steve will kill him so he puts his hands over his face when steve puts the shield into tonys arc reactor we know theres no going back when tony said you dont deserve that shield cap drops the shield the dropping of the shield is the end of caps arc steve stood for the traditional american values of honor bravery and justice and he was noble and selfless the dropping of the shield shows that cap has rejected america and this is not the america he stood for civil war has one of the most emotional endings the avengers are broken from within and there is no healing the themes of choice and revenge are clear and present choice drives the whole movie and the initial conflict between the heroes on the accords revenge is shown when zemo wants revenge on the avengers black panther wants revenge on bucky iron man wants revenge on bucky this is what tears them apart civil war also handles its new character really well spiderman is a cool addition and makes everything more enjoyable when hes there but he is stuck there mainly for fans because spiderman is the most marketable marvel character but black panther is awesome in the movie he has his own character arc in the movie he wants revenge on bucky throughout the whole movie and does everything he can to kill him because he thinks bucky killed his father he even follows iron man because he knows bucky will be there and he wants to kill bucky then he finds out that it was actually zemo who killed his father and finds and confronts him zemo tells him about how he wanted revenge on the avengers for the death of his family when hearing this tchalla realizes that he too wanted revenge on bucky and that this desire for revenge was destructive to those with it and that by taking revenge he was no better than zemo because of this he decides to give up this desire to kill zemo in an act of revenge and says vengeance has consumed you its consuming them i am done letting it consume me justice will come soon enough civil war is a masterpiece of a movie and i definitely recommend watching it
Jun 2 2020,positive,this time taking the audience down a darker path in fact the darkest entry in the mcu completely eliminating the humor but for good reason captain america civi war or referenced to fans as avengers 25 pits captain america against iron man after they ave a disagreement over events after sokovia the action and emotion in this film are amazing and it hits all of the right notes and gives us the iconic airport sequence and new characters like spider man and black panther
Jun 2 2020,positive,better than captain america winter soldier a
May 26 2020,positive,the mcu at its finest  amazing action sequences and choreography some nice humour sprinkled throughout a pretty mature movie and an undeniably great conflict that drives the story  could not have asked for much more out of this one
May 24 2020,negative,the whole plot revolves around a guy not knowing what youtube is
May 24 2020,positive,the movie around it is great but that airport scene is something else
May 23 2020,positive,this movie is my most favorite in the marvel cinematic universe aside from endgame  before captain americas character was slightly ignorable until he got the winter soldier movie which really emphasizes his character this movie really emphasizes his character more deeper as working out the relationship between his coworkers the movie is jam packed with everything the action sequence which is greatly choreograph makes audience really attached to it there is drama love story politics war and everything   it saved the whole cinematic universe and make captain america great again
May 23 2020,positive,look this is a monstrosity of a feat for the comic book genre this one is the one that did every single thing right a tour de force full of drama family friends politics and ultimately proved to be about what position does one take on riding the fine line between individual choice and being regulated because of little accountability of human loss of life  the best film made by the endlessly epic mcu and a damn near masterpiece that will have you your family and your friends jumping from side to side back and forth on these greater complex questions this film takes the risk to dare and tackle
May 16 2020,positive,4th best mcu movie it shouldve won an award for best special affects stunts acting antagonist and best plot
May 9 2020,positive,captain america civil war was a pretty great marvel film  this movie was action packed with great story telling and in this film they were some serious consequences for the main characters in the film  i really liked this film on how they introduced spiderman and black panther into the mcu  but the comic book version of civil war was way better than the  film 
May 7 2020,positive,this is a fun film when you see it for the first time the more you watch it the more it will lose its touch evans and downey jr are some really strong points in this one it is better then most the mcu and could be in the top 10
Apr 26 2020,positive,the perfect end to one of the mcus most consequential arcs civil wars narratives and political play were especially outstanding matching in comparison to its detailed action sequences
Apr 26 2020,positive,an audience warranting and crowdpleasing if not always coherent and uniquely dramatic action packed installment in the mcu that not only splits its characters but also the audience
Apr 25 2020,positive,amazinggreat introduction to many heroes and very climatic
Apr 24 2020,positive,well um i liked it mainly the action scenes and the breathtaking suspense i would have liked it better if helmut zemo were more like his normal self and crossbones didnt die so early in the movie i really enjoyed the highway scene and the airport scene but this movie is nothing like the civil war i know many differences scarlet witch instead of the new warriors crossbones instead of a bunch of really powerful villains a school doesnt blow up the fantastic four and xmen are absent spiderman doesnt betray iron man captain america doesnt get assassinated after the civil war i loved the introduction of spiderman to the mcu but they could have introduced black panther to the mcu differently but i liked him being there for the civil war i liked the story and it was interesting what they did with winter soldier also hawkeye finally had a costume that looked good on him in movies so yeah good movie just a few flaws
Apr 24 2020,positive,save the best for last that exactly what the captain america films did just when i thought nothing could top winter soldier marvel proved me wrong even after rewatching this film years later i still get excited to see the introduction of guys like spiderman and black panther this movie isnt a traditional super hero movie and thats what makes it great
Apr 24 2020,positive,best mcu movie by far  almost feels like another avengers movie  awesome  also loved tom holland as spiderman  very funny  very compelling story  must watch
Apr 23 2020,positive,such a great dynamic with iron man and captain america facing off but the introduction with spider man and black panther and the battle at the airport is one of the best scenes in the mcu
Apr 20 2020,positive,despite not living to the promise of the original comic civil war is an exciting action spectacle featuring the clash of different morals and plenty of character development along with political thriller vibes and a compelling story its also the perfect introduction of black panther and spiderman to the mcu
Apr 19 2020,positive,amazing film i love the conflicts between tony and steve the action sequences were great i love how they introduced spiderman i am glad they brought in ant man and hawkeye into it it was great even though this film is like avengers 25 but i still love this film
Apr 15 2020,neutral,overated not even a captin america film more like avengers 3
Apr 13 2020,positive,this superhero movie was very good the ensemble cast of this movie did a spectacular job in this movie the plot to the movie was actionpacked and thrilling theres even a shocking twist that occurs near the end your mind will be blown when you see this movie if you havent seen this movie yet i suggest that you check it out immediately its a definite must see
Mar 27 2020,positive,now thats what i call a good captain america movie or at least a team captain vs team iron movie anyway i love the unique screenplay the battles especially iron man and captain america the introduction of spiderman finally and the direction of the russo brothers overall civil war manage to show us that not every superhero would agree with one another the only way to settle their differences is to fight one on one
Mar 25 2020,positive,i absolutely love this movie it is so fun to watch and it has one of my favorite scenes in the whole mcu it is when spiderman swoops in and takes caps shield that scene is so fun to watch and it just is so cool when we see spiderman for the first time in my opinion this isnt really a captain america movie it is really an avengers 25 more than a captain america movie i honestly think this has rdjs best performance in the mcu and this movie has some pretty good performances    i think this movie has some of the best action scenes in the whole mcu and it has some of the best choreography too the sound design is very good with all of the sound effects like spidermans webs iron mans repulsors and the jets sound so good like i said before this movie has some of the best performances in the whole mcu and i think this has rdjs best performance in the whole mcu the cgi and the deaging in the movie is very good but some people dont like the floating head from iron mans suit in reality if you were wearing an iron suit it would most likely resemble that of iron mans the score elevates the whole movie and the airport scene is one of the coolest in the whole mcu with the score in it and all of the mcu movies have some of the scores of all time in my opinion this really is just choosing a side and sticking with it i know that i am on iron mans side and i just wanted to keep him winning and winning and if i was on caps side i would want the same thing they do have some twists i would have never seen coming which i was nervous because i thought i might have been predictable but thankfully it wasnt like i said in the previous mcu reviews it is so cool to see what he will accomplish and become later in his life like i said before i just wanted iron man to keep winning and pushing forward and i was on the edge of my seat because of the twists and the things they throw at you and i wanted to see him keep pushing and i kinda wanted cap to lose and the incredible adapted from the comic from what i have heard they changed a few things but i heard they adapted it well in the end nobody really wins overall i absolutely love this movie and would recommend it to anyone  
Mar 21 2020,positive,easily the best captain america movie
Mar 16 2020,positive,i was surprised to see black panther showing up in this bunch of the fights in this were awesome like black panther going after bucky avengers fighting with bucky after getting hypnotized and all of the avengers excluding some fighting each other the ending was pretty good enjoyed every minute of this movie worth the watch
Feb 22 2020,positive,heroes vs heroes was something ive always wanted to see on the big screen just for the sake of curiosity you know and i finally got to thanks to civil war it has a pretty solid story good action scenes and etc the usual marvel stuff never perfect but still good enough for everyone
Feb 21 2020,positive,one word bucky he is the star of this movie no doubt about it the way sebastian stan plays the character is phenomenal making you genuinely believe that this guy is suffering emotionally that his mind is confused and torn but other than james buchanan barnes the other characters were stellar as well steve and tony are at their very best in this one two best friends forced to fight each other natasha is alright  she didnt do too much i loved rhodey in this one more than any of his other appearances vision was fun wanda was very cool zemo was an excellent villain not someone you would expect which made it all the better the airport fight was ok it was definitely the weakest action set of them all but it was still a good fight overall a solid movie with a solid plot but bucky really took it to the next level
Feb 20 2020,positive,captain america civil war is a movie that shows that even the mightiest heroes can fall and turn against each other with the main conflict being between tony stark steve rogers and bucky aka the winter soldier this is a very solid movie the only problem i have with it is the fact that the movie carries on too much
Feb 18 2020,positive,since when does a superhero flick have a better third act than first since civil war part postwatergate thriller part postbourne globetrotting actioner slick dialogue sick action some smart retconning and remodelling and a smattering of excellent ideas the concentrated focused tone and influences and the cleverly designed superhero moments make for a memorable and nailbiting superflick    remember that first time you saw a marvel movie and you loved it that very special marvel movie that you came out of the cinema thinking thats what these connected colourful gripping comic properties should be full of injokes and great surprises and genuine humour  civil war wipes the floor with that  fully succeeds at making a cap centric story that has some amazing character introductions exchanges and is focussed on paying off so many threads from previous marvel films in a way ultron wishes it could  it appeases the adult in me by providing rich dialogue completely balanced nonarchetypal politics and stunning modern action sequences each one with three or four gags at least that makes smart individual use of the characters skills involved  caps third instalment simultaneously managed to also appeal to the child in me by providing many surprising earned comic book moments full of wonder and integrated very organically and very differently to the clusterfuck that was ultron  i genuinely cheered and exclaimed in wonder or surprise or shock and thats a testament to the skill nerdy smarts and talents of the russos and their team making cap a sympathetic emotional very unamerican hero  yes you do have to have seen the other mcu properties to appreciate this movie but even without all the comic bookiness it succeeds as a taught family thriller brothers versus brothers genuine globetrotting nice use of location cards thrilling clever riveting twisty movie that takes winter soldier throws everything bad about it out tosses in everything that made iron man great and closes off so many threads in a sensitive spiralling ingenious way that you cant help but go along for the ride and come out grinning  i wont whisper in your ear about how great it is the way you could palpably hear a ripple of boyfriends in the cinema explaining who this or that is in the mcu when they appeared but instead i will shout from the rooftops how great this movie is  because if the mcu is more like this then it isnt a colossal cheeky cashgrab it can sometimes meet the lofty heights of an affective reflective relevant piece of art
Feb 17 2020,positive,man oh man i cant grasp just how brilliant this movie is it adapts a famous comic book storyline but just builds upon the source material instead of just adapting it word for word some of the most enlightened debates ive ever had was about team tony or team cap and both sides have valid arguments thats what makes this movie so genius and so thoughtprovoking highlighting real world issues like government control over freedom i just really love this film
Feb 15 2020,positive,another incredible movie from the russo brothers with some of the best action from the entire mcu especially the airport scene the emotions are huge and the actors give some of their strongest performances you can tell why each character chose which side and you can resonate with both sides no matter who you prefer the only thing that holds it back is the villain who gets incredibly lucky in his plans rather than actually being cunning and clever
Feb 15 2020,positive,i just mostly dont feel anything after watching big superhero movies and i dont get the purpose in them and all they do is set up another one so you have to watch it its just plain
Feb 13 2020,positive,the conflict between heroes was just very sweet marvel succeeds over and over again in delivering great movies
Feb 10 2020,positive,excellent movie nice story telling fabulous character introductions hard hitting action pieces
Feb 7 2020,positive,by far the best captain america movie it is fun in every way
Feb 7 2020,positive,this is a true masterpiece the grounded nature to the hyper action scene and best introduction of spiderman and black panther this the by far the best crossover event the whole comic book film making industry have came up
Feb 7 2020,positive,considering the movie was a reactionary response to wbs batman v superman it did exceptionally well i would never call it exceptional but it served as a course correction of mcu after the inultingly awful age of ultron and aside from typical mcu problems like unfunny one liner jokes and terribly weak villain its worth checking out
Feb 6 2020,positive,a valuable addition to the marvel cinematic universe civil war brings us a believable approach to tony starks character as he wrestles with personal conflict
Feb 6 2020,positive,the best movie ever wow
Feb 6 2020,positive,another great film in the mcu
Jan 27 2020,positive,really enjoyed this film was cool to see what ultron started to be followed through 
Jan 26 2020,positive,epic fight scenes rdj and chris evans on point as always only thing stopping it from 5 stars is problems with the story and how we got to the climax    rating 8910 445 stars rounds to 45 stars
Jan 26 2020,negative,pathetic in all ways so boring and cgi is also boring made me want to puke watching
Jan 24 2020,positive,moreorless the good version of batman v superman  its surprising how similar civil war and bvs really are  both films attempt a realistic superhero story but stray a little too far into a cnnlike political debate  however civil war works where bvs didnt for several reasons its themes are treated with more intelligence its technical execution is far superior and because the audience already has an attachment to both captain america and iron man the conflict between the two heroes holds much greater weight
Jan 11 2020,positive,great movie very well crafted and it is an awesome thrilleractiondrama at the same time characters decisions are likable and understandable absolutely do not miss this one
Jan 11 2020,positive,these movies never disappoint
Jan 9 2020,positive,this is a movie that has a conflict that doesnt seem too forced it makes sense that these characters would be divided into separate teams it contains the enormity of an avengers movie and much emotion
Jan 7 2020,positive,the movie was great and black panther was way better and more logically presented in this movie compared to his own movie which says a lot about how this movie managed individual characters it knew how and where to put the spotlight in every moment of the movie
Jan 6 2020,neutral,overly political and clustered with so much going on and a lackluster villain with an unclear plan giving the captain america trilogy a mediocre ending and the mcu a boring movie 510
Dec 31 2019,positive,not true to the comics at all but otherwise a decent film
Dec 31 2019,positive,highly political really serious plot spiderman is so awesome
Dec 31 2019,positive,i was only peripherally aware of the single super hero marvel titles when they came out but this is an avengers movie not just captain america  there are voices of conscience on all sides  complicated issues and real consequences  i highly recommend this movie
Dec 28 2019,positive,great film that nearly split the fan base in two like a civil war thought provoking and a great introduction to characters in this next wave of the mcu
Dec 27 2019,positive,perfect movie imho  issues of today presented thru film
Dec 26 2019,positive,a massive scale superhero movie with challenging morals and awesome action
Dec 24 2019,positive,incredible action packed screenplay fantastic movie in captain america trilogy absolutely amazing movie
Dec 24 2019,positive,this is the weakest of the captain america movies the cpt was still cool but the villain and iron man were weak links here its a good flick it just didnt deliver the suspense or feels that the other captain america films did black widow was the character i felt the most for spiderman and antman were nice additions they delivered most of the wows and levity glad they made it in
Dec 23 2019,positive,ive been talked into trying more marvel dc etc movies and was told from a loyal marvel fan to start with this one  besides black panther rating appears earlier in this list i havent watched a marvel movie since the amazing spiderman 2012 however it looks like ill be watching more of these movies from now on civil war lacked the eyeroll moments i loathe in blockbustery movies ok there was one from a jeremy renner oneliner but ill let it slide the action scenes were entertaining the banter was fun and the plot made more sense to me  and was more satisfying  as i realized the villains motive although he wasnt a major character paul rudd was peak paul rudd biggest criticism was elizabeth olsons eastern european i think accent
Dec 22 2019,negative,civil war tries to replicate a similar feel to both winter soldier and an avengers movie but it just doesnt work tony starkiron man seems extremely out of character and the conflict between him cap and bucky feels extremely forced
Dec 21 2019,positive,some major plot wholes but overall good
Dec 21 2019,positive,take the winter soldier and avengers mix the two together and bake to perfection and you get this great movie the unique take on heroes vs heroes with both sides justifiable was well executed
Dec 20 2019,positive,captain america and iron man along with some new faces in the mcu make this film an emotionally riveting experience great fight scenes and unique direction for the avengers team
Dec 20 2019,positive,it sounds kind of unrealistic but they actually crafted a perfect emotionally resonant reason to pit two of marvels biggest superheroes against one another a
Dec 20 2019,positive,very good movie tying in lots of characters and still proving to be extremely entertaining
Dec 19 2019,positive,the real avengers 2 setting the plot and the bar for every marvel movie to come after it
Dec 19 2019,positive,this film showcased the very best of the mcu the character building and emotional drama portrayed by the russo brothers shows why they were given the biggest mcu movies  it has everything you could wish for in an mcu movie the humour and drama are intwined and balanced perfectly to avoid the dramatic beats from feeling unsubstantial  the introduction of black panther and spiderman in this movie is also handled excellently with each character getting their big moment  the only weakness in this film was the villain they couldve removed him completely and with some slight adaptations made this story even better  it is one the best in the mcu and sets up phase 3 perfectly
Dec 18 2019,negative,i mean  if you want to see a hero rightfully blamed by a mother for getting her son killed then watch how the hero gives no fks and runs off the following day to bribe an underage high schooler into fighting historys most deadly schizophrenic assassin then this movie is the one for you      if you enjoy watching deeply emotional developments as a heros father is murdered in a bombing and to have that scene complemented with a 20 or so minute play fight between all the heroes as the camera jumps from one pairing to the next as they exchange blows and crack the lamest one liners of all time into the camera while smirking hey we havnt met yet my names green arrow whats yours  then ermm go for it i guess           if you want to watch the all powerful vision wield one of the mighty infinity stones so effectively that he accidently snipes his human mate in a flying metal suit out of the air with a laser and is then for some reason surprised when it nearly kills him  urghhhh just dont bother with this film its not worth it the franchise is not worth it
Dec 18 2019,positive,apparently people hate this movie but not to be rude but how
Dec 18 2019,positive,captain america civil war is one of the best movies of all time it has a incredible story the action especially the airport and final battle are amazing zemo is such a great villain for this story and it is one of the best mcu movies
Dec 17 2019,positive,if age of ultron failed to keep up with the first avengers civil war knew how to bring fun and the beginning of disagreements in the teamthe addition of the black panther and the combat at the airport satisfy the comics audience so much for those who have met the characters through the movies
Dec 16 2019,positive,tonys reason for the avengers signing the sokovia accords was harsh but it made some sense the heroes need to be kept in check to better ensure the safety of many innocent lives
Dec 16 2019,positive,civil war was an actionpacked film and had lots of brilliant memorable dialogues that marvel enthusiasts can obsess over until the following flick comes alongside
Dec 16 2019,positive,capt america for the win no offense for teamironman but steve rogers just made the movie so good now i want to have capt america as a friend to always have my back
Dec 16 2019,positive,oh yeah seeing antman turned into a giant almost made me lose my mind this is what i am paying for movies  these moments right here
Dec 16 2019,positive,i love this one from vision our very strength incites challenge challenge incites conflict and conflict breeds catastrophe the sokovia accords might be a bit overboard but he made a legit point
Dec 15 2019,positive,this battle between marvels finest superheroes left me hanging on the edge of my seat it was a great one seeing how friends had to choose which side will they choose and to fight for what they believe is right
Dec 15 2019,positive,spiderman and black panthers introduction to this movie made it a whole lot better and we can expect that that is a foreshadow for their upcoming movies too
Dec 15 2019,positive,civil war is just like the prequel for the infinity war where a lot of marvels heroes are showcased more hyped to see what will happen after the avengers were disbanded
Dec 15 2019,positive,friendship or the world capt america proves that being a friend means that even if the entire world is against you he will be there with you till the end
Dec 11 2019,positive,hands down the best captain america movie captain america civil war has everything you could want in a superhero blockbuster and its truly epic from start to finish as close to perfection as you can get
Dec 2 2019,positive,top 5 mcu for sure this movie perfectly illustrates how when two friends have different viewpoints it can drive a wedge into their friendship and cause in the words of vision catastrophe chris evans and robert downey jr as usual are phenomenal in this movie their performances are charismatic but at the same time you are convinced that there is conflict between these two friends this movie also gave a great introduction to mcu newcomers at the time black panther and of course spiderman the last throwdown at the airport was awesome though since then that throwdown has gone down in the rankings zemo was a great villain mostly because you could understand where the guy was coming from after the events of age of ultron overall this is a amazing mcu movie
Dec 2 2019,positive,the height of the mcu a perfect superhero film
Nov 28 2019,positive,thats it it is not terrible but i think it can go even further too confusing not funny captain americas reason is childish and i think it is just a showcase of special moves
Nov 28 2019,positive,i might give this movie an a rating it is a great film and i thoroughly enjoyed it thumbs up
Nov 28 2019,positive,both the mental and internal conflicts for this movie were so great after the events of age of ultron this pushed for the amendment of the law which was the catalyst for the splitting of the avengers into two simply amazing
Nov 28 2019,positive,at the end of the day captain america civil war is a movie about friendship and vengeance and how these two things split the avengers into 2 groups and forced all the superheroes to make a choice on whom to fight for
Nov 28 2019,positive,kudos to the russo brothers for making a great marvel movie again amazing choreography fight scenes chase scenes and great stunt work
Nov 28 2019,positive,marvel did it again captain america civil war is a thrilling actionpacked marvel movie that will surely entertain you through and through the mcu became more tense because of the plot of the movie and loyalty and friendship were put into jeopardy and this one fractured the team to 2 sides
Nov 28 2019,positive,i was loving every second of it fascinating action scenes and it all came down to the point where all the marvels heroes must fight to prove a point all i can say is that i enjoyed the movie and will definitely watch it again
Nov 27 2019,positive,a truly spectacular movie 1010 story paired with great acting from the cast alongside the introduction of new superheroes made the experience worthwhile i am so excited about what the next phase of the upcoming mcu films has to offer
Nov 27 2019,positive,im on team iron man on this one capt americas reason for me was a bit childish at least impressive fights and with this one the superheroes were forced to make choices and choose which team would they fight for
Nov 27 2019,positive,captain america vs iron man setting 2 of marvels greatest heroes against each other was truly the fight of the century now that is an actionpacked superhero movie
Nov 26 2019,positive,possibly the best mcu movie ever
Nov 20 2019,positive,the last third of the movie is actually great but the first two halves are just action scene after action scenes
Nov 17 2019,positive,this movie was awesome i loved the airport fight scene and almost everything else about it team iron man
Nov 7 2019,positive,captain america civil war is storytelling at its best
Nov 6 2019,positive,with so many characters the russos held the film together quite masterfully without making it lose the plot
Nov 5 2019,positive,just like the comic fantastic simply one of mcu best films
Nov 5 2019,negative,this movie sucked poorly acted poor dialogue poor events poor plot literally everything about this sucked ass and just tugged at celebrity strings one of the worst superhero movies ive ever seen anyone who gives this movie more than a 2 star rating is absolutely full of barf
Nov 1 2019,positive,consistently rated as one of the best movies in the mcu it diverts from the original marvel comic civil war but it is similar in the general concept of superheroes being required to register to the government eventually this creates conflict between iron man and captain america to wedge that conflict captain americas best friend is being framed for murder of the king of wakanda this catapults a series of marvel superheroes to fight against each other resulting in one of the best superhero movies created
Oct 20 2019,positive,this movie is great a good watch
Oct 18 2019,positive,honestly i did not expect the film from marvel to be so good all the positive reviews about him turned out to be true and i even liked his only minus the drawback of the first half of the film i liked he lets the movie swing    the russo brothers really can and now they have proved it im glad that joss whedon left the studio and now they will be the ones who will shoot the next avengers  its much better for them they were able to do in the film about captain america what whedon could not do in the age of ultron  they assembled a huge team of heroes both old and new and managed to give out an unmixed mess from events where storylines and sometimes even the characters themselves are lost  and a measured and consistent drama where everything is arranged on the shelves and every little thing is visible    by the way they trained to shoot the avengers clearly on this film since it certainly is not about captain america this is really just another avengers only without thor and the hulk but with a handful of new heroes    and to the topic of characters the ant was nice to see tchalla is damn good and spiderman turned out to be a berry on the cake how cool he is this is the best spiderman of all that was on the screen before him the perfect peter parker i even applauded as soon as he appeared in the frame i liked the previous spiderman and i regretted that they covered him but now i realized how wrong i was and yes the age of tom holland is one hundred percent hit still better than marvel no one knows how to film their own characters    it was also pleasant to watch the development of the characters introduced in the age of ultron    the villain was also worthy baron zemo is not a typical villain like the whole movie for marvel it will not disappear from your head as soon as you leave the hall and most likely will remind yourself of yourself in other films    true the secondary villain krosbones who was stupidly leaked at the very beginning gave the best hope by the way he laughed out loud when he took off his mask under which was his other mask just like deadpool but with the only difference being that this moment was conceived as serious    martin freeman who literally flashed a couple of times wanted much more especially after he was vividly announced about his participation in the film    the only negative that i would note is the ambiguous and almost open ending usually i like this but here a similar denouement seemed inappropriate to me i would still like to know what in the end happened with the avengers or at least with the heroes themselves after everything that happened this question remains unanswered    another such question was where did nick fury go thor in asgard the hulk is there with him as stated but what is the excuse for the oneeyed leader moreover everything that happens it seems is directly related to him  its his avengers i think he would deal with quarreling children    in general i liked the picture how i like few films from marvel in addition to the guardians of the galaxy at least not a single such impression was made yet hope to see more of these superhero movies
Oct 13 2019,positive,a well thought out film with some great action scenes so many great performances
Oct 7 2019,positive,i like this movies dark tone and it follows the story of winter soldier well the fight does not have enough consequences and the movie does not need a villain but it still has a bad villain but it is still super good the conflict between tony and steve is good and spiderman is awesome
Oct 7 2019,positive,if the last good guys fight each other movie left a bad taste in your mouth bvs then this movie will refresh it for you once again marvel studios prove that no matter how big they go they can always make it work terrific directing action acting and story makes this movie one of the best in the entire mcu 910
Oct 6 2019,positive,phenomenal film that depicts the destruction of a universe with a great induction for the black panther
Oct 6 2019,negative,the story that broke marvel on the big screen the bad guy sucks but we get spiderman
Oct 5 2019,positive,an awesome vs movie with a few low points and an amazing 3rd act
Sep 30 2019,positive,captain americacivil war is a fine example of what the russo brothers are capable of but still bringing in to the silver screen the comic that saved marvel comics in the begininng of the century from bankrupt with a massive number of super heroes fighting for their side is something fenomenal yet here we saw in my opinion very few heroes battling each other no fault on this is on the russo brothers just a movie too soon of its time but in the other hand the introduction of the sokovia accords has the main reason that the team separated is a interesting new point of view
Sep 30 2019,positive,i was starting to pick up on the marvel formula saw the trailer and went ok cool i think i got this and it was enjoyable enough until i had everything i had been predicting turned on its head in a truly satisfying way still in my top 3 mcu movies to this day to have a division so well written that you can understand and empathize with both sides funny in the right places serious when it needs it was hard to believe the mcu could be fresh after so many movies and this looked like a cash grab but i was happy to be wrong left the cinema like a kid excited to talk to my friends about this
Sep 30 2019,positive,captain americacivil is one of the mcu with a big consequence that divides two heroes and to form teams to fight each other  with lots of great fight scenes and whole lot of excitement going on the void and introducing new heroes like black panther and spiderman this is a must see film
Sep 28 2019,positive,basically an avengers film with internal conflict was nice to see a film in the series that tried something a little different raised the stakes  rdj stole the show again chris evans is a very close second nice bland of comedy mixed in with a serious undertone that made the movie just so happy cap did squash spiderman like a bug at the airport very lucky he was able to catch that thing at the airport 
Sep 26 2019,positive,awesome movie better than batman vs superman
Sep 25 2019,positive,it is one of marvels best cinematic perspectives and a great window to bring marvells visions
Sep 25 2019,positive,somewhat based on the comic series they did a pretty job given what they had to work with and the limitations that they were confronted with one of the best mcu films with the addition of some philosophical issues for the viewer to ponder
Sep 21 2019,negative,this film was absolute garbage the worst marvel film made so far stan lee would turn in his grave if he knew how bad hollywood did this film really poor film read the comics instead and you wont be disappointed  ps if you want to save some time go and watch something with a bit of backbone like spiderman captain marvel etc
Sep 18 2019,positive,this is a very nice movie even if they should have called it avengers civil war or simply civil war since all avengers characters appear on screen
Sep 15 2019,positive,scarlett witch and visión sucks
Sep 11 2019,positive,captain america civil war is one of the only marvel films that has a dark serious tone and i like it  civil war is my favorite mcu film
Sep 11 2019,positive,the perfect comic book movie
Sep 10 2019,positive,favorite of the series
Sep 10 2019,positive,its got everything going for it one outstanding way to set up next avengers movie
Sep 9 2019,positive,i loved this movie because just all the heros coming together and duking it out in one of the best battle scenes ive ever seen this also had a very understandable vilian 
Aug 28 2019,positive,a good take on the civil war story but it should be called iron man vs captain america
Aug 27 2019,positive,its always interesting to see why your favourite heroes would fight  and here the motivations are very clear and understandable unlike other movies looking at you bvs one of the better mcu movies
Aug 27 2019,negative,one big cluster duck  that you cant follow if you arent a hardcore mcu fan that knows all about the movies universe
Aug 25 2019,positive,one of the best marvel movie
Aug 24 2019,positive,captain america civil war begins the next wave of marvel movies with an actionpacked superhero blockbuster boasting a decidedly noncartoonish plot and the courage to explore thoughtprovoking themes
Aug 24 2019,positive,it may initially seem like avengers 25 but captain america civil war is able to focus on steve rogers and his ensemble of characters as well as the avengers additionally the film successfully introduces black panther and spiderman into the mcu and gives them both enough screen time to make them satisfying the intriguing villain and intense final battle also help out in crafting the perfect ending to captain americas standalone trilogy
Aug 23 2019,positive,better than i could have hoped batman v superman cant even tell us why two people are fighting but here we know exactly why each of the 12 people are fighting this movie the the biggest slap in the face to zack snyder simply by being excellent
Aug 18 2019,positive,a brilliant masterpiece that takes itself seriously in all of the necessary places and still manages to implement the desired banter that is expected from films like those in the mcu acting is impeccable and is delivered exceptionally real prominent example in my opinion is buckys conflicted persona being so well executed action is utilized strongly and in the appropriate scenes and is produced as well as an ample source of climax airport scene 9610 with its only issue being perhaps an overindulgence in politics 
Aug 18 2019,positive,my only problem with this movie is that it pains me to see my favorite heroes stand against one another    spidermans as well as black panthers introduction especially were amazing
Aug 18 2019,positive,captain america civil war is pretty much non stop action fun and quippy dialogue in the battle royale we see many marvel characters weve met or have been anticipating come together for either team captain america or team iron man although all the introductions and storylines are maybe a bit much i do love that this film shows the ethical challenges of superheroes  all the lives lost in pursuit of saving the world but its hard to take seriously the ferocity of the fight amongst friends 
Aug 11 2019,negative,civil war is a debacle its a long advertisement for future sequels theres not really a bad guy the heroes dont team up for the greater good 
Aug 6 2019,positive,this mish mash of superhero vs superhero works on every level the mcu at its best 
Aug 3 2019,negative,the editingcgi and camera work was incredible i just couldnt enjoy the story it was a fight scene and then a fight scene and then a fight scene and then a fight scene ive seen that a million times i was hoping for something different it was made well i just prefer story line to anything else 
Jul 27 2019,positive,sets up some interesting character dramas for the mcu heroes entertaining but will it be a memorable film twenty years from now
Jul 21 2019,positive,with this film they nailed the action scenes and showed an incredible path of how hard and emotional it is to be a superhero with the cast it made this film a lot better 
Jul 20 2019,positive,this movie is so much fun  while there is not a whole lot of action for a marvel movie the story more than compensates for that  this is the best captain america movie yet and i loved everything to do with buck  this is just a great movie
Jul 17 2019,positive,the captain america trilogy ends on a high note in the superbly acted superhero blockbuster that pits our favorite heroes against one another while some may complain that there are no stakes there is no denying the emotional sequence between cap iron man and bucky that will have you cheering and crying at the same time a fantastic script and some wonderful direction also give the story a grounded feeling and with newcomers chadwick boseman and tom holland in there mcu debut stealing the screen from their veteran counterparts this is sure to be a film that will thrill all ages
Jul 15 2019,positive,this movie is amazing in every way possible
Jul 14 2019,positive,best marvel films of 2016
Jul 14 2019,negative,its really force it made a movie for chris evans who doesnt give a best movie for mcu
Jul 10 2019,positive,this movie has one of the greatest stories in cinema history and it takes the characters that we really came to love over the years and pits them against each other this movie is action packed and emotionally gripping 1010
Jul 9 2019,positive,superhero battle royale time the verses movie thats heavy in pure action many scene stealing performances and cameos of new and familiar heros to mcu canon captain america  civil war is agruable in any conversation for the best blockbuster of the 21st century and one of the greatest superhero movies of all time  anthony and joe russo dont know what a sophomore slump is in their second mcu action movieconflicting philosophies over westphalia politics pull the avengers apart for the best choreographed  action sequences in marvel studios movies to date the culmination of 8 years of marvel studios and the start of phase 3 with a bang 
Jul 8 2019,positive,this movie blew me back to the 80s i absolutely loved this movie it is the best comic book movie to date absolutely amazing i definitely 100 recommend it an this absofuckinglutely gets an a
Jul 8 2019,positive,the russo brothers are back at it again with nonstop action a well written plot and dialogue and a surprising or two new appearance to the mcu
Jul 7 2019,positive,concept and plot makes a lot of sense russo bros know how to direct great marvel films pacing is great and didnt feel like 2 and 12 hours movie adds a lot of tension and controversy which is a good twist in the mcu
Jul 7 2019,positive,loved this great twist but this was as much an iron man movie as it was a captain america movie 
Jul 5 2019,positive,is this really a captain america movie anymore  i mean it has his name but lets not pretend like we dont know this is avengers 25  in fact this really should have been avengers 2  yeah the story would have had to been restructured since the conflict stems from ultron and sokovia but it could have worked  onto the review though  the conflict in here is extremely welldone looking at you batman v superman and you really have trouble choosing a side until you get to the end of the movie  then you clearly see who is acting off of emotion and who has a level head  even then though there is no right way to go here  both sides are well done and they provide endless discussion for fans even after 3 years since its release  everyone gets to have a part to play here and the airport battle will hold up as one of the best action scenes for years to come  
Jul 5 2019,positive,funny has some decent twists but has no stakes because nobody dies
Jul 3 2019,positive,probably one of my favs from the mcu 
Jul 3 2019,positive,although its technically a captain america movie we should really all be calling this an avengers movie the conflict in this is fantasticyou can really see where both iron man and captain america are coming from neither of them is wrongt they just have different views of how superheroes should be held accountable for their actions the breakup of the avengers the forming of the two teams and the ultimate fight between them are beautifully done as we can see just why each character picks the side heshe does the final scenes of the movie may just be the best though as it is by far one of the most emotional we ever see in the mcuan excellent addition to the superhero universe
Jul 2 2019,positive,a fun movie with lots of action sequences 
Jul 1 2019,positive,on its own civil war is an exciting actionthriller the themes it tackles manage to be just heavy enough that you can feel the weight without being too heady or challenging to more casual audiences 
Jun 29 2019,positive,great story with an amazing cast of bringing these superheros together
Jun 28 2019,positive,this movie is actionpacked funny at times and a real crowd pleaser it was a nice addition to the library of films and even one of the best ones
Jun 25 2019,positive,watch this movie with a large group of friends that will get you a great movie and a fight over what team will win
Jun 20 2019,positive,an oppressive tone cant keep down an otherwise deeply engaging and suspenseful character drama 
Jun 18 2019,positive,a brilliant and actionpacked conclusion to the captain america trilogy combined with the russo bros direction markus and mcfeelys script the performances of the cast jackmans score opalochs cinematography ford and schmidts editing patersons production design reisss set decoration makovskys costume design action sequences and visual effects civil war ends this trilogy by dividing the heroes and does so in a brilliant way
Jun 12 2019,positive,one of my favorite movies in the mcu it has all my favorite heros and its even interesting if you dont know the full backstory
Jun 10 2019,positive,great movie with some iconic scenes and a great but not perfect story i think its rating is perfect
Jun 7 2019,positive,second fav movie of all time dont even know how to begin this movie is unbelievably well made this is my favourite comic book storyline in my opinion and it has a special place in my heart in its translation to the screen 55 2nd fav mcu film and movie of all time
Jun 4 2019,positive, spoilers ahead                 the dialogue is outstanding even fuller of subtext than usual and stunning action sequences like the airport fight carried by the charm of the newly introduced peter parker and ant man but the plot is still a little thin    the framing of bucky and starks parents death seems so temporary the true argument between captain america and iron man about supervision seems mature for the marvel movies but still doesnt reach the depth of the fundamental moral divide between professor x and magneto
Jun 3 2019,positive,setting up a great future for the mcu this is the end of the avengers as a team but captain america civil war delivers an emotional ending with action packed scenes
Jun 3 2019,positive,captain america civil war is spectacular exciting and tons of funand spiderman rocks
Jun 2 2019,positive,what an awesome movie steve rogers is a man who stands for what he believes in and sticking by promises made to friends back in the 1940s is one of those things as a result new friends become enemies and battle lines are drawn all three captain america movies have been enormously entertaining if the comics could bottle this stuff cap would be a best seller all the time loved seeing spiderman enter this universe this movie is gold
Jun 2 2019,positive,an amazing movie it really shows the human side of the heroes and shows that the world is affected by their choices yes they may be heroes but they still affects the lives of regular people around them and that really was brought i to the light with this movie as they fight over important moral issues
May 31 2019,positive,it is my favorite movie
May 29 2019,positive,in my opinion this is the best captain america movie the action is really good but the story its meh in my opinion
May 28 2019,positive,this movie was really good the fight scene at the end is epic top 5 mcu movie
May 26 2019,positive,civil war is my favorite in the capitan america trilogy it has a better story more grief and dark tone and most importantly tony stark in it  i would say that is almost a more human version of the avengers and by more human i mean without gods and aliens and it is also a nice introduction of new characters
May 26 2019,positive,civil war is a movie packed full of emotion the motives for stark and rogers are very good and help us have an interesting battle for which side we want the movie delivers on action in every single way the final fight between cap and tony is so great and you can tell that they have both been through a lot zemo is a great villain with great motives sure his plan requires a lot of luck and chance but he is a perfect behind the screen villain well tony is actually pictured as the antagonist in the movie have i mentioned that i love the accords yet the accords are a perfect thing to get this whole thing started jeremy renner chadwick boseman are all excellent in this movie the directing is absolutely perfect and the introduction of black panther and spiderman was so good i absolutely loved this movie but it does become a little bit long at times that and convenient plot points hold it back slightly also have i mentioned how perfect chris evans and robert downey jr were these are the best movies not named avengers endgame they have been in yet unbelievably good movie but just a little long and convenient  9410
May 26 2019,positive,fun action packed iconic and overall amazing captain america civil war is probably one of the most deep movies the mcu has ever made as it highlights how a successful team full of very different people can have internal conflicts that we have seen earlier in previous movies all in all loved the movie
May 26 2019,positive,3 words watch it now
May 20 2019,positive,the concept of the movie is great the airport fight scene is absolutely incredible captain america vs iron man is a battle that no one belived that it would exist the team of both sides have fan favorites my though about the movie is that it was exciting and with a ending that surprises you
May 20 2019,positive,wow  that explains plenty of avengers backstory
May 20 2019,positive,focussing on character making the action real and amends for plotholes like we have to be restrained didnt we save the city from you trying to nuke it
May 19 2019,positive,hmmm cgi is much better than the black panther
May 17 2019,positive,man this is by far the best in the avengers series so farwatching them backwards does have its advantages  you save the best for last this one excels more than just a superhero movie love it 
May 17 2019,positive,amazing movie just shows how different everyone is and tells the story we needed
May 15 2019,positive,great movie great characters one of the worst mcu villains and black panther and spiderman for the first time in mcu
May 15 2019,positive,this fil is not a captain america film its an avengers film i dont like the fact that this has every avenger with the exclusion of the hulk an d thor this movie drags as a captain america one but does phenomenal as an avengers one
May 14 2019,positive,oh my god this film is so good top 3 mcu film worth watching it  is just actionpacked dramatic definitely the best out of all captain america films
May 12 2019,positive,captain america civil war is basically avengers 25 but ill still give it a two thumbs up
May 6 2019,positive,with the simplest reason  it manages to turn out to be one of the most action packed film for 2  hours giving alot of insights towards upcoming movies being a very key movie to the whole mcu  and for a  standalone  film i like how it includes so many characters and what more fight against each other going through a whole loop to a super simple reason causing all this impact really including the ripple effect before ending it in the perfect tension and aftermath without being enemies but yet not the friendliness  add in the hype and the iron man v ca makes for the perfect movie and marketing strategy 
May 5 2019,positive,duller than my sister
May 4 2019,positive,i just love this film period
May 4 2019,negative,mediocre jokefest like the rest of the marvel movies 
May 4 2019,positive,the beauty of captain america civil war is the fact that there are no right answers to the dilemmas it brings up its all up to what kind of person you are and it encourages you to make the decisions for yourself instead of trying to be a propaganda piece not many movies do that and who knew that a captain america movie would    this is my 2nd favorite mcu movie this is one of my favorite comic book movies and is an experience to be held at the movies
May 4 2019,positive,i was very glad to see spiderman in this movie when i was expecting him to be in marvel cinematic universe than the reboot movie
May 3 2019,positive,third cap ably balances the realisticish intrigue of the last entry with the starstudded gusto of the first avengers ensemble picture the legendary airport battle is among the best climaxes in the series if only the core conflict between cap and iron man was more convincing and less contrived
May 3 2019,positive,extremely emotional and super character biased great use of misdirection awesome action
May 1 2019,neutral,really liked all the parts with tony stark really didnt like the parts where captain america and his friends were given a free pass for all the horrible things they ever did   felt very hypocritical and the russos really seemed like they didnt even notice how backwards they wrote cap   overall good viewing experience but bad writing
Apr 30 2019,positive,great movie the conflict between the friends is almost painful to see to friends fighting each other in such a context really makes you feel sorry for them and everyone else that might be getting into something they dont fully understand aka spiderman the conflict and civil war between them really sets it apart from every other movie in the franchise
Apr 28 2019,positive,i did enjoy this movie a good deal the story was well written but i was caught off guard by the character arc of the black panther characterâ he was so set on getting revenge on his fathers murderer and i was rooting for him the entire time only for him to change his mind fifteen minutes before the films end the bad guy was right in front of him and he decided to change his mind i find it difficult to see him as a true hero now a true hero commits a true hero follows his resolve im not sure how i feel about this wishywashy forgiveandforget type crap that movies have been doing lately no one cried when inigo montoya got his revenge on count rugen now thats how you tell a revenge story thats a heros journey if i ever saw one i just think the film could have handled that storyline a bit better other than that is was okay
Apr 28 2019,positive,this movie is everything that marvel should be lets start with the villain zemo phenomenal he has a motive that makes sense he is creative uses his intelligence to fight the avengers and not his strength and is shown to us not through conflict but through small snippets of his plan throughout the film the red herring plan is great and allows for the perfect conflict breaking the avengers apart is the perfect concept for marvel it creates tension between characters that will have to be overcome in the future we learn about bucky learn about tonys past and we get a massive insight into steves morals steve has already been seen doing whats right and just even if it disobeys direct orders but this time he does it not against the government but against his best friends as well this movie also provides an introduction to multiple characters that were previously either not yet seen in the mcu or had just not yet been introduced to the other characters overall it really is the emotion and story and development of tony steve and bucky that drive this film to be as good as it is
Apr 27 2019,positive,this movie is very entertaining it combines some new characters with some older ones and it makes a great film the plot is really great and this is probably one of the best movies in the mcu
Apr 27 2019,positive,captain america civil war is a full stacked action packed ride from marvel studios that never shows any slowing down
Apr 26 2019,positive,civil war is still the best captain america iron man and avengers movie all rolled into one the superheroonsuperhero action extravaganza is immaculately handled by the russo brothers gritty but wondrous directing style while still managing to hit great character beats for every hero in the huge roster at every opportunity furthermore the subtle mastermind villain and his motivation to tear the avengers apart is a smart much more impactful deviation from the usual worldending monger of superhero movies despite being a significant departure from his comic book self  but its the humanity culminating into the emotionally devastating fallout of the films third act that make it something else the personal stakes on cap and tonys sides make every punch kick and blow leading to the mcus most effective battle cut deeper than skin or bone
Apr 26 2019,positive,this movie is probably the one that works the least as a solo movie but is vital for the universe
Apr 23 2019,positive,intense entertaining epic with a history full of politics and fights between our heros civil war is undoubtedly the film with one of the darkest and most dramatic endings in the mcu
Apr 23 2019,positive,one of the best mcu movie ever pack with action you wont want to miss 
Apr 22 2019,positive,classic but serious enough to avoid plunging head deep into clichã cs like the recent mcu movies
Apr 22 2019,positive,awesome plot best marvel movie yet it had everything the whole last hour was just non stop fighting and action isnt that amazing this whole movie i really wanted captain americas side to win cause i agreed with his side way to go marvel
Apr 20 2019,positive,one of the best marvel movies story acting action sequences special effects cgi everything comes together to make it a truly cinematic experience each character belongs in this movie and the premise and the plotline is a perfect fit cannot make much improvement over this like winter soldier a tad better
Apr 20 2019,positive,one of my favorite movies
Apr 18 2019,positive,i loved iron man and cap
Apr 16 2019,positive,good movie and good chemistry between the cast awesome
Apr 15 2019,positive,while not the direct adaptation of its incredible source material civil war serves as an excellent addition to the mcu the russo brothers do an excellent job of connecting largescale action to smaller more emotional moments
Apr 14 2019,positive,one of the best mcu movies
Apr 13 2019,positive,captain america civil war is about the fact that the avengers made some serious mistakes which killed a lot of innocents so the government made up a contract which says they dont go after people on there own anymore the avengers all reacted differently which made them split up into two groups team cap and team iron man iron man is for the contract captain america is against then there is also the fact that someone is pretending to be bucky and committing crimes as bucky so iron man gets mad at bucky and captain america does everything to protect him aka there is a lot of anger is this movie    the movie started off with a fight scene which was a very cool fight scene the only thing was that it really frustrated me that the camera dude apparently couldt keep his hands any sort of still i watched the movie in imax 3d so maybe thats why it kind of bothered me in the beginning but after a while i didnt mind it at all and it just felt like you were more a part of the movie i would highly recommend watching this movie in imax 3d cuz it was great the movie was filled with fighting scenes and my favorite one was where both teams go against each other ya feel all the cool characters together thats funny cuz they werent actually together ha and there was surprisingly a lot of comedy in that battle too which i personally really enjoyed    apart from all the lovely comebacks there where some new faces as well first we got black panther who has the coolest suit but he was a bit too determent to get to bucky but once there will be more movies about him which i guess is going to happen that for sure will change and i think ill start liking him a bit more once that happens also the new spiderman hes such a kid though haha i adore tom holland as spiderman he is so funny i cant wait for more i love it i also want to take a moment to praise paul rudd because he is the coolest and he made me laugh a lot okay so i can keep talking about all the characters and i can keep going on for quite a while as well but i wont because they are all just so cool i have a lot of feelings one thing i want to say though is that i keep getting more and more frustrated about black widow im sorry i know there a probably a whole lot of fans out there but i just keep questioning why shes in the movies i mean she is a good and pretty dope fighter but thats it i most of the time felt like that about hawkeye as well but not in this movie so thats great    it was a lot like batman v superman almost the same storyline only some different characters obviously ha but i really really enjoyed it it was so entertaining and the movie ended before i even knew i really love the characters and it was fun to finally get to know more about their stories i cant wait till this continuous i already said a lot and although i could still go on for quiet a while ill stop now so yall can go watch this cool movie 
Apr 11 2019,positive,why not avengers 25 i would have given 5 stars if they had attached to the comic but hey they had more plans for the future
Apr 9 2019,positive,this ties for 1st in mcu i love this movie and have watched it many times
Apr 7 2019,positive,civil war is one of marvels best its also one of the best superhero films out there the conflict between cap and iron man explodes into the franchises most emotional confrontation their friction begins ideologically then escalates physically this film is a great example of how to turn allies into enemies even if its only temporary
Apr 2 2019,positive,one of the best mcu films along with winter soldier and infinity war
Mar 29 2019,positive,complexed and layered  ut with the usual and welcome humor and action signiture to the mcu 96
Mar 27 2019,positive,marvel flips everything on its head by turning one of their top heroes into an antagonist tony stark overcome with guilt tony wants to shift the blame anywhere else by signing the sokovia accords captain america as always follows his strong moral compass rather than his emotions and it culminates in some of the best avenger on avenger fight sequences ever delivered and if that wasnt enough just when you think our heroes are about to team up to take down the shady villain influencing events behind the scenes the truth of tonys past is laid bare and we get a climax that is purely driven by emotion well emotion and a whole lot of punching
Mar 26 2019,positive,a deadeyed moreorless exsoviet martial agent takes spiteful aim at the paragons of americas imperial war machine manipulating their characteristic egoism bloated pride and traumatic paranoia until friend turns against friend teammate against teammate both sides claiming the mantle of righteousness neither giving an inch for compromise while vague enough to be somewhat geopolitically prescient this is also a plot weve seen before wasnt this lokis plan as well to get the avengers to fight one another and tear them apart from the inside then again the narrative conflict here is really rather perfunctory and even more than the previous franchise installment the movie feels like a lynchpin for the broader marvel arc workmanlike in its forthright efficiency a workhorse for all that the film introduces brings together and moves around the board the russo bros do an apt job managing such a massive cast and monumental task making the plot keep moving if not necessarily making it emotionally moving even though cap himself ends up feeling like something of a support character in his own franchise the emotions are a bit too simple and onedimensional as if the screenplay itself had to turn superheroes into strawmen to keep proceedings coherent the plot is simultaneously too byzantine and too straightforward lacking in surprises yet full of complications the characters are a few too many their allegiances too fleetingstill the result adds up to be more than its parts especially in the spectacular crossover melee climax
Mar 23 2019,positive,if you seen avengers infinity war and asked why are cap and iron man not talking to each other well show them this spectacle of two friends turned enemies trying to kill each other
Mar 23 2019,positive,the only thing negative about this film aside from the enjoyable rollercoaster of emotions it makes mcu fans go through is that it feels more like an avengers flick than the final addition to the captain america trilogy aside from that the film allows the aggregating marvel superheroes to despite its title come together in a way that no avengers movie could
Mar 19 2019,positive,throughly satisfing not my favourite but does its job and delivered enjoyable entertainment spiderman annoys me ive never been hot on spicy but in this incarnation less especially when hes put near to the others hes a bit of hindrance for me personally
Mar 18 2019,positive,this movie is the very definition of overrated the motivations feel absurd given previous films and the tension in the movie is deflated by the fact when the heroes finally collide neither is really trying to harm the other  too much is played for laughs although the marvel cinematic universe introduction to spiderman is well done
Mar 17 2019,positive,the conflict felt contrived or forced so i didnt find the film as compelling overall
Mar 16 2019,positive,really loved that they brought spiderman into the movie and loved the action
Mar 16 2019,positive,one of the best marvel movies by far
Mar 15 2019,positive,an outstanding russo bros adaptation that works on many levels not flawless to be sure but it certainly has heart
Mar 15 2019,negative,if you want to find a movie that does not look like comics at all this is the perfect movie despite being very entertaining they did not explore the comic they wanted to adapt in depth
Mar 15 2019,negative,a big mess very poor villain highlight of one fight scene does not make a film good poor script
Mar 13 2019,positive,spiderman and black panther debut theres a reason everyone talks about the airport scene but that last fight was pretty dope
Mar 13 2019,positive,one of the best ever imo
Mar 12 2019,positive,best captain america movie ever
Mar 12 2019,positive,is not the best of marvel but anyway epic
Mar 12 2019,positive,much awaited film and it lives up to the hype
Mar 10 2019,positive,another fantastically strong captain america film great character development
Mar 10 2019,positive,expected something more from it
Mar 10 2019,positive,iron man should have won but i still love this movie so so much
Mar 10 2019,negative,can we be done with heroes fighting heroes and can we be done with complications that could be fixed by two people sitting down and talking like adults 
Mar 9 2019,positive,the avengers 2 that whedon failed to make captain america civil war puts a large amount of the same cast into a more personal story of betrayal paranoia and the definition of what should be justified and what it means to avenge  also marks the first truly fleshedout mcu villain in a good while
Mar 9 2019,positive,great movie glad to see spiderman in the mcu although i wish there was a better reason for the fight than a brainwashed winter soldier
Mar 9 2019,neutral,a major scale down from the original comics it reduces a major rift between a ll the marvel heroes into a playful bicker between a dozen friends
Mar 9 2019,positive,this film soars above the first two which were also very good
Mar 9 2019,positive,my pick for second best marvel movie after infinity war
Mar 9 2019,positive,captain america civil war is a superhero movie that really understands that compelling characters and strong emotions are both far more important than spectacle the russo brothers create clever subtle and surprisingly thought provoking ways to turn our beloved heroes against each other this is not your average marvel movie low on spectacle high on nuance
Mar 9 2019,positive,great movie it is impressive how the cast continues to grow yet marvel continues to give each character a unique personality and a role to play in the events the dark tone is a nice change of pace since most marvel movies aim for the action comedy feel
Mar 9 2019,positive,a non stop action movie this movie delivers
Mar 9 2019,positive,you ever seen that really old movie iron man 1 where hes in the workshop making that suit thingy yeah well this is what its led to and its been brilliant
Mar 9 2019,positive,great movie  amazing directing
Mar 8 2019,positive,an amazing ending to the captain america trilogy my favorite out of the three the funniest part of it all is that i was actually on iron mans side the entire time
Mar 8 2019,positive,such a fantastic storyline as steve rogers is once again put in the spotlight that airport sequence was astoundingly entertaining    grade a
Mar 8 2019,positive,good story exiting and funny
Mar 8 2019,positive,excellent movie glad they got spider man for it
Mar 7 2019,positive,what a way to wrap up a trilogy captain america is no where near my favorite marvel character but i gotta admit it definitely has the best trilogy out of any hero
Mar 7 2019,positive,it just a fun to watch movie with good interpretations as always nothing to say about that we thank the directors that they didnt repeat same script as the original comic book they do an amazing job
Mar 5 2019,negative,it was boring and the action scenes were very bland
Mar 5 2019,positive,fabulous the russo bros know their stuff man i wish theyd do a star wars movie
Mar 5 2019,neutral,honestly i think its a slightly below average mcu movie 
Mar 3 2019,positive,i wish aaron taylor johnson as  quicksilver was in this movie so the family against family aspect was played up more id imagine his role in civil war would be like this    civil war he would be on the lagos mission with his sister captain america black widow and falcon helping wanda getting the smoke out of the building stopping crossboness men by walking through walls and getting civillains to safety with his speed he would have a harder time to put his hatred for the stark family aside and join iron manâtms side because he would be convinced that it would stop enhanced people like his sister from causing causalities again he would try to beat cap again and run around giantman in circles but he would be defeated easilyhe would also refuse to fight back against wanda and as a result she wins the battle throwing his famous catchphrase back at him we both didnt see this coming during the beginning of the battle between the two teams of avengers he would also run faster than everyone else even spiderman during the beginning of the battle between the two teams of avengers he would appear as a blur compared to everyone else i imagine the lagos incident would still happen even if he drops wanda to lift crossbones up into the sky he also would have a rivalry with vision over his romance for wandahave black widow help him learn of american culture and give spiderman a run for his money at the battle in germany at the airport he would bicker and fight with his rival hawkeye once again while being surprised how he named his newborn son after pietro and show anger at vision for not being able to focus on capturing cap and winter soldier due to his love for wanda at the end of the film he would run around the training room unsure of what to do now that the avengers disbandedcaptain america and pietro would both have a falling out over their differences of being the protective big brother of wanda which would lead him to joining iron mans side in captain america civil war it would also show that  despite battling each other and unlike tony and steve nothing would ever break their love and loyatlity to each other even though they would be seperated at the end of civil war they would know that it would not be long and they would need each other when the avengers reformed
Mar 3 2019,negative,what a total fucking crapfest how can this get a 90 rating superheroes battling each other zzzz zzzz zzzz
Mar 1 2019,positive,this one had early signs of sjw intervention
Feb 25 2019,positive,honestly this should have been avengers 2 aou had weak narrative for an overarching plot
Feb 24 2019,positive,all in all a good movie
Feb 24 2019,positive,the movie is unfocused and everyone in the movie make dumb decisions for no reason
Feb 24 2019,positive,great movie and felt more like an avengers movie first appearances of black panther and spiderman as well
Feb 21 2019,positive,my favourite mcu movie period i love the tension i love the action love the drama and the villain even wins
Feb 9 2019,positive,the mature themes explored in civil war feel a bit too watered down to make room for its many characters subplots and undeniably fantastic action scenes still civil war does more than your average superhero film to engage your brain and leave you mostly satisfied
Jan 30 2019,positive,the problem as some of its predecessors is the too long runtime but despite that the script is strong and credible and its refreshing to watch a well done superheroes movie with conflicts between them
Jan 26 2019,positive,2016s ultimate on the edge of your seat movie goes tocaptain america civil war they should really make an award for that i know who the winner would be if it was made back in 2016
Jan 19 2019,positive,undoubtedly the best captain america film ever this movie not only brings exciting action to forefront it explores various themes and ideas that many other films are unable to display with such strength this movie also brilliantly leaves an interesting although somewhat saddening ending to the relationship of the avengers as we are left to wonder what will happen with these heroes in later mcu films
Jan 17 2019,positive,who doesnt love this film this film was very awesome very great
Jan 15 2019,positive,a well acted well shot solid film but i have a few gripes with this film the first one is that zemos plan is 90 luck this movie should not be made this early and the accords are pretty flawed and spiderman was a very much welcomed addition to the mcu but pretty shoehorned in in a somewhat choppy way but definitely good movie but it is very overrated
Jan 12 2019,negative,the worst mcu movie i could not even enjoy infinity wars because of how much this movie smells there is no consequences  because of their actions the end spoiler they all escape anyway dumb
Jan 9 2019,negative,this is one of the worst marvel movies ever none of the motivations for any caracters make any sense what so ever and overall the battles feel realy forced
Jan 9 2019,positive,good effort spiderman and antman were shoe horned in for no reason at all and the airport fight was a practice fight everybody holding back except black panther and bucky but a good spectacle nonetheless and hell of a fight scene at the end
Jan 7 2019,positive,captain america civil war is an emotionally rich and a very deep film it explores political controversy and shows the impact of lies and corruption it is an incredible film complete with outstanding action a very good score and one of the greatest movie conflicts of all time
Jan 5 2019,positive,spooderman was cool  80
Jan 2 2019,positive,great story one of the best superhero movies but in some of the fighting scenes you can see clearly that the characters are not actually punching each other   93   ï 12 12does anyone have any orange slicesï 12
Jan 1 2019,positive,i missed this and had heard bad things about it but i enjoyed watching this as i have a much better understanding of the marvel universe now
Jan 1 2019,positive,not nearly as fantastic as everyone makes out but certainly the best mcu movie so far    i think it has almost as many flaws as bvs however it isnt laid bare by the dull imploding storyline of bvs and this movie has likable characters who can actually smile
Dec 31 2018,positive,captain america civil war is one of marvels best movies and i think it is the best movie that came out
Dec 30 2018,positive,this episode really humanizes the avengers except maybe cap
Dec 29 2018,positive,this movie is next level story telling airport battle is one of the greatest action moments in the mcu and black panther as well as spiderman are awesome
Dec 28 2018,positive,possibly the most compelling superhero movie since christopher nolans dark knight 2008 civil war keeps the audience at the edge of its seat thanks to a nailbitting plot that benefits of having a more mature tone than other marvel flicks
Dec 27 2018,positive,its remarkable to think that even though this is called captain america civil war you can easily see where both steve rogers and tony stark are coming from this made the movie all the better being conflicted about which side i agreed with was real challenging and i commend the russo brothers for that due to that plus the introductions of both black panther and spiderman as well as fantastic action sequences airport showdown and climax and a complex conflict between the mcus greatest heroes civil war remains one of the best marvel and superhero movies ever made 
Dec 27 2018,positive,marvels unofficial apology for age of ultron this is great the management of multiple plot lines and introduction of new characters is handled brilliantly hats off to everyone involved
Dec 21 2018,positive,captain america civil war is the best entry in the captain america series it knows how to deliver some fun and entertaining action while also balancing the dramatic aspects and i love movies that can do that and this one does it extremely well
Dec 20 2018,positive,amazing action   good plot and twist at the end   84
Dec 17 2018,negative,i love captain america or more accurately i love steve rogers as a characters the winter soldier is one of my favorite movies and i was expecting great things from the russos first of all it makes no sense for a captain america movie to feature as much iron man as it does captain america they shouldve made this into an avengers movie and given cap a real third solo installment   this movie barely has any soul and worst of all is trying to convince us that iron mans opinion is as valid as captain americas which it isnt especially in caps own movie this movie was so unabashedly biased in iron mans favor despite the fact that he should have been a secondary character that it made me angry there is nothing noble about tony trying to force his friends to sign their freedom away to the un especially given that trigger for him was the sokovia tragedy which he caused i know we all collectively try to forget about ultron but come on there is nothing righteous about tony trying to murder a brainwashed prisoner of war who was forced to commit atrocities there is nothing dignified about tony blackmailing a fifteen year old child into fighting with him against a group of overpowered superheroes   lets all stop pretending that tony stark is a good person and that captain america civil war is anything but the physical proof of everyones willful blindness on that giving flaws to characters is obviously recommended to give them depth but it only works if said characters are held responsible for their actions at some point this movie is frustrating and a pain to watch and nothing more
Dec 17 2018,positive,totally entertaining and exciting
Dec 17 2018,positive,great film from marvel love the new spiderman
Dec 17 2018,negative,the script is a shit the movie is all forced to captain america making the orther heroes be weaker than they really are so talking about habilities it has many mistakes about the other marvels movies
Dec 15 2018,positive,civil war is another actionpacked movie in the marvel franchise bringing lots of new characters twists and lots of other fun things to the franchise civil war also handles the clash with the avengers going head to head really well and executes the build up almost perfectly but at times i did find myself a bit bored
Dec 14 2018,positive,a big moment for the mcu and the comic book fans and it delivered
Dec 11 2018,positive,more dramatic than other marvel movies but not to the point where you cant have fun with it it has the signature marvel humor with an amazing variety of characters including spiderman which was played amazingly by tom holland who might be my favorite peter parker even better than the winter soldier which is undoubtedly a masterpiece
Dec 11 2018,positive,a gripping story from start to finish with the political side of the last captain america movie still present the superb acting from both leads chris evans and robert downey jr makes this that extra bit better one of the best mcu movies to date
Dec 8 2018,positive,my favorite marvel movie yes i said what i said
Dec 8 2018,positive,it has epic scenes a great set of characters in almost all there is good development and a plot that explores what actually happens to the other side apart from saving the day
Dec 8 2018,negative,people love this movie maybe they love the action or the story or just the dark tone in general just to know its not as good as the rest of the mcu movies like infinity war its not the same theres no really cool villain like vulture or iron monger the action is not sifi enough like guardians of the galaxy its dark tone dose not work i dose on the dark night trilogy the sky is never blue once in this movie it is never funny not even 1 and the story is boring and barely effects the mcu at all im not saying this movies bad its just one star away okay
Dec 6 2018,positive,the greatest mcu movie to date
Nov 29 2018,positive,was once the best the best film marvel had ever made
Nov 25 2018,positive,captain america civil war tells a heartbreaking story extremely well and does a fantastic job of introducing some new key players in the mcu
Nov 24 2018,positive,this is a movie that i could watch over and over again great cast and i was so disappointed that it was removed from netflix i watched it at least 6 times in one month compelling story this movie isnt for everyone though my friend who is into more realism didnt like it another problem was that it was so laced to past movies that if youre not a hardcore marvel fan itd be tough to understand i came into this movie blind on the whole captain america trilogy and for half of it i thought bucky was the villain i caught on after a while and wanted to watch the other two movies
Nov 24 2018,positive,great acting  story as usual
Nov 22 2018,positive,the best of the captain america movies and one of the best mcu movies yet and it gives robert downey jr and chris evans time to shine in their roles and with the awesome introductions of black panther and spiderman in the mcu gets me excited for the future
Nov 22 2018,positive,im not gonna lie this disappointed me
Nov 19 2018,positive,one of my favourite mcu movies the plot the action and the character moments is really great i do think the movie suffers a little bit from the unnecessary character of zemo because he creates loads of story problems
Nov 19 2018,positive,one of the best comic book movies of all time anthony and joe russo have made a darker look at the superhero with intense action chris evans robert downey jr and scarlett johansson lead the cast with fantastic performances
Nov 18 2018,positive,impressive superhero epic with complexity huge action scenes and heart
Nov 17 2018,positive,awesomeness personified one of the best marvel movies ever that amazing airport fight one of the best action sequences filmed
Nov 16 2018,positive,strongest of the captain america trilogy because of the relatable characters and engaging story
Nov 14 2018,positive,while it is easy to get enamored by the action and new side characters when one focuses on the two protagonists it can become one of the most fulfilling marvel films
Nov 14 2018,negative,ummmm yet another super hero movie about the marvel universe or whatever
Nov 11 2018,positive,to sum up for a literal rewiewing its got everything a marvel movie and an action drama should contain and much more
Nov 6 2018,positive,this film was great
Nov 4 2018,positive,best captain america movie ive ever seen airport battle was soooo epic and spider mantom holland stole the show 100 certified fresh
Oct 22 2018,positive,marvels first crossover event makes for a very entertaining action film
Oct 21 2018,neutral,it may have gret action and story but theres too much talking and politics and makes me hate tony rhodey and other great characters
Oct 20 2018,positive,i hate to say this but this is my least captain america movies the war was unnecessary i just didnt get it im sorry
Oct 15 2018,positive,i understand completely why this a captain america movie but for me this should be an avengers film then have a third and final captain america film to kill him off before avengers 4 anyhow superb film loved it
Oct 15 2018,positive,this movie is  sooo fucking amazing one of the best movies ever made i was definitely  team america when i went to see it captain america civil war is an amazing and fantastic masterpiece that everyone should seethe action was awesome everyone in this movie was great  the acting was perfect it was great to see spiderman in this movie everything in captain america civil war was great couldnt have been any better this movie will always be one of the greatest
Oct 15 2018,positive,a great film that provides a climax in the series and is a perfect fit in with the other films
Oct 13 2018,positive,one of the best marvel films brimming with tension as two conflicting ideologies force iconic heroes to justifiably take up arms against one another
Oct 13 2018,positive,people fight things blow up they all get over it
Oct 12 2018,positive,the russo brothers done a good job with this one fans have wanted civil war to be a film since the start of the avengers to be honest i thought this film would be on a fast track to win robert downey jr an oscar robert downey jr as ironman is the best thing ive seen since well ever you really feel a lot of sympathy for iron man seeing what he went through during the film most definitely recommend for 12    the comic book accuracy in this movie was surprisingly accurate also the poster for the film was super satisfying and cool to see come to life on screen one of the best thing i found about civil war was that we the audience had to pick a side between cap or tony also the cgi was incredible and almost seemed real    one of the biggest flaws in captain america civil war is that the rest of the movies have been carried on its shoulders so you would have to watch civil war to understand what was going on in future films starring each character not fully but there would be alot of references and scenes mainly referring to it i did not like that we never got to see what happened to the main antagonist     in this marvel cinematic film they introduce spiderman tom holland and black panther chadwick boseman tom holland i must be honest i originally thought he wasnt a good choice for our spiderman but now seeing how well his performance was and how good the suit was i was definitely wrong and chadwick boseman role for the film  i didnt really know what to expect because its not like we have seen a black panther performance before but seeing his performance i was amazed with it    grade a
Oct 10 2018,positive,wow i love this movie all the fights are great especially the airport fight
Oct 7 2018,positive,a fantastic set of characters new and old with acting and writing sublime making the perfect russo brother movie and the best of the mcu
Oct 2 2018,positive,this is a thoughtprovoking superhero film with a lot of banter and a whole lot of action yet because studios dont want to upset the applecart and kill off main characters the final battle scene lacks a true threat to get around it it needed to be about something more  not just an untrustworthy un government but about superheroes not just willing to stop them but determined to arrest them as a result it fails but at the end if you love freedom then you will love captain america
Sep 30 2018,negative,bombastic and trite civil war is the most disappointing mcu movie ever made
Sep 30 2018,neutral,it was good but i did not like how it started and how it ended it was cool when they fought at the airport and spiderman was cool but the rest of it was pretty bad
Sep 27 2018,negative,dear god what have they done
Sep 10 2018,negative,instead of a proper third captain america installment to follow up the first avenger and the winter soldier we get yet another avengers junior film that feels like nothing more than a gigantic phase three trailer and it is only saved by bosemans black panther  marvels civil war is a civil bore
Sep 8 2018,positive,hands down my favorite so far
Sep 7 2018,positive,captain america civil war was a great marvel movie and a great movie in general its fun for the whole family the story was great and the acting was also great chris evans was great as captain america and robert downey jr was great and iron man and the rest of the actors and actresses were great this was the first marvel cinematic universe to feature spiderman and tom holland was great as spiderman
Sep 3 2018,negative,just another waste of time
Aug 29 2018,positive,marvel movie sensory overload hits high note
Aug 25 2018,positive,this one was really close to be the best mcu movie but then it just went in a very wrong direction that i really hated and this very wrong thing is the length  i think that it really wasnt necessarily to be 146 minutes cause i was bored sometimes and actually its the same problem with most of the mcu movies    the roles as always for me arent good the performance of most of the cast is very poor scarlett johansson as natasha romanoffblack widow is bad as always sebastian stan as bucky barneswinter soldier is getting worse every movie chadwick boseman as tchallablack panther was totally a fakeact and chris evans as steve rogerscaptain america is ridiculously serious as always    but some roles i really adored and comes in number one paul rudd as scott langantman as always then robert downey jr as tony starkiron man paul bettany as vision tom holland as peter parkerspiderman elizabeth olsen as wanda maximoffscarlet witch and anthony mackie as sam wilsonfalcon  the others were equal to me    the action sequence was really epic the cgi was stunning too it had a slight sense of humor and the story was iconic    captain america civil war is definitely a great stunning epic and unwelled most of the performances movie
Aug 24 2018,positive,almost perfect not the greatest beginning 
Aug 17 2018,positive,well written and directed captain america civil war is the best movie of the trilogy captain america
Aug 8 2018,positive,funny scenesdramatic moments and overall a great movie
Aug 7 2018,positive,amazing very engaging and lots of action very emotionally invested
Aug 7 2018,positive,this movie was amazing this had so much action and i loved seeing the superheroes fight the entire time i was always wondering who was going to win also i love that spider mans here the part where he takes captain americas shield is priceless this was my favorite movie
Aug 4 2018,positive,after antman showed one scene
Jul 31 2018,negative,captain america civil war is a movie which focuses on the fact that there are civilian deads when the avengers take the matter in their own hand the fact is however that the hero captain america who is created to protect the country does not listen and keeps dropping civialian bodies in an attempt to soften the load and make sure for the audience that cap is actually the good guy the two hero teams of cap and iron man fight in an attempt of iron man to stop cap from dropping more casualties the plot of the movie is completely ruined when in this fight nobody dies and cap gets off without a scratch this makes you wonder where everybodys intentions lie and whether anyone of the heroes actually cares about the people civilians there are trying to protect by fighting in the first place in a matter of easing the pain during the fight war machine drops down to earth when his suit dies but even he gets out without dying from the drop as a spectator this makes you gringe so hard why is there no parachute the movie is ended with one last fight in which nobody does again and when you start to wonder where this movie begun you begin to wonder what has changed in marvel universe in this movie after you realized that there has changed nothing you wonder where 25 hours of your life have gone to and that you will never get them back
Jul 28 2018,negative,to call this movie thought provoking is an insult to well written works with actual substance put into them  the movie looks lifeless in its cinematography  any actual interesting dialogue about morals and politics was put on hold and never brought up again so there could be a team vs team battle royale  why couldnt they have just talked about their issues  this isnt fing high school  but then again but every action story can be as interesting as fatezero  dont watch this movie it does nothing interesting and unique in the slightest  210
Jul 28 2018,positive,captain america civil war lets you choose sides in a innovative way spiderman brings something new to the avengers
Jul 27 2018,positive,this is what fans have dreamed off for years and for its time this would of been the biggest event in the marvel cinematic universe mcu why because the avengers broke up and this movie absolutely pulled it off     captain america civil war is a very entertaining and thought provoking movie that includes every single hero that has been introduced so far as of may 2016 captain america civil war yet again stars robert downey jr as tony stark aka iron man chris evans as steve rogers aka captain america scarlett johansson as black widow aka natasha romanoff anthony mackie as sam wilson aka falcon sebastian stan as james buchan barnes aka the winter soldier or bucky and more all portraying their own heroes again whilst tackling one of the mcus most interesting non cartoonish and confusing storylines     marvels captain america civil war finds steve rogers leading the newly formed team of avengers in their continued efforts to safeguard humanity but after another incident involving the avengers results in collateral damage political pressure mounts to install a system of accountability headed by a governing body to oversee and direct the team the new status quo fractures the avengers resulting in two campsone led by steve rogers and his desire for the avengers to remain free to defend humanity without government interference and the other following tony starks surprising decision to support government oversight and accountability     from rotten tomatoes    before i move on to my story review may i warn you that there will be spoilers for captain america civil war the winter soldier and spider man homecoming read at your own risk ill be discussing them in quite a lot of detail the film opens with bucky barnes aka the winter soldier getting mind controlled by hyrda who order him to get serum for there the super soldiers this scene felt like we were watching the winter soldier again i know buckys story is still to be continued due to the fact that he finds out that he is actually bucky in the winter soldier but i didnt really see the point of this scene until i found out its meaning next we are in present day where scarlet witch wanda maximoff black widow natasha romanoff falcon sam wilson and captain america steve rogers are fighting crossbones and his goons there fights leaves destruction and havoc that the un comes to together to try and stop the avengers from being a private organisation instead they want the avengers to be monitored and only be sent on missions if absolutely necessary this causing a rift between the avengers as you have falcon captain america and scarlet witch who think the accords should not go ahead and let the avengers still be a private organisation then you have tony stark black widow vision and colonel james rhodes who think they should have the accords as it will stop the avengers from killing the innocent and tony thinks if they dont sign the accords something bad will be done about it later this sets up the rest of the film nicely and this scene express all the avengers opinions and thoughts on the accords once steve rogers comes back from peggy carters funeral which could of been more emotional and more satisfying black widow goes off to vienna to discuss the accords this is where we meet king tchalka of wakanda the former black panther and prince tchalla of wakanda the new black panther at the vienna accords a sokvian person called zemo disguises himself to make him look like bucky barnes and sets off a bomb that kills at least 12 people at the un including king tchalka tchalla is so devastated that the bomb killed his dad that he goes off to kill the person he thinks is responsible bucky black widow calls up steve steve tells her he knows what bucky is doing  so he is going to get him black widow tells him to stay out of it but he doesnt steve goes to buckys house that is filled with armed soldiers steve kills some of them and lets bucky escape tchalla now black panther finds bucky and chases him down a motor way captain and falcon follows them but the three are later arrested when rhodes in the war machine armour turns up with follow police officers when tchalka died it was actually pretty sad and we saw why tchalla wanted revenge we also saw what steve would do for his friend but it feels like we have seen bucky and captain america fight at lot of times before due to the winter soldier movie and the arguments between steve and bucky feel like de ja vu therefore its getting quite repetitive in berlin captain america falcon black panther and bucky are all taken to the cia headquarters in berlin there we get to meet everett k ross who is played by martin freeman and we now get to see what sharon carter is doing after shield was compromised captain america steve rogers falcon sam wilson and black panther tchalla arent put in cells but in offices however they still cannot leave it all there outfits belongings are taken from them including caps signature shield bucky is now taken into a special room where he is kept in a special portable cell where he is interrogated by zemo the man behind the vienna bombing zemo has killed the real physiatrist who is supposed to interrogate bucky tony has a conversation with steve telling him that him and wanda scarlet witch will get reinstated steve is confused about wanda so tony says she is being protected by vision in a compound steve says she is only a kid and storms off a doesnt sign the accords like tony wanted him to in this conversation tony mentions that him and pepper potts are taking a break but in spider man homecoming the next film that tony makes a main appearance in and in that film he proposes to her does this mean that in the two month gap between spider man homecoming and civil war that tony got back together with pepper back in the interrogation room zemo has annoyed bucky and bucky breaks out of his cell and escapes steve then finds bucky and bucky admits that he killed tonys parents as they had serum that would make people into super soldiers tony asks thunderbolt ross if he and a few others can suit up and track down barnes thunderbolt gives him 48 hours to bring in barnes black widow says shell get black panther to help and tony flies of to queens to recruit peter parker to become spider man ill speak more about his character later on tony now used up most of his 48 hours recruiting peter travels to berlins airport with rhodes aka war machine black panther vision black widow and spider man to fight captain america and his team that includes hawkeye aka clint barton scarlet witch aka wanda maximoff and scott lang aka ant man caps team is the team against the accords who are breaking the law by fighting without permission and there is tonys team who are trying to bring in barnes and who are for the accords  as steve rogers cap will not hand over barnes and turn himself in peter parker now in his brand new spider man suit jumps in and steals caps shield they fight but black widow betrays iron man aka tony stark and lets bucky and cap escape in a helicopter rhodes and tony fly after it but falcon goes after them vison uses the mind stone to stop falcon but it hits rhodes and rhodes breaks his legs captain america and bucky fly off whilst rhodes and iron man go to the hospital along with the rest of their team and the rest of captain americas team who were left at the airport are arrested and taken away this scene is by far the most thrilling and the all round best fight scene in the entire mcu and ill speak more about that later on black panther tells ross that black widow is the reason why captain america escaped so she goes on the run whilst tony flies of to the prison to try and get information as to where steve went at the prison falcon secretly tells tony where steve went and tony flies of to get them and tchalla follows tony on the way there tony is sent footage of zemo that tells him that zemo disguised himself as bucky and that zemo wasnt supposed to interrogate bucky tony sends the footage to ross i am not sure if it is either thunderbolt ross or everett ross it did not say tony makes a truce with cap and they explore the deserted island theyre on they find zemo who shows tony footage of bucky killing his parents we briefly see this scene at the very start of the movie this scene was actually really emotional and robert downey jrs performance as iron man in this scene was brilliant steve admits that he knew bucky killed his parents so iron man fights them zemo escapes but is caught by tchalla who arrests him zemo admits that he set off the bomb in vienna and he is sorry he admits that his plan was to break up the avengers he then tells tchalla that he wanted the avengers dead because they are the reason for his wifes death this scene was absolutely brilliant as it showed us why zemo was a bad guy and why he did what he did captain america and bucky defeat iron man by breaking the arc reactor that powers his suit and now that greatest line of the movie is said by tony you dont deserve that shield my father made that shield steve leaves his shield and leaves with bucky to free his friends in prison and they go the wakanda tony flies back to see rhodes and black panther takes zemo to berlin for questioning tony then finds a letter that was given to him in a very funny way by stan lee that is from steve steve tells tony that was he did was wrong and that he is sorry for everything that happened for me this was a great way to end the movie and it set up lots of new possibilities for the mcu its a shame we didnt get to see hope van dyne the wasp in the airport fight though there is also a few post credits scenes the first one we get to see bucky going back into the ice until the wakandans can find a way to cure his brainwashing and make him immune to it for me i was excited for what was to come next once i saw this scene as it set ups lots of possibilities as to what the black panther movie would feature the next one we see peter parker at home suffering from injuries he made in the airport battle however when we last saw peter parker he had no scars on his face so how did he get them was it just a editing mistake anyway we then see him shoot a laser that projects the spider man symbol it was quite obvious that we would see more of spidey but this post credits scene was actually a pure joy to see    first of all can i just say that bringing spider man and black panther into the mcu was a real game changer and they chose the best people for the job i honestly think that marvel nailed peter parker i think that tom holland is the best peter parker thus far he looks the right age he seems nerdy and his acting as the web slinger is top notch also chadwick boseman is also brilliant as black panther but i think that marvel made a mistake of teasing spider man in the trailer and i think they should of left him for the big reveal in the movie it would of been more exciting and shocking for the fans and would of added to the experience    thirdly i will talk about the heroes and the two teams the side i have picked is iron man iron man is one of my favorite marvel heroes period and he was in the right anyway so i like that the cast expressed their feelings for the un accords and why they picked what side they did each individual hero had their time to shine on screen and they all were portrayed superbly marvel did have lots of heroes to deal with in this movie and they were able to fit them all in perfectly and they all had there own time to shine onscreen the plot twist with bucky and introducing the other winter soldiers was actually surprising and probably thrilled fans who wanted more than one winter soldier in captain america the winter soldier iron mantony stark wasnt as funny and witty in this film as he has been in the previous films but that might of taken away the tone this movie set talking about humour scott lang aka ant man played marvellously by the extremely funny paul rudd was the most humourous character in this film his lines were really random and that is why they were funny also don cheadle tackled the amputated leg scene superbly and showed what people are really going through overall all the heroes were portrayed excellently but its a shame we couldnt of seen thor and hulk but they are somewhere in space cue thor ragnarok    next ill talk about the villain zemo zemo is actually one of the best and most underrated villains in the entire mcu and is played terrifically by daniel brühl he isnt even powerful but he is so smart and all the things he did were really well planned and clever and thats why i think he is the best villain in the entire mcu he also has a moral reason to break up the avengers the avengers killed his family when they were fighting ultron so all he wanted was revenge and boy he got his revenge nice and toasty    now ill go onto talking about the worst things about this film there arent any big mistakes in the film but there are them odd mistakes here and there but all movies have them so its no need to talk about them but before i move on can i just say that every time ive watched this movie i have found out something new about the plot or zemo or even whats going all the way through this movie i just kept thinking about what is happening and why its happening this is a very thought provoking film that i had to rewatch as i was quite baffled the first time round the film did actually improve hugely when i rewatched the 2 hour and a half run time went by very quickly and the film was paced nicely and didnt drag back to talking about the worst things about civil war a big mistake this movie made was including two characters called ross i mean i dont have any thing wrong with the characters its just that half the time you didnt know which one they were talking about they could of called them by there first name to make it more understandable also the arguments do get repetitive about the accords i did speak about the problem with bucky and cap in my story review so there is no need to revisit that here but what i would of liked to off seen in the film is the return of betty ross general thunderbolt ross returned since the incredible hulk a film i actually enjoyed so why couldnt she return it feels like see doesnt even exist anymore    the sixth thing ill talk about is my favorite scene the airport battle that is one of the best scenes in the mcu and is absolutely awesome it was a dream to see all this character battle it out we got a glimpse at the next spider man film and a glimpse at the black panther film too the airport battle had some devastational effects on the characters and each character that was included in this big fight each had there own time to shine its just so good     overall captain america civil war brings together all the heroes introduced so far as of may 2016 and even introduces some new ones to make this absolutely awesome film that includes a sinister villain a non cartoonish plot and some awesome fight scenes that is still to this day one of marvels best movies
Jul 24 2018,positive,captain america civil war pits the avengers against each other with a great puppet master villain and some touches of humor the siberia climax is one of marvels best fights as well as the airport fight  910
Jul 23 2018,positive,the film has nothing to do with the comic thats whats wrong in the movie but all of it is about perfectionism
Jul 20 2018,positive,i really wanted to hate this movie but i couldnt
Jul 19 2018,positive,i love the fight scenes were awesome 
Jul 16 2018,positive,captain america civil war combines the thrills and grit of the winter soldier and the emotional depth of these beloved characters to deliver the marvels best film yet directors anthony and joe russo had the seemingly impossible task of cramming dozens of different characters into one cohesive movie  and yet they pulled it off with style civil war is marvels deepest and most focused movie yet with the storys central conflict between chris evans captain america and robert downey jrs iron man the main cast including sebastian stans winter soldier and anthony mackies falcon give their best performances the latter providing some muchneeded levity newcomers tom holland and chadwick boseman particularly the former who steals the show are also excellent additions the action exceeds all expectations as well the battle at berlin airport is overflowing with scale explosions and surprisingly some laughs as well this is quickly followed by a more dark emotional climax with its cast action scenes and emotional depth civil war indeed has everything fans could have wanted while its conflicting tones can occasionally be distracting civil war is an impressive feat to pull off and should give fans confidence with the russos directing the upcoming avengers infinity war
Jul 15 2018,positive,love film but pretty much the exact same as   bvs
Jul 12 2018,positive,captain america civil war is the best of the captain america trilogy and also a superb way to kickstart the third phase of the marvel cinematic universe in captain america civil war the avengers lives are at stake after a mission goes awry that resulted with the deaths of a number of civilians to solve this problem the government introduces the accords where the heroes will only work for them to save others when necessary while iron man along with his allies agree to this captain america and the others refuse to do so things just couldnt get worse when the winter soldier bucky barnes becomes a wanted man after bombing the piece treaty in vienna that killed tchallas father cap soon learns that his friend has been framed and that he must find the mastermind behind the events that led to the fracturing of the avengers as iron man fights his way to send cap into custody back when this showed two years ago in imax i had a blast watching it especially on the directors club when i got it on dvd i still couldnt get enough of this film as marvel has really become a game changer by the start of phase three which led to avengers infinity war and this is one of marvels best efforts to date between dcs batman v superman and this film captain america civil war is a much better experience especially when dc now starts to sink gradually from one film to the next with marvel the stakes are high and they slowly start to turn into the crown jewel of comic book movies that began with the original iron man until this film  avengers infinity war and so on one of the things that i like about captain america civil war is that this movie like the previous films does a great job in keeping their footing on the right direction while telling a good story this movie seriously did the job expanding some of the questions from the previous films like what truly happened to iron mans family and so on i love how the film is well executed during the course of the story that does not lose its direction from one place to another as it is told in a powerful yet intriguing way the movies twists and turns are so unexpected youd never see it coming the themes about how far would you go to be a hero is well explored every character is so fun to watch from the new ones black panther to the returning and reintroduced faces spiderman and antman the action scenes are intense combined with good old fashioned humor like what the previous marvel films usually do the airport battle is funny and exhilarating featuring crazy cgi effects from past marvel films and the thrilling final battle against iron man captain america and winter  soldier there are some scenes that are just as suspenceful as in its predecessor the death of tchallas father the winter soldier going crazy and the shocking twists in the finale and last but not least the main highlight of this film is the main antagonist helmut zemo beginning with this film until antman and the wasp the villain issue has been solved neither of the enemies the avengers faced this time around are not watered down from lack of character development marvel seriously responded to this issue by giving us villains who are threats to the heroes or are more human and changed the heroes mind knowing that the villains are usually telling the truth for all the right reasons and zemo is just the start now that the films can compete with the netflix marvel shows villains the acting is spot on everyone from the casts did a good job with their roles in this film from chris evans to robert downey junior as captain america and iron man respectively while the new faces like tom holland and black panther are amazing last but not least the returning casts from past marvel films like scarlett johansson paul rudd anthony mackie don cheadle are great as black widow antman falcon and war machine while i like seeing stan lee once more in another funny marvel cameo directors anthony and joe russo did a spectacular job with their work on this film they really took a huge leap forward with their work on this film until avengers infinity war with the help of writers christopher markus and stephen mcfeely these four are the key players of the marvel cinematic universe as they helped in expanding this universe in the best directions thanks to their hardwork and effort this franchise has sprawled to the top of the hill overall captain america civil war is a fun start for the phase three mcu films the result is an entertaining and memorable action film filled with humor and charm while delving deeper into the mythology of this expanding universe this film gets an 1110
Jul 10 2018,positive,i cried multiple times despite promising myself i would not fantastic special effects and a riveting storyline make it a mustsee for any marvel fan the unstable relationship between lovable sarcastic genius billionaire tony stark and brave underdog soldier steve rogers supernovas into a heartrending thrill ride of mistrust and uncertain loyalties how far is cap willing to go to protect his old friend before it tears the team apart will tony be able to forgive his teammate for old deeds buried in the past for 30 years watch and find out in this stunning addition to the mcu
Jul 7 2018,negative,i meani mostly am poor very poor so only attend to the cinema as a treat to my elderly mother for our interest in the new star wars and indy jones things    soi mean forget all other stuff even as in cinema so only viewing it on a tv like 999 of humans if so bad cgi washed out colors and id rather watch those sloths with algae since that was in hd ive never played minecraft but i did play populous decades ago and the thing is maybe similar     and anyway the plot seems to be 80 action scenes with no plot 10 scenes with no plot introducing antman and spiderman 1 that shit actor from children of a lesser god said something 2 frank grillo dying for some reason 7 of why fighting why oha lot of  introducing black panther and why he is beating the shit out of other heroes which would be awesome if    i mean why not just instead do contest of champions no need to spend 40 minutes on random character and actor sorry sorry winter soldierbucky barnesactors name which no one gives a shit about  my review is that i saw it once and thats enough according to the metanarrative of movies nothing in it is goodacting goodwriting enough to see again and the visuals are just utterly ridiculous     bland washed out and nonsensically plotted movie youve seen before vs say hd for reals the planet earth or planet squid why would anyone choose the former    keeping up with various new marvel cinematic movies that i havent seen in theaters is kind of a burden since theyre so ugly and nonsensical as compared to my normal views of tv 1 star since 0 star isnt an option durr durr durr
Jul 6 2018,positive,when i first saw that this movie was supposed to be the marvel heroes fighting one another i was worried i wasnt sure how audience would perceive movies where the main characters who are generally saving peoples lives fight to the death and cause mass destruction to the world aka man of steel but i was relieved to how fantastically this story went and i was happy that they did use stuff from the civil war comics
Jul 3 2018,positive,one of the greatest superhero movies of all time captain america civil war functions more as an avenger movie with all of its classy characters battling the living daylight out of each other with tom holland making his first appearance as spiderman civil war breaks emotional height includes the best action and depth of the entire mcu and has an allstar cast each with an iconic and unforgettable role
Jul 2 2018,positive,the best captain america movies so far you would think pinning to of the most liked characters against each other wouldnt work but it works so well
Jul 2 2018,negative,good eye candy seeing double the avengers but that was about it hard to believe one below average villain could accomplish so much and cause the rift between teams wasnt much of a war more like competitive sparring at least it wasnt avengers fighting another million man army of robots or aliens
Jun 23 2018,positive,probably should have been an avengers movie but that means that its a hodgepodge of great scenes culminating in a grand final fight sequence
Jun 22 2018,positive,one of the best action movie ive ever seen i would have like it to be grittier and it has some pacing issue in the last part but everything serves the action well and i was tottally immersed throughout the whole film
Jun 20 2018,positive,great action sequences and even with a lot of characters they made it work
Jun 16 2018,positive,airport scene alone makes this movie worth seeing
Jun 10 2018,positive,one of my favorite of the mcu  i wish they would of went a bit more in depth and closer to the comics  this should of been two movies to have more time building up the animosity between stark and rogers
Jun 4 2018,positive,man this movie was great i saw this film once in imax 3d and a second time in imax 2d it was great both times its shot well most of the time and even when its not it is still amazing i have to say that the score elevates the film to a whole new level and really makes the film better the acting from the main 14 characters are amazing the 4 best from both teams were team captain america chris evans captain americasteve rogers paul rudd scott langant man sebastain stan winter soldierbucky barnes and elizabeth olsen wanda maximoffscarlett witch team iron man scarlett johansson black widownatasha romanoff chadwick boseman tchallablack panther tom holland peter parkerspiderman and paul bettany vision the other actor either dont have enough screen time to be called amazing or were meh actors the story is complete but it is more of an avengers film than a captain america film the airport battle is shot awesomely in imax i got to give this film a 100
Jun 3 2018,negative,honestly i thought this was a big disappointment for the mcu
Jun 3 2018,positive,2015 was a great year for mcu but since the start of 2016 they have been killing it and it all started with civil war i think civil war is the most underrated mcu movie of all time and it is an a must buy must see must love and so on the captain becomes of the 5 strongest avengers in this film and went from one of my least favorite avengers to number 3 in my book it is underrated on every level
Jun 2 2018,positive,some lack of logic and respect for tony starks ability to understand the concept of mind control but otherwise this is the classic continuation of excellent action visuals comedy and bringing together various threads of stories from all over the place in the successful way that marvel studios has been doing in the past decade
May 31 2018,positive,marvels civil war mcu edition was a very great mcu film who would of thought that they would see a hero vs hero film
May 28 2018,positive,needs more improvement 
May 28 2018,positive,in my opinion one of marvels greatest accomplishments if not their greatest from the fiery start picking up where the winter solider left off to the great character arcs and who can forget about the airport fight this movie is amazing daring and as badly entertaining as ever so for me its definitely an a
May 28 2018,positive,saw this after infinity war and wish i had seen it sooner  just like in the spiderman movie am not liking the controlling nature of iron man in the mcu  good movie with a weak ending
May 27 2018,positive,this movie was really good the conflict between stark and rogers was very well done and tom hollands performance as spiderman was really good very enjoyable movie and i like how its not a casual main villain vs hero story as it is a hero vs hero story
May 26 2018,positive,wow was not expecting that much awesomeness 
May 25 2018,positive,captain america and tony stark dont agree with each other so that will be come a problem what will be happening will things go back to normal or will things go bad how about you pick what side youre on iron man or captain
May 25 2018,positive,this movie is truly great i enjoy it every time i watch it
May 21 2018,positive,cuando ve esa pelicula me quede sin palabras   when i saw the movie i ended up speechless
May 21 2018,positive,civil war holds to be a great treasure among marvels cinematic universe the film perfectly gives all our heroes enough screentime to not only both understand where they stand and why  but to also get just the right amount of action and fun from them as well also topping the list of great characters is the villain zemo played by daniel brühl who shines as a different kind of marvel villain who is able to deconstruct our heroes and dissect the avengers doing so without superpowers and by putting them against each other the introduction to black panther and spiderman are also impressive and well done this movie rings to be one of marvels best hits
May 20 2018,negative,a lot of characters punching each other a lot no cgaracter depth a weak plot
May 18 2018,negative,im genuinely shocked by the good reviews whilst not totally terrible in the way that american ninja 3 is totally terrible the basic premise of this film is a bunch of massively entitled idiots decide to squabble amongst themselves in what is essentially a pointless load of rubbish whilst in the same universe at the same time shield is dealing with very real and far more important threats agent coulson proves himself to be not only more useful than every single other avenger but also more grown up and more likeable the only thing this movie actually achieved was destroying my opinion of all the characters involved every single one of them should have handled the entire affair way better than they did the vision went from being something really interesting in age of ultron to some kind of weirdly obsessive nanny it had its fun moments it even had its moving moments but the fact remains that it was a tiny petty squabble that doesnt even come close to demanding the budget it was given and this should never have become a movie
May 17 2018,negative,popcorn action not a film ill watch again it was mistitled its actually avengers 25
May 16 2018,positive,captain america civil war was a great way to kick of phase three of the mcu with tons of characters and lots of violence
May 12 2018,positive,the russo brothers return to kick off the third phase of the marvel cinematic universe and all i can say is that they have outdone themselves captain america civil war acts as both the conclusion of the captain america trilogy but also as an important chapter in the ongoing shared universe it continues storylines from both the winter soldier and age of ultron as steve rogers is on a mission to find his long lost friend bucky barnes now a brainwashed hydra assassin named the winter solider meanwhile the avengers have to face the sokovia accords which will establish a united nations panel to oversee and control earths mightiest heroes and that will create a conflict that will split the team into two separate teams one led by rogers and the other by tony stark the ensemble cast of previous films in the mcu returns with some brand new welcome auditions as the film marks the debuts of spiderman and black panther in the franchise chris evans and robert downey jr continue to impress as their respective heroes the action is highoctane even more so than in previous installments particularly in one iconic sequence the storytelling is innovative there is depth heart stakes humor realism and consequences for the avengers to face the intentions and motivations of all characters are fully established allowing you to choose your side the russos have once again made a brilliant and nearly flawless superhero movie that perfectly represents everything a modern blockbuster should be
May 11 2018,positive,thrilling actionpacked and emotionally resonant captain america civil war is a spectacular superhero film that lives up to the hype it is not easy to cram so many superheroes into a movie and make it work but the russo brothers have pulled it off with the help of a talented cast the directors have crafted a satisfying superhero film with exhilarating action sequences fantastic performances and a compelling villain the film sets a high bar for the comicbook genre in terms of acting it may be the most wellacted film in the marvel cinematic universe thus far robert downey jr delivers his finest performance to date as tony starkiron man showing an emotional range that he has never before chris evans is equally impressive as steve rogers and has really grown into this character over the years despite the outstanding performances from the cast captain america civil war suffers slightly from an overlong running time at times it does feel overcrowded with one too many characters nevertheless its a nearperfect comicbook film that accomplishes what it sets out to do lets just say that if youre a fan of the comicbook genre you will not be disappointed by this film
May 8 2018,negative,it was uneventfulthe story was pretty bad the only one worth watching was captain america
May 8 2018,positive,civil war feels more like an avengers movie but is nonetheless entertaining
May 7 2018,positive,perhaps the strongest film in the mcu yet which combines the best of both the avengers and winter soldier it fulfills an interesting arc for the captain taking him from a company man to a man against the system and dives into the superhero convention of not being able to let go of the past in a meaningful way this is marvel at its finest thrilling and with plenty of heart
May 5 2018,positive,the story wasnt very clear at first
May 4 2018,positive,captain america civil war combines both fun super hero action with genuinely thought provoking themes and delivers one of marvels best films to date
May 2 2018,positive,i could watch this all day
May 2 2018,positive,one of my all time favorites
May 2 2018,positive,an engrossing and mature marvel outing featuring one of the mcus greatest action set pieces the airport scene obviously while raising the stakes internally for the seemingly invincible avengers mostly a spinning the wheels movie plot wise but it does a great job of getting all the pieces in place for marvels magnum opus infinity war
May 1 2018,positive,a captivating installment to the marvel franchise that sets up infinity war perfectly by dividing the avengers introducing new characters and bringing back old story lines that have more relevance
May 1 2018,positive,brilliant russo standard keeps being raised great politics done right great action stakes are realistic to their characters and black panther is absolutely perfectly realised in this unfortunately this film does a much better job with his character than his solo film
Apr 30 2018,positive,when i first saw it the thing that frustrated me the most is that nothing got resolved but after repeated viewings and discussion with folks i love it its a great character study and lets many iconic marvel heroes grow dynamically
Apr 29 2018,positive,very great movie i loved it it was great taking the avengers apart the only thing is that the winter solider got away with murder and i didnt like how at the end it was 2 against 1 with cap and bucky against iron man
Apr 29 2018,positive,engaging story great action dig deep into these characters you can feel the internal conflict hate to see friends fight but at the same time i love it  one of the best marvel movies so far
Apr 29 2018,positive,captain america civil war is an excellent film it is about the political involvement in the avengers activities that causes a rift between captain america and iron man chris evans and robert downey jr give amazing performances the screenplay is well written anthony and joe russo did great job directing this movie i enjoyed watching this motion picture because of the action and adventure captain america civil war is a must see
Apr 29 2018,positive,masterpiece everything about this movie was great
Apr 29 2018,positive,one of my favourite marvel movies maybe even my 1 favourite
Apr 28 2018,positive,on a whole the movie was okay  what we didnt like was watching the avengers implode from fighting each other for political reasons  as part of mcu it met the standards weve come to expect from marvel studios  the 3d effect cinematography actingall very good  it was a bit anemic when it came to humor but the actors managed to squeeze some out  after seeing avengers infinity war this past weekend and keeping captain america civil war in mind im convinced more than ever now that marvel studios  needs to keep the russo brothers far away from marvel studios movies    these days were surrounded by negativity anytime we turn on the news or read twitter  we dont need to see it reflected in a marvel movie  marvel was good at keeping a positive view on things  enough so for us to escape into for a few hours while watching it
Apr 26 2018,positive,while marvel and dc are perpetual rivals never before did they really go head to head with similar movies before the spring of 2016  after the massive disappointment of batman v superman marvel gave it a shot with their own version also an adaptation of one of the most popular comic stories of all time  i bring up dc because its hard to think about civil war without thinking of batman v superman because of how similar they are and how close their release dates were  and its quite clear that part of what made civil war great was that it succeeded where batman v superman failed  this review is not just hating on dc but it really is important  right when this movie came out the disappointment from bvs was still fresh on our minds  but enough about bvs on to civil war    marvel has two types of movies the mystical cosmic ones and the earthbased ones  this is clearly the latter  it feels more like winter soldier than any other marvel movie and not just because its a captain america movie  theres a lot of talk about the politics within the mcus world which is vital to the plot  the avengers are torn as to whether they should be put in check or not  for those who may not be interested in fictional politics this will be rather boring  its kind of like the politics in the star wars prequels only with way better writing  the sokovia accords are something interesting to thing about though  what if this was your world  would you want them kept in their place     the characters in this movie is the most important aspect  you have the clear division between cap and iron man where the tension they built over the previous few movies destroys their friendship  at the end of the movie when theyre fighting each other it is actually sad  you saw them build a relationship over the past few movies and now look at them  of course this movies show stealer was black panther  wow  everyone knew he would be a fun character to watch but he was much better than anticipated  the way his character develops makes for a very great subplot which this movie definitely needs  zemo is one of marvels best villains  he has no powers no supersuit no magic weapon none of that  all he has is an idea and some soviet secrets and you could very well argue that he wins in the end  theres an interesting relationship between scarlet witch and vision where she takes caps side to and vision takes tonys seeming more like a robot but yet with a bit of humanity in him  most of the rest of the avengers are just there for comic relief like antman and spiderman  thats welcome though  most of this movie takes itself quite seriously and the humor helps keep the mood up     the action scenes are fantastic  the airport battle is the best mcu action scene havent seen infinity war yet and its not even close  it goes on for 15 minutes and its fun to watch climactic and has some great lines thrown in  the final battle was epic emotional and a great end to a great movie  if there is one thing to complain about the movies a tad bit long  its just over 2 and a half hours  its still a great movie and one of my favorite mcu films to date  team cap
Apr 26 2018,negative,yet another superhero movie with predictable fight and chase scenes that i can barely muster the interest to watch while the premise is interesting the watchmen does it far far far more interestingly more edgy and darker the big ballnumbing cgi fight scene near the end between the rival heroes just beggars belief the have beef with each other but they clearly dont want to murder each other and yet theyre shooting deadly missiles and arrows all over the place like how would captain america actually feel if he murdered spider man the idea that they can fight like this and not accidentally maim or murder each other is just so hard to believe meanwhile theyre throwing jets around and shit causing billions of dollars in damage and probably killing a bunch of maintenance workers am i just too old for these movies or what
Apr 26 2018,positive,a comic book fans dream a super hero brawl that introduces spiderman to the mcu is the biggest treat in this one
Apr 25 2018,positive,civil war was not as good as i thaught it should have been iliked the ultimate edition of bm vs sm more than this movie most of it has to do with one thing the story i honestly did not see how the story was so great there were some details like bucky killing tonys parrents and steve trying to save bucky but overall i saw the story as you sine the acords your on iron man and the governments side you dont sine it your a crimanal with cap or retired and the worst part of the story was the villian zemo his plan all depends on knowing exactly where people are going to be exactly what they are going to do and exactly how they are going to respond how could he know cap bucky and tony were all going to be in the hydra base at the same time or that they would be together at all and how could he have known that tony would try to kill bucky spider man was one of the things i didnt like in this movie his jokes were pretty lame and corney spiderman didnt entertian me at all thank goodness for homecoming otherwise i would not be looking forward to the futer of mcu spiderman black panther on the other hand was awsome and his ambition to kill bucky for revenge of killing his father was the best part of the story in the movie and it was great when black panther relised bucky didnt do it and that he was letting revenge distoy himself as well as it was destroying tony in end the movie was fun action packed with cool fight sequences and had an ok story with lots more good character development
Apr 25 2018,positive,this film was really great it hit me in all the feels and the political agenda is so relevant the airport scene also fulfilled all desires so good
Apr 24 2018,positive,this is the best mcu movie to date and one of the best movies of all time
Apr 24 2018,positive,very good  my favorite movie now funny  suspenseful a great film if you have not seen it yet do it before you die
Apr 23 2018,positive,civil war was a fantastic marvel film the way the writers walked the tightrope of having heroes disagree with each other but still show respect was brilliant everyone knows tony stark is on the wrong side this movie but you dont hate him for it truly an epic movie for marvel fans and i loved every minute of it
Apr 23 2018,positive,captain america civil war 4 out of 5 this movie has great story telling and great action probably some of the best fight scenes from all of the avengers movies this is the way age of ultron should of been the feeling you had the whole film was realistic you felt like iron man and captain america were friends fighting each other for their beliefs spidermans part didnt feel forced and connected easily into disneys mcu overall a great film ill be seeing it again soon this is a must see for all marvel fans
Apr 22 2018,positive,93100  captain america civil war has some very serious and interesting themes the sokovia accords are a great way to divide the avengers and to cause a conflict zemo is a very interesting villain and delivers some great thoughts for the avengers to deal with the conflict captain america and iron man have is very compelling you want both sides to win but you know both sides cant win when you think the conflict is over and everything is settled a major plot twist brings everything to its knees again causing bucky to actually be a real enemy to tony sometimes the cgi was wobbly especially in the airport battle but it wasnt too obvious except for the floating head thing that tony had the russos really know how to handle characters in big ensemble movies even better than joss whedon tony is the best hes ever been since iron man and all of the other characters feel so much more real from their iterations in avengers age of ultron i gotta hand it to christopher markus and stephen mcfeely they really know how to write all the actors delivered great performances and great chemistry for a movie centered around captain america i didnt mind all the characters being on screen the score by henry jackman was also great and it might be just as great as the winter soldier soundtrack overall captain america civil war is a very important movie in the mcu and a very good one at that the russos did it again
Apr 20 2018,positive,even though the title shouldve been avengers civil war it one of the best marvel movie ever made everything on her is good i like how they introduce black panther and spiderman to the mcu excellent bucky escape scene excellent fight scenes but the best fight scene will always be captain america and the winter soldier vs iron man scene
Apr 18 2018,positive,loved this movie captain america is my favorite character great fight scenes  awesome storyline 
Apr 16 2018,negative,civil war is not good where were the confederates i love the confederates i want to have sex with a confederate captain america fought no confederates this movie angers me antman is bigger than my penis this upsets me why cant the antman be smaller i call upon the power of will shane to make the antman smaller thank youbrandon the blueberry slayer
Apr 16 2018,positive,this is probably one of my favourite marvel movies 
Apr 10 2018,negative,this was avengers 3 not a stand alone captain america movie if they wanted to do a third captain america movie could easy have crossbones as the main villian and have civil war as the true 3rd avengers film
Apr 8 2018,positive,while building a convincing political debate and growing tension to the point of collision captain america civil war ties the tips of steve and buckys story closing a triology with dignity and its worth emphasizing the balanced tone of the movie and the perfect introductions of black panther and spiderman
Apr 7 2018,positive,the movie was great however the addition of spiderman and antman picking random teams seemed like it didnt make sense
Apr 4 2018,neutral,despite having a lot of potential talent and starpower behind it the end result feels quite underwhelming the first act starts off fine and is quite interesting it feels like things are going in the right direction but then we reach the second act  this is where the big fights take place this act is riddled with fights but theres a huge problem there is absolutely nothing interesting about the fights there is no tension the characters do not act like theyre in a dangerous situation and joke around during the situation and though the jokes are funny sometimes they remove any trace of tension during the fights and the cgi feels awfully obvious the fact that the scenes are shot in a uninspired way along with a flat color palette doesnt help the situation at all in short the second act is uninspired and boring however towards the end of the second act we finally feel a sense of tension then we move to the third act the third act is amazing and the climax is one of the best in any superhero film but it isnt enough to save the film from a disappointing second act which takes up most of the film if the airport fight had been shortened to 10 minutes it would have made the second act much easier to sit through
Apr 2 2018,positive,this movie is nothing short of spectacular i wish dc made movies this good
Apr 2 2018,positive,a great conclusion to the captain america trilogy that makes you excited for what is next zemo is possibly one of the better mcu villains who had a motif and a thought provoking presence that he sprung upon the team
Mar 31 2018,positive,the only thing thats not amazing about this movie is the captain himself i dont think that captain america is that interesting of a character he is literally a buff guy in a dorky suit the best moments in the film are mostly iron man being himself
Mar 29 2018,positive,captain america civil war is an action packed movie and one of the better films in the mcu the film basically follows two storylines one involving the avengers and one revolving around captain america that builds off the events of the winter soldier the plot involving the avengers is the more interesting and well developed following the destructive events of many of their actions in previous films there are many in the world who question their intentions and safety to the world the united nations wants to pass the sokovia accords which would restrict and control the actions of the avengers this splits the team up with tony stark leading the way in favour of the accords and steve rogers questioning them this drives the premise of the film bringing together the heroes for another film despite this technically being a captain america film the plot that builds on the winter soldier revolves around bucky and events in 1991 bucky is still dangerous despite remembering who steve is and captain america does whatever it takes to save his life this drives the premise of the film as bucky is a wanted fugitive and anyone who chooses to protect him is considered a criminal too those who choose to side with captain america become wanted criminals and help steve in his quest to stop the villain zemo who is part of the reason why steve refuses to sign the sokovia accords zemo is another bland mcu villain receiving very little screen time and is very one dimensional in the scenes he is present he is important to the overall plot however especially in the third act but his motives are the only important thing about zemo despite the weakness of the villain the plot involving the avengers serves as the highlight of the movie the struggles and differing perceptions the team possess shows that even a group of socalled heroes with special abilities is vulnerable to disunity and are far from perfect the action sequences are visually stunning and serve as the highlights of the film the most notable being the airport scene involving all the heroes and the final fight of the third act these fights in particular are emotionally capturing and action packed the fight sequences in the first half of the movie are less impressive however the effects of these scenes are amazing but the heroes survive endless bullets and injuries making these sequences unrealistic at times the film also fails to kill off any major characters which make it hard to believe stakes are involved or the heroes are really in danger despite these drawbacks the fight sequences are some of the best in the mcu yet the pacing of the film is favourable as the run time is very long there are some slower portions of the movie but for the most part the film is well paced for a 147 minute run time the climax of the film is also incredible providing interesting and heart breaking twists before bringing iron man and captain america to their absolute heights as characters this will serve as an interesting premise moving forward into infinity war overall captain america civil war is an action packed and emotionally driven superhero adventure the story involving the avengers is amazing and provides many great action sequences which overcome another forgettable villain and an underdeveloped story that builds on the winter soldier
Mar 28 2018,positive,ill not beat around the bush this is how you do a superhero movie this movie is fantastic from start to finish the character arcs are great the visuals are stunning the story is gripping the list goes on it felt like a natural sequel to both winter soldier and age of ultron not an easy task    when this movie was first announced my biggest concern was that it was going to go away from a captain america  movie and be  more of an avengers movie this wouldnt be a bad thing but i feel that it would have taken away from the journey steve has been on since we met him way back in ww2 that is not the case luckily and this movie does a fantastic job of having all these massive characters on screen while never taking away from steve himself we follow his journey and ghosts from his past but we are also shown the larger mcu  and how just because people want the same thing doesnt mean they want to go about it the same way it is civil war after all so we needed a big character to stand against steve and his fight for righteousness the other big player in this movie was iron man    rdj was great in this we clearly see his motivations and what drives him to do what he does and why he believes in the accords he has done some terrible things why wouldnt he be made accountable for them his arc with bucky is great too and you feel the pain he has when finding out bucky killed his parents  this connection between steves old life and new also helped defined who he was and what he stands for their conflict pours over to include all the other avengers and it was great to see how their characters felt about the registration act none of their actions felt out of place and out of character which is a credit to the writers and the cast    i cant talk about the characters without talking about the 2 new ones introduced  black panther and spiderman both of them were awesome in their own way black panther was great and was it was good seeing a different aspect of a super hero we arent told a great deal about him but after the death of his father we see the kind of man he is we see how he is originally driven by anger and revenge but by the end we see that he has to be strong for his country and for his people    then theres spiderman when this was announced every fan both freaked out and started their own ideas of who and what they wanted for the new spiderman tom holland nailed it marvels perfect casting at work again the suit was great the quips were great the action was great spiderman was done perfectly no question    the action of the movie was also great the airport scene will go down in mcu history as one of the most aweinspiring spectacles on screen  seeing all the avengers fighting against each other was something i never thought id see but i am very glad i did the trailer had shown spiderman and the other avengers but the giant man twist was a great addition to an already fantastic set piece the other  actions scenes were also really good the crossbones chase was great and was a good way to introduce the sokovia accords the final fight with cap and tony was also great and it felt earned not just a fight for the sake of a fight    now it wasnt a perfect movie it did suffer from the usual mcu condition of not having a really good villain zemo wasnt bad by any means but he just felt a bit tacked on i enjoyed his plan and understood it but i understand the main complaint that a lot of it was down to luck rather than planning it is called civil war so i cant really fault this secondary villain too much but it is a negative against an otherwise perfect movie    verdict discharged    even with a slightly weak villain captain america civil war is the definition of a super hero movie i didnt think i could enjoy a movie more than winter soldier but then i saw this that is 2 for 2 for the russo brothers and this really has me excited to see what they can do with infinity war
Mar 23 2018,positive,captain america civil kerfuffle its pretty bizarre to have a film like this and put only a single characters name in the title since so many of the avengers team are in it its not so much a captain america movie as it is avengers assemble 15 but that isnt to say it wasnt enjoyable it has the same kind of thoughtful discourse and questions on the responsibilities of superheroes in modern society that youd expect from latterday marvel and the characters are still engaging likable and most importantly 3 dimensional  the most notable problems lie once again in its close quarters action sequences the camera still wobbles and moves too fast and the edits are still far too frequent for you to adequately gauge what is going on to whom and for what reason the director needs to pull back and slow down and the editor needs to do likewise it also suffers from blatant franchiseism trying its best to squeeze in as much foreshadowing for infinity war as it possibly can but despite all this i still really enjoyed it even at 2 hours and 27 minutes it never feels that long is never boring and the action when you can decipher it is exciting and always has a reason to exist its a worthy conclusion to a solid superhero trilogy
Mar 21 2018,positive,captivating intriguing and imaginative captain america civil war is the best super hero film marvel has ever made
Mar 19 2018,negative,not going to write a detailed synopsis of why i dislike this movie but compared to other marvel movies its not good they rushed characters into the story which is something dc tends to have a problem its rushed clunky and while in terms of regular movis its mediocre compared to marvel it just dosent add up
Mar 18 2018,positive,one of my most favourite marvel movies
Mar 18 2018,positive,plot was hard to follow  at times oh where oh where is pepper or is it just because they cant get gwyneth paltrow to sign a contract
Mar 15 2018,positive,a good movie once again another amazing cast with great performances nice inclusion with spiderman though  its realy a 3rd installment of the avengers
Mar 8 2018,negative,lets just fight for the hell of it so people will watch
Mar 6 2018,positive,personally one of my favorite mcu titles to date captain america proves to be an anomaly of marvel whose sequels only get better with every passing title
Mar 3 2018,positive,amidst a series of incredible action scenes and cgi so amazing youd swear they actually hired a giant paul rudd is a deep and interesting moral dilemma should we allow these superpowered vigilantes to continue and possibly let innocents die this film lets us see both sides of the argument and if you dont switch sides at least once youre being stubborn my only issue is that we have a villain zemo who is one of the better villains in the mcu but feels out of place in this film where there should be no real villain
Mar 3 2018,positive,this is the best film ever to me and my friend its the best captain america film good cast very cry scenes sometimes one of the very funny marvel flims
Mar 2 2018,positive,i enjoyed almost all of the movie there was awesome action great acting and also this introduces important characters into the mcu be sure to watch this on netflix before it is only on disneys streaming service that is yet to come out as of now
Feb 28 2018,positive,awesome debuts for spiderman and black panther great story and action sequences
Feb 26 2018,positive,this movie isnt very funny either and like winter soldier has a political based plot but the main difference here is that civil war is too cluttered with heroes and plot points while winter soldier is a lot more organized 
Feb 24 2018,positive,with this 3rd film cap wins the best franchise award with a little help from downey jr
Feb 23 2018,positive,pretty good  i liked how all of the characters started showing up  welcome back spiderman
Feb 23 2018,positive,this very well might be the best movie in the mcu yet it had great and memorable action a very interesting debate with compelling arguments for both sides and excellent characters with good reasons for them picking their sides and it did a very good job integrating almost all of the avengers into a movie that was mainly about captain america
Feb 22 2018,positive,whew that had a lot of different settings at hand however the duo brothers directing this movie did well to create this it will be an impactful movie
Feb 20 2018,negative,abysmal movie this movie should have been called captain america internal struggle as this was definitly not the epic civil war story this movie would have been fine had they not called it something it definitly was not
Feb 19 2018,positive,weak on villain strong on everything else  this movie is a blast  its super busy  do not watch when fatigued  you will be lost  stop reading my review and get to it    evans and rdj are terrific
Feb 18 2018,positive,by far my favourite film
Feb 17 2018,negative,thin characters over hyped sequences of cheesy b grade action forced humor and again the mcu forces tony stark as the central most important characterin a captain america movie
Feb 16 2018,positive,exceptional story line  and the right amount of people in screen per minute  the addition of spiderman and black panther was amazing
Feb 15 2018,positive,not bad at all surprising the marvel industry keeps finding creative ways to make good movies and keeping the storyline alive this is for sure one of their best ones it only gets better as the movies goes along
Feb 15 2018,positive,introducing many new characters and plotting 2 of the mcus biggest characters against each otherwhile it might sound like a recipe for disaster civil war over delivers on every way imaginable   ill give it             92
Feb 14 2018,positive,this movie is on another level of emotion captain america civil war is everything a marvel fan could expect its got the hype the thrill the drama the action the humour and every single thing we know and love from the mcu films the plot is simply perfect unexpected heartbreaking and pretty mature and the cast is on its highest hour special mention to robert downey jrs outstanding performance as tony stark and chris evans fantastic portray of steve rogers tom holland and chadwick boseman rock it as the anticipated spiderman and black panther respectively another must see for this cinematic universe
Feb 13 2018,positive,an attempt to give every character some screen time dragged the film out and left it feeling slightly disjointed i am not sure this worked
Feb 10 2018,positive,captain america civil war was a fantastic finale to the trilogy although it felt more like an avengers instalment it was packed with captain america like traits the plot was brilliant and set up an iconic fight scene between the disassembled avengers the action was some of the best from the mcu and the acting further boosted it unfortunately the villain was once again the downside of the movie proving less developed than previous antagonists the new additions to the cast proved excellent with tom holland as spiderman and chadwick boseman as black panther who both performed perfectly overall id give it an easily deserved 90
Feb 7 2018,positive,great movie with good character development and great action sequences great rewatch ability
Feb 6 2018,positive,excellent movie i love all the marvel avenger movies but please these people need to use less profanity
Feb 6 2018,negative,i have to rules concerning movies a good movie doesnt need to be longer than 90 minutes and you need a very good case to make it longer than 120 this wasnt neither
Feb 6 2018,neutral,title civil war  storywritingmessageplot2  characteracting3  musicsound2  cinematographyediting4  ageoriginality3  total1425
Feb 4 2018,positive,once this movie ended the first thing that came into my mind was this is what batman vs superman should have been captain america civil war stands tall as one of the best movies of 2016 and the best installment of the captain america series as if the winter soldier wasnt good enough this is on a whole nother level its got humor  great writing the tone is perfect and the action never is exhilarating especially the last few fights in the movie the introduction of black panther on the big screen is one of the biggest highlights of the movie honestly i cant think of anyone who would make for an awesome black panther because of chadwick boseman speaking of which the introduction of the new spiderman is another plus for me to me tom holland is the best spiderman out there especially after what we saw from him with spiderman homecoming and yes even better than tobey maguire who we all adore honestly i can go on and on about praising this movie but this is as much as i will do  i cannot stress enough about how much this movie is a thousand times better than batman vs superman and how this is the one that we deserve 9 out of 10 another example of how marvel is better than dc just saying
Feb 4 2018,positive,by far the best movie marvel has ever made
Feb 3 2018,positive,really good movie  dark and i like that more than the kiddiemovies  there is no sjw soapboxing in this movie unlike a lot of the new marvel ones  this is worth watching for sure
Feb 3 2018,positive,this is undoubtedly one of marvels best films this is also one of the best superhero films period the plot is solid its easy to care about the characters and the action sequences dazzle when cap and iron man duke it out its one of the best and most emotional fight scenes in the whole genre
Feb 3 2018,positive,awesome must see for avengers fans  thrill ride and well written
Jan 30 2018,positive,while captain america civil war once again shows that marvel really struggles with creating a compelling villain despite the fact its mostly a hero vs hero movie it has great action set pieces great story some great heart to heart moments and is a perfect way to set up some of these characters to get ready for avengers infinity war
Jan 25 2018,positive,exceptional my favourite marvel studio to date
Jan 22 2018,positive,works perfectly to introduce the new universe characters but falls short in the story pretty much the same story as all captain america and avengers movies the movie left a bit to be desired in terms of creativity
Jan 21 2018,positive,after the disappointing avengers age of ultron and good but not great antman in 2015 i was excited for captain america civil war i was team cap all the way but as the movie draws to a close i did not know which side was in the right this movie does a very good job with balancing the two sides so each one is right if you do not like what iron man is trying to do and you want cap to win then by the end of the movie you will sympathize with iron man the conflict here is done very well though the battle at the airport feels more like kids playing a paintball match then superheroes trying to beat each other to a pulp the story progresses along at a good pace and sprinkled throughout the movie there are twists and turn no one could see coming the biggest problem with the story is the sub plot with zemo while he gets off to a good start when he tortures the man in the motel he soon falls into the category of a bad mcu villain he is relatively forgotten and eventually shows up at the end black panther takes him down in a fairly pathetic way captain america was better in cap the winter soldier but he is still fine here iron man is good and shows a lot of emotion black widow is awesome at the start but is also kind of forgotten falcon is fine scarlet witch is much better now then she was in age of ultron winter soldier is again great but i preferred him in cap winter soldier hawkeye is also sort of forgotten i still do not like vision black panther is awesome war machine is meh he should have died so that the movie can feel like there was consequences paul rudd is again hilarious as antman and tom holland makes for the best cinematic spiderman ever crossbones is completely wasted my hopes have been answered for emily van camps character she is peggy carters great niece now marvel just has to explore caps relationship with her and her character can come full circle overall it is a great movie with a huge ensemble and lots of action but the bad villain and barely any consequences way it down thumbs up
Jan 16 2018,positive,marvels captain america civil war is not an avengers movie just because of the amount of heroes in this film doesnt have to automatically mean that this should be called avengers civil war    the reason why this is a cap movie is because of his struggle to protect his best friend bucky yes the accords are taking place and yes there are mixed opinions not to mention every fight scene cap partakes in also includes other heroes to back him up if this was really a civil war this wouldnt be a cap movie the only real reason its called civil war is because it correlates with the accords cap doesnt want to give up his best friend back in the days of world war ii no matter who or what comes in his way the final battle is not because oft the accords its because of the government wanting bucky for his manipulated actions when deep down cap knows that bucky didnt do anything however he has nothing to prove the 5 winter soldier event also had a part in the fight between the two factions caps team knew about zemos manipulation and founded out that his plan was to unleash the soldiers     zemo is probably one of my favorite main antagonists in any of the marvel films his motivation is good his plan is good and hes just a smart guy once cap iron man and bucky went to battle the soldiers a twist is revealed that zemo really just brought them here not to kill soldiers but each other the big reveal happens and thats when avengers are truly torn apart    the things that arent so good in this movie is plotholes involving zemos plan to counteract that argument though he did say he is very patient and took the time to study each avenger spiderman didnt need to be in this movie but i quite liked him
Jan 15 2018,positive,the best marvel movie this is a superhero movie that addresses real world issues and what it would he like if the avengers in existed i  modern day society the motives of both captain america and iron man are fleshed out and it is easy to look at things from both characters perspectives the action is top notch and the cinematography is great this is the pinacle of super hero movies right up there beside christopher nolans the dark knight
Jan 14 2018,positive,far better than dcs batman v superman civil war propels the marvel universe forward with a film that makes me super excited for whatever the studio has planned next
Jan 13 2018,positive,russo brothers are sixpack energy drink full the after party is too much and fortunately the phrase the more the merrier against all logic works    captain america civil war    russo brothers is painting the best of what this franchise can and does offer this peak of mcu pulls every cat out of the bag they can with political correctness that it breathes and a thrilling blood for blood revenge that it dwells on this scifi genre that mcu has been claiming it so arrogantly uptill now comes alive in this final chapter of steve rogers the film is not only confident but thought provoking where the makers being aware of the influence of these characters over the decades crafts into the storytelling wisely one of the primary reason why zack snyders dawn of justice fails to communicate with its momentum    what joss whedon failed to do in age of ultron russo brothers the directors does it with such ease that the previous chapter seems like a joke the depth that this film breeds in this accused franchise is impeccable in context to the passion of finally even attempting to raise bigger questions that not only puts its banner on trial but also exhales satire in those dinner table conversations and conflict breeds catastrophe so obvious is that conversation yet so enlightening on reaping the flag with a propaganda written in bold for each character in that room that may or may not emit their views    it must be hard to shake the whole double agent thing huh whips downey to johansson that has a much more gasping effect than any of the staged battles in the film probably the most underrated antagonist in the franchise all his clips edited and sprinkled on the storyline is much more nuanced that your usual scenarios in mcu there is a little green in your blue eyes he concludes and you know then and there with a satisfying feeling that the film has succeeded along with daniel bruhl that spirals out what they call it civil war he an empire fallen
Jan 12 2018,positive,civil war is the best marvel movie i have seen yet the storyline is good and it kiils me to see the avengers fight each other
Jan 10 2018,positive,this movie is really fun to watch even though i do have an issue or two with it  overall it is just a blast to watch  very few fans of marvel will regret watching this
Jan 7 2018,positive,i know a lot of people love this movie but i was rather lukewarm about civil war having read the comics this movie is titled after i wanted a deeper discussion about why each hero was picking which side and showing that theres more grey and nuance to the freedom vs security debate instead this movie rushes through the motivations for everyone to pick a side so it can get to the action case in point antman and hawkeye are practically afterthoughts whose motivations are glossed over so fast its almost insulting it is pretty cool to see all these heroes fighting each other using their powers creatively against and with one another but the substance isnt really there to make it more than just a summer blockbuster spectacle also spidermans appearance feels shovedin at the last minute and doesnt add much other than hey we reached a deal to put spidey in the mcu in fact having a child fighting in a conflict he doesnt understand just makes tony stark seem like more of a selfish idiot and harder to side with    if you think im nitpicking youll probably love this movie if you care about story and character motivations and dont mind if there isnt something exploding every 5 minutes you might be disappointed by this movie
Jan 6 2018,positive,marvel did a good job with captain america civil war when i saw the trailer i thought it was great i new i had to see it and so i saw it well done pick your team shell it be team cap or iron 
Jan 4 2018,positive,this was one of the best moves ever
Jan 4 2018,negative,as a joke really good i couldnt stop laughing because all the movie was ridiculous as a super hero movie pretty bad as any marvel movie since avengers 2 nothing nez too much jokes and characters being stupid when they are supposed to be intelligent
Jan 3 2018,positive,i dont think you need to see me praise this film its been praised enough already
Jan 3 2018,positive,favorite out of the whole captain america trilogy
Jan 2 2018,positive,i dont exactly adore the concept of the avengers fighting against one another but other than that the movie was amazing
Jan 2 2018,positive,very entertaining and thoughtprovoking but set back by some character inconsistencies a few scenes of poorly shot action and being a bit of a muddled story in some regards
Jan 2 2018,neutral,its fine that the audience loved this movie but how is it the same critics that give other more well written well acted movies scores in the 60 and 70 percent range gave this movie a 91 did we watch the same movie    this movie was an excuse to cram in as many marvel heroes as possible sprinkle a small amount of storyline and a ton of thoughtless action scenes together i regret watching this movie in theaters     dont get me wrong i love marvel but all the avenger series suck     my favorite marvel movies  the 1st xmen 90s  xmen first class 2011  guardians of the galaxy 12  iron man only the first of the series
Dec 31 2017,positive,pretty good id give it 85
Dec 31 2017,positive,loved seeing all the different characters and the fight between them was brilliant and entertaining to watch the politics of it were good and the characters decisions were also some of it was a bit thin in why they chose particular sides and the beginning of the film didnt really get me excited for the rest of it not sure what the outcome or purpose of the film really was especially with the release of the infinity war trailer but of a gap filler film really
Dec 30 2017,positive,one of the better marvel movies to release yet great implementation of characters such as spiderman iron man and many more
Dec 29 2017,positive,i need six stars loved it    loved the real tension between characters and worldviews a persuasive way of helping children and adults realize that our heroes arent onedimensional people  and even heroes can have genuine differences of opinion about right choices
Dec 29 2017,neutral,movie was dark  but constantly jokes around in a way it would downplay the experience it had too much forced humour  tone inconsistency    plot is left to luck and chance
Dec 29 2017,positive,its big and loud and fun with a decently interesting plot to boot
Dec 26 2017,positive,this was basically avengers 25 and welcome home spidey
Dec 25 2017,negative,easily the worst thing the mcu has ever put out every performance is phoned in  every plot point is nonsense  every single action sequence is tedious and poorly filmed  single handedly killed any enjoyment ive gotten out of these mindless popcorn flicks tony is mad at steve and they fightand then about a million characters show up to run at each other no one cares and no one tried  the airport sequence is so bad it will make you rethink your life
Dec 25 2017,positive,ok i watched this when it came out in theater and just happened to step on some thread about it to remind me that i should rate it and give some thoughts  though there may be a good possibility that im missing some stuff initially i was with cap because i didnt like the accords but then i got a few problem with cap himself his line we are giving up if were not taking responsibility for our actions sounds all fine and dandy if we were shown how cap does take responsibility for the collateral damage and countless victims is he paying for the destruction does he deal with apologiesexplanations as a public figure to government reporters etc we will never know because we were never shown one cap sounds logical but does he propose anything useful instead to satisfy the reasons that the accords first raised from if he doesnt he is just another vigilante who makes himself sound like a hero its really immature if one thinks gosh they saved the world without them more would have died so its illogical that they are being held responsible or being criticized or being restricted to some government accords  thats like a punishment rather than a praise for saving the day as a captain you have to be able to give alternative plans on how to take responsibility and convince the public that they are not just boundless vigilantes and lastly cap should have explained every little details about buckyhydra situation to make tony understand and make an apology for not telling him like a true captain would do to a teammate right after successfully damaging the suit enough that tony cant make another attempt to kill bucky sending a letter after heat has cooled down is understandable but he should have done it at the spot as well to be more effective and logical really i remember hearing you dont have to do this line and thinking thats not really the tone or words you use to calm down a person talk more sympathetically towards tony who just learned the truth about his parents death plus i dont know if it was just poor directing or acting but the scene where cap dropped the shield and carried bucky out just seemed oddly cold and indifferent his attitude and the camera angle were just somehow weird maybe its because i thought more appropriate response from cap is sympathetic undertone since cap in my head is a character who can relate yet be logical as for tony he did all the flawed yet understandable things within his character tony isnt a perfect character of virtue moreover he does stuff to take responsibility in his own ways like funding the avengers taking initiatives like damage control and agreeing to sign sokovia accords yes all those attempts of taking responsibility are flawed and create problems but thats not really the point at least he is not all talk
Dec 24 2017,positive,it was an amazing summer blockbuster film it was funny entertaining seriousminded all in one production in a very right way my only problem with it is only that the cgi was too much and too obvious also the plot with zemo actually could have been executed so much better nevertheless it was awesome
Dec 24 2017,negative,ridiculous plot nonsensical motivations all to create a fun 20 minute fight scene fraught with no peril or concern for characters well being
Dec 24 2017,negative,one of those movies where i just cant understand how anyone was able to like it i even thought the graphics were bad for this one a lot of computer battles that just looked bad
Dec 24 2017,positive,movie was good to go but towards the end it begins to fall off zemo must be a psychic to know that messy plan would work out would have rather seen civil war as a deep trilogy post thanos and instead have a more interesting captain america 3 that sees him dealing with the fallout of the shieldhydra chaos
Dec 24 2017,negative,i wish i could give this crap 0 stars 2nd to worst marvel movie only fan4stic was worse total waste of talent and ridiculous story line the only good part of the movie was black panther 
Dec 23 2017,positive,captain america civil war has began the chapter for the marvel cinematic universe as a mature breath taking humourless movie packed with extensive action sequences and unimaginable themes
Dec 23 2017,positive,a fun time got what we expected  and spiderman too awesome
Dec 22 2017,positive,a bold and giant step in the right direction a film where the stakes seem really high and the tension and action stay in line with that feeling only bettered by iron man 1 and the winter soldier cracking superhero team upthat might never be topped
Dec 21 2017,positive,civil war would make my top 10 marvel movies picking up on our own cultures culture wars this movie taps and channels two different visions of what america is about cap standing for freedom and iron man and his authoritiarian spin sets up for one of the greatest hero vs hero fight scenes in the marvel universe  with lots of action humor the introduction of the new spidey this movie works and shows why the marvel formula is so successful great actors great script depth staying close to the characters origins and yet a fresh new take
Dec 21 2017,positive,awesome movie so many characters thrown into one movie and it works  great story and action scenes the big battle between all the heroes was a lot of fun to watch fantastic casting of both newcomers black panther and spiderman climax was intense and wellhandled russo brothers are great directors
Dec 21 2017,positive,avengers 25 was an okay film  however i just dont believe tony start would act the way he does towards capt  that  s why i lowered by one star  if they had done a better job as to tell us why these two are fighting each other then the movie would be better  also 5v5 is not really a war is it  misleading title
Dec 20 2017,positive,basically avengers 25 great film no real problems i had with the movie
Dec 19 2017,negative,captain america does something and iron man dislikes it they then fight and random characters show up for no apparent reason in this absolute mess of a film bad acting bad action sequences bad characterization bad plot and bad cinematography much worse than average disney marvel movie  the air port fight sequence is so awful it will make you rethink your life and how you cant believe you wasted hours of your life watching a bunch of  action figures run at each other  also who the hell was filming bucky and tonys parents how is that a twist tony already disliked bucky so it doesnt even change anything bravo russo bros
Dec 19 2017,negative,sad what else can be said this looked like the tv cartoon of xmen from the 1980s but with worse dialog acting and no direction
Dec 18 2017,positive,what an awesome movie so engaging and suspenseful great action sequences awesome characters and story
Dec 17 2017,negative,overrated piece of crap movie is so forgettable after a year i couldnt even recall why on earth would all these costumed freaks fight
Dec 16 2017,neutral,i wait until the day that marvel can implement something new into their movies so it doesnt feel like your watching the same movie over and over again
Dec 16 2017,positive,another solid addition to the mcu that pits our favorite heroes against each other with believable motivations and heavy consequences the story and the primary villain feel weak and underwhelming but serve their purpose in getting our heroes to the right place at the right time
Dec 15 2017,negative,garbage movie that should be allowed to call itself a sequal to captain america the winter soldier    the story arcs of the captain america character ensemble get relegated to a bplot for the sake of some avengers bullshit    the introduction of tchalla the black panther was the only redeeming factor
Dec 14 2017,positive,great movie great to see the playoff between loyalty and the various repercussions it can cause
Dec 14 2017,positive,a perfectly well constructed movie
Dec 10 2017,positive,this movie brings a lot of background for the next avenger movie i like how it developed two new characters spiderman and black panther
Dec 10 2017,positive,the blockbuster of the year civil war doesnt fail to have a clear motivation the plot introduces black panther but not in the best way there are some holes in the plot such as where did the hulk go despite this the actions scenes were incredible and the huge cast is awesome the plot is great with great drives to reach an epic climax awesome and epic movie
Dec 9 2017,positive,holy  love the showdown esp antman goes big
Dec 8 2017,positive,civil war is a fun film with lots of action which all superhero movies have seeing more heros and having them all bundled into one film is a nerds dream sadly this film is more talk than action which left me bored with all the dialouge instead of the action that we came to see it is a good film but not great
Dec 3 2017,positive,civil war is as fun and action packed as any superhero movie lover can want its humor and action that weve seen though so why do people love this movie its because of how this film is constructed and what the filmmakers did with the characters they created an organically made conflict and let the viewers seep into the conflict by really giving us compelling scenes where characters open about why they are doing what theyre doing and spend time showing the actions take place through the humor and fun action theres an emotional core of human choice and broken friendship that is fleshed out magnificently with these great character moments and perfect insertions of serious dialogue and action that creates a unique superhero extravaganza
Dec 2 2017,negative,crammed with countless characters that the movie cant seem to make you care about civil war is a dull stakeless emotionless actionfest that refuses to push the boundaries of the superhero franchise
Dec 2 2017,negative,of course its marvel movie yes it automatically gets a 90 rt rating for this dribble they call a movie  most of marvels characters are just so boring to watch  black panther black widow hawkeye what the hell are their powers supposed to be  i mean how lame
Dec 1 2017,positive,while not as a good as the comic its based on civil war has its moments and kickass action scenes definitely one of the better movies of the mcu theres real tension to be seen here
Nov 30 2017,positive,great acting a lot of emotions great special effects and good humor make this one of my favorite marvel movies i didnt think id enjoy it much but i was very wrong chris evans role as captain america is particularly good here as he is given more depth to work with as is sebastian stan as winter soldier
Nov 29 2017,negative,misleading title its no war its a falling out that turns into a play fight full of unnecessary jokes terrible writing and pointless giant man marvel get away with anything its ridiculous 
Nov 26 2017,negative,dreadful in every respect
Nov 26 2017,positive,i really enjoyed everything about this movie it talks about all the characters so well although i would have gone deeper on black widow it was incredible to see new spiderman portrayed by tom holland i am really looking forward yo watching infinity war
Nov 24 2017,positive,with solid action a likable cast of characters and again great acting this installment works despite the fact it takes itself a bit too seriously
Nov 24 2017,positive,different from the comics but still a great movie
Nov 24 2017,positive,civil war might be considered as a bold approach to the mcuit was not meant to be funny but rather to be a much darker and serious compared to the previous films of the mcuit does succeed at creating a heavy atmosphere but sadly it all crumbles in the second part of the movie returning back to its old self with an incoherent justification for the creation of that civil war between captain america and iron manthe end product is a rather good attempt from marvel trying to tackle a genre which suits dc betterit remains a good movie though
Nov 23 2017,positive,whats the big deal with the airport fight scene this movie sets up huge stakes in the first act only to stript them away in the second and wayyyyy over complicate things in the third also captain america is the wrong guy in his own movie hes already on the wrong side of the sokovia debate with tony and then they add in bucky as if i give a shit about him to make him extra fartbrained
Nov 21 2017,positive,more the third avengers movie than the third cap movie but its still really fun and entertaining with some cool action set pieces airport scene anyone introduces black panther for time on film and spidey into the mcu both well done
Nov 20 2017,positive,captain america civil war somehow manages to be extremely fun and emotionally engaging experience at the same time making this the best marvel cinematic universe film yet this is a must see for any fan of the mcu or fan of the comic book genre in general captain america civil war is a testament to how strong the mcu and comic book genre is coming along
Nov 19 2017,positive,just another marvel movie prefer the first avenger to this though
Nov 19 2017,positive,potentially the best film in the mcu civil war brings together all of the heroes of previous entries and then some learning from the mistakes of overcrowding age of ultron with sidestories civil war has one central story of the ethics of being a hero by having so many characters in one film it truly shows how for this franchise has come and makes you yearn for more the introduction to both black panther and spiderman fit perfectly in the story and are played fantastically by their respected actors the best part of it all though is that there is still more to come in the future from these people
Nov 19 2017,positive,superhero fatigue is a problem that many people think is starting to settle in fantastic four was an abysmal film and it made less than spy kids 3d game over batman v superman dawn of justice received terrible reviews and had one of the biggest friday to sunday drops are people sick of these films well not if youre in the marvel family it seems for one thing marvel actually takes pride and careful attention to detail with their films both the previously mentioned titles are rush jobs for specific reasons civil war is proof that the good guy vs good guy aspect of superhero films can be done right    the world wants to hold the avengers accountable for all the death and destruction theyve caused over the years so the united nations put together the sokovia accords which means the avengers would work for them tony stark supports this steve rogers does not things get more complicated when bucky turns up again and is the prime suspect in a bombing that kills dozens of people with two prominent members of the avengers on opposing sides of the issue will the team ever be the same again    civil war has a lot going for it stellar cast great characters topnotch special effects excellent action sequences comedic relief andwell the list goes on the russo brothers have delivered a slick action film that makes me comfortable with the fact that they seem to be at the helm of the marvel franchise now when the avengers was first announced i thought it was going to be dreadful then they said these guy named joss whedon was going to be directing it and my expectations instantly changed whedon delivered a great superhero film that set up the rest of the films to come the russo brothers now have the task of juggling all these characters and they do an admirable job    each character has their shining moments but the core of the story is stark vs rogers so while its fun to have rudd come in and have a few laughs i dont think anyone is expecting huge things from his character same with spiderman who is forced in here to set up his future films within this weird shared universe with sony those are not complaints they both work wonderfully in the film if i were to find a complaint it would be in the thought process of the villain zemo his plan is so painstakingly convoluted that i wonder how it even worked at all too many things need to fall in place for him to get what he wants and it distracts from the emotional power of the climax the actors and the history with the characters manage to save it a bit and do raise the stakes but i had my problems nonetheless    the grand spectacle at the airport between these characters was indeed a highlight when you have characters like vision and scarlet witch who are so powerful they could end the fight instantly its a good idea to have them simply do damage control i wondered how they would handle these two they did a decent job of it after this film i can only hope that infinity wars goes this route and gives each avenger a worthy foe to fight and not a hoard of mindless foot soldiers which is exactly what the previous two avengers films did     fans of the series will be pleased the action is great a bit shaky at first but they let it breath later on and some great introductions of new characters that will bring a fresh perspective to the franchise black panther for one steals a lot of the scenes he is in bold move to have such a big character show up in the film without a solo movie to set him up but it works here the cast is diversifying as more and more characters come into these films and im glad to see it tony stark is great rdj does a great job with him but weve seen the guy have a big role in these films 6 times now i get that marvel is scared to let some of these characters go because they are so integral to everything but i honestly believe something along these lines needs to happen to bring more emotional depth to the franchise for a studio willing to take chances are projects like guardians of the galaxy they need to take a chance1st civil war is basically a copy of bvs a government building gets blown up by a bomb killing a prominent government official a villain manipulating heroes into fighting    2nd too many characters just popping up without any reason at all and just shoehorned into the movie  antmangiant man  black panther  hawkeye was retired now suddenly abandons the girlfriend and kids to come back and help a fugitive escape from the authorities  the annoying spiderkid more annoying than jar jar binks in the phantom menace did more talking than fighting    3rd after all the buildup about a disagreement over the issues of collateral damage and government oversight of the heroes those issues were completely trivialized by a big fight that was nothing more than a friendly sparring contest with bad oneliners thrown in are we still going to be friends after this we havent met before mr stark what do i do now you have a metal arm im from queens im from brooklyn    was the civil war supposed to be a real fight for something they believed in or just a jokeoff to determine who could deliver the best jokes    4th mcu fans had been saying for months that captain america was justified in opposing government oversight of the heroes because he didnt want the avengers to be controlled by hydra but it wasnt hydra who requested the sokovia accords it was the united nations    the avengers had caused massive deaths and destruction so the united nations wanted oversight of the avengers but captain america didnt want the avengers to be held responsible and have to answer to the people for the massive deaths and destruction that they caused    captain america wanted the avengers to be the supreme authority exactly like hitler stalin and saddam hussein made themselves the supreme authority to make decisions on whats best for the people instead of letting the elected representatives of the people make decisions on whats best for the people like the way a democracy works so basically captain america opposes democracy and favors tyranny    5th plenty of plot holes and lazy contrived writing tony stark had called secretary of state ross to evacuate the airport prior to the big fight so ross knew before the big fight that the captain america and the bucky were planning to hijack a plane at that airport    so why didnt ross just have military fighter jets hovering in the sky nearby in case they succeed in hijacking a plane theres already a shoot on sight order for bucky so if they succeed in hijacking a plane then the military fighter jets can just fly in and either shoot at their plane to force them to land or shoot down their plane    since captain america and bucky cant fly on their own their powers are useless when theyre inside a plane being fired upon by military fighter jets and their plane wouldnt be able to evade military fighter jets but the script needed captain america and bucky to escape so that it could set up the final fight between iron man and captain america    also the 1st half of the movie is all about tony stark trying to get all the avengers to sign the sokovia accords which state that the avengers would operate only when approved by a un panel then in the 2nd half of the movie tony recruits peter parker to join his team even though peter is a minor and wouldnt be able to sign a legal document and thus wouldnt be approved by the un panel to operate under the sokovia accords    another egregious error is that the whole movie set up bucky as the killer of iron mans parents thus setting up the main conflict in the movie but why would there be video footage of their accident on some random back road in 1991 and how did whomever filmed the video footage know to place the camera at that exact spot where their car crashed and not a mile ahead or a mile behind where the car crashed    if there was video footage then wouldnt iron man or jarvis or even ultron have stumbled across it by now tony hacked classified government networks in seconds in iron man 2 hacked shield in the avengers and has apparently been watching peter parker on a regular basis seems like he would have found video footage of his parents deaths a long time ago    and better yet how could the coroner rule their deaths an accident when the ligature marks around maria starks neck and the fist imprints in howard starks face would have been immediately evident in the autopsy was the coroner just incompetent    also tony stark believed his parents died in an accident and never suspected foul play at all so how did zemo know that their accident from 25 years ago was actually foul play how did zemo know there was video footage from 25 years ago of tonys parents being murdered and how did zemo find that footage when tony never knew about or found that same footage    tony stark was more angry at steve rogers because steve knew but didnt tell him so how did zemo know that steve knew the accident 25 years ago was actually foul play    those are massive pills were asked to swallow that exist only because they conveniently set up the final conflict between iron man and captain america now thats some mighty contrived writing    6th another forgettable mcu villain zemo was about as invisible in civil war as luke skywalker was in the force awakens    7th critics and haters of bvs complained about how lex knew superman is clark kent and how superman knew batman is bruce wayne but there was no explanation at all for how tony stark knew spiderman is a high school kid in queens
Nov 19 2017,negative,this movie was so bad and so boring i wanted to like it but i just couldnt horrible horrible 
Nov 19 2017,negative,kept wondering if it was another avengers sequel
Nov 18 2017,negative,just awful just terrible a horrible waste of some great characters dont waste your time
Nov 18 2017,positive,very congested trying to give each hero ample screen time barron zemo was a throw away villain used to movie the plot along strong visually and introduction of black panther was great addition for future marvel movies 
Nov 17 2017,positive,another great marvel flick great action a realistic feel and well paced for a film with many characters this film earned its 45 stars i hope marvel makes more movies like this in the future
Nov 17 2017,positive,entertaining good rhythm but with a few visual excesses show as a logical story consequence of humanity permanent corruption and distrust a relatively forced script introduces interestingly new characters increasing the complexity of the marvel cinematic universe and preparing for future releases
Nov 16 2017,negative,the most interesting story involving crossbones lasts a total of 15min the rest of the movie is predictable and little intensity as there is no threat we know the heroes wont kill eachother and the villain of the story is just as forgettable as the winter solider villain
Nov 16 2017,negative,what a waste of a movie for marvel comic fans i am sure it hit the target however for the everyday joe looking for entertainment and story it was horrible on the lower end of quality marvel films
Nov 16 2017,negative,hot mess with no stakes as per all marvel films
Nov 15 2017,negative,wretched and im being kind nothing like the winter soldier no intrigue or cleverness the movie was completely predictable and missing a worthy villain i fell asleep after the first couple of minutes because the opening scene was just stupid also tony stark must be going through manapause fir this entire film his character makes no sense whatsoever hes probably the worst part of the entire film also black panther is cool but hes a little to old to be acting so childish the only two characters that were interesting were bucky and cap the rest of the characters are just boring and bring nothing to the movie the whole climactic fight between cap and iron man was also very childish for almost a decade weve heard nothing about starks mom and all of a sudden we are suppose to believe that he loved her so much hes willing to kill two innocent people to avenge her very stupid and ridiculous then nemo wants to bring down the avengers and at the end of the movie hes all proud of himself but the moron actually made super dangerous groups with the guy responsible for killing his family helming the avengers talk about not thinking it all the way through if i could i would give it negative stars and slap all the critics who gave this movie such a high rating
Nov 15 2017,positive,get rid of scarlet witch
Nov 9 2017,positive,while civil war will never beat winter solider i love how this roster of well developed characters fight each other making it a very emotionally charged movie
Nov 7 2017,positive,action scenes a greatspider man is great and so was black panther
Nov 4 2017,positive,a good action film with some interesting themes though i found some of the characters i felt like you were suppose to root for unlikable and inconsistent also i had problems with the risks hawkeye took in this movie after the extent he went to to protect his family in previous films tom holland was fantastic in his debut as spiderman overall a very entertaining movie though i didnt love it as much as others
Nov 3 2017,positive,personally i thought this was the best mcu installment to date it has more grit than the others with just a touch of comic relief thats what i view as a winning formula
Oct 31 2017,positive,captain america cililmwar pushes the themes of friendship and revenge hard in a fun and heartbreaking ensemble movie that contains one of the best action scenes in superhero movie history
Oct 30 2017,positive,perhaps more of an avengers film rather than a solo captain america one nevertheless civil war shows us a new side of our favourite heroes and seeing them disagree with one another and tear the group apart is something new and definitely one thing that will be remembered another great thing is the introduction of new characters including black panther and spider man both of which became fan favourites after the film and carried on to have extremely successful solo films
Oct 29 2017,positive,while the key components of the mcu are still working smoothly the film more often than not seems to almost topple under the weight of the mythos its supposed to carry given the lineup involved its easy to forget that this is a captain america focused film which means that it skips the cynical selfawareness of other mcu series and adds a good dose of pathos and rather numbskulled naiveté too bad that characters such as tony stark suffer due to this as the plot  in order to reinforce the captain america films trademark directness  requires them to be unable to communicate like adults that would resolve the main issue in an instant and make the entire conflict redundant
Oct 27 2017,negative,the worst mcu film to date the big hero fight was a lackluster letdown and the villain was terrible the comic book version was a bigoted nazi scientist who created a formula to remain young his adopted children were all brainwashed the film drastically changes the zemo character into a soccer dad with a legitimate hatred towards the avengers how did mr suburbia zemo outsmart a superhero team that has the combined iq of a supercomputer
Oct 27 2017,positive,incredibly well balanced despite the number of characters
Oct 24 2017,positive,captain america civil war marvels critical and commerical success civil war not only set the stage for other marvel movies but was one of the most mature entrys in the series filled with action and story
Oct 22 2017,positive,civil war took on a very challenging task of having 10 main characters in a film and they did it flawlessly this is probably my favorite movie of 2016 and definitely in my top 3 mcu films as of homecoming it felt more like an avengers movie than the third captain america movie but it didnt change anything chadwick boseman did a really good job as black panther and as someone whos not insanely excited for the black panther solo film i hope that he gives a performance as great as he did in civil war the movie encapsulates you from the opening scene and it continues throughout the entire film the airplane scene may be one of my favorite action sequences in any movie ive seen this is before infinity war tom holland owned the role of spiderman and i loved how they introduced him civil war is definitely a movie all directors should watch before making a picture because it shows how well they utilized all these characters at once
Oct 19 2017,positive,loved this but its pretty depressing towards the end
Oct 18 2017,positive,combining the noncartoonish type of plot of captain america the winter soldier the sheer awesomeness of the first iron man and the ensemble cast of the avengers and age of ultron captain america civil war is one of the best superhero movies of all time its only noticeable flaw is a common one in the mcu the color palette is kind of bland fortunately it compensates with an expertly written script oscarworthy performances and some of the best action in superhero movie history
Oct 15 2017,positive,best captain america film to date felt very avengers like with most of the avengers cast present throughout the movie
Oct 13 2017,positive,excellent film the airport battle was simply amazing and i loved the inclusion of spiderman and black panther my only problem is steve protecting bucky throughout the whole film even when tony finds out the truth about his parents death
Oct 12 2017,positive,the marvel cinematic universe can boast that its installments have been just decent at worst which is a great problem to have however i dont think anybody could have predicted how great captain america civil war would be on numerous levels granted i was excited for this one anyway aside from the fact it would be the mcus take on the civil war storyline that occurred in the comics a decade prior the winter soldier had been a significant improvement over the first avenger which was still a really good film leading me to wonder if civil war would continue that trend it did and how first of all if you are worried that this is too crowded of a movie avengers 25 i remember hearing due to the size of the cast dont fear  this is still distinctly captain americas film conversely if you are worried that some of the characters dont get their time in the spotlight everyone adequately gets time to shine and contribute to the story while discussing each acting performance would take a great deal of time i would in remiss if i didnt specifically address the two main leads at least to date this i believe is the best weve seen chris evans and robert downey jr play steve rogers and tony stark which is no small feat thanks to both their performances and the writing we can really see how far these two characters have come since their debut movies i also would like to give special shoutouts to chadwick boseman and tom holland in their debuts as black panther and spiderman respectively both shine here and give the mcu a bright future i also cannot neglect to mention the films action scenes which are the absolute best this franchise and perhaps any superhero films in general has seen without going into specifics i will say that the airport sequence is a new high watermark for superhero action it will be tough for marvel or dc and fox for that matter to top the action here overall in case you couldnt gleam this from my amateur review captain america civil war should not be missed by any movie fan not just marvel fans
Oct 12 2017,positive,surprisingly convincing
Oct 9 2017,positive,great superhero movie
Oct 8 2017,positive,good coop fights which is what i came for some of the additional characters are more valuable than others and theres too much moping around but its less tedious than some mcu fare
Oct 7 2017,positive,could do with our the villains plan
Oct 3 2017,positive,eight years ago marvel took the reigns of the superhero genre with iron man twelve films later and batman superman and the xmen are still playing catch up with both the comic book fan and casual moviegoer in the palm of its hand marvel could have played it safe with this one a runof themill action fest would have brought in the dough while also entertaining the masses but yet again marvel showed us why its number one    captain america civil war poses a question that may have crossed your mind while watching the avengers or age of ultron in the midst of the mindblowing action taking place on screen how many innocent civilians were killed    within the first half hour of the film the avengers are shown footage from major events in past marvel movies but rather than enjoying a shot of the hulk smashing a few aliens into a building the heroes see pieces of that building crush a bystander filming the chaos from his phone instead of watching captain america throw his mighty shield they are treated to the lifeless eyes of a woman caught in the crossfire of superhero and super villain    shortly following this earths mightiest heroes are presented with a document called the sokovia accords which states that the avengers must place themselves under the command of the united nations or retire tony stark signs steve rogers doesnt ultimately pitting the two heroes against one another and leaving the rest to choose a side    while technically a captain america story civil war plays out more like an avengers 25 which works in the films favor the russo brothers mesh the darker tone of captain america the winter soldier with the humor of guardians of the galaxy masterfully balancing a plethora of characters new and old the dialogue is thought provoking the action is spectacular and the performances have never been better
Oct 1 2017,positive,the directors did a pretty great job balancing the film with that many characters
Sep 27 2017,positive,what do i need to say its a masterpiece
Sep 20 2017,positive,i have watched this movie 5 times and cant get bored of it love everything about it
Sep 19 2017,positive,screenplay its good
Sep 16 2017,positive,grippingemotional compelling characters great visual effects chris evans and robert downey jr  give there best performances ever  and the plot is amazingly relatable captain america civil war is everything a blockbuster movie should be and the best marvel movie to date
Sep 15 2017,positive,while the plot of the first 2 avengers films involved our heroes fighting amongst each other and teaming up later to beat up the bad guy this film involves only our heroes fighting amongst each other in little more than a marvel royal rumble which is ok but not particularly good and certainly not spectacular
Sep 11 2017,positive,one of the best action films of the last decade
Sep 10 2017,positive,as we speak about action scenes and persoal confrontations between the main characters in the mcu captain america civil war is one marvel movie for the ages and surely a future classic as well as a model for other blockbusters however martin freeman has literally nothing to do sharon gives her contribuition for the plot but the romance between her and steve rogers is highly forced and the motivation behind hawkeyes decision is not quite developed hes an avenger as well he should have some participation in the sokovia accords but in the end the fights between our beloved characters will make this movie fully unforgettable
Sep 9 2017,neutral,the beginning was interesting but then it became boring it feels like they talked about the consequences of the characters actions to appear serious for 10 minutes and then we had to endure another tonysteve conflict   also i dont like how tony got peter parker involved spiderman has powers but hes still a teenager tony should have known better than to make him fight against trained soldiers and enhanced people  the fight between the two sides was disappointing too the characters were supposed to fight for their convictions for what they believe in not making jokes every two seconds   255
Sep 9 2017,positive,wonderful movie possibly my favorite from story to visual effects to drama to fight scenes to character to cast this is where its at  i choose team anti registration because as cap said if you see a situation pointed south you cant just ignore
Sep 8 2017,negative,totally contrived and stupid plot just to make the good guys fight each other  this is something marvel seems to be obsessed with      remember the avengers fighting each other in the first avengers movie  hulk fought thor  black widow fought hawkeye  thor and iron man fought until captain america showed up and thor brought the hammer down onto caps shield     remember hulk vs iron man in the hulkbuster armor in age of ultron  remember scarlet witch and quicksilver fighting the avengers before joining the avengers themselves    star lord gamora rocket and groot fight each other in guardians of the galaxy before they become friends    iron man and war machine fight in iron man 2    thor fights hulk yet again in thor ragnarok      daredevil fights punisher in the netflix daredevil series  jessica jones fights luke cage in jessica jones  iron fist fights luke cage in the defenders  and so on      this movie continues marvels obsession with forcing the good guys to fight each other  captain america iron man bucky falcon war machine black widow hawkeye antman spiderman black panther vision scarlet witch  they all fight each other    there are some lame cringeworthy attempts at humor while the good guys fight each other undermining the seriousness of the whole thing  the only casualty due to all this fighting is one of the black guys war machine   no one cared about him anyway and he doesnt even die  robert downey jr just phones it in these days because he knows no one who watches these comic book movies has a brain
Sep 8 2017,positive,captain america civil war is a great and average marvel super hero movie packed with action and adventure it really packs a punch and is very fun and exciting to watch
Sep 8 2017,positive,the best marvel movie seen the avengers
Sep 6 2017,positive,what an incredible movie  i cannot get enough of this action packed emotional and well written story
Sep 2 2017,positive,its all action now iron man and captain are not getting a long at this point and so that means only one thing what do we do we fight so cap and iron man chose who will be on there team you know its a funny movie i was laughing at some parts of this movie  now pick your team that you    will be on team captain or team iron man
Aug 31 2017,positive,wao captain america never lets me down what a movie
Aug 25 2017,positive,the best of the mcu and one of the best superhero movies of all time
Aug 25 2017,positive,the best and most memorable film in the mcu  455
Aug 19 2017,positive,too many people side with cap on this one making the civil war less captivating due to its inherent bias am i over thinking this maybe but it affected my viewing
Aug 17 2017,positive,what an strong story to put together for this great movie
Aug 17 2017,positive,tense darker and somewhat more realistic feeling civil war doesnt go the traditional route of colourful black  white right vs wrong world that has been shown so far in the marvel movies but instead decides to look behind the scenes so to speak to show you the ugly sides of the superhero business the consequences of their actions and how sometimes there just isnt any perfect way to go about things taking a deeper look at politics ethics and morals doesnt mean that theyre skimping on the action though  theres still a number of highoctane sequences that are sure to thrill and overall its just an immensely entertaining package
Aug 16 2017,positive,with a quasiavengers feel captain america civil war is easily one of my favorite marvel movies of all time this first installment into phase 3 of marvel really takes the franchise to the next level and gets you excited for films to come it is easy to see the huge progress that marvel has made with its films the coolest and most intricate fight scenes ive ever seen and that ladies and gentleman is what makes a good super hero movie we are introduced briefly to the villain crossbones in the first fight sequence the cgi to make rdj look young is incredible and i love the mister softee shirt i think the people who have lost loved ones in the battles that take place with the avengers are selfish i get that your son or daughter or dad or relative died but look at the big picture the avengers save millions of lives they cant save everyone because of this concept and other innocent people getting killed from avenger events tony and the united nations want to keep close watch on the actions of the avengers the captain however thinks it will suffocate them as a team and prevent them from doing their duty the sokovia accords are this put into place peggy carter dies after the un conference in vienna we meet tchalla black panther and the team splits into two peggys niece aka the girl next door and cap are getting it   side note the black panther is dope   hah when captain america basically curls a helicopter best part of the movie is when we are introduced to an all new spiderman played by tom holland i loved the sequence leading up to the big fight scene and the big fight scene itself was amazingly portrayed and thought out well done so apparently theres some top secret base in the middle of the ocean where they keep high security prisoners in this case some of the avengers on caps side the winter soldier killed mr and mrs stark the movie gets pretty deep with intensity and broken bonds during the scene with captain america and iron man fighting each other it makes you think what the future holds for the avengers great ending note from the cap    mid credit scene is bucky agreeing to go into a cryogenic sleep until a cure can be found for his brainwashing this takes place in wakanda kingdom of the black panther    end credits scene is peter parker trying out new tech given to him by stark spiderman will return      stan lee appears as a fedex delivery man mispronouncing tonys name as tony stank
Aug 16 2017,positive,greg greg smith founder of agile writers of richmond va scott i don t want this to come to blows but it s time we reviewed the latest film from marvel studios    scott dr scott allison professor of psychology university of richmond yep this time it s allout warfare among the good guys let s recap    greg we meet the avengers fighting the good fight in lagos where villain brock rumlow is attempting to steal a biological weapon after defeating rumlow and his minions captain america steve rogers played by chris evans captures rumlow frank grillo who tells him his long lost buddy bucky sebastian stan is alive cap stunned by the news lets his guard down long enough for rumlow to ignite his bombvest ever alert scarlett witch wanda maximoff played by elizabeth olsen uses her powers to contain the explosion but she is not powerful enough to prevent it from tearing through a building killing several wakandan citizens    scott secretary of state thaddeus ross william hurt informs the avengers that the world will no longer tolerate them having free reign to decide which missions to pursue and how to execute those missions the united nations is about to approve the sokovia accords establishing a un committee to oversee all avenger operations some of our superheroes led by tony stark robert downey jr are in agreement with this new oversight while others in the group led by steve rogers oppose it the resultant internal fight compromises the group s ability to stop supervillain helmut zemo daniel br hl from carrying out his evil mission    greg scott after suffering through last march s batman v superman civil war was a welcome respite here is a complicated story with multiple heroes told in a compelling thoughtful and still exciting manner  all the things missing from the ponderous bvs while there were slow moments in the film the meeting with a very young spider man  brought the movie to a standstill overall this was a movie worth the nearly twoandahalf hours running time this movie had it all a huge cast with lots of action and everybody onscreen wanted something there were no hangerson there were no merelymentioneds nothing went to waste and everything pushed the story forward this was a logical completion to the captain america trilogy and it sets us up for future avengers films i was fully satisfied    scott greg civil war is an appealing movie for all the reasons that you mention how many times over the years have we said well marvel has done it again another smart crisply told story with rich appealing characters as you mention civil war pulls out all the stops by including almost every superhero in the marvel universe ironically these added characters augment the avengers while also compromising them legitimate philosophical differences divide the group which i found fascinating and realistic what i didn t find realistic was the group fighting each other to the neardeath so i have the same criticism for this film that i had for batman vs superman namely the implausible premise that supersmart and supervirtuous heroes would be so dumb as to try to kill each other yes at a superficial level it is fun and cool to watch all these superpowers matched up against each other but come on we should expect more from our heroes than brutish fighting among them isaac asimov once said that violence is the last resort of the incompetent i agree what s next a movie in which jesus and gandhi get into a knife fight so while i admire the impeccable craftsmanship of this movie i question its premise of having supergood guys deciding to do superbad things to each other violence is not the answer and it never will be the answer to human problems we need role models who exemplify this basic principle not violate it i understand it wouldn t have been much of a movie if the avengers resolved their differences peacefully sadly we only gravitate to movies in which conflict is settled by brute force  even when it s our socalled superheroes who initiate that brute force    greg well all i can say to that is that violence has solved all our major wars and we have super smart people at all levels of government and still we fight senseless battles so while i agree with your sentiment there are plenty of counter examples about smart people and stupid solutions the thing that impresses me is the lack of villains in this story we ve written before that the best villain mirrors the hero in every way what better way to create oppositional forces for heroes  than other heroes it s a deft move on marvels part and creates a tension that you could not possibly create with pureevil villains here we have heroes fighting heroes where we can see both sides of the argument there is no clear right or wrong and as we have seen before the best villains think they are in the right team cap and team iron man both strongly believe they are in the right it s a strong composition of equal heroes instead of equal heroes and villains very cool stuff    scott we do encounter a couple of villains in this movie such as brock rumlow at the outset and helmut zemo throughout most of the story in fact dealing with zemo s villainy is what drives the intragroup conflict within the avengers i was struck by the inner schism of bucky barnes  he is part hero part villain which metaphorically characterizes the schism within the avengers it s interesting to consider the mentors or lack of mentors in this film perhaps the avengers foolishly fight amongst themselves because they are lacking good mentorship who is there to tell tony stark that he should allow steve rogers to follow his own path no one and that s a problem heroes who lack mentors are prone to doing stupid things which is exactly what transpires when the avengers begin selfdestructing in a sense the sokovia accords represent an attempt by the world s nations to mentor the avengers to help them use their superpowers more wisely    greg those are some interesting thoughts about mentors in this story often we see former heroes become the mentors for the upandcoming heroes however the avengers are in a strange place  they are the first of their kind while captain america does mentor the younger scarlet witch he is in fact the prototypal hero there is no one to guide him on the other hand we have iron man he should have been mentored by his father but we see that tony stark was largely ignored by his father and so tony lacks a proper mentor in fact it is possible that the elder stark may be considered a dark mentor as he offered negative examples for his son    scott rating captain america civil war is a challenge on the one hand we have the flawed premise of supervirtuous people fighting each other on the other hand we have marvel s impeccable execution of this flawed premise there s an old adage that goes  you can put lipstick on a pig but it s still a pig  the flawed storyline here doesn t render the movie entirely piggish as there is still much to like here civil war is great fun to watch and represents another technological marvel for marvel so despite the flawed premise i will award this film 3 reels out of 5 the heroes here do go on a journey of divisiveness and healing the schism begins with the presentation of the sokovia accords and ends when our heroes finally come to their senses after nearly destroying each other have they changed much as a result of their journey besides all the bruises they may have been humbled and reached some understanding of the pointlessness of their fighting again a heroes rating of 3 out of 5 seems about right as we ve noted there isn t much mentorship going on here which may be the main problem with our heroes engaging in their senseless battle you re right greg about tony stark lacking a moral compass from either his father or from pepper potts steve rogers just does his thing without help and it shows the sokovia accords is the world s attempt to mentor our heroes but they re a pretty stubborn bunch the best i can do is give a rating here of 2 mentors out of 5  movie heroes mentors    greg scott i think you have to rate a film on what it attempts to bring to the screen if this were a slapstick comedy i d rate it as a slapstick comedy but since it s actionadventure i believe you have to rate it on the genre it is slotted in i appreciate your nonviolent leanings but as you point out there is no story here without the conflict  it is subtitled civil war after all i enjoyed this film and i think it nicely rounds out the captain america trilogy the filmmakers delivered on their promise and i happily award 4 out of 5 reels but i have to agree with you on the heroes rating these heroes are fairly wellestablished here and there is little growth or transformation that is the primary thing you and i look for in a hero s journey and it s lacking here nobody really learns anything in the end captain america and iron man go their separate ways after a knockdowndragout fight however the secondary characteristics we look for in heroes charisma strength loyalty etc  are there in strong measure like you i award 3 out 5 heroes and there is little mentoring going on here we see suggestions of dark mentoring from the senior stark but there are no past heroes to guide our upandcoming heroes i can only muster 1 out of 5 mentors for captain america civil war movie heroes mentors
Aug 15 2017,positive,it was the best marvel movie i ever seen
Aug 14 2017,positive,civil war has great cinematography and amazing action its a tad slow at times but nothing bad enough to complain too much about
Aug 13 2017,negative,from the completely underwhelming action sequences to the trademark dry humour this film has you praying for credits from the first moment to the last spoiler its hard to take any marvel film seriously now considering the only interesting thing they could think of doing with a small superhero was to make him big ingenious guys
Aug 7 2017,positive,it does feel epic in some way if you know our heroes but simply throws any true conflict they might have by putting bullshit brain washing
Aug 5 2017,positive,a home run for the russo bros but not as great as winter solider
Aug 4 2017,positive,amazing before this movie came to theatres i was so excited to see it and i thought it was gonna be great boy was i right i loved all the action the cast was perfect and although they shouldve included hulk and thor this is hands down one of the best marvel movies ever
Aug 3 2017,positive,best superhero movie
Aug 3 2017,positive,a 5 star fast paced movie that gives the fans something to debate about
Aug 1 2017,positive,its fan service and its almost impossible not to adore no matter how you look at it civil war succeeds on every note comedy action drama you name it civil war has it in spades
Aug 1 2017,positive,i personally do not agree with this rating i think it deserves at least a 97 or more this is so far my favorite movie i am so excited to see avengers infinity war ahh im screaming im so excited
Jul 31 2017,positive,this film is what i have been waiting for in the mcu it brings most of the beloved characters we have known and loved since the beginning and put them together in a full blown punch up which is cleverly done and does in no means drag on and i hope this film has given us a slight taste of what avengers infinity war will be like
Jul 29 2017,positive,one of the better superhero movies i have seen the cast was great and the plot was great the plot could have been a little more accurate to the comics great action and special effects
Jul 28 2017,positive,one of the better marvel films great plot great action and lots of superheroes
Jul 27 2017,positive,great action good storytelling superheroes what else do you need i just loved it
Jul 26 2017,positive,the best way to do the civil war story without pissing everyone off
Jul 24 2017,negative,to me each avengers movie is more boring than the last as i become further and further removed from the point at which i cared about each of the characters in his or her origin story  and most movies that are part of a series still make sense on their own but not this one  it feels much more like an exceptionally long episode of a tv series that is gradually losing its steam
Jul 22 2017,neutral,the action amazing effects excellent but there is something undeniably exhausting about marvel these days and civil war encapsulates it what was billed as mcu changing war really boiled down to a family spat besides the fight scenes there isnt much to view here as characters become predictable with their one liners and actions
Jul 22 2017,positive,spiderman was good some good fight scenes not as good as first viewing
Jul 22 2017,positive,i wish mom and dad wouldnt fight
Jul 21 2017,positive, i cant get enough of steve â
Jul 21 2017,positive,eh was what i was saying after this kinda boring film ended
Jul 20 2017,positive,one of the best super hero films for action and fighting the airport battle is the funnest scene in the mcu by far and the last fight between cap and iron man is by far the most emotional the biggest flaw is that it doesnt take its self seriously while being filled with many pointless and unfunny jokes but overall great movie and fun to watch
Jul 20 2017,negative,i wish i could give negative stars  this was a mail in performance by every actor except rudd and they all know it  the only people that dont know it are the unsuspecting reviewers here on rotten tomatoes  the plot was absolute trash compared to the comics and the actors are doing a horse and pony show trying to get over the fulfillment of their contract obligations  pleasehave some taste people  at the very least learn to have standards  to be completely unbiased i have loved all of the other marvel movies  you knowminus the crappy ones like hulk and electra or daredevil and manthing  also anything with tony maguire is trash      the end
Jul 20 2017,positive,the best film in the captain america trilogy yet wellrounded characters a lot of emotion and a really exciting third act
Jul 20 2017,positive,its good movie lot action powers and comedy a lot comedy
Jul 19 2017,positive,absolutely brilliant
Jul 19 2017,positive,the ending was so anticlimactic
Jul 18 2017,negative,never finished this movie either way i have always disliked both ironman and cpt america so getting to see them both in a movie is just a horrible event for me
Jul 18 2017,positive,another entertaining entry in the marvel universe that delivers a good story but with a running time that is possobly 20 minutes longer than it ought to be the action is fun and often inventive but rarely very consequential the cgi is distractingly obvious and overused at times but on the whole everything hangs together well
Jul 18 2017,positive,after seeing it a few times it may be my favorite movie ever
Jul 16 2017,negative,after an unfortunate incident in africa the un decides that the avengers require oversight and sets to passing a resolution that a un entity control the avengers  tony stark is for this captain america against it  when the un meeting where the resolution is about to be debated is attacked and several un representatives killed it appears to be the work of winter soldier  captain america is convinced of his innocence tony stark is convinced that he is guilty  this sets the two against each other with the other avengers choosing sides    im not a fan of comic book movies though did enjoy the three iron men movies and captain america the winter soldier  the better ones have more to offer than just your usual cgiaction  unfortunately this is not one of those  pretty much cgiaction and nothing else made for the kids who wonder who would win in a fight between iron man and captain america    basic plot with new super heroes introduced simply because the producers can  one such character is spider man who is incredibly irritating  certainly a reason to skip the spider man movie      one for fans of comic book movies only
Jul 15 2017,positive,i think this is the best captain america movie so far
Jul 14 2017,positive,its got a lot of good but it did feel a little long and seems like too much of a stop gap in the mcu to give  it a higher rating on its own merits
Jul 13 2017,positive,this film works all the characters in an excellent way and offers quality action spiderman is amazing and the black panther steals the scene the direction of the russo brothers is incredible but the film becomes somewhat predictable and lacks courage in its end
Jul 13 2017,positive,captain america civil war is essentially the current culmination of what has transpired in the marvel cinematic universe mcu since 2008 with the release of iron man 1 pitting two heroes captain america and iron man against one another in a battle of personal beliefs and morals however these are not the only players involved in this superhero extravaganza with captain america being joined by the winter soldier falcon scarlet witch antman and hawkeye and iron man teaming up with war machine black widow vision and newly introduced black panther and spiderman civil war is definitely the most intense and mature of all the mcu films and what the russos directors really grasped well is creating an environment where we as the audience can invest and care for these heroes on an emotional level which is testament to what the mcu has done with all these welldeveloped characters throughout all these years we have seen all these characters evolve not just as heroes but as people the histories of both steve rogers and tony stark are central to the story that develops in civil war and the events that ensue creates the division within the avengers as well as the people watching the film unfold this also helps our villain zemo increase his influence on the audience because as invested viewers whether you picked a side or not noone wants the villain to achieve his goal with great writing great directing and great acting this film acts on what it intends to achieve superbly creating the best marvel film seen to date
Jul 13 2017,positive,the peak of the marvel cinematic universe so far  the thought that came to me while watching was its doing the watchmen better than the watchmen did    as much personality as all the marvel films have this is one of the few that was characterdriven  as any intro to storytelling course will tell you  choices are what make a character civil war puts each of its leads into positions where they have to make tough choices ultimately revealing who they are    it manages to do all of that character work without sacrificing on the fun of a summer blockbuster  a fantastic achievement for a franchise that should be growing long in the tooth but instead seems to be growing even stronger
Jul 13 2017,positive,the problem as some of its predecessors is the too long runtime but despite that the script is strong and credible and its refreshing to watch a well done superheroes movie with conflicts between them
Jul 11 2017,positive,it was great when it comes to the new storyline it was entirely different from the original one however i couldnt enjoy completely just because i wasnt that into it nevertheless i can say its greatly done it was a new sensation
Jul 10 2017,positive,still the best in the mcu
Jul 10 2017,positive,entertaining  spectacular with heartfelt themes and a twisting plot while developing characters persona
Jul 8 2017,positive,entertaining  spectacular with heartfelt themes and a twisting plot while developing characters persona
Jul 8 2017,positive,plot seems contrived and overly complicated considering the antagonists ultimate goal entertaining action sequences though
Jul 6 2017,positive,this is the best movie in the mcu at least in my opinion it is
Jul 5 2017,positive,captain america civil war represents an icon of a perfect superhero movie
Jul 5 2017,positive,strengths i praised the original avengers for the delicate balancing act it did with all its parts this movie might have dont that ever better with so many pieces this basically plays as an avengers movie all the usual players give their typically strong performances chris evans steve rogerscaptain america continues to have great chemistry with sebastian stan bucky barnesthe winter soldier and scarlett johansson natasha romanoffblack widow the person who may give the best performance of all is robert downy jr tony starkiron man hes been so good in every movie hes appeared in but hes at his best here the arrogant pieces of him start to fade as the weight of avengers iron man 3 and age of ultron all crush him it all comes to a head in the final fight against cap and bucky which is among the best in mcu history speaking of great fights the airport battle between team stark and team cap is the single best thing the mcu has ever done its so perfectly laid out with each hero getting several chances to shine the direction character moments and action of that scene are perfect paul rudd scott langantman is the mvp of the fight even though thats really his only scene the movie gets the humor right never going too far in with it but remaining funny at the right points i especially enjoyed buckys relationship with samfalcon anthony mackie there was also the tall task of introducing two major new characters which not even avengers had to do tom holland peter parkerspiderman and chadwick boseman tchallablack panther are both spectacularly cast even better theyre introduced so well gone are the generic origin stories parker and stark develop their relationship quickly and it sets up homecoming while tchalla plays mysterious early on in fact tchalla gets one of the better arcs going from someone basing his actions off rage to allowing zemo daniel bruhl to live i also enjoyed elizabeth olsen wanda maximoffscarlet witch much more here than in ultron lastly i have to praise how the film never leans you towards picking a side between iron man and captain america you can see how both sides are right and how both sides are wrong    weaknesses there were only a few small things in this film that bugged me one was how hawkeye jeremy renner came back after his retirement in ultron it led to some cool scenes and i love having him around but it cheapened ultron a bit the other was vision paul bettany i just still dont like his character even if he was dumbed down a bit here he was basically a god in ultron it didnt help that he walked around dressed like a dad during the movie    overall i often go back and forth on what my favorite mcu film is its either the avengers or this thats how good civil war is it manages to juggle a lot at once and never feel forced to introduce black panther and spiderman have great scenes of cap against iron man feature brilliant fight scenes and set up future films is genius its a brilliantly paced movie that is among the best ever
Jul 4 2017,neutral,was surprisingly disappointed by this
Jul 3 2017,positive,captain america civil war    captain america civil war is the third installment in steve rogers chris evans trilogy     civil war is set two years after the events of age of ultron the avengers have adapted into a unit focused purely on the will of defending the earth after an incident in lagos the avengers are viewed as an unhinged organisation in which doesnt take into the account of the damage they leave behind the united nations create the sokovia accords which place the avengers as government property    this motion pits two avengers against each other tony stark robert downey jr is struggling with the reprocussions of his life choices over the last eight years after his creation of ultron tony is split between his creativity ablillityâ and his moral choices after hearing the reprocussions of the sokovia standoff against ultron half of sacovia was demolished realising that the avengers need to be grounded into society without limitations his view is that the avengers are no better than the villains they try to protect the earth from so tony accepts the accords realising its best for the citizens of the earth    steve views the avengers as the saviours of earth when no one else can stop a threat the avengers are the last line of defense he views the avengers as the protectors of earth steve views the accords as a way for the government to control the avengers in essence the avengers will become a task unit for the government to decide where they go and who they protect or fight by signing the document the blame will shift to the avengers overlooking the sacrifices they made to defend the earth by signing the accord surrenders their right to choose what they fight for    tony and steve are challenged by there divided views for what is best for the avengers as the pillars of the team the team are divided on what is best for the avengers     joining steve is sam wilson anthony mackie wanda maximoff elisabeth olsen bucky barnes sebastian stan clint barton jeremy renner and scott lang paul rudd team cap focuses on the idea that the government doesnt control the avengers    tonys team consists of   james rhodes don cheadle vision paul bettany natasha romanoff scarlet johanson   peter parker tom holland and tchalla chadwick boseman team iron man focuses on the idea that the avengers need to be grounded into reality    through the sokovia accords which unites the nations of the world tchalla the heir to the throne of wakanda is thrown into this war between heroes through events which i cant reveal without spoiling parts of the plot    bucky barnes returns as the amnesiac winter soldier struggling with the actions he has made in the past bucky is in hiding after the actions he has committed steve and sam are still hunting for bucky after his second disappearance in the winter soldier and after he is targeted after a current disaster steve finds bucky on the run and pays a tough price for reuniting with his old friend    the villain of this movie is zemo daniel brã 14hl zemo is a simple man with no super powers or evil organisation he is one man who manages to tear the avengers apart from the inside why zemo is a brilliant villain is the fact that in a typical marvel movie a villain has to be powerful and menacing to fight the hero however this movie is about heroes turning against each other due to their morals and points of view the terrifying and amazing factor of zemo is that he could be anyone the everyday man in the crowd there is nothing powerful about him which is terrifying zemo may not be the most memorable villain in the mcu however he is the most affective in the sense that his drive is relatable and a genuine threat    the action in this movie is fantastic the russo brothers show once again the realistic close up violence in which can and should be shown through 12 rated superhero movies the fights in this movie are on a massive scale throwing in so many characters and not once does it feel as if the action is overused or the characters never feel too bloated in this movie one scene in this movie is one of if not the greatest fight scene in superhero history i will refer to this as the airport scene however the drive of this violence comes from the fact that you route for both sides to win and you really empathise for these characters and some of the fight scenes in this movie are really emotional and affective    one performance really shines in this movie full of serious scenes and character development this performance is the only fun and comedic performance in this movie even robert downey jr is grounded and serious in this movie there is only one scene where he is the traditional tony stark and thats when hes with this specific character tom holland is the much needed comic relief for this movie and he brings it all in one scene the airport scene this is the spiderman which we have been waiting for tom holland is fun young and what you picture when you think of peter parker this is the version of spiderman which is apparent in the comics the source material spiderman in which is quirky and somehow fits in the mcu tom holland is a small part of this movie but really makes an impact showing the capability of this version of spiderman holland maybe the best spiderman yet on the big screen    this movie is amazing the action the cinematography the story the characters are top notch the acting in this is brilliant every part of this movie is on point and entertaining the exact thing in which batman v superman isnt even though these movies are the exact same the difference is the execution of the movie civil war has been building up since age of ultron and you have come to relate to these characters as youve seen them grow as the movies have continued this is what is missing in the dceu although the characters in this universe are known the movie versions are not this is what separates these two franchises the audience has grown with these characters and cares this is why the russo brothers civil war is better than zack snyders batman v superman honestly i cant wait to see what the russo brothers create for avengers infinity war because this movie has iron man black widow spiderman black panther war machine and vision pitted against captain america antman the winter soldier falcon scarlet witch and hawkeye this is a mustsee for marvel fans and movie fans alike i cant recommend this movie more
Jul 2 2017,positive,a fun albeit overrated entry in the mcu
Jul 2 2017,positive,this movie is awesome when i watched it i said this is the second best mcu movie just before the avengers civil war has some problems but the main problem which make it a little bit worsestill great than the avengers is its romance it was awful the romance between steve and sharon started and finished in this movie we didnt see anything special in the winter soldier but civil war totally is the second best mcu movie
Jul 1 2017,positive,this movie is able to push so many characters together into one story there are so many characters but it still manages to keep a captain america story theres a great balance of humor action and drama
Jul 1 2017,positive,this is a good movie  talented cast  good humor  plenty of drama but not too much cause otherwise people might get bored  good action  civil war has all of that
Jul 1 2017,negative,pointless invincible demigods that are ostensibly on the same team fight each other in a nostakes grudgefest because hollywood has 6 year old boys writing their movies now
Jun 30 2017,positive,at one point during this movie i heard a kid in the theater tell his dad this movie is amazing i couldnt agree more this very timely film pits fan favorites captain america and iron man against each other in an ethically ambiguous quandary should people with extraordinary abilities be controlled this isnt the first film to ask that question watchmen batman v superman and most of the xmens have all explored this subject just to name a few but its the first ive seen that illustrates both sides of the argument so well as well as why each character takes the stance they do and take it as far as they do after watching the film its tough to side with only one of them despite the constant urging of twitter to declare your allegianceteamswitzerland this is an impeccably written and expertly paced film especially for an action flick directors joe and anthony russo deftly juggle the storylines of a veritable cornucopia of superheroes allowing each to shine in his or her own moment and even squeezing in some solid character development the film does a fantastic job of fleshing out characters we already know and also of introducing new characters giving them just enough screen time to leave us wanting more i mean i dont want to get ahead of myself but for the first time i am thinking that this time around the spiderman reboot might actually be good there is a crazy amount of stuff covered in this film  yet even at 2 12 hours it always flows and never feels crammed it balances the bombastic action sequences with enough quiet characterdriven moments to keep the viewer from going into overdrive and adds enough humor to counteract a plot that could easily go too dark and heavy this aint no lovers quarrel though everyone is initially reluctant to engage this civil war ends up being a bitter fight with some shocking consequences it hurt my heart a little to see cap and tony come to blows but the film treats the issue somberly and with the respect both characters deserve though the title is a bit of a misnomer it should be called avengers civil war this is easily the best of the cap movies and even rivals the first avengers movie which i heralded as the perfect superhero film and the mcu juggernaut rolls on
Jun 30 2017,negative,overrall disappointment with holes in the story that glare down uncontrollably the biggest disappointment though was incredible predictability of ever situation the title itself completely gave away the outcome the commercials also commented on the how emotional the movie would be and in the end it held just as much emotion as rock a predictable bland rock
Jun 29 2017,positive,one of the best superhero movie of all time loved the movie all characters were awesome specially spidey he killed it in that movie and the same thing with black panther best fights ever the airport battle was epic and the fight we all been waiting for cap vs iron man
Jun 26 2017,positive,this is probably the second best of the captain america movies nearly a draw when you put it against the first it really feels like more of an avengers movie than a captain america movie but the plot itself is a good one that shouldnt be forgotten in the large cloud of superhero movies it definitely stands out
Jun 26 2017,positive,everything is organized in a perfect way and the quotes are really emotional and inspirational i absolutely love the movie
Jun 25 2017,positive,so no major deaths other than the obvious one its ok perhaps disney is to blame for this  but i really expected some good deaths anyway the battle was amazing and quite entertaining the new avengers were excellent i kind of hated the sokovia accords but i cant help feeling bad for iron man and his parents
Jun 24 2017,positive,team captain america vs team iron man now this is awesome in civil war 
Jun 20 2017,positive,having so many characters in one movie and having it work is always   a huge pay off and the tone of the movie was truly perfect
Jun 20 2017,positive,should just be called iron man 4
Jun 17 2017,neutral,eh it was ok lack of thor was noticeable and unfortunate im pretty tired of captain america
Jun 17 2017,positive,while it does lack a specific focus it is ok to forgive it for that because it makes up for it with enthralling action sequences and memorable characters
Jun 16 2017,positive,the final and definitely the best movie in the captain america trilogy civil war is by far one of the biggest and probably the most serious of all the marvel films  of course there are still a few jokes tossed around here and there but ya its still pretty serious  and as of right now i suppose that i am not being as optimistic as i could be probably because of how many times that i have seen the film  but in my honest opinion it seems quite a bit like the winter soldier in its own mostly covered up ways  such as the fact that it seems to highlight the bucky story a little too much for my liking  along with the whole general set up of the story and the all too familiar pacing and timing of the action scenes  now dont get me wrong i do love a couple of the action scenes but if im being realistic they just seem like they could be so much more surreal instead of hardly more than just plain jane satisfying  and last but not least i will address the antagonist of the film named zemo  okay so i must say that his motivations and villainous plan are terrific partly because in the end his plan actually succeeds  but just being honest here zemo may very intereseting and original  due to the fact that he is nothing like his comic book counterpart of the same name which unfortunately makes him feel ever so slightly watered down like the rest of the film so anyways in the end i would assume that i more than likely did nothing other than dissect the worst parts of the movie  but hey all i can tell you is that i am posting my opinion of the film which is exactly what i should be doing  so if you dont like my review i could really care less
Jun 16 2017,positive,i loved it mainly due to the mcu introduction black panther
Jun 16 2017,positive,this film was amazing probably the best comic book movie this year super heroes fighting superheroes is a cool idea batman v superman didnt do it right but this film did      rating 8910
Jun 14 2017,positive,while it does lack a specific focus it is ok to forgive it for that because it makes up for it with enthralling action sequences and memorable characters
Jun 14 2017,positive,while the dceu responds to the destruction and chaos that superheroes cause earlier in their movies this is greatness marvel just showed that subplots and many characters can be handled masterfully without making a movie feel bloated or long it juggles many ideas and introductions of characters we longed to see in the mcu particularly the king of wakanda himself black panther this is the movie that finally has a giant consequence for the future stories of marvel and is the best chapter yet
Jun 13 2017,positive,great action and an interesting story introduces spiderman and black panther extremely well and makes both characters important best movie of 2016
Jun 11 2017,positive,this my favourite mcu movie  i really like the plot of the movie and i actually enjoyed the villain i loved the addition of spiderman and black panther     9310
Jun 10 2017,positive,bigger cast than avengers this movie completely recovers age of ultron s letdown this movie feels more like an avengers movie than age of ultron      again just like previous capamerica movies it suffers from pacing i think marvel can do 1h 30 min movies way better than 2 h movies   i was on visions side iron mans side pretty much all the time since for me it made more sense marvel plays this we wont kill people who are bad card too much in this movie but i give it 455 because i think the movie was amazing in terms of casting and execution i did not like premise much but it makes sense for some part what i love the most is that this movie sets 2 more movies spiderman and black panther   spoiler alert  bucky should be killed and so zemo
Jun 9 2017,positive,another great film put out from marvel studios the russo brothers know what theyre doing and how to make a great comic book film great action great acting a typical weak villain but overall a great spectacle surely a classic to look back at when the mcu is all said and done
Jun 8 2017,positive,good knockabout fun will age better than most of the others
Jun 6 2017,positive,having so many characters in one movie and having it work is always    a huge pay off and the tone of the movie was truly perfect
Jun 3 2017,positive,robert downey jrs expositionfest drags this one down
Jun 2 2017,positive,masterpiece of a movie
Jun 2 2017,negative,another overrated and boring marvel film
Jun 1 2017,positive,its actually just avengers 3
Jun 1 2017,positive,i know these are widely acclaimed movies but the marvel character movies arent that engaging for me it was watchable but not something i feel like i need to watch again
Jun 1 2017,positive,goodness what ive always wanted since i was smashing action figures together alone in my room that airport scene eh still plenty of room for emotional storytelling
Jun 1 2017,negative,nothing outside of the airport fight scene stood out to me visually the cinematography is very digital and very bright theres not a lot of depth not much shadows or contrast it just doesnt look great to me it looks very basic it looks like network television drama watch bvs and then watch captain america civil war with these things in mind and thats the difference with bvs there is effort made in terms of cinematography in the look and the tone atmosphere and mood
Jun 1 2017,positive,this movie does a great job handling the relationship between the avengers as well as introducing black panther and spiderman into marvels cinematic universe
May 31 2017,positive,it was a good way to tear the avengers apart right before the infinity  war iron man and war machien are injured captain america gave up his shield buckys metal arm got riped off  and we now know thors hammer is distroyed and the hulk is kidnaped with thor this movie did a good job of doing what it was meant to do
May 31 2017,positive,this episode in steve rogers life is a comicbook favourite and as a fan myself seeing it transferred onto the big screen is a dream come true with some of the best casting in  movie history this movie hosts an allstar cast including chris evans scarlett johansson and robert downey jr my personal favourite marvel studios movie this event has  expanded the marvel cinematic universe greatly with new characters such as spiderman and black panther joining the universe with some of the best action in superhero  movies the conflict between the two teams comes to an end in a memorable final battle scene with emotional dialogue widening the plot even more great dialogue with  occasional bouts of comedy involved this is truely what a superhero movie should be overall this movie is a mustsee and a favourite amongst many
May 31 2017,positive,civil war is an ambitious movie for marvel and it succeeds on most fronts not quite as good as the avengers films it doesnt collapse under the weight either and is definitely entertaining and spiderman nails it
May 31 2017,positive,1 word spectacular marvels best film yet with a compelling story a character driven climax and a truly memorable baddy that no one saw coming tense beautiful mesmerising fun dark captiviating you really can feel the characters reasons for their acyions and the whole film feels believable wow
May 30 2017,positive,one of the best movies ever created best part spiderman
May 29 2017,negative,look if you want action this is the movie so i am not saying this is terrible for practically everyone who watches it it had so much action i was actually bored and they didnt even fight the villains they fought themselves sorry let me rephrase that they never fight the villains also this wasnt exactly a captain america movie it stared the avengers this could of easily been the next avengers movie and it really is with captain america attached to the name it should have been named avengers civil war plus they introduced spider man sorry but i felt that was a bit stretched simply put they could of ended the fighting in the middle airport scene and then made up and captain america go off and get that villain who i have no idea the name of because he is barely in the movie what happened to a good old fashioned plot does it always have to be fighting cant it just be the occasional fight and the plot revolving around in the background and then at the end the big grand fight we have all been waiting for what successful movies have done this let me give that a thought hmm the older spiderman trilogy the avengers the first one captain america the first avenger iron man thor the dark wold did an excellent job of this etc and those are only some there are many more this was basically so dumb as well i could probably do math homework come back an hour later and still follow the plot also personally i think ca should have defended the whole un contract thingy while iron man was opposed to it why would iron man really want to be controlled um no he is a playboy playboy and control contradict each other plus ca is pretty much for anything government created right i felt like they kind of got their personalities mixed up     so let me sum this up to much much fighting no plot dumb and they mixed up the iron man and ca personalities
May 27 2017,positive,good movie i however dont like my movie heroes pinned against one another
May 23 2017,positive,this is the best movie ive seen potentially since avatar the story though a bit of a mess at times is exactly how it shouldve been chris evansrobert downey jrscarjoand so many others weve come to love are amazing as always and the newcomers chadwick boseman and tom holland are incredibley well cast must watch film
May 19 2017,positive,wow just wow fantastic a finest mcu movie absolutely actionpacked full of emotion and powerful moments truly a thoughtprovoking tribute to the meaning of friendship with tons of mayhem maintains focus truly deserving of the a rating
May 19 2017,positive,entirely exciting and fun to absorb marvel again hits home with a general formula of action humor and nostalgia there is enough material in this film for all ages to enjoy
May 18 2017,positive,this is one of the best mcu movies you will ever see  spiderman is amazing
May 18 2017,positive,my favorite super hero movie ever so far
May 15 2017,negative,absolutely unbalanced  the one of worst movies marvel studios has ever made the reason for them to fight each other was poor and poorly executed some dodgy cgi scenes pacing issues you can easily take out this movie from the story line and the saga will still make sense a disappointing last movie the captain america trilogy    the introduction of new characters like black panther and spiderman was good and the opening scene was promising that was the only good things about the movie good underused villain    very very disappointed trailers got everyone behind this piece of crap over hyped by everyone even when people saw this movie said it was the best mcu movie yet but quite frankly its the worst    overall i think this movie would be a better time if i was drunk
May 14 2017,positive,the beauty of captain america civil war is the fact that there are no right answers to the dilemmas it brings up its all up to what kind of person you are and it encourages you to make the decisions for yourself instead of trying to be a propaganda piece not many movies do that and who knew that a captain america movie would    this is my favorite mcu movie this is one of my favorite comic book movies and is an experience to be held at the movies    1010
May 7 2017,positive,yes theres the airport scene  and yes we have spiderman  but we also have black panther  and more antman  and a plot that still flexes the mcus storytelling muscles  engaging without being stupid we have great reason to feel for cap mr stark and even our new villain zemo  the russo brothers have elevated their game in the wake of winter solder and brought us a terrific gift as a big blockbuster
May 7 2017,negative,spiderman alone cant make this movie good
May 7 2017,positive,an actionpacked superhero blockbuster which boasts a decidedly noncartoonish plot and has the courage to explore thoughtprovoking themes
May 6 2017,positive,this movie is awesome spider man
May 6 2017,negative,its overrated in my opinion
May 5 2017,positive,very enjoyable actioncomic book movie  the director does a great job balancing so many characters effectively adding in just the right amount of favorites like spiderman and antman
May 4 2017,positive,the action and plot was amazing all goes to the all mighty russo brothers
May 2 2017,negative,marvel once again showed us how you can perfectly make another movie with the same formula which you are using from 10 yearsbut gladly public will probably eat it up
May 1 2017,positive,in my opinion this is 2nd only to dark knight when it comes to superhero movies this is a fun movie to watch even on multiple viewings the storylines allow for the characters to be going in several different directions mentally and emotionally throughout the titular character loses his long time girlfriend agent carter iron man is going through marital problems emotional stress due to being confronted with the death of a young innocent man due to ultron and has to relive his parents untimely death bucky has to constantly be reminded that he was a brainwashed soldier for hydra that did some of the most despicable things imaginable black widow is torn between her friends and her duty vision is still unsure of his position in the team and who he is as a person scarlet witch has her overpowered body to contend with and her emotional stress due to unfortunate events in lagos watching these characters deal with their own inner turmoil and watching the situation be constantly manipulated by zemo in his attempt to destroy the avengers for mostly selfish reasons the introduction of spiderman his uncharacteristically attractive aunt may black panther and the knowledge of the winter soldier program make this movie a must see
Apr 30 2017,positive,just another marvel episode move along people
Apr 30 2017,positive,i dont read comic books and these movies are starting to get predictable
Apr 29 2017,positive,it was alright i mean nothing happened really like story wise also why didnt iron man win the fight at the end
Apr 27 2017,positive,great film the airport scene was great so was the end fight with captain america and winter soldier vs iron man
Apr 27 2017,positive,words cant describe what a tour de force this movie is the action was beyond cool the pacing was great and there was never one dull moment this film is a mustsee another job well done marvel
Apr 26 2017,neutral,a natural competitor of batman v superman movie and not a worthy one    i rate the film about captains war as 255 and i am being really generous truly speaking    first of all i have to say that mostly it is not a movie about clash of superheroes former friends but a legal drama and well speak about it later    action scenes versus regular people are designed in a way when each superhero has their moments to shine while stupid opponents wait in groups about 34 bad guys to have their asses kicked special effects look fine of course just recall the movie budget  250 million not including the enormous amount on promotion    the whole theme of the movie is ridiculous a bit similar to batman v superman plot where superheroes started to suffer incredibly because of the damage they deal when perform gargantuan battles to save the universe    i mean there were plenty of films and series involving batman superman and all of the marvel characters and no one cared about regular people dying but in harsh times of idea crisis logic is put away and odd scripts emerge it looks as if cinderellas fairy godmother suddenly starts to think about how her magic corresponds with the law of conservation of energy    when secretary of state demonstrates superheroes via fancy presentation which consequences there are because of their actions the logic is not just killed it is annihilated and no one mentions evil guys who tried to conquer or destroy the whole planet no one sees giant flying robosnakeorwhatisthatthing    its like everyone agrees well yes the hulk decided to make some noise on his own    next thing we see is army acting on the streets of new york does anyone think that a tank or carbased machine gun has no risk of injuring or killing somebody    the film script lacks at least any pieces of sense and becomes more broken with every minute and the discussed scene was shown on the 22nd minute of the movie    the sokovia accords    once these papers appear on the screen they never leave it as all the boring talks throughout 25 hours movie is all about the legal document legal document in a freaking superhero movie and they talk and talk and talk i can understand when the movie is based on dialogues but a marvel actionpacked movie    as the movie is declared to be about battle of two earth defender teams i have to say a few words about how the conflict is shot    i can state i like the legwork by scarlett aka black widow it reminds me the beautiful sonya blade from mortal kombat    in general our superheroes are noble people so they fight only 1 vs 1 even if the disposition indicated that there is only one villain vs a group of heroes o logic where art thou    there is fun similarity with the batman vs superman movie stark and captain meet each other on the 90th minute of the film while the bat and clarke start fighting on the 120th minute of the movie and i cant say that everything that happened before major fights was worth watching    i congratulate everyone who did not fall asleep until this moment you are the real superheroes here fellas it seems that any efforts movie creators wanted to actually make are performed during this battle there are even some funny jokes i remind it is the 90th minute of the action movie spoiler spidey is great    the movie is exceptionally boring i have never been to a cinema where 99 of audience fell asleep during the action film    if you skip all the talks you may consider captain america civil war as a decent movie
Apr 25 2017,positive,great movie great action what else do i need to say
Apr 23 2017,positive,wow just wow great movie
Apr 22 2017,positive,i liked the overall movie but wasnt thrilled when they changed so much of the story and im not talking about the characters they couldnt use
Apr 22 2017,positive,black panther is awesome
Apr 20 2017,positive,the latest big budget marvel extravaganza which despite the captain america moniker might as well have been called avengers 3 is another action film of solid entertainment but i definitely think it was too long  with the exception of the airport battle and maybe the final showdown between cap and iron man i think most of the action scenes couldve used a bit of trimming  it just gets exhausting after while to see punch after laser blast after punch  and i definitely wouldve cut out most of spidermans intro  the moment he shows up at the airport would be where hed start in my view  the scene in his apartment deflated his spidey entrance and was too long  and since the movie is 2 and a 12 hours long  trimming was most definitely needed  that all being said it is solid entertainment and a good action superhero flick but despite all the good i still feel that i am just worn out on the whole superhero thing in general
Apr 19 2017,positive,watching civil war i felt like a kid again and im 40
Apr 14 2017,positive,now i do believe that in recent years ive had to sit through 2 spiderman origin films both telling the same story so to drop a new spiderman into the middle of this being tapped up by ironman when theres been no mention of the avengers in any of the spiderman films seems a bit daft perhaps theyll do another spiderman origin film to now include the avengers that aside this was a bit more low key than the usual superhero films where everything gets destroyed so it made a change
Apr 14 2017,negative,not really my cup of tea  the good guys fighting each other love the avengers and all those super heroes this is just a bit too negative
Apr 14 2017,neutral,its ok as a filler in the marvelavengers storyline but otherwise was hardly memorable or exciting
Apr 12 2017,neutral,this movie plays like a bloated avengers spinoff  i really dont understand the hype behind it
Apr 12 2017,positive,i just loved the movie i was afraid that it will not go all the away but they went through with it iron man vs cap and it was fun as hell the whole premise and the things leading to events in the movie are kinda silly and the villain is as barely adequate as any marvel bad guy but aside from that there isnt that much wrong with the movie of course there are a few nitpicks but they are so insignificant that arent even worth mentioning easily my second favorite superhereo movie of last year after deadpool and in top 5 of all time
Apr 9 2017,positive,it was good popcorn fun
Apr 9 2017,positive,a very good superhero film a bit messy though
Apr 8 2017,negative,a terrible movie with a really predictable plot no stakes and the story seems to be the same as every marvel movie oneliners ruin the moments way too often and the cgi is terrible the villain was useless and there were a lot of plotholes marvel is now aiming more towards the children and it loses realism and meaning the marvel stories are getting worse
Apr 8 2017,negative,plot not credible at all characters behave completely and unreasonably the opposite they normally do accusations to heroes considered the supernatural nature of the hostiles appear foolish even for a 5 years old kid too bad after the good work around ultron and ai
Apr 7 2017,negative,absolute rubbish thinnest plot to a movie ever gets completely lost in a tangled scrip dont bother with this one rt is biased and rigged
Apr 4 2017,positive,a few years ago if you had asked me which superhero smackdown i was looking forward to more batman vs superman or iron man vs captain america id have answered unequivocally with the former    and then dc started actually making movies and doubt began to slowly creep in and then after actually slogging through batman v superman dawn of justice i knew that there likely wouldnt be any doubt in the future when it comes to their cinematic universes marvel straightup owns dc    and this isnt a case of a marvel fanboy just piling on fact is i straightup love batman and i love him far more than any hero in the marvel stable    please note that im actually very tired of making comparisons between the two comic book giants every time they release a film but the differences are so stark that i just cant help it and when they each release a versus movie within months of each other im sorry but comparisons are 100 inevitable and in a reveal that shouldnt be surprising to anyone whos seen all the films stan lee and co once again get the upper hand here    for starters captain america civil war is a straightup fun film its fastpaced entertaining chockfull of good performances and contains just the right amount of humorous moments in other words its about what youd expect from the marvel cinematic universe    but the film moves beyond fun because it has an interesting story that involves interesting characters we know and care about unlike batman v superman which was essentially a clash between strangers weve gotten to know people like captain america iron man and the black widow over the course of several movies therefore when these friends and allies turn against each other and begin to duke it out theres real gravitas in the situation we feel like we know these people and we dont want to see them fighting each other    and what starts all this nasty infighting like many bitter feuds its rooted in tragedy after yet another excursion by the avengers team results in the death of numerous civilians the authorities decide theyve had enough secretary of state thaddeus thunderbolt ross william hurt reprising his role from the incredible hulk the early and oftenforgotten second movie in the marvel cinematic universe meets with the team and informs them that an accord will soon be passed that puts the heroes under governmental control essentially theyll be working directly for the united nations they will not go out on any sort of action that isnt directly sanctioned by uncle sam and the other countries involved in the treaty    this makes sense in a way an unfortunate part of the superhero business is that it will usually lead to some sort of collateral damage be it the deaths of innocent bystanders or the total annihilation of a major city now its usually not the heroes fault but it would still stand to reason that the world would eventually get tired of it and demand some kind of accountability especially if they take the stance that the superheroes may indirectly cause the creation of the supervillains as theorized by paul bettanys vision im glad that these movies are dealing directly with this fallout too often in this genre its something thats just completely glossed over    however this proposition doesnt sit well with some of the avengers particularly steve rogers aka captain america chris evans he doesnt like the idea of intervening in crises only when given the ok to do so in his mind it defeats the whole point of the avengers initiative as they shouldnt be tied down to bureaucratic red tape meanwhile tony stark aka iron man robert downey jr is fully on board with this believing that superheroes need to be held in check both sides have their merits and both men believe the alternative will result in even more death and carnage    this ends up dividing the avengers with some siding with rogers and others with stark and when the united nations is bombed in a terrorist attack seemingly conducted by bucky barnes aka the winter soldier sebastian stan rogers old friend that sets the two factions against each other stark wants barnes brought in to face justice while rogers begins to suspect that an enigmatic man named zemo daniel bruhl is the true culprit     what i like most about this whole situation is that at face value youd think the two characters would have taken the opposite stance in the early stages of the marvel cinematic universe tony stark was a wild card a roguish rebel who didnt want the government interfering with his affairs recall his refusal to turn over his iron man suit technology to the authorities in iron man 2 for example conversely steve rogers was a gungho allamerican soldier boy whose loyalty to the mission knew no bounds therefore youd think that rogers would be on board with this idea while stark would find the whole thing too big brotheresque    but over the course of the mcu weve seen the changes in their characterization and thats one of the major benefits of telling characters stories over multiple movies stark hasnt been the same since flying through the alien wormhole in the climax of the avengers hes been haunted by the prospect of a hostile extraterrestrial army ever since this plagued his mind and induced panic attacks in iron man 3 and it led to him creating the titular villain in the avengers age of ultron in an effort to protect our planet therefore its completely natural for him to get behind secretary ross proposition here    and rogers for his part began to receive inklings in the avengers that his superiors werent always honest with him and maybe didnt always have the countrys best interest in mind this came crashing to the forefront in captain america the winter soldier in which he discovered that the evil organization hydra had successfully infiltrated the us government and had been slowly working over the course of decades to undermine their efforts so its not a surprise that he would now have a certain degree of distrust in governmental authority figures    what im getting at here is that marvel has done an absolutely fantastic job with building and developing these characters the decisions made by rogers and stark feel completely organic theyre driven by the characters experiences and not the demands of the plot it makes sense in the grand scheme of things for them to feel this way these are profoundly natural and satisfying character arcs when captain america made his first appearance in the mcu i commented on how the character was kind of bland and boring now i see that it was all a setup to some very heavy character development    and since we care so much about these characters that makes the action sequences which are pretty great to begin with that much more resonant the central setpiece is an extended battle on an airport runway and its nearly as good as the climaxes in both avengers movie directors anthony and joe russo who also helmed winter soldier prove to be quite adept at handling chaotic fight sequences and the film makes great use of characters both old and new importantly the new characters such as chadwick boseman as the black panther and tom holland as your friendly neighborhood spiderman new to the mcu at least never feel shoehorned in    if theres a flaw with civil war id say its with the villains scheme which is one of those ubercomplex numbers that relies on predicting peoples actions with 100 accuracy and all sorts of turns and developments that need to go off without a hitch or the whole thing would collapse as with the joker in the dark knight or silva in skyfall it requires the villain to possess an almost godlike omniscience but at least we understand the motivations behind the whole endeavor and at least the scheme ends up going in a different direction than you might expect    and besides i was enjoying the film too much to really let this issue drag it down civil war offers tantalizing possibilities for the future of the avengers and the mcu in general and im anxious to see the next step remember how i said i wasnt a marvel fanboy earlier after some consideration it appears that might not be entirely accurate because when it comes to this fantastic cinematic universe theyve constructed im for sure a big fan  from jack foran   to sein82wowwaycom   sent wednesday march 29 2017 40600 pm    a few years ago if you had asked me which superhero smackdown i was looking forward to more batman vs superman or iron man vs captain america id have answered unequivocally with the former     and then dc started actually making movies and doubt began to slowly creep in  and then after actually slogging through batman v superman dawn of justice i knew that there likely wouldnt be any doubt in the future when it comes to their cinematic universes marvel straightup owns dc     and this isnt a case of a marvel fanboy just piling on  fact is i straightup love batman and i love him far more than any hero in the marvel stable     please note that im actually very tired of making comparisons between the two comic book giants every time they release a film  but the differences are so stark that i just cant help it  and when they each release a versus movie within months of each other im sorry but comparisons are 100 inevitable  and in a reveal that shouldnt be surprising to anyone whos seen all the films stan lee and co once again get the upper hand here     for starters captain america civil war is a straightup fun film  its fastpaced entertaining chockfull of good performances and contains just the right amount of humorous moments  in other words its about what youd expect from the marvel cinematic universe     but the film moves beyond fun because it has an interesting story that involves interesting characters we know and care about  unlike batman v superman which was essentially a clash between strangers weve gotten to know people like captain america iron man and the black widow over the course of several movies  therefore when these friends and allies turn against each other and begin to duke it out theres real gravitas in the situation  we feel like we know these people and we dont want to see them fighting each other     and what starts all this nasty infighting  like all bitter feuds its rooted in tragedy  after yet another excursion by the avengers team results in the death of numerous civilians the authorities decide theyve had enough  secretary of state thaddeus thunderbolt ross william hurt reprising his role from the incredible hulk the early and oftenforgotten second movie in the marvel cinematic universe meets with the team and informs them that a bill will soon be passed that puts the heroes under governmental control  essentially theyll be working directly for the us government they will not go out on any sort of action that isnt directly sanctioned by uncle sam     this makes sense in a way  an unfortunate part of the superhero business that it will usually lead to some sort of collateral damage be it the deaths of innocent bystanders or the total annihilation of a major city  now its usually not the heroes fault but it would still stand to reason that the world would eventually get tired of it and demand some kind of accountability especially if they take the stance that the superheroes may indirectly cause the creation of the supervillains as theorized by paul bettanys vision  im glad that these movies are dealing directly with this fallout too often in this genre its something thats just completely glossed over     however this proposition doesnt sit well with some of the avengers particularly steve rogers aka captain america chris evans  he doesnt like the idea of intervening in crises only when given the ok to do so  in his mind it defeats the whole point of the avengers initiative as they shouldnt be tied down to bureaucratic red tape  meanwhile tony stark aka iron man robert downey jr is fully on board with this believing that superheroes need to be held in check  both sides have their merits and both men believe the alternative will result in even more death and carnage     this ends up dividing the avengers with some siding with rogers and others with stark  and when the united nations is bombed in a terrorist attack seemingly conducted by bucky barnes aka the winter soldier sebastian stan rogers old friend that sets the two factions against each other  stark wants barnes brought in to face justice while rogers begins to suspect that an enigmatic man named zemo daniel bruhl is the true culprit      what i like best about this whole thing is that at face value youd think the two characters would have taken the opposite stance  in the early stages of the marvel cinematic universe tony stark was a wild card a roguish rebel who didnt want the government interfering with his affairs  recall his refusal to turn over his iron man suit technology to the authorities in iron man 2 for example  conversely steve rogers was a gungho allamerican soldier boy whose loyalty to the mission knew no bounds  therefore youd think that rogers would be on board with this idea while stark would find the whole too big brotheresque     but over the course of the mcu weve seen the changes in their characterizations and thats one of the major benefits of telling

since this plagued his mind and induced panic attacks in iron man 3 and led to him creating the titular villain in the avengers age of ultron all in an effort to protect our planet  therefore its completely natural for him to get behind secretary ross proposition here     and rogers for his part began to receive inklings in the avengers that his superiors werent always honest with him and maybe didnt always have the countrys best interest in mind  this came crashing to the forefront in captain america the winter soldier in which he learned that the evil organization hydra had successfully infiltrated the us government and had been slowly over the course of decades working to undermine their efforts  so its not a surprise that he would now have a certain degree of distrust

Apr 2 2017,positive,great film i flipped when spiderman came
Apr 1 2017,positive,so great the battes were amazing and i wish it was even longer than 2 and a half hours
Apr 1 2017,positive,best superhero movie of all time
Apr 1 2017,positive,civil wars writing is impressive not as a feat of artistry but as an engineering accomplishment its a testament to how skillfully that task is executed that the movie never feels leaden or tangled despite the umptymillion characters it introduces and the endless reams of plot its relied upon to unspool in fact its fun
Mar 30 2017,negative,to a trash movie the single biggest problem with this movie is how many situations could be solved by saying the phrase we saved more people than were harmed you moron tony stark seems to be riding a massive guilt trip through this movie he carried from the first iron man movie nobody died because disney and we got out one token death in avengers 2 nothing new was offered here the only scene that keeps this from being a 1 review is the brawl at the end
Mar 29 2017,negative,this movie is a bad adaptatation to marvel characters i known from the comics if you dont believe just check the scene where captain america is fighting a lot of american soldiers because they were doing their job of courcce it was for saving bucky but he almost kill people that probably had family that scene that i am talking about shows how the chacters from the marvel cinematic universe change with no reason because that scene shows us that this isnt the captain america that we met in the first avenger that sacrifices himself for a strangers  in the scene when tommy lee jones character throws a grenade to the soldiers so my question is why this change you could answer that is because of peggys dead but from the captain america that i known from the comics that dead will inspire him to be better of what he was before no worse finally hawkeye appeard out of nowhere and without any explanation
Mar 28 2017,positive,touched on some really interesting ideas a more sophisticated concept of morality which can often be grey rather than the typically portrayed black  white  as well as closing thoughts on vengeance definitely an innovative approach that was delivered with significant thought and a fresh addition to the mcu definitely had an entertaining climax with the introduction to the young peter parker and tchalla bp thrown in there on top of everything almost gave another half star but for some reason it didnt feel like they quite hit it home for me with some of the big moment scenes and the humor with introducing all the new characters oh yeah sorry antman seemed a little offkey at times
Mar 27 2017,neutral,full of so many problems that critics and fanboys willingly overlook because the bandwagon demands this movie be declared a masterpiece    they relied heavily on conveniences and plot holes to make this movie work they ignored their past movies just so the narrative of the film could be held together like there suddenly being mass casualties in sokovia when if you remember it showed everyone who wasnt part of the mass that was flying towards space running away on all sides so they couldnt have been hurt by debris and it showed them get everyone but quicksilver off of the floating island alive so this movie had to ignore the events of age of ultron to work    they conveniently left vision out of the beginning of the film so he wasnt there to clock the bomb vest crossbones was wearing it also relied on everyone forgetting that the us government had been infiltrated by hydra so why trust control of powerful beings like the avengers to the un when there is no guarentee there arent evil forces working there that would exploit the avengers for their own gain  and i loved how none of the avengers saw fit to mention to ross that had they done nothing the human race would be enslaved and millions would be dead and none of them shoved in his face that if they hadnt have been there the invasion of new york still would have happened and everyone in the city would have died because the government fired a nuke at the city to stop the invaders  the avengers had to sit and not defend themselves just for the sake of the story    the civil war was more like a scuffle used to try to make it seem deep but it was just a display of their powers and an excuse to shoehorn in spiderman    makes tony look bad because he knows bucky is innocent of killing the leader of wakanda but doesnt bother to tell anyone that way he can keep steve and the others as criminals    it was mighty convenient that tony realized steve was right otherwise he wouldnt have shown up so zemo could show him the conveniently placed camera footage that conveniently proved that bucky had killed tonys parents while brainwashed even had expert assassin winter soldier stand and stare at the camera so everyone could get a really good look at their killer    this movie was just so bad everyone bashes batman vs superman which did have its problems but not enough to warrant a 26 6070 maybe but while everyone made sure that only the negative aspects of that movie were focused on the same people make sure that this movies good points are all that is focused on instead of a 90 it should have pretty much the same score id give batman vs superman 6070 full of flaws but the good do outweigh the bad    so its hypocritical to give this movie universal praise when it relies on so many plotholes and conveniences just to function fill any of the plotholes and it falls apart
Mar 26 2017,positive,best superhero movie ever  even batter than avengers 2012 and age of ultron   i love it
Mar 26 2017,positive,despite a couple tiny flaws like an unnecessary villain and perhaps too many new characters captain americacivil war is well written acted along with amazing action and a justified reason for iron man and captain america to fight each other its a great movie to be a part of the mcu
Mar 26 2017,positive,its one of the best comic book movies with amazing action sequences and visuals it has also the balls to explore thoughtprovoking themes
Mar 25 2017,positive,falls in love with the rest of the mcu great storyline also a great way to introduce new characters and bring back old ones and set up future storylines
Mar 25 2017,negative,winter soldier maybe the best super hero movie of all time  this is the most over rated movie of all time great fight seen at the airport  watch the reality trailer for this movie and you will see the entire plot makes no sense
Mar 24 2017,positive,chris evans is the best and the ending took me by surprise
Mar 24 2017,positive,fantastic action movie    while it cant match its incredible predecessor the winter soldier it is nonetheless an extraordinary display in how to handle a huge cast of characters multiple plotlines and still make something that is exciting funny action packed enjoyable and even moving     the movie really capitalizes on the shared marvel cinematic universe and theres so much of the history from a huge number of their previous films that pays off here and enriches the experience    my only real criticism is that the big superhero battle  in the middle detracts from the tonal consistencly of the film as a whole and undermines the 70s thriller style they were continuing to go for in the same vein as the winter soldier    that battle is everything youve ever wanted to see in terms of a full scale superhero smack down and it like the movie as a whole is a ton of fun
Mar 23 2017,positive,captain americacivil war is a movie about bickering superheroes with captivating energetic action sequence with strong characterization however the villain is again forgettable an a  after 12 marvel movies the world and characters marvel have built through these movies has been well realised  so what are the stories left to tell well how about a rumblentumble between all the superheroes a riftargument between them to a colossal proportion the marvel superheroes have always been united especially through the avengers teams so a conflict between them can be a major plot point  in this 13th marvel movie and 3rd captain america moviethat is what actually happens the avengers continue to hunt down criminals globally but us secretary of state thaddeus ross william hurt and almost all un leaders think that the avengerssuperheroes should be identifiedregulated and supervised by the un under the sokovian accords treaty claiming that the avengers have caused reckless destruction killing innocent bystanders  the superheroes are divided over whether they should sign the treaty with a side led by iron man robert downey jr arguing that the heroes should be accountable for their actions and conform to law and another opposing side led by captain america chris evans arguing that the avengers should be an independent entity free from political influenceinterests  the movie provided a strong argument for both sides and never do i felt swayed by one side only the characterisations and motivations of the heroes are aptly enhancedespecially for cap and iron man their friendship is really put to the test the emotions are raw and heartbreaking  and there is a villain lurking in the shadows however the villain in this movie is not engagingmenacing enough which has always been marvels weakness save for loki  the movie also deftly introducereintroduce 2 heroes to the marvel pantheon and amazingly their limited screentime is enough to flesh out both characters  the action is stupendous the best that u have seen in a marvel movie and that is saying something it is very energetic kinetic and inventive especially the avengers operation in nigeria at the beginning of the movie a running chase scene involving cap and 2 other characters and the climactic allout rumblebattle between both sides of superheroes at a private airport that battle involves almost all of the heroes in the marvel cinematic universe so far  tldr it is an excellent movie recommended for everyone i have been intentionally vague about the plot so that u can enjoy it for yourself an a
Mar 23 2017,positive,best marvel movie of all time
Mar 22 2017,positive,honestly its not as amazing as everyone says it is but is still very enjoyable just a bit slow and boring at times with a very poor villain but the action makes up for it
Mar 21 2017,positive,captain america continues to be the best vehicle for the marvel universe but ultimately im getting a little bored with it and civil war didnt do enough new to make me think wow what a great film in its own right
Mar 21 2017,negative,this movies is so bad spiderman sucks ass he is gay
Mar 20 2017,positive,i love marvel maybe a little to much it does not have much in common with the comic book series besides them being divided though a different plot the movie is still amazing lots of action great visual affects and the story is still pretty good
Mar 20 2017,positive,captain america civil war comic book nerds who as children used to fantasize about which superheroes which win battles with one other will be delighted with this third installment in the captain america franchise which features just that when world governments attempt to curb their powers creating a schism within the avengers the two and a half hour film however is tediously long for all but the most diehard fans who will be delighted at the usual visual effects and trademark battle scenes b
Mar 19 2017,neutral,it was like watching batman v superman with the extended edition but without the willingness to go all the way evil another issue of bad villains that dont fit the storylines zemo was useless and the drowning scene was so poorly shot take out ironman zemo and the civil war idea and just keep bucky cap and panther and you had a great story line
Mar 19 2017,positive,by far the most emotionally lacking  yet of this series and rather disappointing compared to the caliber of the ones before
Mar 18 2017,positive,an avengers movie which shows 2 colliding teams of heroes lead by iron man and captain america in a classic battle all holds up until the end which shows iron man taking on captain and bucky in one of the most epic battles ever a battle that will effect the avengers a battle that will effect the mcu who wins iron man or cap which team wins civil war is one of the most epic superhero movies you will ever see on screen my score 97
Mar 18 2017,neutral,one of the most overrated movies to date
Mar 18 2017,positive,best film of 2016 for me personally waited such a long time for this filmblack panther  spiderman made the movie for me
Mar 17 2017,positive,i am still not sure why this is supposedly better than batman v superman well made but i do not like watching my heroes go after each other for me the resolution was unsatisfying it is made all the worse by the fact that it is nearly ignored by the next film
Mar 17 2017,positive,captain america civil war was a very emotional and intense movie i say this because during the other films where all the avengers are in one movie they work as a team to defeat the enemy theyve always had each others back for example when loki opened the portal to another dimension in avengers considering theyve been through alot together you would think they would be friends for ever but no civil war changes everything in the film the team is divided into 2 captain america doesnt want to be felt as government property and iron man doesnt want to loose the team so he goes head to head with each other my favorite part was when iron man found out who killed his family and destroyed the guys iron arm
Mar 16 2017,positive,a tremendous story with lots of action explosions heart comedy and some pacing issues
Mar 15 2017,negative,ey tony how are you yeah ye yeah interesting yeah your fathers are dead oh god ill going to sleep
Mar 14 2017,negative,most boring overrated movie ever
Mar 13 2017,positive,it definitely has its moments and is better than some of the marvell movies but still not great
Mar 13 2017,positive,a heavy storydriven film with laughs sadness fantastic action and set pieces and some pacing issues
Mar 13 2017,positive,its what batman v superman could have been but seriously its just a better version of bvs  it has a lot of things in common with dawn of justice  the end result is way better than what bvs is but it just has that many things in common  but is definitely worth a watch even though its a lot like batman v superman
Mar 11 2017,positive,marvel did their thing captain america lived up to the rest of the marvel comics depiction
Mar 10 2017,positive,i dont see how they could have done this one any better im extremely satisfied with this film
Mar 8 2017,positive,if there is 1 sentence i can say for why captain america civil war was awesome to watch it would be the airport fight scene was the best fight scene i have seen in any marvel superhero film but it wasnt just actionpacked it was also emotional in a way that was just so mindboggling and so entertaining 9999 of the characters were great and a bunch of other things
Mar 7 2017,positive,while i believed deadpool was a good film captain america civil war is the best comic book film of the year  not only was this the best comic book film of the year but possibly the best product marvel has put out since avengers  as a fan of the original comic run of civil war i was hoping that marvel would adapt the story to their cinematic universe since the announcement of the mcu  while the story doesnt translate word for word thanks fox to the original comic the film keeps the core beliefs and story arcs alive in the film adaptation
Mar 7 2017,positive,an excellent film from characters to acting from plot and to emotion   though it is full to the brim of characters old and new it never feels bloated and remains a captain america story through and through chris evans does an excellent job in portraying the conflict cap feels as well as the resolve to remain who he is robert downy jr is excellent as iron man but never steals the spotlight from cap but adds to the film not making it an iron man 4 film and the introduction of tom holland as spiderman is a fantastic casting choice and the brief screen time he does have has won many people over  the airport fight is built nicely and the fight itself is one of the best not only in a cbm but movies in general  an excellent film that ties the past together and sets up the future in interesting ways
Mar 5 2017,neutral,incredibly boring and samey fighting between the heroes is totally unnecessary the story is pretty much based around the destruction caused in the previous movie so shallow its ridiculous this is an avengers movie and not a captain america movie whatsoever its all just total rubbish and completely boring funny here and there but a poor follow on from the incredible winter soldier  better on second watch
Mar 5 2017,positive,should really be called avengers 3 superb marvel wins again with humour action combo    theverdict marvel vs dc dc is pulverised spiderman is in it need i say more
Mar 4 2017,positive,an amazing climax to a longtime build of conflict throughout marvels cinematic universe     the russo brothers balance a culmination of suspenseful turmoil explosive action welltimed humor and even character development across the board of a roster never before seen on the silver screen    a landmark for superhero films
Mar 4 2017,positive,captain america civil war keeps its serious tone from the past captain america movies with not so much jokes like marvel in almost every movie and introducing all the new and old avengers fighting together even if it is against themselves
Mar 3 2017,positive,classic the way marvel does this is astounding
Mar 3 2017,positive,airplane fight scene is worth the price of admission alone though not a perfect movie this is one of marvels best for sure
Mar 3 2017,positive,weakest of the previous captain america but still a good movie
Mar 3 2017,positive,the editing on the action scenes was realistic ive seen this film twice already and i still cant figure out why iron man and captain america are beefed out the only thing that makes this film amazing is spoiler spiderman
Mar 2 2017,positive,more like avengers 25 than a straight third installment in the captain america film franchise but its still heavy on the cap so us cap fans will still love it black panther is pretty cool in this another of my favorite marvel characters from back in the day sets up what seems pretty could be a pretty cool movie some cool action scenes especially the airport fight scene if youve seen it you know what im talking about its maybe the best action scene in any marvel movie while not a great self contained story it does push the mcu narrative along well and sets up some awesome potential plot points for future films
Mar 2 2017,positive,it was supposed to be about a fundamental ideological opposition in the end it was about a guy taking his bromance way way too seriously
Mar 1 2017,positive,loads of visual entertainment and unbelievable action sequences with a deeper plot then we find in many action superhero filmsoh and if that isnt enough there is an all star cast including elizabeth olsen 
Mar 1 2017,positive,this review contains spoilers     political pressure mounts to install a system of accountability when the actions of the avengers lead to collateral damage the new status quo deeply divides members of the team captain america chris evans believes superheroes should remain free to defend humanity without government interference iron man robert downey jr sharply disagrees and supports oversight as the debate escalates into an allout feud black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner must pick a side    since 2008 disney have changed the face of the superhero movie with their triumphant marvel cinematic universe the superhero genre yes its its own genre now has produced some terrific films many people believe xmen 2000 started the modern era of superhero movie craze and while i do agree i think it was sam raimis spiderman 2002 that gave it the boost it needed and the one it deserved these were real characters with real depth the 2004 sequel was even better building upon the story that the original started we got a better insight into who these characters were and what made them so special its the real beauty of a sequel they allow you to explore so many different aspects of a character its why tv shows are the goto place for excellent character development we get to know them for years and it helps us sympathise with them the mcu feels much like a tv show each phase is a season and each season ends with a finale avengersavengers age of ultron    captain america civil war adapts mark millars popular comic book that saw the avengers the xmen the fantastic four and much of the marvel universe collide the comic was filled with deaths betrayals and fantastic monologues that furthered the dark side of the marvel universe that we had previously seen in stories like house of m    unlike the comic the movie feels much smaller and more personal to captain america sure you can call this avengers 25 but it still feels like what is is as heart a captain america movie captain america civil war is packed with some incredible fight scenes and an engaging plot which differs dramatically from the source material its adapting we have spent numerous movies with these characters and to see the compromises they make in this film is what makes it stand out    while the avengers are on a mission their carelessness leads to the deaths of innocent civilians and political pressure begins to squeeze them into choosing a side save the day with absolute freedom or fight by order of bureaucrats while previous mcu films are all about fun adventure and heroism civil war brings the universe into a real world with real consequences if the events that took place in both avengers movies were real life there would be hundreds of innocent lives lost and this would be something that is immediately brought up yet we dont hear about that grim side of it until this movie the characters and the audience are both being smacked in the face with consequence its what watchmen 2009 and the incredibles 2004 do so damn well however the film isnt necessarily a downer unlike batman v superman dawn of justice the film still has plenty of the humour and fun that the mcu has come to be so widely known for not that thats a fault of bvs so theres a mixture of seriousness and jokiness and i dont think that works too well    until the final few scenes i never felt any real tension the first act is full of reasons why the avengers is a controversial branch of the once mighty shield and so we understand that something big has to happen and once the avengers take sides we expect brutal deathfilled warfare after all the movie has war in the title however the second act contains an action scene that felt as though it was out of a completely different mcu film one with a lighter tone where there were no real worries and it was all about fun they have come here to fight and if needs be kill each other in order to make a stand and have their way in an incredibly important and serious issue so what do they do why they tell jokes of course theyre not supposed to be having fun they should be terrified about the outcome of the fight but its not even clear if they want to kill each other or not of course like every mcu movie there are no major characters who die and stay dead this takes away the impact and any tension the airport scene could have had had there been one or even two characters die the airport scene is one that was made to entertain rather than propel the story    in comparison the final confrontation between rogers bucky and stark is brilliant this fight has raw emotion its brutal where the airport sequence focused on spectacle and great big set pieces this fight has a much smaller scale yet the stakes are so much greater there has never been a fight in the mcu like the fight at the end of civil war and im not sure well ever get one like it again    my favourite thing about this movie is the philosophy that weaves the story and separates the characters the dark knight sees batman and the joker fight a battle of wits daredevil season 2 sees daredevil and the punisher collide in both verbal and physical battle batman v superman takes batmans anger and plots it against supermans naivety captain america civil war has the patriotism of captain america go up against the compromising and regretful iron man the writers stephen mcfeely and christopher markus do an excellent job of giving reasoning and understanding as to why there is conflict and why the two lead characters take different sides but the minor characters dont seem to get enough screen time or dialogue they pretty much decide their team in a few lines or less it doesnt feel like the characters made the decisions themselves but the writers along with the good writing for the lead characters both robert downey junior and captain america give their best performances of the mcu thus far as far as newcomers go black panther and spiderman had great onscreen presence chadwick boseman gives a fine performance and his character has a touching and inspired arc tom holland brings a spiderman that weve never really seen before he is very much like the spiderman from the ultimate universe in that he looks a lot younger and doesnt shut up although a little shoehorned in he works really well throughout his sequences and it was a great advert for spiderman homecoming    the film almost feels like one producer wanted them to go dark with this and another wanted them to stick to the usual mcu feel when war machine is blown out the sky and free falls into the ground he should be dead no question but its the mcu and so he is more or less fine hes walking again not soon after its this sort of thing that makes me a little sick of the mcu it almost feels like schlock same formula same result i have to say i enjoyed this movie but not nearly as much as i wanted to    its uncommon for superhero movies to directly adapt a single story from the comics they rarely even use the name of the comic they are inspired by or are are adapting on the contrary captain america civil war uses the name of the comic and i suppose would call itself an adaptation but it greatly differs from the overall story and tone of the comic had they faithfully adapted the comic i think it would have felt out of place for many people if many characters were killed off in this film and if it was handled really well i would have loved that but im not sure the general audience would have been too keen the mcu took the ultimate risk in bringing all of these characters together but from there there hasnt been much to greatly admire about the mcu like there once was    score 35
Feb 28 2017,positive,hero against hero not only shows us a different take on a marvel film but also gives us a little taste of whats to come for infinity war new spiderman tom holland proves to the audience that hes perfect for the role of 15 year old spidey
Feb 27 2017,positive,im team tony all the way
Feb 27 2017,positive,when you have no good ideas for a villain have superheros fighting among themselves
Feb 26 2017,positive,a darker more thoughtprovoking film than most in the mcu civil war boasts epic combat and a sense of tension maintained throughout i thought the villain was interesting although others would disagree the new additions to the cast were also a welcome bonus
Feb 26 2017,positive,this movie has everything that age of ultron did not great action a decent plot and multiple avengers interacting in an entertaining way
Feb 25 2017,positive,a very actionpacked and thoughtprovoking movie it presents real world themes bringing the marvel cinematic universe ever so closer to our own world almost every character is interesting making us feel their struggles and problems robert downey jr once again steals the show as tony stark tom holland is a brilliant actor to introduce spiderman to the universe with great comedic timing and a fantastic  representation of the character this movie is intensely intriguing and will have you clapping once you reach the credits
Feb 25 2017,negative,kids movie alert   8 years old and under   no room for adults in this one folks
Feb 25 2017,positive,the action scenes are the most exciting and well choreographed definitely a few notches up compared to batman vs superman  mainly it is because everyone of the superheros has their own signature weapons and skills who does not want to know which superhero has the upper edge the budget that goes to the big stellar cast must be astronomical it is one of the rare movies where the selling points is merely the fights and not about the story and i dont mind a bit
Feb 25 2017,positive,i dont see how they could have done this one any better im extremely satisfied with this film
Feb 24 2017,negative,i was an avid marvel studios fan until this movie came out from start to finish this film was full of choppy editing exceedingly poor dialogue and very cringy character portrayals it takes a pretty bad film to make me walk out on one and this captain america sequel made it very tempting to i was taken aback at how carelessly this film was made after the russo brothers pulled off the winter soldier so wondrously captain america civil war is definitely a prime example of just how much an embarrassingly huge budget can overwhelm even the finest of directors smh
Feb 23 2017,positive,amazing simply one of the best comic book movies of all time
Feb 23 2017,negative,battle was silly  goofy and childish  like a bunch of kids fighting over a toy epic my ass there was only one fight   comic book is better     thank god for logan movie we get to see a really epic battle against reavers and x24
Feb 23 2017,positive,good movie with dramatic fight scenes filled with heroes
Feb 23 2017,positive,civil war was boring
Feb 23 2017,positive,this film is a master piece if you want to see captain america do what he does best then this is your film
Feb 22 2017,positive,captain america civil war is a miracle of digital effects that mashes the previous marvels masterpieces of iron man 3 and captain america winter soldier into an action packed and thrilling visual spectacle the basic plot of the movie is the battle between the respective leaders of the avengers tony stark aka iron man played by robert downey jr and steve rodgers better known as captain america played by chris evans over the future of the group this leads to intense and conflicting moments for long time fans of the series who have grown to love both characters  lets just start off by saying that this movie had a budget of a quarter of a billion dollars with that kind of money in the works one would expect nothing less than the best with writers such as christopher marcus behind the scenes and a a list cast the movie was predestined to be a blockbuster all of this put into the capable hands of both joe and anthony russo has produced a movie that is a thrill to watch and a fitting homage to its prequels   as always robert downey jr and chris evans shine in their roles as they have come to be the living embodiment of their characters their lines were smooth and well executed and both were obviously comfortable on the set being portrayed as alpha males on set but the real thrill for me came in watching some of the lessor roles scarlett johanssons black widow interpretation continually adds a little emotion to her cold assassin persona that is very much central to the plot twists bucky the previous antagonist in captain america winter soldier was finally developed more thoroughly and sebastian stan absolutely nailed it his rough style of acting blends well as both a villain and an old friend to the group and he really added a lot of depth and emotion to the film   just because i love the actors doesnt they were all fantastic the newcomers antman paul rudd and spiderman tom holland added comedic relief but in my opinion their recent introduction to the characters limited their effectiveness to drive the plot however both paul bettany and chadwick boseman vision and black panther put on stunning displays being this is bosemans introduction to the marvels universe im sure we can expect big things from him in the future everything considered it was a star studded supporting staff that enabled the filmmakers to put even more depth into an already heartwrenching movie  sadly nothing is ever perfect this is evident on a second viewing the main issue with the movie is it almost feels like four or five movies compressed into one film i often caught myself thinking i was seeing the finale in the middle of the movie because there was a lot of action and emotion in the film the lack of a stable storyline was overlooked by almost everyone watching for the first time overall this movie is still a stunning masterpiece that will put you on the edge of your seat and keep you there for its duration  so was it a great film i think yes in an era of films tailored to suit all ages this is about as good as it gets there is something for everyone in captain america civil war for the diehard fans it tears you to pieces watching chaos consume the team that youve grown to love after all to quote robert e lee it is well that war is so terrible else many would grow fond of it
Feb 21 2017,negative,civil war is a disgustingly contrived bore that champions the moral that the friendships of the powerful few triumph over the lives of the many 117 sovereign nations come together to craft a peaceful treaty to reign in the avengers but captain america decides his lifes calling is to reject any limit to his authority the fight between allies was as pointless as batman v superman yet somehow worse and the comedy lacked its typical punch the only redeemable part of this movie was the black panther a character with rational thought and believable justifications but he is practically drowned in the catastrophic melting pot that is captain america civil war    the take were not movie critics but we might be better  
Feb 20 2017,positive,great marvel movie for the avengers
Feb 19 2017,negative,is this tony stank    worst writing childrens jokes very unintelligent script
Feb 15 2017,positive,great superhero movie marvel never ceases to deliver im a huge fan of the comic story line and they did a great job of bringing it to the big screen all the characters have enough screen time and you really understand the struggles of both cap and ironman its amazing the film makers were able to fill this movie with a ton of heroes and not make it feel bloated or overly long filled with great moments like the arrival of spiderman back to the mcu and an exploration of some of the less well known characters like hawkeye might be the best marvel  movie to date
Feb 14 2017,positive,emotional action packed thrill ride loved it worth buying for sure
Feb 12 2017,positive,nothing special about this one
Feb 12 2017,positive,great fight scenes and decent plotline and backstory probably the best in the series so far
Feb 10 2017,positive,marvels as ive come to know lot of gadgets and special powers and fight scenes
Feb 10 2017,positive,with a thoughtful plot and solid action this is what marvel movies should aspire to
Feb 7 2017,positive,fair though i didnt believe the stance or spineless followers on each side spiderman was annoying
Feb 7 2017,positive,i was at the edge of my seat through the whole movie i cant believe how great the got cap and tony with all they went through and how their motivations are caused by what have happened in previous movies fight scenes are just pure beauty and grace black panther rocks and i cant wait to see his solo movie the storyline of bucky was just thrilling and his relationship with steve is everything i ever wanted it makes whole fandom which i love to the deepest pits of my soul 1010 3
Feb 7 2017,positive,best marvel film so far and little below the realistic dark knight which still stands strong as the best superhero movie hype was big and russo brothers didnt disappoint just another strong step for marvel as they enter the phase three
Feb 6 2017,positive,in my opinion captain america civil war is marvel studios best and one of the greatest superhero films of all time the third chapter in the first avengers series of films and the thirteenth chapter in the marvel cinematic universe divides our heroes into two factions after they requested to run under the control of the united nations some agree and others oppose which leads to some amazing action and stellar writing the airport fight scene alone is enough to make the film worth seeing it sees the return of many old faces sorry no hulk or thor and the introduction of new heroes to the mcu black panther spiderman which does lead to a lot of side plots which does lead the movie feeling ambit cluttered but the film does manage to tie up all the loose ends by the end this also leads to numerous films getting set up throughout such as spiderman homecoming and black panther the main villain zemo attempts to get revenge on the divided avengers by getting them to kill each other but his plan similar to lex luthors in batman v superman is very convoluted and relies a little too much on chance despite this and the fact that a bit too much goes on in the film its an actionfilled sometimes humorous and downright entertaining ride from beginning to end
Feb 4 2017,positive,ignore the plot holes  sit back  and enjoy the ride
Feb 4 2017,negative,awful worst movie of 2016 rip off of bvs from the trailer to the poster
Feb 4 2017,positive,disappointing i loved the first two and this was good but not good enough spiderman was irritating and black panther wasnt that great either bucky was the most exciting character in it i reckon still definitely worth a watch
Feb 2 2017,positive,hi everyone so lets jump into the review this movie is fucking amazing captain america civil war is what the perfect captain america sequel and avenger sequel finally after 13 movies we finally have a complex villain with a very interesting motivation he wasnt weak in my opinion zemo was actually a strong villain because he had a reason to do what he did words cannot express how happy i am to see marvel step it up with the villains  anyways this movie is amazing on all points from a human perspective a political perspective and from a superhero perspective i think the story was interesting how everything is surrounded by consequences vengance and the biggest themefriendship literally if a building blows up the people are going to go ape shit on the avengers  this is by far the best performance from robert downey jr since iron man 1 there is one scene in the end where if youre in film class you can do an entire analysis on tony stark alone this was the most interesting tony stark in a long time and his character was awesome you will feel bad for tony stark in the movie  this movie is honestly a character study for superheroes there is another scene where the avengers are discussing superhero politics and you can study that too you will sway toward team cap or team iron man this movie couldve been where you only see caps side and thats it but instead you get everyones perspective from spiderman well get to him in the spoiler review to the star captain america and its glorious  now i usually never rate anything a 1010 unless if i feel something or i am truly moved and this movie actually did it this rating is by being an actual movie too as a superhero movie 1010 forsure but as a film this movie is both epic emotional dramatic and most of all brilliant but the only 2 movies ive given 1010 to is the dark knight and the avengers 1 guess what this will be on the pallet of the 3 superhero movies to make me do this but i give captain america a 1010  ps this movie is so good that batman v superman doesnt deserve to be compared to this movie
Feb 1 2017,positive,this was awesome much better than batman vs superman
Feb 1 2017,positive,i really think that the captain americas series is the best from marvel so far its the only one where each movie got better than the last one and i cant say the same for the other series thor iron man the avengers  this one is full of jawdropping action amazing cgi and all the characters that chose a side teamcap or teamironman had their reasons well explained    full review    rating a
Feb 1 2017,positive,not bad  i guess they had to do it and because they did i kinda felt that maybe they might be running out of ideas  im sure there will be a few more good super hero movies but they maybe numbered
Jan 30 2017,positive,admittedly i am unfamiliar with all these franchises i bet on a legit system this movie would have sounded great i made it to the end thats at least worth an average rating for me thats 610     i think chris evans can be a good actor and robert downey though he plays the same guy in everything can somehow be great these movies have brought in quite a cast and everyone is there in this one that and some decent effects and action sequences again make this at least average perhaps more if youre into these kinds of movies
Jan 30 2017,positive,although this movie doesnt exceed expectations it certainly meets them by presenting characters you are made to care for and some of the greatest action scenes the mcu has to offer
Jan 30 2017,positive,i understand its a captain america movie but it feels like rdj and chris evans get entirely too much screen time by themselves the black panther and the winter soldiers story arc could have been phenomenal with a little work of course vision and scarlett witchs arc as well still visually gorgeous and gritty incredible acting aplenty still good ole marvel
Jan 29 2017,positive,the action as always is some of the best youll see but the way to story ties together by the end is really what makes it perfect
Jan 28 2017,positive,excellent movie  complex ideas were distilled into an understandable dialogue between the characters  all of the characters continued to develop and change as they faced the consequences of their actions  heroism freedom vengeance and national security are all debated but without being overbearing or pedantic the action and special effects fit into the story and are a part of the conflict rather than distracting from the plot  very good movie with comic book superheroes used as a vehicle for debating contemporary issues while being very entertaining and bringing the captain america character to life on the big screen  very well done movie and thoroughly enjoyable
Jan 27 2017,positive,the russo brothers captain america civil war was a very good film i do believe that the title adapted from the critically acclaimed graphic novel written by mark millar did not suit it i felt that an adaption of this title couldve have better been saved for another movie truly felt wasted in general i thought the movie was solid but somewhat of a let down not on the same level and excitement that captain america the winter soldier gave me but a great effort nonetheless and honestly this feels more like an avengers 25 movie rather than a captain america 3 movie my favorite things about the movie are chris evans steve rogerscaptain america as always he does a great job chadwick bosemans tchallablack panther and tom hollads peter parkerspiderman 1 of my least favorite things were robert downey jrs character development had taken a toll as i stated it was a good film a step down from the last but good
Jan 26 2017,positive,i really wanted to give this less than 3 stars there is so much wrong with this film but the one shining moment makes this a 3 star movie     thin story no real urgency and false views on character relationships make this one of the more poor films in the mcu
Jan 26 2017,positive,good movie great action bit of a twist ending
Jan 25 2017,positive,this movie is an excellent actionpacked ride from beggining to end and adds another piece to the brilliant mcu all the effects acting and cinematagrophy are great as to be expected from a marvel film the movie opens with a great chase sequence of crossbones and his henchmen this is one of the negatives of this movie however as crossbones dies in the first ten minutes this also launches the whole sakovia accords part of this movie this is yet another dumb part because even the government wouldnt be this anal yes some people died when crossbones blew up however the avengers stopped him from unleashing a biochemical weapon that would have killed many more people they also bring back up new york and the alien invasion from the first movieis it just me or wasnt the government going to drop a nuke after you get past this the rest of the movie is excellent the two opposing ideologies begin the group down a path of self destruction around here we meet zemo the main antagonist of the film i feel that his characters motivations and plan make complete sense after the bombing at the un is blamed on bucky we are treated to an excellent action sequence where we are introduced to black panther played excellently by chadwick boseman skipping ahead bucky is eventually used by zemo to get the mission report for december 16 1991 this eventually leads to bucky trying to escape and captain stopping a helicopter with his bare hands which is the first of many incredible moments in this movie we then learn of the existence of five more winter soldiers and that having an army of them is zemos end game finally we get to the ultimate showdown cap recruits hawkeye ant man and scarlet witch while tony adds vision and spiderman to his side by the way tom hollands spiderman is the best we have ever had on screen he is funny and witty but also seems like an actual teenager there are so many awesome things to discuss from the epic fight giant man was awesome hawkeye and black widows fighting was excellent and the end where vision accidently hits war machine is emotionally devestating finally captain and bucky are on their way to confront zemo in siberia at the same time tony discovers the truth and heads out to help them when they all arrive they find that the winter soldiers are all shot dead and this is when zemos true plot comes to fruition he shows what happened on december 16 1991 and that bucky killed tonys parents this leads us to the final epic battle where tony is eventually bested by cap but not till after bucky loses his arm cap dropping his shield is also one of the best things ive seen in a superhero film so much weight there i love this movie the two new characters that we get are excellent the motivations driving the avengers apart make complete sense zemo is a servicable villain ultimately this movie proves to be even better than its predecessors
Jan 24 2017,positive,this movie is very good much better than batman vs superman but i had some problems with the movie both black panther spider man and ant man were thrown into the movie for no reason although the characters were awesome they didnt fit in the movie  the movie also has an awesome fight scene although it is awesome besides a couple of the heroes they have no reason to want to murder each other also there was no tension in the fight we know none of them were going to die unless it was telegraphed quick silver in age of ultron because were going to see them in like 10 other movies it was good dont get me wrong but definitely not perfect
Jan 23 2017,positive,or bs 2    the similarity between this film and batman vs superman has not been lost on fans  it has been on some reviewers  but not me while bs is intense serious and gloomy ca always has its marvel sense of humour lurking thats why we have ant man and spiderman in this one just when it gets too serious out come the jokes though they share so many plot points and characters ca can trump bs with a laugh    and the set pieces  well they are pretty good the fight at the airport is classic avengers bs has set pieces too but they are dramatic not exhilarating yet i enjoyed bs more  a little more  because the avengers franchise has now been stretched a bit too far and jesse eisenberg as luther is just great avengers needs a decent villain a loki  its own heroes make poor villain subs    not a great addition to the franchise
Jan 22 2017,positive,great movie good script different characters on same movie most of the times is good mix shame the fight each other always same team please 
Jan 22 2017,positive,im a little disappointed with this movie perhaps my my biggest disappointment with marvel studios the heroes have been shamefully misused probably the large amount of characters causes this   im worried about avengers 3 and 4
Jan 22 2017,positive,unlike the critics and the audiences this is a disappointing sequel to its predecessor captain america the winter soldier i had high expectations before viewing this movie but when it finished i was pretty disappointed but i have to say the character development and the depth for each of the characters were pretty impressive for that many the character motive of his or her action was explained well however for me the action was kind of disappointing there was not much of an intense handtohand combat scene the airport battle seemed a giant mash of all the good action scenes of the past marvel films that did not work for me but at least the humor was great and the chemistry of the characters were impressive as well there were some awesome characters like black panther spiderman was very fun to see but he didnt seem that necessary to be in the movie also the disappointment for me was the central conflict between the main two characters captain america and iron man it didnt really felt like they were against each other also the villain of this film zemo felt unnecessary as well overall captain america civil war was a disappointment and i think it is the same class as batman v superman
Jan 20 2017,positive,better than i expected
Jan 20 2017,neutral,captain america civil war was one of the most sought after film of 2016 although many critics may give the film great reviews i actually disagree with most of them the movie follows the same rhythm of all these films set piece lame joke set piece lame joke bunker in berlin set piece lame joke set piece im assuming the moral complexity is intended to be in the conflicts between the characters but these conflicts are all so obvious and cartoonish that i absolutely failed to detect it it felt like the stakes were set really high but the payout didnt really pay off the film sets up this huge conflict and as i watched i started to think very seriously that something really really bad was going to happen  in the end however things are justokay no major character dies stark and rogers dont hate one another and neither suffers any grievous setback the movie did have some redeeming factors though tony stark was great as iron man as he proves that this was a role that he was born to play another stand out from the cast was the introduction of spider man  the movie is beautifully shot and the sound mixing is some of the best the special effects were also great and that airport scene was well made the movie is just predictable and shows that marvel is afraid of taking risks with their characters
Jan 19 2017,negative,tertibly cliche in the marvel series and so diluted from the original plot i can now only expect this out of disney
Jan 18 2017,positive,a good followup that puts actors in scenes together and gives them meaningful dialogue that is awesome
Jan 17 2017,positive,yeah youre marvel fan no no i didnt say you were a superhero nerd but youve watched these you already know about the witty humor the relationships that have been built the enjoyable introduction of new characters this one ranks pretty high on the list of marvel movies thus far
Jan 17 2017,negative,i know a lot of people like captain america but i hated this movie by the end of the film i was hoping that someone would kill captain america because he was so irritating i should add that for a film thats aimed at kids this is rather violent and has some swearing in it  rather irresponsible from the film makers
Jan 16 2017,neutral,relatively typical marvel fare with impressive special effects and action sequences fused with annoying and distracting humor it is however slightly better than many other marvel efforts due to a clear ethical discussion and the inclusion of more previously unseen characters
Jan 15 2017,positive,another great  marvel movie black panther was a great addition and finally a proper spiderman
Jan 15 2017,positive,incredible work on entering new characters in history in a short time
Jan 14 2017,positive,fantastic story great unexpected
Jan 14 2017,positive,there are so many things that should have gone wrong but that is a testament to why civil war works so well fantastic action sequences and a willingness to explore foreign territory in its themes culminate in civil war as the definitive blockbuster of 2016
Jan 14 2017,positive,captain americacivil war is an amazing film and my 2nd favorite mcu movie the russo brothers continue the cap trilogy with a ton of consequential actionairport scene black panther and spiderman are a welcome addition to the mcu franchise most of the cast from avengersage of ultron rises high also in this movie and the pacing is well made for some of the time zemo is still underdevelopedevery villain in the mcu feels bad except for loki and the pacing feels somewhat slow as some action takes forever to get to still a welcome addition to what the mcu can accomplish
Jan 13 2017,negative,i have absolutly no clue how any could rate this higher than a two it was stupid childish and had one hell of a bad script boring plot line bad editing no depth in any of the production whatsoever the first two were good but this was just straight up shit if you think this was better than winter soldier in absolutely anyway your opinion should have no value on any movie ever made this was a bad movie
Jan 13 2017,positive,the story is a cluster fuck and a snooze at best but the entertaining action is keeping me from giving it a fat 0
Jan 12 2017,positive,great action and a strong first half but bloated overlong and the hole plot was muddled
Jan 12 2017,positive,oh my gosh this movie was so cool the airport battle was the best super hero movies battle scene in all super hero movies my favourite character was spiderman
Jan 12 2017,positive,i loved rooting for captain america with my boyfriend rooting for iron man was just more entertainment in top of the movies great entertainment
Jan 12 2017,positive,winter soldier was wayyyyyyy better
Jan 11 2017,positive,im definitely hitting fatigue with the mcu
Jan 10 2017,negative,so lame unrealistic fight scenes as most hollywood crap movies and so boring i was falling asleep watching it i only watched it because it had 45 stars on netflix now i cant trust their ratings either its a kids movie
Jan 9 2017,negative,boring ugly and forgettable i cannot and will not begin to try and understand how this film is reviewed so well the action scenes are uninspired spiderman felt tacked on and the plot lines that tie ironman and cap into their feud feel that way also the introduction of black panther is this films only saving grace dont believe the hype this movie is a total bore
Jan 9 2017,negative,was a disappointment compared to other marvel movies full of one liners and tried to hard to be funny no hulk it does introduce some new characters which was nice but not enough to make up for the dull movie
Jan 9 2017,negative,you call that a war what a waste
Jan 8 2017,negative,very disappointing i thought that the premise had the potential to be great but there was just too much over the top emoting and posing for posters
Jan 8 2017,positive,loved loved loved it
Jan 8 2017,negative,just goes to show todays generation of critics and viewers have no idea of what a good movie  a foolish plot thats so sappy at its core and with a half asleep cast makes it one of the worst in its genre
Jan 8 2017,positive,i dont know if its just coincidence or something about the state of the world right now that both the marvel and dc film franchises have movies dealing with the legality and morality of allowing costumed superheroes to destroy entire buildings and bystanders while they fight their super villains in civil war the avengers face the consequences of their actions in age of ultron in which an entire city was destroyed and countless innocents lost their lives the un wants to control and direct the avengers the avengers themselves cant agree on whether they should submit to this so they end up fighting with each other unfortunately the conflict is simply not plausible enough to accept that they cant talk this through several new superheroes are introduced including a new spiderman who will have his own movie soon these films are well made but there are so many characters it becomes confusing keeping track of whos who and whos on which side
Jan 7 2017,positive,my favorite marvel movie it has a ton of action and has a pretty good storyline i love this movie
Jan 6 2017,negative,am i the only one who actually hated this movie it was so unecessary it didnt add anything new to the mcu because we know that by the next film all will be well again the bickering between the avengers felt stale and annoying and this just felt like an effort to make money with civil war merchandising
Jan 6 2017,positive,wasnt bad for a marvel movie
Jan 6 2017,negative,for a movie called civil war there was no civil war at all    baron zemo is such an boring character and the whole bucky  steve bromance is such an annoying thing the fact that the captain america trilogy is in fact a captain america  bucky barnes trilogy is the most dissapointing thing of all    such an overrated movie russos as directors are great but the script was a st
Jan 6 2017,positive,enjoyed it a great deal but i wasnt really sold on the emotional conclusion of the starksrogers conflict it was a pretty small blemish on an otherwise convincing plot would have liked more on spidermans ethical struggle from the comics too but i guess the timeline doesnt really match up for the needed maturity level of peter parker
Jan 4 2017,neutral,the movie has a theme of distrust especially between captain america and iron man the cameo appearance of spider man more the lab halfway through the movie made it interesting it was though unforgiving to watch it for 2 and a half hours ironman rightfully has a grudge who wouldnt after what be found out towards the end of the movie
Jan 4 2017,positive,it wasnt my favorite mcu movie but definitely it the top 5 i really liked seeing characters from different perspective it had its flaws but it worked
Jan 3 2017,positive,a great way for marvel  to kick off 2016 with one of the greatest of all time  this movie represented a great amount of action and slight comedy to enforce a fantastic superhero movie it shows a great intense familylike conflict with captain america and iron man feuding over a new registration act passed by the government with the new act various avengers are hit with an important decision that is either to join team cap and be a fugitive or join team iron man and work for the government
Jan 3 2017,positive,boyohboy is marvel on top of their game their movies just keep getting better being a canuck i never cared for the cap thought he was too goodytwoshoes and kinda bland hes still far from one of my favs but im beggining to be swayed by him anyways this movie is excellent considering all aspects i hope this cast of avengers stick together for sometime
Jan 3 2017,positive,the action and look of the film cant be faulted but this is pretty much just a film for films sake as its essentially a setup for the next film which at the time of writing hasnt even been made
Jan 3 2017,positive,a crowded film that has a lot on its plate civil war manages to deliver a thought out plot while minimalizing the clutter that comes with introducing new characters and setting up groundwork for a new wave of storylines while not quite as deep a story as winter soldier or the first iron man civil war is surely worth a watch as long as audiences ignore the subtle plot holes that come with most hero films
Jan 2 2017,positive,its always nice to see our favorite superheroes but the villain was amazing
Jan 2 2017,negative,probably a good movie but i dont like friends fighting
Jan 2 2017,positive,showing an excellent maturation of the marvel universe movies civil war is not only the very best of the captain america but the avengers themselves
Jan 2 2017,neutral,it was light fun entertainment that appeared to loose itself especially with the airport action scene with spiderman which felt like an exercise in cramming everyone into the sequence rather than delivering a memorable violent  romp  disappointing to see them working on the consequences theme because i dont feel i need a lecture on the political consequences of violent action in a light action film
Jan 1 2017,negative,waste of 2 hours terrible cgi bad fight scenes garbage plot this movie was horrendous i cannot fathom why it has such high regards by critics this movie in my opinion is the worst but overall no better then decent
Jan 1 2017,positive,good movie until they started fighting each other that part was crazy
Jan 1 2017,positive,good action and a masterclass in giving everyone something to do even if the story is a little nonsensical
Dec 31 2016,positive,granted the title is civil war but the premise did not justify the destruction of each other and the airport i understood tony wanting to attack bucky when he knew about his past but the reason behind the war was so childish too much of that in real life so it made it churn my stomach rather than making it an enjoyable movie
Dec 31 2016,positive,the russos created an tight telling conflict which a lot emotional payoff through the mcu
Dec 31 2016,negative,this movie has some great moments good acting well done set pieces and action sequences and is irredeemably stupid unfortunately for the movie to exist and its plot to move at all all characters and organizations that appear have been rendered incompetent or so foolish and petty that you cannot help but wonder how they remember to breathe within minutes of the beginning of the movie and regularly throughout are moments when everything could have been resolved had only anyone showed the slightest bit of intelligence or humility or sense  that such a bad plot was allowed to crawl out of the sewers and be approved and that a marvel release was wasted on this festering boil of foolishness is terribly unfortunate
Dec 31 2016,positive,great entertainment for the whole family
Dec 30 2016,positive,the third captain america movie cap wasnt one lf my favorite marvel superheroes but these movies could change my mind  the story doesnt follow the original narrative told in the comics but its probably why i like it better than the comic this is great action packed film  chris evans is terrific as captain america and same for robert downey jr as iron man  in this film captain america and iron man are pitted against each other because the avengers are being forced to be placed under government supervision because of all the collateral damage they are causing  captain america refuses to go along which pits him against iron man who wants to do it because it would minimize harm  the movie also introduces a series of new characters like black panther ant man and a rebooted spiderman
Dec 30 2016,positive,the usual avengers silliness  entertaining and fun
Dec 30 2016,positive,gave it a second viewingthis time didnt fall asleep and enjoyed it some really great moments peppered throughout and well choreographedshot fight scenes all around wasnt the winter soldier but still entertaining
Dec 30 2016,positive,has everything what a blockbuster should have
Dec 30 2016,negative,cgi great awful acting and script
Dec 29 2016,negative,wow this movie is awful
Dec 29 2016,positive,great popcorn flick with lots of good action scenes  however the plot gets swallowed up at times with the pace of the movie  at times i am left wondering what is really going on  like bvs not sure the reason they were fighting was that believable and i am still wondering why  not sure the setup worked and still puzzled by the winter soldiers role in everything  also the movie falls victim to one of the most common mistakesall one character has to do is speak up and explain something to avoid a major conflict but for some unbeknown reason they never do also the cgi was hit and miss in parts and some of the fast scenes seemed choppy and had a very shaky camera at times and lots of quick cuts between frames that made it difficult to take in and follow  but seeing all the heroes with a few surprises make this a fun bright action packed popcorn flick
Dec 29 2016,positive,a nice twist to the usual good guy vs bad guy superhero movie civil war delivers an interesting internal conflict  supporting characters boosts this movie despite some boring and bland main characters
Dec 29 2016,positive,outstanding political movie i have to say the correlation of the movie and what is happening across the globe is outstanding look at the election of trump and the brexit movements surging across europe captain america stands with conservatism and liberty while tony starkiron man signs on with the liberal globalistsunited nations in an effort to restrict the use of power to avoid catastrophe it turns out the globalist were all about control and ended up imprisoning many of the avengers despite the greater good iron man eventually comes around and admits chose the wrong side though i love the bold glaring message of freedom and liberty portrayed in this movie  i was biting my lips waiting for a ultra liberal left wing message in the end because thats all we get from hollywood these days especially with these a list movies  outstanding movie two thumbs up five stars bravo to the producers
Dec 28 2016,positive,this should almost be titled as an avengers movie as everyone plays a key role besides thor and bruce banner the internal struggle is a nice change of pace to the save the world mentality the marvel cinematic universe ultimately creates
Dec 27 2016,positive,my favourite movie of all time it has so much characters to concern with yet none of them feel like they were left behind it constantly makes you wonder who is right or wrong this is very well thaught out
Dec 26 2016,positive,i really think that the captain americas series is the best from marvel so far its the only one where each movie got better than the last one and i cant say the same for the other series thor iron man the avengers  this one is full of jawdropping action amazing cgi and all the characters that chose a side teamcap or teamironman had their reasons well explained  full review    rating a
Dec 26 2016,negative,a couple cool fight scenes and obviously good viz fx but i found it to be pretty unremarkable standard and not memorable otherwise not even rdj paul rudd and spidey could save this one for me
Dec 25 2016,positive,improbable but entertaining i now own the 3d version
Dec 24 2016,negative,civil war is yet another terrible mcu film even with the help of spiderman tom holland and antman paul rudd who get dragged into the whole controversy somehow however their very presence smacks of desperation   at a bloated running time of 2 hours and 26 minutes captain america civil war is dull overlong exhausting and only mildly entertaining it is an underwhelming exercise in sound and fury striclty for brains on pause
Dec 23 2016,negative,quite to be honest i liked bvs better this movie was just for the money and when marvel saw the chance to use spiderman they got happy and of course critics have to like it because its disney but i liked age of ultron more this is a script that trys to hard and only has fun with spiderman they kinda did him right but i dont think that can forgiven for not putting anyone at risk sure war machine is hurt badly but i knew he was gonna survive just tuning about itll be racist to marvel to let him die and they showed him getting hurt in the trailer which then means hes fine cmon disney id rather have fox do it
Dec 23 2016,positive,marvel knows how to make them great conflict with iron man and captain all of the marvel movies have a deeper social issue in their story interested to see where this story line goes
Dec 23 2016,negative,terrible film due to the change of iron man between films there was beginning and the end of the arc but not the actual arc itself also the villain again was undeveloped and poor i dont blame the actor as i know he is amazing in films like rush instead i blame the mcu makers themselves half of the film was unnecessary and could have  used that time to do the things that i have just mentioned
Dec 22 2016,positive,classic superhero movie but the heroes are fighting each other  its a story of a clash between duty and loyalty
Dec 22 2016,positive,so good love it was better in theaters vs at home though
Dec 22 2016,negative,lol special effects what special effects  3d renders captain america spiderman black panther doing stunts  antman scaling in size  nothing compared to doctor strange or rogue one  not even xmen apocalypse quicksilver scene was incredible kill scenes were good  too    cant believe critics nominated civil war for special effects
Dec 21 2016,positive,i love it the best marvel movie ive ever seen except my bro thinks batman vs superman is better than civil war my response is bullcrap it was way better
Dec 18 2016,positive,this was a lot of fun really makes me look forward to homecoming as spidey was definitely a highlight in the film
Dec 18 2016,neutral,have seen it but the humor was so bad it made me cringe otherwise it was a good movie but had loads of space for improvement
Dec 17 2016,neutral,25 stars seeing the heroes fight each other was cool  there should be a law that superhero films are not allowed to surpass the 2 hour mark
Dec 17 2016,positive,captain america civil wars action scenes and iconic heroes are outstanding
Dec 17 2016,positive,another of those nice idea poor execution its great that they started this discussion about the casualties involved when super heroes save the world but then of course they went on to have massive highly destructive fight scenes that while exciting felt out of place given the plot
Dec 16 2016,positive,my review the movie captain america civil war2016  1 hands down the russo brothers  2this movie showed me you can only see something new when you accept the change  3tone of the movie is serious combined with situational humour  4fight choreography oh my fking god nailed it read russo bros took help from john wick stunt team  things i likedspoilers  1the vintage visualization of different cities and time slate with text notifications on center this movie is so damn grounded to reality in a fiction scene  2tchalla king of wakanda black panther blew my mind right trough the core as usual tony stark no one can replace his attitude peter parker and tony stark convo the heat dialogues among the avengers  3 the tone really it is so new and consuming worth  4 all the avengers  do not wanna waste time to point each and every one outcoz every one has their shine out moments  5finally steve rogers  captain america he melted my heart literally  6the shield and repulsor beam slowmo scene nerd chills  things i did not like  1 spiderman in the airport scene phew cgi   2 other winter soldiers  really  3 the arc of motivation is kinda rotational     note they really did respect the laws of physics  as antman goes to become gaintman his motion scenes declines    final verdict havent expressed everything  its not the movie i wanted  but the movie i deservedyou must watch all the mcu released movies to get a best feeling i experienced while watching this piece of preciousin the soul its a cap movie
Dec 15 2016,positive,i would say see the other avengers before you see this one it brings in other characters it is a good flixster but not my favorite storyline
Dec 15 2016,positive,captain america civil war review i was telling a friend tonight that i could make this review very short  go see this movie but where would the fun be in that i have only just recently left the cinema so maybe i need to calm down a bit but i would like to claim this to be one of the best superhero movies ever made i think it sits right up there with the dark knight and replaces the gritty craziness of the joker with amazing action clever dialogue so many great characters that you care about and a huge dose of fun if you are a superhero fan and especially a marvel fan then this movie is going to make you squeal with delight repeatedly marvel usually makes great movies but i have never had so many purely gleeful moments in one of their movies as i did tonight this is the best captain america movie and probably the best iron man movie it feels like a mini avengers but with more character depth and less at stake globally the focus of civil war is centred perfectly on the struggle between the good guys and the main villain takes quite a back seat as he should i could waffle on about how good antman spiderman and the black panther were i could mention great rolling action scenes that look like they were cut straight from daredevil i could draw your attention to how marvelous the marvel cinematic universe is that it has saved certain key moments for this movie so they have the most impact but really just go see this movie
Dec 15 2016,positive,there is now longer any discussion possible a question that has persisted for many comic book fans has been resolved in a resounding fashion marvel comic books are exceedingly better suited for adaptation into movies demonstrating the proof of this is the exquisite planning and amazing execution marvel has accomplished something never before seen on this scale the creation of a cohesive imaginative universe that continue to drive an ever expanding group of superheroes and their complimentary villains the marvel cinematic universe of simply mcu the genius forming the foundation of this unprecedented critical and financial achievement was the division of the numerous movies into phases phase 1 introduced the audience to the core character through their individual origin stories with the introduction of their individual origin stories and the first tenuous interconnections managing the now greatly anticipated teaser scenes inserted into the extremely lengthy end credits brief glimpses into the future of the franchise into minutely dissected each frame and dominating the detailed discussions online and in comic conferences phase 2 introduced a broader cast of characters increasingly expansive scope extending into the galaxy with the film latest film reviewed here captain america civil war although listed as the third film in the captain america saga there is a valid argument supporting this is a direct sequel to the second official avengers film the beauty inherent with the inherent overlapping continuity and internal consistency of the mcu both viewpoints are correct it reminds me of lyrics from a buffalo springfieldsongbattle lines being drawn nobodys right if everybodys wrong    those of us that fondly remember devoting a substantial portion of our allowance to marvel we needed to keep up with a number many of the stories unfolded partitioned over some different comic books creating an amorphous cloud or characters and intense situations demanding the acquisition of all component comics this technique translated remarkably well to the cinematic format frequently prolog is used to reestablish vital relationships and lay the groundwork for the next installment if the sagathe most important connection goes all the way back to the first captain america film stevs establishing his childhood best friend was bucky barnes sebastian stan captured by hydra bucky is subjected to torture brainwashing and given the same super soldier serum that rodgers into the icon of freedom the opening scene becomes a prolog connecting the previous installment of the captain america saga back to when steve rodgers has captain america as part of the brainwashing a series of random words are used to lock a hypnotically implanted directive into his mind in modern times he is used to highjacking a cache of that very same serum    in the aftermath of defeating ultron the avengers underwent a change in its rosterthe revised lineup included steve rogers  captain america chris evans natasha romanoff  black widow scarlett johansson sam wilson  falcon anthony mackie and wanda maximoff  scarlet witch elizabeth olsen we find them in lagos determined to stop brock rumlow  crossbones frank grillo from appropriating a deadly biological weapon rumlow in the act of desperation detonates a suicide bomb in the hope of killing rodgers considering the name of his nom de guerre is in the title of the movie we knew the attempt is futile wanda tries to distance the explosion from her teammates with her psychokinesis resulting in destroying a portion of a building killing some innocent people with cameras always at hand the video of the event goes viral creating an international outrage    addressing the issue of holding enhanced people individually or in teams must be held accountable for their actions intentional and collateral 117 countries in the united nations propose the sokovia accords which would create a panel of member nations empowered with oversight of the avengers they would decide when and if they could act limiting their authority and hold the team accountable for their actions immediately the avengers are divided tony stark agrees overcome by guilt for his contribution in creating ultron rodgers is adamantly opposed trusting their ability to selfgovern rather than submitting to bureaucratic control of people illinformed to make decisions involving enemy actions from other worlds and cultures a conference in vienna is held to ratify the accords but it is interrupted by a terrorist attack apparently led by barnes which kills some the diplomats among the casualties is king tchaka john kani of the small but technologically advanced nation of wakanda this country is the only source of the metal vibranium the material of captain americas shield capable of absorbing and dispatching any force applied to it the royal prince tchalla chadwick boseman vows to kill the man responsible the royal prince is not issuing an empty threat in his grieving state of mind it soon becomes evident that the prince is possessed enhanced strength stamina and agility making him a formidable warrior garbed in a suit woven with vibranium in this guise he is the black panther as the avengers rift widens the prince sides with stark and those that agree the accord is necessary lieutenant james rhodes  war machine don cheadle vision paul bettany and the black widow stark recruits a teenage superhero from queens to join his side peter parker  spiderman tom holland on team rogers the lineup consists of scarlet witch falcon clint barton  hawkeye jeremy renner and for their new members barnes the winter solider and a guy sam knew from another movie in phase 2 scott lang  antman paul rudd    a contributing factor to the split included the mandate to reveal their secret identities the mcu is not as concerned with this factor attributed to superheroes so thankfully it was omitted to permit the story to concentrate on the crucial issue of selfdetermination and autonomy by retaining the consistency and focusing the mcu of relevant social issues the emotional motivations compelling the characters and arguably the most important factor of all the psychological ramifications of such incredible abilities and the resultant responsibilities most people have grown up watch a superhero tossing a car into the air to stop a criminal without much concern for exactly where it lands in the original avengers movie the battle of new york may have saved the world but it caused billions in damage and irreconcilable loss of innocent lives culpability is more critical the post 911 world than ever phone cameras catch every potential transgression submitting it to the court of public opinion as demonstrated here the typical political reaction it to enforce sanctions oversight committees and regulatory panels to provide the public with the illusion of security friends are suddenly pitted against each other in an allout battle to justify their point of view    in typical mcu fashion this storyline was an excellent platform to introduce new characters and further establish characters recently added the walt disney based marvel studio has finally reacquired the rights to spiderman after several tries by sony fell short of expectations here they are going with the original spiderman portraying peter parker as a high school student with a genius in material science and engineering it is only natural that stark sees a potential in this young man extending beyond a fortuitous spider bite some of the groundwork for the foundation of this story presented in the netflix based segment of the mcu featuring such localized heroes as dare devil and jessica jones those stories commented on the massive destruction resulted in an extensive need to rebuild after the battle of new york the city provided fertile ground for opportunistic villains such as  king pin one of the most critical plot points for phase 2 is responsibility culpability and accountability    releasing the film in real 3d and dtshd 71 audio offer an unbelievable sensory experience that turns the movie into an emotional roller coaster i have the tendency to judge the effectiveness of how a director utilizes the illusion of depth the challenge for a director is not how he employs the technique during the intense special effects heavy sequences but rather in his effectiveness in infusing the 3d effects as an integral part of telling the story in this film just showing characters walking in a hall or standing in a room possesses such an inclusive feeling that you become part of the story the 3d is not overtly in your face but quietly a part of the scene is conferring an added sense of reality
Dec 14 2016,positive,favorite marvel movie to date amazing action with great character development and spidey of course
Dec 13 2016,positive,great movie actually best movie ever definitely a great way to kick start phase 3 for the mcu especially for us bigtime fans i love this movie so much bravo cant wait for the next phases that the mcu will have for us love this movie
Dec 11 2016,positive,kudos to the russo brothers and the ensemble they are one of the reasons that marvel is the best
Dec 11 2016,positive,captain american civil war epitomizes everything a marvel superhero movie should be it was impossible to pick sides because both sides made absolute sense and the characters portrayed that same conflict as they fought for what they believed to be the right cause the action was nonstop the fight scenes were top notch and a touch of humor was placed in at just the right moments future marvel movies have a lot to live up to after this one
Dec 11 2016,negative,why are we fighting again
Dec 10 2016,positive,enormously great sequel that makes up the mcu
Dec 10 2016,positive,this is a pretty enjoyable movie although i am not sure why they didnt just call it avengers 3
Dec 10 2016,positive,just a good marvel movie  none of these will every be 45 stars because the bar was set so high by the first avenger movie and the early ironman movies but they are entertaining
Dec 9 2016,negative,one of the most grossly overrated movies in history    welcome to the first civil war to take place exclusively as parking lot brawl ignoring the horribly exaggerated film title captain america civil war is a poorly shot poorly written and for the most part poorly acted movie    whether its the horribly intrusive screen titles that seem geared only to people who may have forgotten their glasses the laughable cgi on stark the strange choice of the deliberately shakey camera work in the early fight scene that i shall not spoil or the awful contrived motivations civil war disappoints on almost every point    there is no part of this movie that could not have been solved by old friends sitting down and talking about it in stead a scenario where they cant even begin to meet a consensus is contrived and triggers possibly the laziest safest good vs good movie ever    the only saving grace of the whole thing is the climax fight of the film although the conceit of cap giving up the mantle is utterlly undone by the letter he leaves him anyway    poor acting poor directing a poor villain and a poorer plot make this film near unwatchable avoid at all costs
Dec 7 2016,negative,weak plot never any real sense of threat or danger ending felt like they got bored airport scene entertaining though
Dec 6 2016,positive,captain america was wrong and tony stark over reacted the best parts were antman and spiderman
Dec 4 2016,negative,totally burned out on mcu  this was an iron man movie
Dec 4 2016,positive,larry and i both thought this movie was ok dont get me wrong lots of action and specila effects but we both also did not like that super heroes fought against it other it became too much it became confusing at times and you truly did not who to root for
Dec 4 2016,positive,i thought civil war is the best captain america  avengers movie yet the combination of characters in civil war is great from classics like iron man to newer characters like black panther or spider man
Dec 4 2016,positive,my favorite mcu movie its truly exceptional
Dec 3 2016,positive,captain americacivil war is amazing movieprobably the best marvel movie imo    strong performance  airport scene  wellwritten scripture  lagos chase scene  black panther  spiderman   shaky cam in 2 action scenes  zemos plan
Dec 3 2016,positive,there is a similar sinister conspiracy like batman versus superman where its captain america versus iron man  to unleash anger and vengeance of violence from ones past to get the superheroes to kill each other i think the plot is like a nasty kid battlling  a couple of  plastic toy superheroes together along with other superheroes like antman and young spider man trying to defeat each other at some emptyoflife airport very entertaining to see more than several superheroes battle each other but they seem to be too busy fighting each other and not knowing psychologically that someone has set them up they seem to talk about the consequences of their collateral damge actions  the loss of innocent lives  but never really see that some villain would take advantage of their actions and use that to destroy each other 
Dec 2 2016,positive,very entertaining the fight scenes are interminable to the point of becoming a chore  the movie couldve easily been thirty minutes shorter but i mostly enjoyed the ride
Dec 1 2016,positive,the russo brothers have brought another exciting and fresh installment to the mcu canon civil war is intelligent entertaining exciting funny and manages to successfully direct its large ensemble cast
Nov 30 2016,positive,easily the best so far of the marvel cinematic universe and one of the top ten or five comic book movies ever made 910
Nov 30 2016,positive,one of marvels best since the avengers captain america civil war brings up funny dialogue great action scenes many heroes including one of my favorite superheroes spiderman i really recommend this film if you enjoy all marvel films like me and havent seen this one
Nov 30 2016,positive,this is by far one of the best marvel movies ive ever seen  it has an excellent blend of superheroes and a compelling story to follow
Nov 30 2016,positive,i have never been a big fan of comic book movies  they generally are a moderately pleasant way to pass the time but nothing to extraordinary   however i decided to watch this simply based on robert downey jrs reprisal of his iron man role which i think he does excellent   while i didnt find the movie as entertaining as the iron man movies i did find it to be a pretty entertaining flick   the inclusion of antman and a still learning to harness his powers spiderman made for a good sidebar   i do feel it was pretty predictable at times but id suggest if someone has a little bit of time to kill there are worse things you could do than see this movie
Nov 29 2016,negative,take that for trying to make me take sides between the avengers superheroes
Nov 29 2016,positive,civil war lives up to its hype giving audiences a first look at new characters while keeping the old ones minus thor and hulk and yet giving all charterers the perfect amount of screen time this is the longest marvel movie yet it also has a more physiological villain which is a pleasant change from marvels more brute force villains the story is incredibly well written with the best action the mcu has seen yet on the other side marvel is still unable to kill of any characters if it was like the comics they be back the next day but overall a great film
Nov 27 2016,positive,its a good movie but it takes forever to get to the action part
Nov 26 2016,positive,outstanding performances from an allstar cast elevate civil war above the narrative inconsistencies caused by its merging of two distinct storylines
Nov 26 2016,neutral,felt too long fight scenes were alright but i just cant stand captain america
Nov 26 2016,positive,its a bit too crowded and the black panther just feels stuffed in there and unnecessary
Nov 25 2016,negative,eh only a 10 minute scene is all its good for
Nov 24 2016,negative,captain america civil war was a very underwhelming movie the dialogue was horrible and the plot was often boring
Nov 24 2016,negative,i do not understand the hype this movie was boring and predictable the times of avenger type of masterpiece seem long gone
Nov 22 2016,positive,civil war is a rousing epic in the mcu drawing in deep philosophical and political themes but the results are not as groundbreaking as one would hope for this long into the marvel franchise
Nov 22 2016,positive,with many people fearing the actions of super heroes the government decides to push for the hero registration act a law that limits a heros actions this results in a division in the avengers iron man robert downey jr stands with this act claiming that their actions must be kept in check otherwise cities will continue to be destroyed but captain america chris evans feels that saving the world is daring enough and that they cannot rely on the government to protect the world this escalates into an allout war between team iron man iron man black panther chadwick boseman vision paul bettany black widow scarlett johansson war machine don cheadle and spiderman tom holland and team captain america captain america bucky barnes sebastian stan falcon anthony mackie scarlet witch elizabeth olsen hawkeye jeremy renner and ant man paul rudd while a new villain emerges    rotten tomatoes consensus reads captain america civil war begins the next wave of marvel movies with an actionpacked superhero blockbuster boasting a decidedly noncartoonish plot and the courage to explore thoughtprovoking themes justin chang of variety called it the most mature and substantive picture to have yet emerged from the marvel cinematic universe sheri linden of the hollywood reporter said call it civil war or call it brand extension call it a cinematic universe or a corporate behemoththe latest marvel extravaganza furthers the studios crosspollination of action franchises in a way thats sure to satisfy devotees robbie collin of the daily telegraph wrote this is the cinematic superhero showdown youve dreamt of since childhood precisely because thats everythingand allit wants to be catherine shoard of the guardian called it a huge aspartame rush of a film a giant irresistible snack not nutritious but very tasty richard roeper of the chicago suntimes wrote kudos to codirectors anthony and joe russo and the team of writers for juggling more than a dozen comicbook characters and nearly that many plot lines and only occasionally getting us and by us i mean me lost in the geek weeds kenneth turan of the los angeles times said if you live and breathe marvel this is one of the mcus stronger offerings if you are a spy coming in from the cold the answer is not so clear a o scott of the new york times wrote captain america civil war does not in any way transcend the conventions of the genre on the contrary it succeeds because it doesnt really try conversely stephen whitty of the new york daily news said although its called captain america civil war the latest marvel movie is actually a supersized avengers pictureoverstuffed to bursting and sometimes during its two and a half hour running time it just goes bust mick lasalle of the san francisco chronicle said as a work of thought civil war is compromised but at least there are thoughts to compromise as an action film it has its moments but aside from the big opening sequencethe action scenes are a bit flat andrew ohehir writing for salon said much of captain america civil war is just the laborious workingout of leftover dangling plot elements from captain america the winter soldier two summers ago    this behemoth of a marvel film has a big palette of superheros and this time around they are not only fighting each other but also an unknown enemy that will take down the world as we know it the sibling directors anthony and joe russo has managed to keep this truly action packed story together even if theres a lot going on and i do like the political aspect of how the world suddenly look upon superheroes and their self given right to act as a world police despite the fact that no one really has given them a carte blanche to do what ever they like and to intervene when they want similar to what we saw in batman v superman dawn of justice visually its a stunningly crafted cinematic piece and i loved how well the airport fight sequence was made for example captain america  civil war has a strong character driven narrative with great emotional weight from most of the main characters which is a great added value within this superhero universe i did enjoy watching captain america  civil war and i dont agree with all the negative reviews i have seen captain america  civil war was better than captain america the winter soldier in my point of view and a more worthy continuation of the marvel universe with captain america on the frontline for mankind
Nov 22 2016,positive,civil war gives us a very fun superhero action film where the conflict arises from the consequences and collateral damage from pervious films in the marvel universe the plot is interesting enough and the action is without a doubt fantastic the film suffers from a bland and been there done that feel i also wish the first act flowed faster and smoother its not as good as avengers or winter soldier but still has loads of entertainment value
Nov 20 2016,positive,this franchise keeps getting better and better and marvel keeps taking the super hero genre to the next level dc not so much
Nov 18 2016,positive,essentially what avengers 2 should have been and what a good debut for marvels spiderman
Nov 17 2016,positive,captain america civil war successfully makes a valid case for both sides of an argument making the exciting action sequences and vast array of cool characters simply an extra bonus to the film
Nov 16 2016,neutral,civil war tries to be the dark knight of the mcu and it fails the action sequences were boring at times and there was way to much shaky cam and jump cuts for a marvel movie the airport fight was also hideously boring and had too much shaky cam and jump cuts      owens grade c
Nov 16 2016,positive,waited months to see it being a marvel fan but it was totally worth it as usual perfect balance in between the drama and the action also quiet a bit of humour can be picked up after watching it a few times and lets not forget the special effects that are irreproachable a five star review from me
Nov 15 2016,negative,how can fools watch a stupid film like this but avoid a masterpiece like kubo and the two stings this movie is garbage only one film this year has been great and that film was kubo
Nov 14 2016,positive,great film you know how it works carnage everywhere
Nov 14 2016,positive,while not being thedark knightof marvelcaptain america civil war has an emotional story and brings new marvel charachters to the stadium in a great way
Nov 14 2016,positive,too clever too pretty too intense
Nov 13 2016,positive,directors anthony and joe russo  who would win in a fight superhero a or superhero b is an amusing bit of banter over a drink or two well this is the idea behind civil war assemble a whole menagerie of marvel superheroes from iron man to ant man chuck in some new ones  black panther and a rebooted young spiderman then split them into two teams and have at it   the excuse for this is the worlds governments have decided that the sheer collateral damage caused by previous battles is no longer acceptable  dropping a city from the air tends to cause a few casualties and deaths so from now on they must obey the diktat of an un committee half of them accept and the other half dont   then the set piece mayhem begins as they slug it out its made light by the constant banter flowing back and forth it is a slick superior action blockbuster  one for the movie collection for seeing again at some point
Nov 13 2016,positive,little dissapointong from my viewpoint but it really is great blockbuster it has some unexpected moments and mostly the end of the movie which was really worthy for a praise that thing really won me when i was thinking about the movie after seeing it one of the few that surprised me and the one from much time with that way of unexpecting so good movie
Nov 13 2016,positive,another marvel movie that held itself back by rushing to satisfy obligations to its comic book base people are tiring of these films but not because there are too many  the stories are oversaturated and  underdeveloped this problem started with spiderman iii and has scarcely let up take your time introduce the characters carefully and tell the story properly for goodness sake
Nov 13 2016,positive,too much tony snark too much new canon meant for comic nerds
Nov 13 2016,positive,not sure what the fuss was about
Nov 12 2016,positive,with a gripping story filled with interesting new story arcs captain america civil war makes it known in the first few minutes that youll be crying by the end of the film and you will be with amazing new additions like black panther  and spiderman  youll be hungry for more after this heartstringspulling film
Nov 10 2016,positive,sad but good pluse it has a good lesson you will love it but bring a tissue
Nov 10 2016,negative,an incoherent mess of a film
Nov 9 2016,negative,another weak villain too many characters only one half decent action scene at the airport terrible to watch on a second watch
Nov 9 2016,positive,the intro to black panther was insane when they show that helicopter emptying bullets on him and hes not even budging marvel has officially found an image kill the xmen and stick to avengers and the cosmic universe
Nov 9 2016,positive,civil war goes beyond the silly allfun heroesbeatthecrapoutofvillain but its still fun with all the darker themes
Nov 8 2016,negative,the action scenes are perfectly choreographed and highly entertaining however where captain american civil war falls flat is its story
Nov 8 2016,positive,great movie one of my favorite mcu movies yet all the extremely talented actors in this had great performances such as robert downey jr and chris evans the fight scenes were intense which i liked the new characters such as black panther and spider man had great debuts in the film the plot was great with a good ending there wasnt really anything bad about the film other than we couldve gotten more crossbones in the movie but he had a decent roll in it would give it a 98 best captain america film
Nov 8 2016,positive,455 ratings for captain america civil war  f 90  r 10  actionfantasy fiction movie
Nov 8 2016,negative,seriously have the ran out of ideas again and making such a crappy piece of crap
Nov 8 2016,positive,amazing and a must see so awesome
Nov 7 2016,negative,a messy story that doesnt make any sense and a too play it safe so nothing changes attitude turns what could have been a game changer mediocre superhero movie that raises more questions than it answers it does have some cool actions though
Nov 7 2016,neutral,arent people tired already of this circus
Nov 6 2016,positive,im very satisfied with the film and a lot of the character play really keeps it balanced interlocking the character arcs in this film was great lot of passion and betrayal
Nov 6 2016,positive,i have to say the best part of this film for me were the fight scenes thats probably not what the directors and writers want to hear but that choreography and camerawork was so stellar in those scenes overall its a pretty good film but i still think winter soldier stands alone at the top of this series still much better than the majority of the first captain america this story really comes down to friendships and which ones mean more the politics and principal of it is underdeveloped especially given starks motivation the added characters feel more like unnecessary cameos than integral parts of the story and the villains entire goal belongs in an avengers film not a captain america movie it comes down to rogers putting bucky before almost everything else and unreasonably what friends agree with me and i prefer thats what im landing on rather than dis it ok to lock up people with powers things dont add up and you have followers following the two main just because thats what was in the script but those action scenes captain america fights are the bourne of marvel movies easy worth the watch for anyone who has seen the other two downey jr and evans are great as well and leave everything else out their story their test of friendship and clash at the end is climactic
Nov 5 2016,positive,captain america civil war while it boasts spectacular action character development and new introduced characters it is no different from the problems shared with batman v superman in terms of its plot logic bloated screenplay with its number of heroes and its uncertain tone nevertheless captain america civil war is a satisfactory entry that means big things for the mcu but to be honest i still dont know whether this is a captain america movie or an avengers movie
Nov 4 2016,positive,it is no understatement that comic book movies nowadays are really kicking out and breaking boundaries in theaters these days since christopher reeve made you believe a man can fly tim burton has made batman relevant again before getting embarrassed by joel schumacher and rebooted by christopher nolan and sam raimi has brought to life what is possibly the most definite spiderman movie ever where the captain america movie series has succeeded is by basing its movies on successful espionage stories winter soldier was based on the book the manchurian candidate and this one owes a great debt to the odessa file after the avengers unwittingly cause an international incident us intelligence decides its time to restrict their activities but cap meanwhile tries to defend bucky who has been framed for an assassination their different opinions split the avengers in half that culminates in the top scene in the movie a clash of all the characters from the last several mcu movies excluding thor and the hulk while including black panther and spiderman making this a super sized avengers movie that thankfully doesnt get bogged down by the excessive characters however where the movie makes its fatal flaw is by not picking up from the sam raimi spiderman trilogy and instead inserting yet another rebooted spiderman with a young and hot aunt may even without tobey mcguire it should have cast a new actor to pick up where raimi left off with his version of the character bringing those movies into the mcu while ignoring the ridiculous marc webb dc universe version of the character that snafu aside captain america civil war is awesome and spectacular upping the ante on the previous marvel movies i cant wait to see where they go next
Nov 4 2016,positive,amazing characters brilliant story hilarious humour sad and the grittiness is what makes civil war better than batman v superman
Nov 4 2016,positive,great blockbuster superhero movie it does the comic book proud  great action effects and acting
Nov 3 2016,positive,great battle scenes amazing graphics and storyline and a theme that can be used in many scenarios
Nov 3 2016,positive,arguably the greatest superhero movie ever
Nov 2 2016,positive,one of the best movies the genre has to offer
Nov 1 2016,positive,the best installation in the series by far nice cameo from spidey maybe robert downey jr will give up comic book movies once and for all we can all hope
Oct 30 2016,positive,captain america civil war is big bold and brassy it manages to create the same sassy oneliner heavy writing that has become integral the marvel cinematic universe the film seems so sincere in its aspirations so determined to stand out from the superhero crowd that to see it collapse under the strain of its ambition is quite underwhelming it pits captain america and iron man against each other in a clash of ideologies and to see them fairly debate in lieu of individuality and regulation respectively is nothing short of compelling or thoughtprovoking especially since both sides have their own set of consequences honestly i was not impressed with this film simple as that
Oct 29 2016,positive,owns its cliches in all the best ways great pacing and a believable conflict that doesnt force the viewer to side on
Oct 29 2016,positive,terrible dialog for spiderman the plot was great thoughbut whoever wrote spidermans dialog tried to hard to make him sound like deadpool
Oct 28 2016,positive,a worthy adaption to my favorite marvel story this movie gets better with each viewing actionpacked and surprisingly emotional this is marvels best movie to date since the avengers
Oct 28 2016,positive,captain america civil war beautifully puts all of our favorite superheroes into one action packed masterpiece
Oct 28 2016,negative,im so sick of superhero shit and this example is objectively bad all over the place like a dropped pizza
Oct 27 2016,positive,not my thing the movie is high quality but i didnt really enjoy
Oct 27 2016,positive,top quality action movie blockbuster and managed to not conform to the standard bad guy mcu formula was it maybe just a bit too full of characters
Oct 26 2016,neutral,yet another superhero flick with a trivial plot and yes i know that all hollywood blockbusters have basically the same script but still anyway i have to admit that the fight scene where all our heroes are gathered is pretty cool and its always good to have daniel brühl around but overall its not worth all the fuss
Oct 26 2016,positive,civil war was a fun movie to watch
Oct 26 2016,positive,captain america civil war is the best film of the year
Oct 26 2016,positive,amazing a great and intrigating movie plot
Oct 25 2016,positive,captain america civil war made me like the genra so much that i now have seen the entire mcu and read comics so yeah pretty good stuff who am i kidding its just outstanding
Oct 25 2016,positive,another excellent chapter not quite as good as tws but a couple of the action sequences are right up there best spiderman yet and his aunt may what has she been taking has got it going on
Oct 25 2016,positive,beautiful and fun with phenomenal action and effects with fleshed out characters and themes with truly great sequences and costumes with one of mcus better villains  the best thing about this film manages to be its actors who captivate you into this world  rdj  daniel brühl  sebastian stan  elizabeth olsen  scarlett johannson jeremy renner  chadwick boseman and many more are all delightful 
Oct 24 2016,positive,captain america civil war has become one of my favorite marvel movies to date only second to winter soldier spiderman and black panther are amazing new additions to the mcu and i cannot wait to see their respective films the two best performances come from chris evans captain america and robert downey jr iron man both of them convey a slightly darker side of their character and they do it very well
Oct 24 2016,positive,a dream come to life
Oct 24 2016,positive,nice flickaction packedinsane fight scenesthoroughly enjoyed it
Oct 23 2016,positive,its so cool everyone gets to see it
Oct 23 2016,negative,far too long but it did hold my attention but wow is it a mess it believes it has some deep political tone but i couldnt get my head around it they decided ca is still too dull so its essentially an iron man movie and thy hit each over the head with shields but you know nobodys gonna get hurt
Oct 23 2016,positive,great movie but not sure if i liked the ending
Oct 22 2016,positive,for all intensive purposes i think that marvel is hanging on based solely on the russo brothers and james gunn
Oct 22 2016,negative,im in the minority when it comes to this movie loved by many this movie was a messy overstuffed disappointment
Oct 21 2016,positive,i  love this movie cant wait til the next one love seeing black pantherant man and all the other marvel characters
Oct 21 2016,neutral,you know whats interestingthere are similarities between this and batman v superman two films that came out within a month of each other and in fact i felt like bvs actually managed some of the motivations better i know im probably in the minority  it just seemed ridiculous that these 12 superheros who are very good friends normally would really fight each other practically to the death over whatsigning a piece of paper   with that said the actually fighting sequences were cooler than bvs
Oct 21 2016,positive,a perfect high note that far exceeds aou
Oct 21 2016,negative,where are the villains  where is the big threat  they are so weak and absent the heroes need to start sparring with each other to stay in shape and test there gadgets vision reminds too much of superman and antman is added to the pile of already too many macho superheroes in one movie this team is clearly depressed of their own movie hence the funeral look the entire movie captain americas shield survives without a scratch even the paint seems to be from another world the story is so random and dialogs so boring i had a hard time keeping attention the story is just like the other movies chaotic unclear and uninteresting i guess you only like this kind of movie if you are a big marvel superhero fan or are american 
Oct 18 2016,positive,definitive comic film that works on every level
Oct 18 2016,negative,people says an avengers movie with emotional depth and moral complexity and now i have to question what planet theyre living on seriously wtf people if this is emotional depth and moral complexity then marsellus wallace is a bitch when their operation to stop the theft of a biological weapon in lagos goes explosively wrong leaving dozens of civilian casualties and themselves under scrutiny it may be that im misremembering but were there any civilian casualties in the past didnt whole cities go up without anyone even wandering around dazed with a nosebleed but the plot needs what the plot needs so now the avengers have always blown up innocent people which leads to 100 nations gathering together and saying this must stop and you must all be brought under the control of the un while iron man is for it captain america who is more brexit quickly goes rogue and becomes a fugitive this could have then set the scene for perhaps saying something almost interesting about government control military might and divided loyalties but instead it results in all the superheroes choosing teamcap or teamironman there are no takers for teamneither which would have been the sensible option why why they fight come on captain america a rebel soldier
Oct 18 2016,positive,i am a fan of marvel movies and i like how the stories combine into one so even though this film follows on from winter soldier it also continues on from the latest avengers movie however i give this film 4 stars and  i thought there was a bit to much infighting between captain america and iron man the film was action packed and fun and i liked the addition of spider man and think the new spider man film might actually be good and black panther was an interesting character for all fans of the marvel movies this continues to evolve the characters in the latest marvel movie but also continue captain american story and add a little bit for iron mans history we have not seen before without losing the action looking forward to the next movies and to see who else appear
Oct 17 2016,positive,majestic fight scene
Oct 17 2016,positive,fantastic and way different from the normal avenger movies
Oct 17 2016,positive,my second favorite captain america movie lots of action and good story line
Oct 16 2016,positive,the right amount of depth in its plot its another great installment of the avengers saga
Oct 16 2016,negative,overly long and serious with no sense of fun
Oct 16 2016,negative,one of the most boring and nonengaging films i have ever seen   worse marvel film so far the addition of antman and spiderman to the one battle earned it the one star  so boring to watch pointless story line  really just felt like marvel are milking their  resources for box office revenue  some one else must agree this is a terrible film
Oct 16 2016,positive,nice entertainment had to laugh at ant man the story makes no sense but the action and effects are big ass
Oct 15 2016,positive,this film was really good it deserves a 39 out of 5 one of my moms friends saw it and said it sucked and boy was he wrong everything about this film was great except it recycled a lot of things from other films like the you have caused distruction cause of youre super powers you will get a boot to the  if you dont have supervision
Oct 14 2016,negative,you people must have special needs because this was just as bad as all the other unmarvelous movies i wish they would look into the timing and spacing in the editing   f
Oct 14 2016,positive,watched this with the kids other than the language and some other inconsistencies fun movie
Oct 12 2016,positive,good movie but not as good as the others
Oct 12 2016,positive,seen this movie for the 16th time now since its release back in may of this year goes down in top 5 for my favorite marvel a great installment for the cinematic universe and hopefully set a consistent level of quality for the rest of their movies coming soon in the following years
Oct 12 2016,positive,cause i liked it its one id actually watch again
Oct 12 2016,positive,captain america civil war is a stunning great start for phase 3 in the mcu lots of thrilling action amazing dialogue and an all star cast featuring almost all the actors in the mcu giving great performances
Oct 11 2016,positive,this film is more interesting with mutants and the use of the word mutants the black panther is interesting with a glimpse of storm  and spiderman is the annoying joy hes suppose to be with that said it takes 30 minutes for the film to even get interesting at all
Oct 11 2016,positive,i really liked this but it has left me confused regarding the timeline and where this fits in to the tv seriesmovies scheme of things
Oct 10 2016,negative,worst marvel movie ever such a disappointment marvel need to rethink what you do in the future too many heroes keep separate other heroes from other series like iron man shouldve stayed out from captain america messy just messy movie
Oct 10 2016,positive,a great movie with some minor flaws
Oct 10 2016,positive,the third and last movie to the captain america trilogy  which to say the least was erraticfollows present day steve tony and james while briefly flashbacking way to many times and brief plot points that are brought up with menial importance to any of the super friendscaptain america hits hard in action as the russo brothers brand this corner of marvelthis film while trying to stay blue turns red in just another love tale of steve and ol pal bucky as they bypass federal laws and shove double standard down world goverments  throats and deny justice in the name of lovecaptain america is to say the least is unpatriotically portaryed in the film civil warabove all else in a quest for a unique villain they instead implement a obviously rushed storyline for the character zemo helmet unlike its predecessor its rushed all actionhas major plot holesand doesnt stand up to comic par i think the effort was valiant but i believe they should have left this story to later time were marvel can coral more heroes and make a solid movie
Oct 10 2016,positive,really fast action movie i think the director did a great job delegating screen time between all of the important characters i look forward to seeing if marvel can keep its steam up
Oct 10 2016,positive,a truly fantastic film that will leave you craving to see more the storyline was fantastic and the twist at the end amazing
Oct 10 2016,positive,really good too many eggs though
Oct 10 2016,positive,this was like watching super smash brothers however the introduction of one specific character who already has his own enormous franchise and is personified by an entirely different actor than they used in this movie annoyed me considerably im also growing weary of every avengers movie being just another chapter in a very long story it was cool at first but its getting a bit old
Oct 9 2016,positive,honestly i thought it would be better no one died someone should have died it would have made the movie so much more emotional but marvel is too scared to even kill off their minor characters
Oct 9 2016,positive,starts a bit off i thought the casualties implication was on the nose a bit but ends quite strong whereas bvs had to starts strong and finish not quite as you would have wanted it to be     i thought caps motivation shouldnt really be focused too much on bucky but instead on the accords it kinda makes him a bit uncharacteristic i thought that they had heavy themes to play with but the fact that they just gloss over makes it somewhat anticlimactic as vision said oversight is not an idea that can be dismissed out of hand    the fights are also pretty tame and harmless id say i thought they didnt really wanna fight or as scarlet witch said they were pulling their punches so its hard to take them seriously whereas bvs looked more convincing on their fight scenes and superman did die although that would just be a stepping stone and wasnt really done right and i do have issues with it lets not talk about that you could say you would expect nobody to die and it was nobody dies    although i really liked anything involving spiderman i am a big spiderman fan after all except the cgi looks a bit too fake most of the time doesnt look as good as andrew garfields cgi spiderman and baron zemo is quite good id say its the best marvel cinematic villain to date isnt powerful but manage to split them apart more villains like these please     overall a good movie sure i thought they should focus more on certain issues rather than make this movie too much a save bucky movie that they play it too safe but hey it is a marvel movie its good but not good enough even if theyre bad theyre not batman  robin bad i would like to see future marvel movies change this perception of mine but as it is its a standard 4 out of 5 marvel movie
Oct 8 2016,positive,an epic action movie that has a really creative storyline that all adds together in the end  well done humorous action packed interesting great film
Oct 8 2016,neutral,a great deal of sound and fury but there never really seemed to be any stakes
Oct 8 2016,positive,this film is pretty entertaining and is well directed  my problem with it is that the marvel films for the most part are starting to feel familiar with a rare exception being guardians of the galaxy  my other issue is that all these films have major fights but you know the avengers characters are never going to seriously get hurt or die so theres no real tension or suspense  i did enjoy spiderman though as well as antman  lots of humour as well which is a marvel trademark and one of the things missing from the dc films  this one is definitely worth checking out for fans
Oct 8 2016,positive,amazing marvel does it again with these really hard hitting and action packed movies
Oct 8 2016,positive,absolutely amazing movieone of if not the best marvel movies
Oct 7 2016,positive,it was an okay movie missed the hulk
Oct 6 2016,positive,amazing in superhero movie of the year the best is oscar academy day  my lifie ten marvel superhero is captian amercia vs iron man   play a boxing team everything ever see avengers age of ultron movies
Oct 6 2016,positive,simply spectacular  full of drama fun and suspense
Oct 6 2016,neutral,average movie  dark never delves into what it could regarding the situations that come up during the movie  ending is just as dark if not darker than batman vs superman universally panned  to me theres not much separating these two movies  worst captain america yet
Oct 6 2016,positive,this movie delivers anything you ask for earths mightiest heroes face off in an epic throw down they introduce black panther and who could forget tom hollands amazing performance as spiderman and this movie still holds its weight considering its action packed and still keeps a wellmaintained story line
Oct 6 2016,positive,action intense brilliant
Oct 5 2016,positive,if the dc universe were to take lessons from this film they would learn how to balance the amount of characters in a movie as well as story entertaining yes  the more i see paul rudd as ant man the more i like him as ant man
Oct 5 2016,positive,marvel continues its winning streak with a film that balances a huge ensemble cast and amazing action which is very difficult to do the script is sharp and witty and the action is as always great it also shows your favorite heroes in a different light
Oct 4 2016,positive,this movie is different this is a good different perfect no but it has a lot of good qualities this movie definitely deserves the fresh rating
Oct 4 2016,positive,the heroesre divided and so the fans    before watching this i thought what the avengers are doing here i believed they got the title wrong once i watched it im still the same because it did not look like the captain americas film he never was dominated so calling it as his film totally inappropriate technically it is a third avengers film and well done i liked it it was entertaining but the civil war means its nothing a nations war within just these superguys fight for themselves against what kind of administration they want to come under    i think they have heard that peoples complaint about blowing up the buildings during reviewing other films by bringing up this one so they finger pointed those events in this narration and that is one of the reasons for the civil war to take place particularly disturbing the public and loss of many lives when these powerful men fighting the bad guys the fun part is they are off the street and had a most important confrontation of the film in a deserted airfield so does it make people who were whining about that be happy    i dont know but as an entertaining film it did everything it can give the best for the viewers like the title and posters reveal the heroes are divided here and probably youre going to take a side like usual im with the stark so if youre like me then you would feel the annoyance with the opposite team particularly like antman and obviously captain americas rebellious decision it was like the world versus united states because only americans are behind captain america anyway i did not like dividing the fans and what this film has been a serious damage i hope the fans wont take it seriously    810
Oct 4 2016,positive,my rating 8510  starts off slow lots of dialogue and the plot might be a bit too much to follow for some but the action sequences are pretty intense and build up to a satisfying climax chadwick boseman black panther and tom holland spiderman stole the scenes in which they were in but i have to give the man of the match award to paul ruddantman because hes still as fricking hilarious as ever    scriptdirection a  castacting a  productioneffects a  bonusother 10  well worth the long wait and i think it pretty much lives up to the expectations and hype it is certainly better than the avengers movieswhich makes me think that maybe just maybe thor and hulk who are both absent in this movie are the weak links storywise
Oct 3 2016,neutral,very disappointing majority of superhero movies this year where disappointing the story is boring the conflict is boring only things good about this movie is a fight scenes  awesome coreography  b black widow  i actually could see that shes struggling to fight her friends  c spiderman   black panther was boring his costume was boring scarlet witch should grieved more i mean she accidentally killed a bunch of sick people this was a waste of good actor potential this movie could have been a greatest thing this year
Oct 3 2016,positive,thoroughly entertaining
Oct 3 2016,positive,review at 
Oct 2 2016,positive,great i mean great movie it is full of action and surprises
Oct 2 2016,negative,well for starters i thought this was the weakest of the 3 big summer super hero movies and thats really depressing because this is the one that will be setting the standard for years to come with the universal love it received it felt a lot like a full on avengers movie as it probably should now that we are so deep into that universe the major issue i had was really a continuation of the last few avengers universe movies is that it really is just purely an action packed popcorn flick sure they tried to make it avenger vs avenger much like xmen always doesand is the only one to get it right and batman v superman but at its core it was still just a plot that felt like children playing with action figures represented on the screen     its become a cartoon no pain is felt no emotional they can literally spend half the movie bashing each others brains in with next to no ramifications and the one time someone does get hurt they can just easily take them into stark laboratories to patch them up good as new i felt nothing no connection no harm no risk just like playing with toys i know at the end of the day when i throw a toy across the room its just going to bounce and i can continue playing the avengers have completely lost me never the less i still will continue to watch and eat my popcorn but im not liking where they are going and sadly where they are taking everyone elses movies
Oct 1 2016,positive,liked it very good dialogue between the characters it wasnt grabbing me at first but then it got better i admit it hurts to see cap  iron man nearly killing each other but it looks like the avengers or a version of it it still kinda intact black panther shows promise and i still dont care for spiderman he keeps getting younger  younger its like the marvel version of benjamin button thank goodness no hulk looking forward to the next installment
Oct 1 2016,positive,apart from furthering the story of captain america this movie also needed to follow the comicbook storyline to keep the fans happy this means that a lot of side characters needed to be brought in and that all of these characters had to have time ti shine without taking the spotlight away from our main character i dont know how but somehow the russoo brothers made this work  iron man and captain america had a great chemistry togheter they had a totally different view on the superhero concept  but you believed where they both were coming from    all the side characters were also great in this movie chatwick boseman stole the show as black panter  he was just everything that character should be he was awesome in combat he had some very emotional moments and he actually made a lot of sense the other newcomer spiderman was funny as spiderman  i just havent seen enough of him to say that he is our best spiderman yet  black widow scarlet witch ant man falcon hawkeye and war machine were great too they all had their shining moments in this movie vision on the other hand was just in this movie for the sake of being in it he wasnt bad but he didnt add anything to the movie  the bucky storyline was also very cool and refreshing to see we could explore his character with more dept in this movie then in the second one  my main point of critecism in this movie is the villain he had a good motivation but his plan was all over the place he was in a movie that totally didnt need him tony stark could have easily been the villain figure of this movie we didnt need an evil mastermind controlling everything behind the scenes as for the other problemsi dont have that many  the pacing is great the story spectacular and lets not forget the action the airport scene might be the best action setpiece in any movie ever the final showdown between cap and iron man is also greatly shot thw beginning actionscene on the other hand is handled with a lot of shaky cam but you could still enjoy the great fighting  all in all you should definetely see this movie it is entertaining as hell
Sep 30 2016,negative,horrible please let this be the last avengers movie
Sep 30 2016,neutral,should of been ironman civil war as the story focuses more around him than captain america
Sep 30 2016,positive,this film as a critic like you but as a fan i do not like anything
Sep 29 2016,positive,not a fan of the previous 2 captain america films yet civil war does an incredible job by including a variety of characters definitely still caps movie also impressive action sequences filled with unique fighting styles and a plot much more advanced than anything weve seen in previous captain america installments providing a solid amount of surprise and interest throughout
Sep 29 2016,neutral,sincerely id not love the movie as though i would do it    is it bad no but is an appalling adaptation also the fights origins are very simples and wasnt necessary much conflict since it could easily reach a good agreement     also if is a civil war why didnt the members have more leadership spiderman hawkeye scarley witch etc didnt have much importance only black panther and black vidow     but it is quite enjoyable for every audiencia
Sep 29 2016,positive,action packed smart and filled with great performances best mcu movie so far p s spiderman is so awesome
Sep 29 2016,positive,extremely entertaining excellent moviei absolutely hated spider man
Sep 28 2016,positive,a fantastic movie by the russo brothers and could of not been done better all the characters were developed and introduced in a fast but nice matter chris evans rocked it as captain america again tom holland has to be the best spiderman yet its a must to see movie would of liked to see more of antman spiderman and zemo but very well done
Sep 28 2016,positive,it was a little cheesy with spiderman or spider boy rather  otherwise i enjoyed it
Sep 28 2016,positive,for those who like superhero movies this is a good example of them a film that abuses of the special effects and action can be a good one to watch with family and friends for sure it meets the expectation of distracting  brighten the viewer however as all the current movies of superheroes this one also does not have the best script barely finished characters those in the   movie only to be killed without even a utility and when the end of the movie comes we already know it  from the marvel franchise i do believe that this one has just small changes comparing to the comicbooks what is a really good thing  conclusion a movie that you gotta see to have some fun
Sep 28 2016,positive,even better than the winter soldier civil war is arguably the best superhero film that is not an exact carbon copy of the genre instead of a good guy vs forgettable bad guy it is a sad story of loyalty and revenge and how that affects friendship  with a very unexpected compelling villain in baron zemo you switch sides constantly  through the film on iron man or cap this is the best rdj has ever been with the best balances tones of all marvel movies  not too much humor and levity when it needs it lastly this film has the best airport action scene in film history it does not feel needed some want blood and you feel it great film
Sep 28 2016,positive,best movie of the summer along kubo
Sep 27 2016,positive,wow i enjoyed this movie a lot this is the superhero film that has been building since 2008s iron man i dont know that i would have called it a captain america film just because there are so many other characters trying to take the focus away from cap its like hes a supporting character in his own solo film this is such a huge ensemble it could have been an avengers film
Sep 27 2016,neutral,92716 35     2622 35the mcu kicks off phase three with an elevated scope and theme and while sacrificing none of the blockbuster action civil war continues the detailed character development and provides a more robust plot than many of the previous installments i also forgot just how many mcu characters were featured in this making it often feel like a mini avengers movie    im continuously surprised at how much more i am enjoying these mcu movies this second time around 7510
Sep 27 2016,positive,prob the best marvel movie they have shot besides captain america winter solider i love the depth of the acting and and action
Sep 26 2016,negative,a sad excuse to try and add tension even though you cant feel any because the characters are so obviously safe very few moments had me in suspense and it really is depressing how bad this movie is
Sep 26 2016,positive,captain america civil war is a really good movie it is the best captain america movie and this is up there as one of the best marvel movies its exiting entertaining and so much fun this is my favorite summer movie of the year the movie has some problems but lets list out the good things first of all the acting and characters are great and are the best part of the movie the story and script are so good and is the 2nd best part of the movie because of what marvel did differently with this movie because this movie isnt about fighting the bad guy its mostly about the conflict between our heroes and thats what surprised me anyway the action and special effects are fantastic the look and shots of the movie are nice the pacing and editing are very good the soundtrack in the movie is great the dialogue is phenomenal the visual effects are very good the main villain in this movie and his motivation is actually really good i loved the big fight between all the heroes but that is were a problem starts in the big fight where the heroes fight each other is great but it has a different tone but it works totally fine that was really my main issue with the movie anyway the movie has a very strong ending and i love the stan lee cameo and end credit scenes i like this movie much better than avengers 2 its just such a perfect summer movie it isnt smart but at least its entertaining and so much fun i enjoyed this movie very much and so did the audience i would say if you want a fun time then this is the movie you will love the most this summer this movie was refreshing in so many ways it was a breath of fresh air which shocked me
Sep 25 2016,positive,i see this movie as one of the avengers series not having seen any captain america spinoff movies before interestingly the protagonist lending his name to the title was actually the villain sided with a terrorist suspect who later was exposed to have also killed iron mans parents coldhandedly he was called dangerous he is wrong but thinks he is right    in the end there probably isnt anything right or wrong just what one would and wouldnt do so there is really nothing to do with morality being morale infers that one refrains from doing what is perceived to be wrong no matter what ones belief is against ones wish to stay unregulated iron mans idea is clearly to pretend he complies to being controlled by a committee captain america simply wants to be who he thinks he should be doing what he thinks is right    unfortunately i dont think justice should be in the eyes of captain americas but i sympathise with how he wishes to move forwards the ends sometimes justify the means those with the powers sometimes decide what justifies what that is unfortunately how the world functions he acted at all cost to protect a soldier who saved him but he also acknowledged he was saved simply because the same soldier was under someone elses mind controlhow bizarre    enjoy the civilinternal war of the avengers
Sep 25 2016,positive,it seemed like half a movie stopping abruptly and without half the characters
Sep 25 2016,positive,its almost perfect great directing plot visuals all of it marvel is changing the standards again
Sep 25 2016,positive,hits some misses some  overall good addition to the marvel universe
Sep 25 2016,negative,civil warmore like civil poor  has this franchise dried up   in my opinion yes wasnt entertained through its entire run time
Sep 25 2016,neutral,this movie was fairly good it had things happen in it that were marginally more interesting than nothing happening and spiderman
Sep 25 2016,positive,awesome movie  i always like watching the avengers  the whole idea behind the plot was well thought out  i also really liked that with the omission of thor  hulk they introduced new characters to the avengers in the form of spiderman  antman  highly recommended movie  i cant believe that i didnt go see this movie in the theaters or in imax
Sep 24 2016,positive,awesome movie great job on the whole twist and the action is always amazing with marvel movies
Sep 24 2016,negative,where are the villains  where is the big threat  they are so absent the heroes need to start sparring with each other vision reminds too much of superman and spiderman and antman are just thrown in and added to the pile of already too much macho superheroes this team is clearly depressed of their own movie  they look so serious its like they are on a funeral i guess you only like this kind of movie if you are a big marvel fan or are american
Sep 24 2016,positive,5 stars why   humor   amazing battles ant man did the unthinkablei am a fan of his now and spiderman super cool   great plot   excited to whats coming out next   the avengers out did themselves in this movie
Sep 24 2016,positive,the action is just amazing the story is interesting and thought provoking its not perfect but its pretty close to what a super hero movie should be
Sep 24 2016,positive,the best super hero movie of all time
Sep 24 2016,positive,the one of the best captain america movies ever
Sep 24 2016,positive,clever amazing action sequences huge cast which deftly pays off credit to the writers directors and cast and a big thank you marvel it made this old kids dreams real
Sep 24 2016,positive,i love the marvel movie franchise but this one while still a good movie felt a bit forced id love to see more focus on other characters other than ironman and captain america from here in
Sep 24 2016,positive,too clever  too pretty  too intense at times  too much of everything to merit 5 stars
Sep 23 2016,negative,these pussyass metaphors work about as well as the name pepper potts  or captain america for that matter
Sep 23 2016,negative,no plot headache inducing
Sep 23 2016,positive,another day another marvel movie this one is alright  its get by with a few cool cameos and lots of avengers a typical action movie with a few laughs but getting a bit tired now how about something original
Sep 23 2016,negative,this was the worst marvel movie i ever saw   it seemed promising with its fight scenes  but they were very cartoony and does not follow the same type of movement that the other ones did  the story line was horrible focusing on a nonimportant villian that didnt help the story arc at all  do not see this one
Sep 23 2016,positive,awesome action scenes and a pretty good story and spiderman was amazing but it still isnt better than batman v superman or suicide squad also winter soldier is still the best captain america movie
Sep 23 2016,positive,this movie is a masterpiece anyone who says otherwise is in denial
Sep 23 2016,positive,ive increasingly felt that the marvel cinematic universe has become grossly overrated sure ironman was a breath of fresh air in an otherwise deplorable set of superhero films but captain america just does not do it for me marvel seems to be faring better on netflix with daredeviljjlkif in my opinion these avengers films have become too jokey and pander to the audience
Sep 23 2016,positive,i thought the movie was good and whilst i might have liked a more wrappedup conclusion i can appreciate the way that civil war ended
Sep 23 2016,positive,can there be any more superheroes in one movie and that also fighting each other great fun delivered what you expected humour action and heroes completely worth the waste of time
Sep 23 2016,negative,we are slowly reaching the point where marvels universe is overloading itself too many superheroes to give any of them enough screen time outside of iron man and cap and forcefully distorting their characters to create conflict between the former friends not a subtle film despite a complex theme which sounded promising fights are still cool though
Sep 23 2016,positive,great action adventuregood twist fun  explosions friendship  civil war delivers every thing that we need this summer  chadwick bosemen steals the show whereas tom holland is the bright spot of the moviethe airport battle is the best superhero battle in decades it is much better than stupid fight between batman superman and stupid martha scene   the villain in this movie is helmut zemo is very much like luthor in bvs but still better the ending brawl between cap tony and bucky is very sensitive and great i give 10 out of 10  this is the movie about perfection  it is hatsoff russo brothers
Sep 22 2016,positive,i heard this was better than batman v   superman it was great in its own right but no where near as epic as bvs just my opinion as i am a lifelong superman fan
Sep 22 2016,positive,jampacked with characters and plot elements captain america civil war  maintains its balance with great characters strong action and a noticeably intense tone
Sep 22 2016,positive,best comic book movie ever
Sep 22 2016,positive,is it a great movieyes does it have awesome fighting partyesthen why didnt i gave this movie five starsbecause i think the action parts were too short when i started to enjoy those awesome action partit endedwhitch made me alittle upsetbut stillit is an awesome movie
Sep 22 2016,positive,its a story thats all wrong trying to make something out of nothing
Sep 21 2016,negative,we fell asleep while watching this that should tell you something lol
Sep 21 2016,positive,civil war doesnt seem to bring much new to the table when it comes to marvel films the story doesnt have the same emotional level as previous captain  america films tho it has its moments some of the effects are downgraded the plot is slow and rather lackluster considering the hype oddly the new faces are the most exciting part of this movie to sum it up super hero movie fatigue keeps this entry from being anything special
Sep 21 2016,positive,amazing the best movie of the year this is just so perfect everything about it the unexpected plot the cast the action scenes i loved every second of this film it was really really great and i cant wait for marvels next movie
Sep 21 2016,positive,civil war is a fantastic movie that manages to showcase our favourite characters in a most spectacular way it is even an introduction to some new avengers that we have loved from the comics the story line was very well planned and left room for the next chapter in the marvel cinematic universe it also balanced the elements of drama suspense and humor for the perfect blend
Sep 21 2016,positive,captain america civil war is a psychological thriller that will make you feel different from other marvels avengers and stand alone movies it brings a different look on how characters behave and what about they really feel and suffer it is a totally a different perspective to look on marvel cinematic universe   film got a great direction by russo brothers they do their job of storytelling right also new characters were introduced tchallablack panther chadwick boseman  and peter parkerspiderman tom holland actually in this movie there were too much superheroes but this two were a very accurate addition both of those characters are bringing a lot of refresh for the well set up universe
Sep 20 2016,positive,captain america civil war interweaves global politics personal ideals and impressively crafted action into one of the most complete superior movies in the marvel canon its deep smart and intense a genuinely strong picture that seamlessly meshes high concept storytelling with near flawlessly crafted baseline excitement its sure to leave an indelible mark on the marvel universe in the coming films serving as easily the biggest gamechanger yet in the series
Sep 20 2016,positive,best marvel movie so far i would give it 5 stars however the villains were weak
Sep 20 2016,positive,one of my favorite ones
Sep 20 2016,positive,absolutely awesome great action and humor throughout good enough to watch again definitely puts marvel back on track after the avengers 2 which wasnt all that great love ant man
Sep 20 2016,positive,one of marvels best
Sep 19 2016,positive,noncartoonish plotcourage to explore and so now weve discovered comic book heros have depth if you liked any of the marvel movies here it is everybody kicks the crap out of each otherwatch it
Sep 19 2016,negative,terribly weak marvel movie compared to the comic this is a joke in the comic it was an episode of epic proportions anyone who hasnt read it should go straight to their closest comic book store first off timing was bad in its release it came after batman vs superman which was the first of the two movies to address the question of superhero liability so as such it didnt break any new ground in the civil war movie the reason for the split within the super heroes isnt a very strong one or even evident and theyre too soft in how the two factions are opposed at the same time its badly superimposed on the actual events as they unfold in this case baron zemos deceit zemo in the movie is again a sad representation of baron zemo from the comic in the movie hes just a civilian exsokovian special forces agent who didnt have an issue with superheroes until his family became innocent bystanders the worst part is that when he explains this to them he says something to the effect of i have been planning this for so long for 1 whole year i have been studying you  just one year oh you poor poor soul of course you should be allowed vengeance on something that wasnt intentional and it just ignores the whole would you prefer your family alive but having the world run by ultron or could you consider it a needed sacrifice for the good of the humanity dilemna oh but no this guy wants it all bad guys destroyed without any fallout his character would have been better if he wasnt supposed to be zemo but just some random exhydra operative  the intro builds up to a joke of a pulledpunches fight between themselves at an airport where theyre obviously not trying to fight but actually avoiding fighting each other building up to that all dramatic moment when they suddenly realize that some may have to stay behind well except for cap and winterboy and then they fly off to siberia to neutralize each other amazing  the only one good way to finish this would have been if the other wintersoldiers had been reanimated and an epic fight unfolded with some actual form of cornelian dilemna after which both factions could have decided to part ways and each go in their for or against superhero registration camps  the only new element this movie brought was tchalla but again his presence was weak along with his reason for being on the pro registration side  there were too few superheroes a weak plot and badly orchestrated sequence of events which only served to showcase starks uber sense of egocentrism and inability to see past his codpiece  spidermans portrayal and presence was also far from good he does play a integral part in the comic which is why he had to be added to the mix here but in the comic where he initially wants out and finally joins starks side reluctantly in addition to being full grown in the movie hes still a teenager and just is part of their team without having to think of the issue at hand and as quickly as he was added he is then just as easily dismissed feeling like the director justifying putting a tick next to have spiderboy be part of big fight  done in the comic he eventually even turns against stark when he discovers just how bad things really are  so many things in this movie are dramatically weak in nature take visions participation heres a superhero with tremendous potential yet he is just a side character in the narrative of the movie mainly serving to keep wanda emprisoned on the simple basis that he wants people not to be afraid of her anymore this coming from a red faced robot who can dephase at will he does serve to almost block access to the quinjet by eyelasering the tower to fall on its hangar something ironman could just as easily have done himself but why he aims for the tower instead of just frying the quinjet there is no explanation for  the prison plays a much more important role in the comic especially as its in the negativezone an alien universe requiring portals to travel to and from not some ubersubmarine their superheroes conditions in the prison in the movie arent even that bad theyre simply put in separate cells when stark visits and realizes that theyve all been emprisoned his attitude is more one of oh i did not know this would happen oh well just suck it up you knew what you were doing youre adults deal with it ah how mind blowing  an allaround flop a la russo that makes us run screaming back to the avengers and thor movies which actually had substance and were much harder to shoot down
Sep 19 2016,negative,with a perfectly liberal toxically wholesome ending there was no satisfaction from this film with annoying superheroes antman couldnt maintain himself in his own movie and still couldnt in civil war very few people have heard of such heroes such as the vision or flint the man with the arrows and with promises of the hulk who never came to be for either side the fighting scenes felt immature and dialogue was meaningless drivel for the young teenage crowd captain america had an annoying nobility throughout the entire movie at least five times twice when he saves bucky once from the apartment then water when he doesnt sign the agreement with ironman and most annoying of all when they fight together against ironman twice at the airport and then the end where nobody dies not bucky not ironman or captain america the loose end with the mother whose son was killed by the avengers seems important shes not and at the end when the guys going to fight the winter soldiers directed by the studio ran out of a budget and simply shot them in the head terrible terrible movie
Sep 19 2016,positive,without a doubt civil war has all the requisite marvel humour and action that i expected however i wasnt entirely sold on the character motivations for declaring war on each other to me it all seemed a little forced and truly you never felt like any of them were in any real danger for the marvel movies to continue prospering i feel that they need to take a few more risks still worth seeing though
Sep 18 2016,positive,dazzling action a delicious parade of superheroes the trademark humour character conflicts and moral dilemmas they all lineup for one more spectacular superhero film from marvel its definitely not flawless especially in the plot department but its bound to please all fans of loud action paired with a weighty story arc
Sep 18 2016,positive,september 17th 18th 2016
Sep 18 2016,positive,like the franchise films leading up to it it is slickly shot and boasts big entertaining action sequences and some of the typical marvel humor but it also poses deeper questions and skews the usual goodevil genre roles elevating it above its predecessors and resulting in a beast of a superhero movie
Sep 18 2016,positive,awesome action and awesome story telling
Sep 18 2016,positive,so here we go an event movie one that promises seismic shifts in marvel studios cinematic universe but actually delivers surprisingly little in terms of holy shit moments perhaps marvel themselves play things a bit too safe with their precious characters they have merchandise to sell after all but mercifully what civil war doesnt disappoint on is entertainment value     despite the captain america title you would be better off considering civil war to be a third avengers movie and is superior to age of ultron in pretty much every aspect the film itself however is still cookie cutter fayre marvel fans by now go into the cinema or purchase a disc expecting a certain level of quality and despite a few minor blips they havent fallen below that line which is quite impressive considering how many films they juggle at the same time     the main fight scene itself for all the build up feels a touch forced the two strongest characters vision and scarlet witch seem to do very little for fear of you know hurting someone scarlet in particular comes off the worse in that i dont recall her throwing a punch merely waving her hands around and wondering why her accent keeps disappearing maybe she lost it somewhere between movies obviously hulk and thor are nowhere to be seen to set up for thor ragnarok so you have two teams of hastily cobbled together rivals for a ruck that doesnt cause seismic waves more mild hand slaps in the playground     with a bit more balls civil war could easily have been the best film marvel have produced so far its a really enjoyable ride albeit perhaps a little overly long the addition of spiderman is by far the stand out moment of the movie from the suit with the 60s style  animated eyes to his non stop awe inspired chit chat during the fight spiderman steals the few scenes that he is in and makes civil war all the better for it other new addition black panther is similarly well treated although he takes an understandably more serious tone throughout    captain america civil war may be two and a half hours of moving pieces on marvels cinematic chess board but its two and a half hours of solid entertainment fans and non fans of marvel studios will lap it up and understandably so theres no real jaw dropping moments but also none that made me question my purchase either
Sep 18 2016,positive,this one pretty much has the same problem that batman vs superman has where there are just too many characters in one movie and it makes it very hard to have the characters develop enough for the audience to care  it was good in that it was action packed but i dont really see this as a stand alone movie as it is basically an introduction to what i assume will be an action packed part two
Sep 18 2016,positive,the reason for the accords they are wanted to sign is just globalism propaganda wo this nonsense we could add another star  you killed my love one via collateral damage so its on you but u saved the worlds billions of people  and so they push globalism via the un crap
Sep 18 2016,positive,i dont think its any secret if you read my review of it or followed my twitter that i wasnt a big fan of the avengers age of ultron  yes i gave it a positive score but i ended up disliking more about the film than i ended up liking  it suffered from the fact that it was a sequel to the avengers so they had to take what came before it and turn it up to 11  that meant more action that wasnt exciting or memorable having so many story threads going on that none of them stuck adding new characters that contributed next to nothing to the overall narrative  it was really more of the same if im being honest  i may have given it a positive score but age of ultron might one of the least enjoyable entries in the marvel cinematic universe  which is why im proud to say that this film civil war is pretty much an absolute gamechanger when it comes to this film universe  the problem i realized i had with the mcu after watching this movie is the fact that yes all of these characters live and breathe in the same universe and thats really fucking cool  but the fact is that for the longest time every film in this universe has felt like some villain of the week type shit  each phase leads to an avengers film but after the avengers its like a reset button is pressed and its as if nothing ever happened  yea they reference certain events from previous films but what happened before doesnt really have any relevance in the now  which is where civil war comes in  this is the first movie in the mcu that really feels like the consequences are actually gonna be felt for a long time in this universe  because if you really think about it nothing was actually resolved  they cant hit the reset button on this one because it would be preposterous and insulting to the audience if they did so  well start at the beginning and it was about time they did this but finally we get to see the effect the avengers actions have had on the world  theyve caused collateral damage everywhere theyve gone their actions has led to the deaths of innocent people and world governments are rightfully pissed off that this band of superheroes have basically been allowed to operate with impunity for all this time  thats a big one marvel is actually putting its heroes in spots that they never would have found themselves before  theyre not necessarily weakening their heroes as much as they are believably looking at the consequences of their actions  tony stark is actually supporting the movement for the avengers to have some supervision after meeting the mother of one of the innocent people that died during the battle of sokovia  steve captain america obviously opposes this movie as he feels that the avengers need to be able to perform their actions as they see fit  not necessarily without consequence but he feels that by giving into their demands and essentially being treated as if they were firefighters who are told were to go that they may be sent someplace that doesnt actually need them as much as some other location  so the film is about tony and cap butting heads over this and how both recruit a group of their own superheroes to fight the other  winter soldier is also involved heavily in the narrative as he is framed for several terrorist attacks and iron man is trying to do the right thing by bringing him for interrogation where as captain wants to protect his friend  in spite all of that that i just mentioned one of the movies strongest points really was its simplicity  that might be weird to some particularly after what i just went over but it really is so very fucking easy to follow and you know what it actually makes sense  of course the film does go deeper than that exploring tonys past with his parents and the person who caused their deaths  but one of the many complaints i had regarding age of ultron was its overstuffed narrative  so this really was a huge breath of fresh air in regards to that  there wasnt the least bit of filler  everything in this movie had a purpose  the film also scores many points by finding a villain thats not concerned with world destruction or world domination as much as he is interested with tearing the avengers from the inside out  he wants them to destroy themselves  it works in large part because its something so simple  helmut zemo the villain lost his wife son and father during the battle of sokovia  and to me the best type of villains are those that you can see their side of things  what happened to zemos family was a load of bullshit so you can see how he would want to set things right by forcing the avengers to disband by pitting iron man and captain america against each other wanting to rip each others throats out  to me the fact that im focusing so much on the actual narrative and characters instead of the action is a major positive  i really do think that the character development in this film is some of the best in this entire universe  no joke  seriously ive got all the time in the world which one comes close to this  and i dont mean character buildingestablishing since i would give the nod to guardians of the galaxy on that one  i mean actual character development with wellestablished characters  you usually dont get this much character advancement in a franchise thats been around since 2008  and you know what theres even more room to go with this because as i mentioned at least i believe i did theres no way they can hit the reset button  nothing was really solved between iron man and captain america  theres still gonna be lingering tension between the two when they finally meet each other again  and not to mention the fact that the accords the things that regulates the avengers is still a thing  theres plenty of room to go here  which brings us to the action i mean i cant really complain one bit when it comes to the action  the battle at the airport between caps team and iron mans team is easily the highlight of the film  tony and caps fight scene at the end is also excellent  but again to me those arent even the best parts of the film  the cast is excellent as always but i do believe that both chris evans and robert downey jr put forward their best performances as captain american and iron man respectively  particularly mr downey i feel that he put his best performance in years  and i mean that in general not just covering marvels cinematic universe  part of that is the  fact that hes been playing the character for so long that it really feels like he knows the character better than anyone including marvel themselves  its also nice to see that some characters face lifechanging moments  like rhodes war machine is partially paralyzed after accidentally being shot down by vision  you dont usually get to see that in these films  usually again the reset button is hit and its as if nothing happened by the next sequel  i dont really know what else to say about this movie other than i pretty much thought this was a fantastic movie  i dont say this lightly but this might be the best mcu film ever yes even better than guardians and the first iron man and one of the best superhero movies i have ever seen  its not quite the dark knight nothing ever is but its not far off if im being honest  this is a highly recommended film for sure
Sep 18 2016,positive,was a good movie some scenes seemed rushed but overall a film action packed
Sep 17 2016,negative,meh  nothing new or interesting
Sep 17 2016,positive,this is a really good movie right mixture of comedy action and drama well done
Sep 17 2016,positive,one of the better films of the year marvel gets it i wish dc would and go with someone not named zach snyder
Sep 17 2016,negative,this movie just didnt keep my attention very disappointed
Sep 17 2016,positive,marvel already does and excellent job of casting and creating fairly original plots and this film gets to add even more wellcasted and developed superheros fighting each other it might be the best marvel film thus far
Sep 17 2016,positive,the fight with all the different characters was amazing to watch but keeping up with who was on what side i found so confusing it ended up being rather pointless i also found parts of it convoluted  got lost amazing action but found it far more overrated than i expected to
Sep 17 2016,negative,there seems to be a fashion of soandso vs someothertwat  take a longstanding money spinner like marvel comics and try to give it a new spin take a tip guys if it aint broke dont try and fix it  good film if youre 12 other than that i wouldnt recommend it
Sep 17 2016,positive,basically another avengers film which isnt a bad thing
Sep 17 2016,positive,captain americacivil war2016  starring chris evans robert downey jr scarlett johansson sebastian stan anthony mackie elizabeth olsen jeremy renner paul rudd emily vancamp don cheadle paul bettany william hurt martin freeman daniel brühl frank grillo chadwick boseman tom holland and marisa tomei  directed by joe  anthony russo  review  united we standdivided we fall  my most anticipated of the year heavily compared to batman v superman due to similar plot two big icons and my favorite is in it i only had one question before i saw the movie how is peter parker but no my question wasnt answered anywho your question to me is what do i think of the movie well i wanted this to be the best marvel movie i even thought it could be better than spiderman 2 but my friend said that would be an unfair comparison hes right but civil war i can at least say is well ill hold off on that  following the events of age of ultron the collective governments of the world pass an act designed to regulate all superhuman activity this polarizes opinion amongst the avengers causing two factions to side with iron man or captain america which causes an epic battle between former allies  like i stated i really wanted this to be the best marvel movie ever but if your going to have peter spiderman your going to need to show what makes him the relatible kid we know from the stan leesteve ditko original comic including that new series spidey from robbie thompson now the cast every actor in this movie owns their role ive always loved chris evans as an actor from fantastic four the losersthe only good thing about the movie scott pilgram vs the world and all of these mcu films i love chris evan in this role and he owned the same has been for robert downey jr and of course he is what makes iron man so fun to watch it was great to see more of emily vancamp as sharon carter and her relationship with cap don cheadle is kicking it as rhody i love elizabeth olsen i love almost all of her movies godzilla age of ultron and my favorite of hers with josh radnor liberal arts i cant wait to see what she does with maximoff and how she deals with her power and relationship with vision who is being explored in this film just a tiny bit i thought that was great sebestan stan as bucky that was a little hard to watch with him and tony and his relationship with steve was good to see more of and to explore bucky and his issues with being controlled by hydra anthony mackie oh my god when i saw him use red wing that was so cool it was just like that superhero squad show that was on cartoon network that was bird but more like the avengers earths mightest heroes that was on disney xd which was cool to see it was cool to see william hurt rprise his role as general ross i believe we can expect more of him in the future chadwick boseman as black panther i thought he was cool in earths mightest heroes but i love him in this he was such an awesome edition as it came too the two new introductory characters in the mcu jeremy renner as my favorite avenger hawkeye yeah its always so cool to see him with my future toys i hope they explore his dynamic with his family in a future film and last but not least one of my favorite actresses the ideal beauty queen who i want in universals creature from the black lagoon rebootim waiting is an amazing actress scarlett johansson as black widow what can i say she like every other actor and actress in here is perfect and i am so glad by the news of marvel committing to a black widow movie and i cant wait till that movie and until i get my hands on the trade paperback graphic novel of black widow later this year  when i was on two teams team cap because he fights for freedom and hes a boyscout which is how i am the other team i was on of course was team spidey because as some of you know the first superhero media i was introduced too was tobey maguires spiderman from 2002 i was six years old that film is what made me the fanboycritic i am today granted i mostly love the sequel with doc ock better which is my favorite superhero of all time  this movie is explosive with its amazing action sequences and i have to say that the hand to hand combat was so cool in this movie and hand to hand combat is so awesome to see in superhero movies and i havent seen a lot aside from caps movies and possibly guardians or of course ramis and webbs spiderman we usually see iron man flying around shooting stuff which of course is cool but i prefer hand to hand cause its more intense and lets us feel the gravity of the situation the hero is in now that airport scene that airport scene that airport scene oh my god that is probably the best action sequence i have ever seen in a movie they even gave me what i wanted with antman and by the way i almost forgot where all yall who on hashtag teamantman its gotta be thing you know hes awesome cant wait to see him again oh yeah paul rudd is so cool in this and now the last thing i want to talk about before i finish off my review is of course tom holland as peterspidey well ill tell what i thought he was meh your probably thinking im crazy yeah well actually iam it runs in my family you dont want to meet my sister or my dad theyre insane its just well maybe its the fanboycritic in me but the last two spiderman movies ive had a bad history of the man behind the mask be portrayed very improperly i mean spidey was fun too see in the movie but like i stated earlier in my review if their is anything i want too see in spidey its not just him making me laugh like he always does but i want to see that relatible part of him the kid whos got tons of issues and only had three things his loving aunt his intelligence and his gift not a peter parker who looked like a male model and gets the hottest girl in his school 45 to one hour in his first movieim looking at you andrew garfield you were a great spiderman but a terrible peter while maguire was great at both and as for tom he nailed spidey it was actually like the spectacular spiderman cartoon from 2008 which by the is the best spiderman media adaption of all time he had an amazing feat of strength although im not sure how much of it theyre going to show i read a fact of spidey that said he once lifted the daily bugle building he was humorous when he needed to be people tend to forget that spidey isnt always suppose to make jokes just 90 of the time but when people are in danger he knows it time to shut it and get to business but that wasnt the case in the opening sequence of the amazing spiderman 2 i mean who knows how many people got killed while he was just cracking wise at rhino but in here its different cause no ones in danger so his witty banter was used perfectly he was great to see but i havent made my mind on him yet just gotta wait and hope for the best like agent mulder i want to believe that the next few spiderman movies will be the best spiderman media in film since spiderman 2 and that tom hollands version of peter wont be amazing but spectacular  marvels latest cinematic adventure is their most exhilarating and meaningful yet with a large cast who all get their due with amazing moments and yet very serious which is why i keep saying dc should talk to feige and maybe jot down some notes and as for the comparison of this to batman v superman i gave batman v superman a four out five but compared to this its one big pile of holy cow would look at the time its antoclock im giving captain america civil war a five out of five and is now my second favorite superhero film of all time
Sep 16 2016,negative,the comics were great the comic book movies were a welcome surprise for a while theyve run their course deadpool was an unexpected surprise but please just stop with this formula its tired
Sep 16 2016,positive,captain america civil war is one hell of a movie lots of action and great characters to keep you entertained
Sep 16 2016,positive,loosely based on the popular 2006 comic book story lines civil war is a superhero movie that is very different from the rest it is not your typical good vs evil flick but instead a political debate on whether or not it is safe for superheroes to have no jurisdiction some think so others do not this causes conflict between the two sides that could permanently destroy their friendships you feel for both sides of the war and thats what makes this movie so powerful
Sep 16 2016,negative,why are they fighting eachother so lame what a waste of talent they were all there and they made them do stupid things this movie sucks
Sep 16 2016,positive,great movie with some great action
Sep 16 2016,positive,one of marvels top 5
Sep 16 2016,positive,personally i liked winter soldier better than civil wartoo many superheroes at one place a boring villainand what the hell is spider man doing there what antman did right spidy does wrongtoo much brawling toosometimes i felt like i see one of these old bud spencer moviesas bad as it may seemi liked it overall but it could have been much better
Sep 16 2016,positive,one of the best action movies ive ever seen stunning special effects that dont distract witty and funny dialog and even aunt may as a hottie omg
Sep 16 2016,positive,seemd a little slow and disjointed for the first 3040 minutes but wow once it started it was a banger that airport scene was phenomenal good depth to the characters amazing sound track and exciting set pieces solid superhero fare
Sep 16 2016,negative,decent movie 90 i dont think so thats really laughable when you consider inception managed 86 not that inception is some standard by which all movies are judged but rather a good example of how bad people are at being critical you take a great movie a five star insert any masterpiece and you compare this to it would you really say this is a 45 90100 im starting to think rt critics are bored
Sep 15 2016,negative,biggest disappointment ever complete trash from the fights to some points of cgi spider man trash to the very story itself to tell the truth i had zero interest in this marvel movie since the first trailer the only reason i even thought about seeing this movie was for black panther but he ended up being just ok now the story cold basically be modeled off batman v superman now people can make arguments against this but looking at the movie posters with batman and superman looking at each other then the one with iron man and captain looking at each other theyre basically the same poster but that has nothing to do with the movie just a small thing i noticed but the plot of civil war can basically be looked at as the same thing civil war starting out with a tragic event and the government expressing concern skipping a head sides break down because of a third party similar to batman v superman then after they have a trash battle in a airport how great ok so just over all this was a terrible movie that doesnt deserve half the good reviews it gets doesnt even deserve the half star i gave it or the ten dollars i wasted to see three hours of garbage
Sep 15 2016,positive,9010  awesome movie fantastic actions scenes with a great plot behind it i really dug the theme of hero or vigilante which can be very played out but wasnt in this flick
Sep 15 2016,positive,not a typical baddy vs goody well thought out good plot and humour excellent
Sep 15 2016,positive,we had a blast watching this we thought it was pretty cool to see the other marvel characters come together yay captain america
Sep 15 2016,positive,youre going to get exactly what you came to see  but nothing more
Sep 15 2016,neutral,i fidgeted in my seat like i hadnt since xmen 3 everything leading to the airport scene is tedious and stuff weve seen marvel do before and everything goes downhill afterwards with a refreshingly simplistic villain who has a mindnumbingly convoluted plan civil war cant help but feel like a lateral new version of a product as opposed to somebodys labour of love
Sep 14 2016,positive,a superior entry in the superhero genre  it brings most of the classic characters from the avengers ensemble  there is plenty of action but the biggest suprise in the depth that is given to the story
Sep 14 2016,positive,love it cant wait to see the next one
Sep 14 2016,negative,super heroes are like static plastic action figures they dont die they dont change and they can only damage the stage starting to get really tired of these movies
Sep 14 2016,positive,awesome movie but the cgi is quite a letdown
Sep 14 2016,positive,i dont know what else to say about this other than its everything i ever wanted out of a comic book movie all those days growing up reading these guys stories and just imagining what they could be i finally got it this movie is joy they kind of gloss over the whole civil war arc not really doing it justice but it doesnt matter because what they deliver is soo damn entertaining 
Sep 14 2016,positive,been a long time since the last one so i was kinda lost during parts of the movie i recommend re watching the winter soldier before this to refresh  your memory however i would compare this to batman vs superman in the sense that it wasnt as good as most marvel movies
Sep 14 2016,positive,he russos have achieved an uncommon balance of plot and action humor and drama all of it once again deeply grounded in character
Sep 14 2016,positive,lots of action and a great storygreat cast and directing also great effects
Sep 14 2016,positive,definitely one of the best superhero movies and  marvel  movies to date its fun  has a ton of characters but doesnt get too cluttered  has a sympathetic and  realistic villain which is saying a lot for a marvel movie
Sep 14 2016,negative,this movie had many major plot holes like the ross scene at the beginning and the whole zemo plan it has great action but no great story
Sep 14 2016,positive,fantastic movie great emotions and action
Sep 13 2016,positive,another great marvel installment
Sep 13 2016,positive,a great superhero v superhero movie way better than batman v superman
Sep 13 2016,positive,entertaining as always yet a little wierd that its a captain america title and not a avengers when still all of them are acounted for oh well i liked this one to
Sep 13 2016,positive,review   i must admit i wasnt that impressed with the first half of this film but when the action kicks in it is truly superb watching most of the marvel heroes in one epic battle was a spectacular moment in cinema but im sure that it would have been completely different if thor and the hulk was involved i did find buckywinter soldier sebastian stan a bit dull mainly because he was the cause of all the trouble and he didnt seem to speak or interact with anyone but maybe thats because everyone wanted to kill him tony stark robert downey jr also wasnt his usual charismatic self which was a shame because the movie could have done with a bit of humour they finally put the falcon anthony mackie to good use and some of his gadgets were quite impressive and it was good to see the antman paul rudd and spiderman tom holland play a big part in the epic battle im not quite sure what the black widows hero abilities are but she always seems to be in the middle of everything and i think she is the only superhero to make an appearance in all of the marvel movies wanda elizabeth olsen seems to have the most unique super hero abilities out of all of the avengers to date but with a huge lineup in comic book hero movies planned in the future i really cant imagine what direction these marvel movies are going to go in but its very exciting this movie did seem more like an avengers movie than a captain america movie but as the focus was more on the winter soldier i can understand why they put it under the captain america umbrella anyway i thoroughly enjoyed the action scenes and the director gave each individual superhero some depth and well earned screen time i cant wait for the next marvel movie great    roundup   i was surprised to see black widow come out without a scratch on her body and a hair out of place after the big explosion which killed black panthers father and with all that commotion happening with the avengers were was nick fury anyway this movie was directed by anthony  joe russo who brought you welcome to collinwood with george clooney you me and dupree and captain america the winter soldier i find it weird that these unknown directors who havent made anything that impressive are chosen to make these humongous comic book hero movies with such a huge task at hand and a massive budget to control i would have thought that the studios would have picked directors who have a lot of experience in this field especially with so many different characters to bring to the big screen in terms of the marvel movies these new directors are obviously out to prove that they have the ability to do something amazing which is why i have been impressed with the outcome of the franchise so far the russo brothers are rumoured to be directing the avengers infinity war which is due to be released in 2018 so they certainly have there hands full especially with the introduction of new super heroes in this movie i do think that they done a great job with this film even though the first half was a bit glum but the epic battle scenes were worth waiting for     budget 250million  worldwide gross 11billion wow    i recommend this movie to people who are into their actionadventurescifi movies starring chris evans robert downey jr scarlett johansson sebastian stan anthony mackie don cheadle jeremy renner chadwick boseman paul bettany elizabeth olsen paul rudd william hurt tom holland and daniel bruhl 810
Sep 13 2016,positive,its an entretaing film with full of action most its last hour that makes us wonder what is going to happen with the avengers for infinity war but certanly its not the wonder that everybody says or the perfection made into a superhero movie true is the fact that this is not a captain america story neither a civil war definetily not the great comic book made into a film its an avengers story that tell us a personal interest conflict so its a good movie but it could be a way better
Sep 12 2016,negative,its okay i guess as long as youve seen every other marvel movie for context you enjoy lame attempts at humor and dont care about little things like an ending
Sep 12 2016,positive,captain america civil war so far is the best movie in the mcu one of the best parts of this movie is that it feels very grounded there are also three new characters in this movie one of them is spiderman and i thought tom holland did a great job playing as spiderman he is actually a teenager in the movie if spiderman homecoming is a hit then i think he will be the best portrayal of spiderman black panther was a great addition he was really cool in the action and when he is out of the suit is equally as interesting then there is baron zemo who is the villain of the film he isnt exactly one of those villains who uses physicality to tear them apart but to turn them against each other which i really liked i thought civil war was a perfect superhero movie and is the best mcu movie
Sep 12 2016,negative,this movie was for kids  they should remake an adult version this was terrible
Sep 12 2016,positive,simply put i enjoyed civil war more than i did age of ultron or captain america the winter soldier this movie hit all the right notes and included an action scene that could possibly be the best superhero fight ever put to screen a deep story unique villain and perfect pacing make this a mustsee for any marvel fan or moviegoer but dont expect to get whats going on if you havent seen the other movies in the marvel cinematic universe things like the sokovia accords and general ross appearance wont have much significance if you havent     everybody did a solid job and spiderman had a standout performance in his debut in the mcu
Sep 12 2016,positive,this is one of the best superhero movies ive ever seen teamcaptainamerica
Sep 12 2016,positive,best movie in the mcu since the avengers the russo brothers have shown that they can take a complex story with multiple characters and make sure everyone known their backgrounds and the story behind each one while still incorporating some great humor and unforgettable action sequences my first perfect 100 a of 2016 well done russo brothers well done
Sep 12 2016,negative,good start then everything was lazzy and the villian could do more for us its  really boring if you watch for second time
Sep 12 2016,positive,one of my favorite films of the year
Sep 12 2016,positive,oh i loved it  still great action and funny comedy
Sep 12 2016,positive,captain america civil war begins with strong international pressure to install a system of accountability for our heroes this leads to the avengers being fractured into two opposing teams  i really enjoyed this excellent nonstop action film saw this in gold class 4th viewing  910 rev 354
Sep 11 2016,positive,marvel knows how to have fun with superhero movie
Sep 11 2016,positive,yells from back row team iron man tony stark deserved better
Sep 11 2016,positive,im not avengers fan but this movie is quite awesome i like the idea they scale out the avengers universe the story happened all around the world
Sep 11 2016,positive,when you rdjr in a movie you know he is going to steal the show and on top they put spiderman in the same really
Sep 10 2016,negative,captain america civil war is an amazing movie it had plenty of jokes action and drama plus they all mix well together keep on doing it marvel
Sep 10 2016,positive,i really wanted to like this more after all  it has lovely action sequences beefy muscles and some substance still the plot is flimsy and recycled the gassy nature of the film is too prevalent and the barrage of heroes is just too much its a mishandled shame that feels too afraid to seek new territory
Sep 10 2016,positive,even with a crowded cast the russo bros still was able to make a compelling story with great action depth and great characters with good motivations that makes a great actionfilled movie one of the best of the mcu
Sep 9 2016,positive,it was great i hope infinity war would be better 
Sep 9 2016,positive,a movie meant to be a modern epic it accomplishes a lot when the fighting feels personal and much less when it aims to big for its own good
Sep 9 2016,positive,fun exciting with great personal and political themes which boasts fantastic action driven by its great story this 147 minute 250 million dollar picture is another big success which keeps you wanting more
Sep 9 2016,positive,finishing the movie will be hard when you come to the end of the russo brothers cataclysmic marvel cinematic magic many were worried that this was just a dulled down avengers redo but do not fear it is undoubtedly a captain america blockbuster that also serves as an unaccredited iron man 4 downey jr and evens continue to shine though there are moments of corny humour for the sake of humour and some underdeveloped plot threads the russo brothers have somehow weaved a role for the cast that continues to expand exponentially bosman and hollard bring a fresh and welcome element to the film which is only made more enjoyable with rudd reprising his role as antman a movie which involves some thinking and dedicated attention those that have followed the marvel cinematic universe will not be disappointed
Sep 9 2016,positive,entertainment at its best this franchise is keep on getting better and better
Sep 9 2016,positive,plot very good though some problematic character development  acting very good  sfx excellent  soundtrack very good
Sep 8 2016,positive,just not what i expected i was a little boring for my taste
Sep 8 2016,positive,my only concern is if they did it like the comic books i would be more impressed but thats not going to stop me from watching my favorite childhood heroes on screen
Sep 7 2016,positive,love it its awesome lets go iron mans team
Sep 7 2016,positive,this is now my favorite mcu film im a huge fan of the comic storyline and i was happy to see them adapt it in a way that kept the essence of the story i was happy to see them keep to not glossing over everything there is real conflict i love this film
Sep 7 2016,positive,best one yet loved it
Sep 7 2016,positive,a absolute platinum piece added to the ever growing marvel cinematic universe civil war sees the avengers divided over a new policy regarding their power this felt more like an avengers film than a captain america film as many characters have equal amount of screen time marvel studios are forever expanding and enhancing the cinematic universe and this film was no exception we see spiderman and black panther as the new additions whom add a little spice to the story and bring something different stunning fight scenes and witty dialogue made the action scenes an absolute pleasure to watch civil war is a peach of a film and a worthy addition to the film saga this film didnt feel like 2 and a half hours long and couldve easily been 3 hours to expand more characters
Sep 7 2016,positive,lives up to the hype a great supporting cast inturducing 2 new heroes that work really well great directing and a great amount of humor to yet somehow darker than most the other films
Sep 7 2016,positive,first ever movie i saw in 3d in cinema d  it was in mumbai
Sep 7 2016,positive,thoughtful and emotionally resonant captain america feels more like a character pi9ece than a conventional superhero spectacle of course action is lacking here but the real punch is the emotional one
Sep 6 2016,positive,its fun well acted and decently made but it saddens me that this weightless film has everyone over the moon
Sep 6 2016,positive,the best second movie of marvel good job
Sep 6 2016,positive,captain america vs iron man now that alone would be worth the price of a pay per view fight however now comes the avengers draft because sides are being chosen and everyone is about to lose throw in a sweet appearance from spiderman and what more could you want it could have used more of a behind the scenes figure manipulating things someone you dont see until the end of the movie but it was still a very good movie acting 5 cgi 4 story 4 plot 4 character development 5 leave your comments at ratemymoviereviewsgmailcom
Sep 6 2016,positive,awesome movie and lost of actions
Sep 6 2016,positive,the movie was good but was slightly lacking in story most of these movies have messed up when trying to pack the comics into a couple hours of filming
Sep 6 2016,neutral,lots of fights and silly action all because of something to do with rules and not obeying them or something pretty boring plot and it dragged at least young spiderman was in it for some comic relief
Sep 6 2016,positive,while both beautiful and impressive not every fight seen escaped without the im bored feeling
Sep 5 2016,positive,the biggest pay off for the marvel cinematic universe yet the drama is just as intriguing as the action
Sep 5 2016,positive,oh yeah this is a very fun and overall good marvel movie my second favorite in fact
Sep 5 2016,positive,civil war succeeds where many other marvel films have failed in its inclusion of an ensemble cast all the while tackling interesting concepts and concluding in a refreshing yet unexpected climax
Sep 5 2016,positive,if you tinker with your phone between the fighting its watchable the story is flimsy as ever
Sep 5 2016,positive,awesome great action epic fun not quite on the same level as the other avengers flicks mostly because it lacks a strong adversary to conquer
Sep 5 2016,negative,tío  step down from wanted soldier marvel does not know to make serious movies and in this one we can confirm that  could not care less for the emotional conflict too forced the best part was spiderman the only thing in the movie that was not taken so serious
Sep 5 2016,positive,its very wellpaced and actionpacked but never loses sight to itss chaaracters and fleshes out both cap and iron man    55 definitely one of the most wellbalanced and enjoyable movies of the year
Sep 4 2016,positive,super heroes good guys vs bad guys the lines blur
Sep 4 2016,positive,9416 35 out of 4 rewatch upgraded rating to 5 stars 22920
Sep 4 2016,negative,civil bore zzzzzzzzz boreing garbage just like aou and im3worst ost i ever heard
Sep 4 2016,positive,if there was six stars instead of five this movie earned ten
Sep 4 2016,positive,good diversion of the superhero movie theme although a little unusual
Sep 4 2016,negative,these are all getting very similar im feeling a little fatigued
Sep 3 2016,positive,the action is incredible and the emotions are everywhere its fun and serious when it wants to be
Sep 3 2016,positive,very good just could have done without the cursing
Sep 3 2016,positive,fairly awesome and epic maybe the best marvel movie to date
Sep 3 2016,positive,this is my favourite marvel movie the plot was amazing and had me sitting on the edge of my seat at every moment the script was witty and smart and the effects where tremendous the whole film really shocked me i expected it to be good but not that good
Sep 3 2016,positive,bold enough to break the monotony of super hero movies with a story that is interesting and not to convince you to like it the way it always was
Sep 3 2016,negative,its a regular film nothing to do with the civil war really such action is not seen were more laughs than anything else it is an offense for which he has read the comic   elizabeth olsen and scarlett johansson uff wow they are the most wonderful thing about this film 3 3 3 3
Sep 2 2016,positive,one of the best marvel movies so far
Sep 2 2016,positive,i dont care he killed my mother at its best its less about thrilling action sequences and more about the futility of revenge but when there must be action at least its usually fun
Sep 2 2016,positive,this movie was entertaining but wasnt as great as everyone else are saying its just my opinion 355
Sep 1 2016,positive,one of best marvel movies d
Sep 1 2016,negative,it is not my cup of tea but it is so cringy with forced jokes and forced story points and characters
Aug 31 2016,positive,unlike age of ultron and despite the number of characters aside from perenniallyuseless hawkeye this is a blockbuster with a lot going on and yet never feels like too much the characters are fantastic and despite the name it is actually tony stark and natasha romonoff who take the most room to grow its also a more fitting debut for the highlyenhanced elizabeth olsen as the scarlet witch i never fully bought into the idea of bringing in bucky the winter soldier barnes as captain americas archnemesis but its nicely wrapped up here and aside from a few plot and pacing problems this is one of the  best films in the marvel cinematic universe 97510
Aug 31 2016,positive,it has the fanboyisms of the avengers and the thought provoking story from the winter soldier which equals captain america civil war delivering one of the best superhero movies of all time
Aug 31 2016,positive,enjoyable but the poor plot was made up for in the action it was a shame that the hand to hand combat scenes were shaky it undermined their genius making them hard to follow and not as easy to appreciate also too many characters for them to keep track of
Aug 31 2016,positive,three way tie between this movie captain america winter soldier and the first avengers for best marvel movie thus far that is of course if you dont count guardians of the galaxy within the avengers universe since they havent officially played in that playground yet if we do then its a four way tie
Aug 31 2016,positive,probably the best out of the captain america series funny lines and good action sequences
Aug 31 2016,neutral,action action  more action  but i dont really get it why are we fighting each other also i found spidermans involvement awkward
Aug 30 2016,positive,the 2nd best superhero movie evernext to the dark knightthis movie was turning moment for the whole mcualso the introduction of spider man and black panther  was very well writtenthey were there for a whilethis time the movie moves from the lighter tone of the previous movie and follows the dark tone its previous predecessor which is a nice touchthe russo brothers have truly nailed iti am riding the hype train for avengers infinity wari really hope it surpasses this masterpiece
Aug 30 2016,positive,very fun film action sequences were bananas
Aug 30 2016,positive,good movie but might be a litte bit overrated
Aug 30 2016,positive,great movie marvel is just on a roll right now looking forward to the infinity wars
Aug 30 2016,positive,cool movie full of action and nice story line too thumbs up
Aug 30 2016,positive,the captain america movies prove that they are still among the best in the mcu and this entry might just be the best in the franchise
Aug 30 2016,positive,9510    best comicbook movie of the year
Aug 30 2016,negative,the avengers without thor  hulk with spiderman thats about it oh the vision wears a sweater
Aug 30 2016,positive,great moviewith actioncomedyand superheroes
Aug 30 2016,positive,it is funtastic it is a solid mcu film all the way i mean the way i expected it   all of it is great again russo brothers deliver it good i mean very well the script the characterization and the solid action scenes the action scenes really shines in this film im not really a shaky cam fan in terms of adding it on those action sequences but it was very well made i enjoyed every bits of the fighting scenes especially the airport scene is a classic one they put humor to it its like the cartoon action scenes that we saw in the early days comes to life i love it to bits seriously spiderman antman hawk one on one with black widow cap and iron man being bad asses i mean its just perfect to me russo brothers and the rest of the mcu team knows what its all about another thing that i want to mention is the tony stark moments i love when he has this serious tone and start talking to anyone else i mean they mean business here its just another great entry and a lovable one offered by the mcu and it never ever disappoints me hell yeah there are some flaws and fillers but it didnt even bother me in fact the first half to me is so mysterious that you wanna know whats going on next whos to blame and whos not and this might be the most dramatic entry of any other mcus ive ever seen the feels man its there especially the last parts of the movie i need more after that i cringe when it ended so fast freaking fast a must have bluray a must watch for every comic book fans seriously now
Aug 30 2016,negative,film was too simple and too easy to guess most characters were not portrayed well action scenes were not taken very serious as it is filled with humor
Aug 29 2016,positive,the colossal cast of captain americas civil war shines as they come through in one of marvels biggest films filled with fascinating compelling action decent comedy and overall is a pleasure to watch
Aug 29 2016,positive,emotional gritty and funny without overdoing yep this is one of marvels finest definitely go see it
Aug 28 2016,positive,its one of the best of the mcu entrees but it isnt without its flaws all in all its a well made superhero action movie even if it feels more like avengers 25 than captain america 3
Aug 28 2016,positive,captain america civil war is perhaps the best movie in the marvel cinematic universe so far  the whole cast does a terrific job as always but this time the feelings are amplified as the audience is forced to choose a side in this war  the action scenes of this thoughtful blockbuster are beautifully shot and the soundtrack helps it rise among the top movies of this saga
Aug 28 2016,positive,way overrated  if youve been to other marvel superhero movies then youve seen this movie before and probably about 10 times by now
Aug 28 2016,positive,fantastic movie from start to finish black panther commands the screen whenever he is present and every character fits smoothly into the narrative i may not have liked certain characters actions im looking at you cap but they made sense within the universe that marvel has created
Aug 28 2016,positive,fight scenes 3  characters 3
Aug 27 2016,positive,its ok should have been directed by joss wheaton
Aug 27 2016,positive,really good movie my favorite superhero movie ever
Aug 27 2016,positive,keep making marvel movies i love you iron man its a great family movie ilovemarvel
Aug 27 2016,positive,jizzeverywhere
Aug 27 2016,positive,great action great actors love this movie i would go and see it four hundred times
Aug 27 2016,negative,not very satisying  a reload of all the themes in previous movies  nothing here that i hadnt seen before and most of the characters were horribly misrepresented in their power level    if your a marvel fan and read all the comics this is a disappointment
Aug 27 2016,positive,fun to see all the characters duke it out not fun to watch the boring story unfold
Aug 27 2016,negative,contrived unconvincing division and same old action scenes
Aug 27 2016,negative,so tony creates the enemy in the second movie than hes the hero in the third 1010
Aug 26 2016,positive,a great follow up to winter soldier
Aug 26 2016,positive,civil war will please so many as its definitely one of the best superhero movies marvel could offer
Aug 25 2016,negative,if the goal of this movie was to make iron man look like a total wuss and captain america like a total ahole  mission accomplished i was cheering for their contracts to be over with disney by the time the movie was over no one came out looking good at the end of this one with the possible exception of spidey
Aug 25 2016,positive,awesome movie loved the airport fight scene with ant man and spiderman they stole that scene
Aug 25 2016,positive,one of the most daring mcu films and easily the best summer movie of 2016
Aug 25 2016,positive,when fantasies become reality that civil war is absolutely awesome the fight scene in that european airport is incredible fabulous
Aug 24 2016,positive,this movie takes the stand of being my newest favorite movie of all time
Aug 24 2016,positive,the captain america series in my opinion are the perfect examples of a film series that improves over time this new installment conquers new territory by installing a thoughtprovoking message but balances with enough action humor and charm to still make it a very entertaining superhero flick
Aug 24 2016,negative,fucked up movie sucks as fuck
Aug 24 2016,positive,decent film as good as any other captain america film but with too many characters
Aug 23 2016,positive,certainly the best instalment to come out of the marvel franchise
Aug 23 2016,positive,another great movie for the marvel line
Aug 23 2016,positive,it was a lot better then i thought id probably buy this on itunes on discount
Aug 23 2016,positive,marvel strikes again   love the fight scene at the airport
Aug 23 2016,positive,riveting moments wall of our favorite superheroes resulting in quite the colossal showdown the russo bros keep all of the rowdiness in check by cutting deep into the difficult sacrifices made by a busted  bruised avenger family an entertaining actionpacked blockbuster done right
Aug 23 2016,positive,characters were great story good nice effects way better than the previous one age of ultron definitely worth watching
Aug 22 2016,negative,marvel bias is real the chase scene was excellent but rest of the movie was utter crap
Aug 22 2016,positive,the pinnacle of superhero films so far marvels casting pays off again action is intense but still fun and comic book inspired and the airport fight is so amazing its almost exhausting
Aug 21 2016,positive,a very fun and incredibly enjoyable movie that was well directed well edited well acted and overall was done very well
Aug 21 2016,positive,civil war is pretty much what you expect marvel has seem to have given up taking risks with their stories but other than that civil war is a well paced action adventure film with fine performances and solid action not the best i have seen
Aug 21 2016,positive,fun to watch with a great script too boot
Aug 21 2016,neutral,i feel like this whole movie was just an excuse to make that faceoff scene on the airport tarmac with a bunch of iconic characters beating on each other further proving additional brain development doesnt come with those extraordinary superpowers the basic premise of this was a bunch of comic book superheroes have a disagreement and get damn angry at each other queue mayhem  fighting ie the film its overstuffed with everything youd want from a marvel movie  i enjoyed it more than previous editions so i guess for that its done something right but people who admire these films are getting their own place in hell trust me i know
Aug 21 2016,positive,im gonna be in the minority here but it was just ok the airport fight scene was amazing antman was great for the little bit he was in the movie but it was just another marvel movie with the same feel these movies have had since iron man 1
Aug 21 2016,positive,awesome thats all you can say
Aug 20 2016,positive,phenomenal marvel did it again
Aug 20 2016,negative,this movie wasnt that great i really enjoy black panther bin this movie but thats about it the title of this movie should have been avengers 25 winter soldier was a far better movie
Aug 20 2016,positive,this movie gives me the excitement about comic books that i had as a kid again the stories are great and progressively becoming more unpredictable and i love it all i can say is that this movie is super awesome
Aug 20 2016,positive,captain america civil war has been described as the perfect superhero movie and i can safely say that those theories are correct the captain america trilogy have been the only marvel series to improve upon the last movie this film takes time to introduce each charcter in a way that we feel connected to them as people black panther and spiderman are 2 welcome editions and it advances upon the relationship between bucky and steve all in all this film was great and will be a surefire classic for future generations
Aug 20 2016,positive,im a marvel fan to the end this was full of action and all the new characters cant wait for the next one black panther âââ
Aug 19 2016,positive,one of the most ambitious and creatively successful blockbusters of this decade the fights run long on the second viewing and parts of the film are rather fragile upon close inspection but it all holds together long enough and well enough to see you out of your seat both satisfied and hungry for more
Aug 19 2016,negative,what a waste  typical
Aug 19 2016,positive,this movie was a perfect balance between action packed and mysterious about background between the characters
Aug 19 2016,positive,best superhero movie ever
Aug 19 2016,positive,spiderman and black panther completely stole the movie by far and the plot is amazing like any other marvel movie andits better then dc i had to admit itrobert and chris really acted great for this movie and some are complaining about tom playing as spiderman but trust me he captures the power and nerdy parts of parter parkerspiderman better then andrew garfield
Aug 19 2016,positive,great way to end the trilogy
Aug 19 2016,positive,everything you would imagine and more
Aug 19 2016,positive,good movie but the storyline is a downer
Aug 18 2016,negative,i fell asleep midway through way overrated not as good as guardians antman or even suicide squad
Aug 18 2016,positive,we need more characters for our predictable script
Aug 18 2016,positive,another good marvel film but nothing special i dont know why everyone is so blown away by it it feels the same as previous marvel films and the conflict is not really believable  i dont get how scarlet witch couldnt just decimate everyone so many stupid decisions by both sides many of the characters actions were just unrealistic but noooo logical actions are not allowed or else the movie would end too early like why did bucky not just plug his damn ears they made a show out of him breaking free of his arm restraints but then he pounds on the glass rather than plug his ears and why on earth did vision knock down a tower to stop cap instead of just going directly for him i thought he was on the team that thought the avengers should be kept in check but he decides to destroy half an airport for no reason oh well still a fun movie at least
Aug 18 2016,positive,the best the mcu has to offer so far and thats saying something stacked against movies like the avengers and winter soldier having very little in terms in flaws the movie moves along fast but the story keeps up to the pace but also finds time for the humor that has helped build the mcu it also introduces tom holland as spiderman who may be better than tobey maguire in the role given time
Aug 18 2016,positive,this movie is pure fun had the time of my life great plot acting action etc i extremely recommend especially if you like superheroes or marvel so 910   
Aug 18 2016,positive,i liked the film but i had higher expectationsi dont really like the talking bits because they are boring in my opinion but the airport fight scene was awsome
Aug 17 2016,positive,everything youd expect from a marvel movie and more tom hollands casting as spiderman was well met we got the earnest and smartmouthed peter parker we all know and loveand a respectable introduction instead of a premature uncle ben origin story
Aug 17 2016,positive,excellent story line and introduction of new characters
Aug 17 2016,positive,it is certainly enjoyable with engaging themes and a storyline that is solid however it suffers from having toomany characters and should classify itself as an avengers movie realistically it boasts one of the mcus alltime worst villains but makes things a little more bearable with the presence of tom holland who debuts as spiderman there are great action sequences for sure but it simply feels like the other avengers movies and less like a film that stands on its own
Aug 17 2016,positive,this movie doesnt take itself too seriously yet still maintains an intriguing plot and strong characters
Aug 17 2016,positive,this is the coolest movie ever
Aug 17 2016,positive,the films of the avengers series vary in quality  and thats mostly based on the story not the acting or action civil war is a super compelling story
Aug 17 2016,positive,the best superhero film this year by far i seen it twice
Aug 17 2016,positive,captain america civil war is everything you want it to be and much much more it doesnt even matter if you dont like captain america that much or dont know much about him because there is so much more to this movie than that pretty much all of the avengers besides hulk and thor are back in this movie plus add in spiderman antman and black panther the front half about an hour or so seems a little slow because its trying to introduce the many plots that this movie has but it is completely made up for and worth the wait in the last hour and a half the battle scenes between these superheroes are incredible the tension building between the captain america side and the iron man side keeps the movie completely engaging and makes you switch back and forth between the two sides with so many key incidents happening throughout the movie the introduction of a new spiderman tom holland was excellent as it brought back the way spiderman should be done a teenager that while still a superhero is still starstruck when he sees the other heroes and is still amazed by the things that he sees in the superhero world top to bottom this movie will get you thinking about it long after youve finished watching it and has all the right pieces that it needed to live up to its hype at the end of the day captain america civil war is a great movie and no matter if youre a captain america fan or not is definitely worth the watch
Aug 16 2016,positive,splashanther one
Aug 16 2016,positive,theres not a whole lot to dislike about captain america civil war i do think the mcu marvel cinematic universe has a way of making captain america appear corny at times with little nuances here and there like the patriotic music playing when hes tearing through bad guys to be fair super strength and vibranium shield aside cap is about as plain as oatmeal even when hes going against the grain hes doing so for all the right reasons its enough to drive you nuts or at least make you roll your eyes a time or two you cant really give a guy an edge when hes never had one to begin with    in the case of civil war even if youre not a fan of captain america there are so many other characters to feast your eyes on itll put you in a state of fanboy heaven the gangs all here save for hulk and thor who are replaced by black panther and spiderman new characters require new storylines to answer how did you get here and no one is doing that better than marvel right now the intros are not only brief but seamless and are incorporated in the midst of answering why cap and iron man are going at it in the first place its definitely a delicate juggling act one that i had a lot of questions about going into this film and i can say with complete satisfaction that not one ball was dropped as much as i knocked batman vs superman dawn of justice for the sheer lack of effort in fleshing out characters and story i found myself applauding civil war for doing so masterfully even now im shaking my head because its hard to believe marvel can keep this run so fresh after so many years and so many movies    not only were the new characters introduced seamlessly they were just plain awesome on screen i loved spiderman and thought young tom holland did a great job of capturing the essence of why we like this character so much his blundering innocence will make you smile over and over even as he is squaring off against the good guys yes he was phenomenal and yes you get more than just a tiny peek in spite of hollands great performance i thought there was even more to love about chadwick bosemans black panther the threeway onfoot highway chase between cap panther and winter soldier was easily one of my favorite scenes in the movie    the comedy was subtle and comes at exactly the right moments its sprinkled lightly throughout the movie never forced and never taking your eyes away from the bigger picture the punchlines are like swift jabs that regain your focus and remind you youre having a good time i wont bore you by spending an exorbitant amount of time discussing the action save for a few things 1 its grand everything you want and then some 2 the numerous trailers dont even scratch the surface of what youll get to see and 3 expect some cool surprises that i would never forgive myself for if i ruined for you     with movies like these especially when theyre done particularly well i have to take a step back and allow myself time to let the fanboy vision fade away after three days of this movie stewing in my mental i have to say that i am still very much impressed at what im calling the best captain america movie yet i give it a 93    ill end with a quote from my wife take notes dc
Aug 16 2016,positive,good movie felt like the story was rushed
Aug 16 2016,positive,between 25 and 3 i dislike when these guys fight between them some aspects are a little distorsioned to let the story go and the movie has the dark lowprofile villain style of last captain americas story anyway the new spiderman and some moments are funny i hope in next movie we see avengers again fighting together and much better for something they have not provoked themselves
Aug 16 2016,positive,this film is the definition of what makes marvel movies great so many awesome characters some new ones an interesting villain and a great story without taking the overwhelmingly dreary or too lighthearted route personally favorite movie in the mcu thus far
Aug 16 2016,positive,one of the best movies in the marvel cinematic universe the conflict was well done and the story worked well there were some plot points and character moments that didnt quite work for me as i felt they werent fleshed out enough but on the whole the characters emotional arcs were well done
Aug 16 2016,negative,the movie that brought you big ass location screens
Aug 16 2016,positive,great movie especially if youre a fan the action sequences were awesome
Aug 15 2016,neutral,okay a little boring
Aug 15 2016,positive,minus zemo  plus everything else
Aug 15 2016,negative,this movie was surprisingly boring
Aug 15 2016,negative,was really bored with this movie hated how spiderman looked
Aug 15 2016,positive,great story all the super heroes have good arcs action is amazing airport scene is one of the best action scenes ever good villian who had reasonable goals and achieved them
Aug 15 2016,positive,this movie was great and completely delivered what i hoped for when it comes to action and awesomeness hehehe
Aug 15 2016,positive,this is a very good film for a few main reasons the acting directing and story telling captain america civil war brings a lot to the screen when it comes to those things but really what this film is about is friendship and vengeance and how it can effect everyone in its path which makes captain america civil war so realistic and much more gritty
Aug 14 2016,negative,it was at best  a good movie
Aug 14 2016,positive,the good guys are against one another and the movie has you routing for both sides as you sit back and watch another epic marvel film
Aug 14 2016,negative,action packed check  marvel fun check  mindless petty squabbles check  reasons to despise captain america by the end definitely    as far as a movie disconnected from the comics this movie is ridiculous especially considering starks position  connected to captain america as a character this is insane hes supposed to be a character of unity and patriotism instead we have him turn into a modern conservative who wants to place himself above the law  it is truly impossible to rate this without comparing it to bmvsm which has an existential question involved as opposed to cap just being a rogue
Aug 14 2016,positive,not as good as winter soldier but still really great
Aug 14 2016,positive,captain america civil war is a fun movie with a great cast writing and direction the story is very compelling the action is fantastic the cgi looks amazing and it is also a very funny movie but while it is funny it is also sad at times i wont spoil the movie for anyone who hasnt seen it the only real problem i had with this movie is that it dragged on a bit to long
Aug 14 2016,positive,the whole choose a side trend is flat out stupid by the way but the movie itself was flat out awesome with a great cast
Aug 14 2016,negative,as bad as the avengers civil war was boring and cluttered with too many characters the mcu isnt looking great imo
Aug 14 2016,neutral,got to be honest as the film went on i couldnt really make head nor tail of this far too many characters in one film in my opinion i preferred the first captain america film
Aug 14 2016,positive,marvel did it right i love the avengers and marvel did a great job of making up for the disastrous age of ultron
Aug 13 2016,positive,a comic book fans dream come true this is more than just a superhero movie as it explores ideas that are constant in todays world
Aug 13 2016,neutral,captain america civil war was an all around decent film that i all around enjoyed i especially liked spidermans intro into the mcu despite being hero v hero it unapologetically  refuses to leave atypical superhero cliches that make this move avengers 25 not captain america 3
Aug 13 2016,neutral,flashy but empty action dull and unoriginal story
Aug 13 2016,positive,this is the best marvel comic book movie ever made with its witty plot and interesting new character introductions this is as good a movie as you will see at the theater it has awesome battle sequences almost non stop action and your typical comic book flair it also boasts a more diverse cast and casts an interesting look at the future of the avengers and is it just me or does ant man not steal every single scene in which hes in and oh yeah this is an incredibly well acted movie not that the academy will be lining up with an oscar for anyone anytime soon this is a must see for any comic book fan action fan or summer blockbuster fan this movie sets quite a precedent for the next line of civil war movies lets hope its even close to being as good as this one
Aug 13 2016,positive,excellent should have been avengers 3
Aug 13 2016,positive,great relationship dinamics make this movie
Aug 13 2016,positive,fun good set up for what is to come
Aug 13 2016,neutral,thought it was an ok movie but marvel could have done way more with the idea i also found myself thinking when is this movie going to end a few times
Aug 13 2016,negative,i found this to be more of an avengers sequel than a captain america story moreover i found steve rogers to be a bit of a dick to iron man visàvis the latters parents
Aug 13 2016,positive,amazing epic next level marvel
Aug 12 2016,positive,my second favorite of the three captain america movies
Aug 12 2016,positive,darker more fun that most marvel movies directing was spot on
Aug 12 2016,positive,actually had something interesting to say spiderman was amazing    makes me look forward to that movie even more
Aug 12 2016,positive,this was very interesting but i did not care for this iron man in the movie but of course its in the comics spiderman was really a joke in this movie unexperianced super hero
Aug 12 2016,positive,civil war is one of the best mcu movies  and that airport battle is amazing one of the best superhero fight scéne
Aug 12 2016,positive,    after the outstanding success of deadpool civil war for me suffered conceptually from high expectations  it will ultimately go down as a mediocre instalment of the franchise  nearly every characters arc has already been aptly explored meaning ironman and captain americas moral dilemma of abiding by or ignoring superhero rules is where the heart of the film will be judged  for those of us who are still entranced by superheros this plot may suffice  for me the idea of civil war between our heroes simply lacks the punch that made these characters when they first arrived on our screens    there are solid moments throughout the film spidermans journey into the avengers being one but in the end this feels like another action blockbuster that relies too heavily on cgi over original  characters and depth of screenwriting
Aug 11 2016,positive,i always loved marvel and congrats on another fantastic moive i just cant wait to see whats next in line for marvel
Aug 11 2016,positive,enjoyable funny well directed and good performance but the plot is everywhere and nowhere at the same time
Aug 11 2016,positive,as much as i wanted civil war to be its own movie other than a captain america movie it stands extremely well among the previous marvel movies in my opinion the action and introduction of new characters is handled very well by the directors a very good well directed well acted movie
Aug 11 2016,positive,avengers 25 though cap is in the forefront the cast is well balanced fight sceans are epic and so much wit and banter between players a very solid entry to the mcu
Aug 11 2016,negative,longwinded and short on character development an army of cgi developers does not an interesting movie make
Aug 11 2016,positive,there should have been more emotional scenes between the main character steve rogers and bucky barnes the man steve rogers starts a war for all in all good movie but the amount of characters and action scenes makes it just another typical superhero movie and doesnt beat the winter soldier i especially enjoyed black panthers characterization in the movie cant wait for the black panther movie
Aug 11 2016,positive,one of the better written marvel movies
Aug 11 2016,positive,captain america civil war is the definitive marvel flick and the best of the superhero genre for years to come the emotional impact of the story is genuine the plot is exhilirating and intense each and every action scene keeps you at the edge of the seat and new additions such as spiderman and black panther are what makes this film such a masterpiece    some might call it avengers 25 however above all these characters such as the avengers or the united nations or black panther or spiderman or the vengeful zemo there are three that keep their importance and shine in the movie steve rogers bucky barnes and tony stark the three most important characters beyond all that charismatic and non stop action with fantastic stunt work and clever visual effects is a story about friendship vengeance anger and grief    civil war starts off with a perfectly paced fun but emotional first act that sets the main plot device of the story the sokovia accords however the second act becomes much more interesting and gave me goosebumps we get to see the motivations clearer the story develops the character develops another crisis occurs the heroes are divided and boom we finally get to see the greatest cinematic battle in history of superhero films the highly anticipated civil war battle where all heavyweights such as antman hawkeye spiderman and many others join in     but that airport battle wasnt really the real civil war the war was engulfing within our three main heroes as the villain becomes more apparent and as the heroes unite to stop the ultimate dillema another shocking revelation burns down the relationship of the heroes and it is iron man vs bucky barnes and captain america the real civil war    but there are indeed some nitpicky cons such as rushed story devices such as the appearances of hawkeye and repetitive arguments but these are all minor issues but the main problem was zemo who also turned out to be quite satisfying as well zemos motivations and schemes were very relatable but was dissapointing and could be expanded further upon daniel bruhl did what he could do best and it is not really that much of an issue    the main highlight of the movie for me is spiderman he is my favorite superhero and i was worried about his debut in the mcu portrayed by tom holland and honestly  he nailed it its as if he popped out of a real comic book panel he is the most accurate portrayal of the webslinger yet and has awesome quips as he should do he has some awesome moments as well but black panther is also my other highlight very integral to the plot he is a very regal straight up badass and you can see his character develop in a limited screen time in a very appropriate and blessed way    captain america civil war keeps the stakes high improves as the story progresses with a lot of character development and political and realistic aspects to it however it perfectly maintains its popcorn worth with exhilirating action and great visual effects
Aug 11 2016,positive,the marvel cinematic universe rises in suspense with this the third instalment of the captain america franchise captain america civil war chris evans and robert downey jr lead this large cast of one of the most anticipated action movies of 2016 constantly filled with suspense and cleverly executed action civil war is a film that succeeds in attracting unflinching attention this film is certainly actionpacked never demoting itself to anything but a quickfire pace civil war is visually monumental and accomplishes exactly what you want in terms of brilliant fight scenes and surprisingly emotional sequences evans and downey jr are fantastic playing both protagonist and antagonist each giving some of the most complex performances seen yet as their characters the supporting cast of scarlett johansson elizabeth olsen and sebastian stan to name but a few are mostly wonderful too however the film can tend to feel slightly too manic at points lacking structure and trailing off to complete disorder and turbulence though this doesnt happen very often the film is constantly plagued by a dull villain who is later forgotten and then hurriedly tied in across the course of the film the character is not needed and adds a useless layer to the film that wastes time overall however civil war is one of the best films yet produced by the mcu complete with nailbiting action often deep emotion and an allstar cast this film surely shows that the next era of mcu films is something we should anticipate with high hopes
Aug 11 2016,positive,wasnt all perfect didnt like that the bad guy didnt have a lot of screen time but still loves the movie
Aug 10 2016,neutral,i wasnt anticipating this movie as much as others but still kinda curious about it so here are my thoughts i was slitghly disappointed with this movie i expected more from an adaptation of the civil war storyline the problem is that the motivations that spark this conflict really come from leftfield the protagonists do something out of character to simulate tension but none of it feels genuine while the action does feel more visceral and it is better directed however what shouldve been the climax of the movie is present in the end of the second act and shouldve been the end of the second act is presented as the climax and some characters are totally unnecessary to the plot the action still lacks strong character motivations that gives it an edge and stakes speaking of latter it has always been marvel weakness stakes that matter actual tension it does come at first when the character of the winter soldier is involved and how the colliding superheroes treat him as either an outlaw or a victim but the movies tonal inconsistencies breaks any tension that was present humor has been a huge part of the marvel movies but what shouldve been a darker more serious installment gives in to the more often oneliners and instantanious jokes in the end what shouldve been the turning point for the mcu turns out to be just another popcorn action blockbuster the political aspect is quickly dissipated for more certainly stunning action setpieces with lacking strong motivations certainly not a disaster i did expect more from it but others should find their liking in it
Aug 10 2016,positive,too long for me my family really enjoyed
Aug 10 2016,negative,the only reason this movie had captain americas name on it was because he won the fight in the end the entire plot revolves around tony stark who gets not one but two separate climaxes compared to caps big zero change throughout the film     dont get me wrong yay splosions for days i laughed hysterically during the several action sequences however by including 12 main characters its hard to get to know any of them and by focusing on iron man i missed the character i was hoping to learn something new about
Aug 10 2016,positive,with so much focus on the heroes it struggles to find screen time or character development for the antagonist
Aug 9 2016,positive,arguably the greatest superhero movie ever made this film was executed to perfection through and through the battle scenes spiderman and ant man stealing the show i sincerely didnt want it to end and it left me as well as many others wanting more as soon as possible the plot raised interesting points and questions in a creative way and kept audiences entertained throughout
Aug 9 2016,positive,very well made with great acting and action the story and script should of been polished just a tiny bit more but so much enjoyment here
Aug 9 2016,positive,the best movie ever v 1010
Aug 9 2016,negative,more of the same marvel is scare of what dc is doing i can belive how big they are and of coruse is a jocke this spiderman terrible cast this is a movie that lack of big scale destruction effects i guess marvel should do more movies like deadpool something different  the thing is that most of the people like this kind of movies because we had had more than 10 years of marcel
Aug 9 2016,positive,not quite the winter soldier but a great film nonetheless    the only questionable component is the inconsistent model citizen behavior of tony stark  come on folks  tony is and will always be a narcissist not to mention the fact that he will also always question authority  his character wasnt entirely believable
Aug 9 2016,positive,4 12 stars on the shield out of 5 for me this may be the best of the marvel movies yet and considering how much i love winter soldier and guardians of the galaxy thats saying a lot the russo brothers direct this film in such a way that you dont notice the time going by because you move from action centered set pieces to intensity filled character development back to action almost seamlessly chris evans has really taken to the role of steve rogerscaptain america and thats why his loyalty to bucky seems genuine even when many would have left their friend long before considering that to many iron mantony stark is doing a quasi villain turn at points in this movie i applaud the way robert downey jr imbeds his character with deep regrets concerns anger love obsession respect at the same time and what an introduction to both the black panther and the latest take on spiderman heck even antman has a gigantic time while onscreen and the scarlet witch  vision dynamic begins to echo their comics versions even more and im a huge hawkeyeblack widowfalcon mark so couldnt be more pleased they shine again yes the zemo should have been better developed and put on a purple ski mask or something at least once but even his character workedmade sense overall a great springboard to the next round of marvel universe films
Aug 9 2016,positive,amazing action  amazing story and great charactersthank you russo brothers youve done it again
Aug 9 2016,positive,a great example of a well written and directed superhero movie it is very wellorganized every character gets a chance to shine and the story is very simple yet complex and great it is a great start to another phase of the marvel cinematic universe
Aug 9 2016,positive,fun action packed and when it comes down to serious mode you feel the seriousness and you care about the characters unlike bvs
Aug 9 2016,positive,civil war was great i loved it so much black panther stole the show along with spiderman and antman war machine finally got some screentime bilbo baggins has some fun and scarlet witch is cute as always only 2 complaints 1 with phase 3 getting off to a strong start how will dr strange live up to the already built hype secondly did antman get his orange slices
Aug 8 2016,positive,masterpiece of a movie with so many characters the russo brothers incredibly manage to make me have a connection with all of them the villain is one that i would love to see in future films develop and the movie just makes me more excited for the start of avengers infinity war all in all this movie was an emotional roller coaster and a treat for all movie goers
Aug 8 2016,neutral,being a huge cap fan i had such high hopes for this movie after seeing it about 5 times now i find myself at the end every time not satisfied if this was going to be the last stand alone cap movie it should have been epic while im sure others will disagree and say this movie is epic in my opinion it was just okay to me though winter soldier still stands as the best marvel movie to date
Aug 8 2016,positive,the best captain america to date the villain was excellent and different than any ive seen in a comic film this was to me the movie of the summer or spring if youre facetious
Aug 8 2016,positive,at the time of writing this is the new benchmark for superhero blockbusters  the russos do a better job with the avengers ensemble than weve seen with actual avengers films and still manage to make it a captain america movie  tom hollands new spiderman is also exceptionally exciting as is black panther
Aug 8 2016,positive,lets just call this avengers civil war  it puts to shame the previous nonsense that was age of ultron
Aug 8 2016,positive,the russo brothers not only managed to craft an incredibly entertaining installment of the mcu franchise with great humor some of the most breathtaking action sequences in any super movie but make a worthy sequel to captain america winter soldier civil war is one of the most mature super films to date that has thought provoking themes and a fantastic emotional core with tony stark and steve rogers that will leave you undecided on which team you should choose to be on
Aug 8 2016,positive,a great movie great charactersa good concept of the movie
Aug 8 2016,positive,loved it for the most part  however i have to put my total fanboy aside and be realistic that the plot is tissue thin  especially the 3rd act where iron man turns on cap  bucky again due a conveniently placed and well edited vhs copy of the stark parents death  so zemo carried that around with him everywhere to save for tony  was it there out of sheer coincidence in case tony ever made it to that base  and where did the working vhs player come from
Aug 8 2016,positive,thoughtprovoking action packed emotional thrilling this is what superhero movies are all about the action in this movie is so good that some of the scenes will go down as the most iconic scenes in marvel history the russo brothers were able to handle these so called mini avengers really well i do felt that they had so many themes to handle that some were left hanging without following through but that aside it was still fairly executed with great themes a good plot and action
Aug 8 2016,positive,no questions asked favorite marvel movie of the cinematic universe so far
Aug 8 2016,positive,accumulation of 13 movies and it did not dissapoint but the main credit of the movie goes to the russo brothers
Aug 8 2016,positive,the best marvel movie to datethe russos did it againblack pantherspidey and antman are the best parts with the whole airport scene
Aug 8 2016,negative,crap still in new bottle movie sucksghost rider is better than this
Aug 8 2016,positive,brilliant brilliant brilliant captain america civil war was everything the fans hoped forit was thrillingepic storyspider man was mind blowing many havent mentioned that iron man was amazing herethe problem is did captain america did justice to tony did the movie did justice to tony
Aug 8 2016,negative,yawn i was extremely excited about this movie because of the trailers and posters but at the theater i almost fell asleep the only good part about this movie was the epic battle with spiderman and everyonebut even that scene had its flaws it had bad lines and spiderman seemed to clingy to tony stark parts of the fight looked pour and there looked like way to much cgi now at one point in the movie black panther takes a step in and its pretty cool and you think things are turning around but then the movie gets even worse theres many talk scenes that are long an extremely boring and pretty pointless i am sure they couldve gotten through that story without 15 different long talk scenes then theres the part everyones waiting for the captain america vs iron man the point of the whole movie okay now your probably thinking one of them will get cerisaly hurt or one might even die well lets see there was about a 10 minute kitty fight scene with them like they couldve done sooo much more damage but they had to kitty fight in the end they just go there different ways whaaat i payed good money to see this i dont see why it has such high scores
Aug 7 2016,positive,this is basically what avengers 2 should have been perfect acting perfect humor steady pacing good cast chemistry and solid plot with virtually zero holes
Aug 7 2016,negative,literally no plot what the hell marvel shit like always
Aug 7 2016,positive,the movie was okay but not upto the mark according to me it could have been better spiderman suit was like a shirt painted red blue and black
Aug 7 2016,positive,may be the best marvel movie yet
Aug 7 2016,positive,ok lets take the bad out of the way first and the worst things in civil war can be summed up in two words cap and zemo    its hard to understand what are captain americas motivations here the original civil war comics as notgreat as they were made that clear enough the superhero registration act the need for all superpowered individuals to register with the government and be restriced by it was shady enough to give him a reason to fight as well as the opposite sides reasons for the act the fact that these people are dangerous in the movie were talking about a un treaty countries all over the world are worried about a bunch of people with incredible worldshaking powers traveling around and attacking who they want the un creates a way to hold them accountable and make sure they dont break havoc cap disagrees because something something but when over one hundred governments  including yours  want to prevent you from going too far and you say no one tells me what to do youre clearly on the wrong side    zemo on his end has a refreshingly simple plan creating a crack between the avengers turn them against themselves to ultimately destroy them from the inside thats a great change from the usual big baddie who wants to destroy the world with a column of light however once you have the attack in the un his whole plan stops making sense what he needs to break into the winter soldiers mind find the location of a secret facility get there kill everyone and hope that somehow both captain america and iron man will arrive there at the same moment so he can show them a video thats a lot of things that need to go right    theres a third fault in the movie and thats more subtle the movies premise and first act is that something happens to throw cap and iron man on opposite sides fighting but still respecting each other one hour later and the movie ends with cap and iron man on opposite sides fighting but still respecting each other while you may argue that the un attack was a kind of final straw that finally forced them to actually battle the rest of the movie doesnt change anything on a story perspective the whole second half could be cut and youd be in the same place    but the important thing is the journey or so they say and here the russo brothers deliver the action is spectacular the funny moments land the characters are wellconstructed and the emotional moments hit you hard all the merit goes for the direction and the actors the scene preceding the final fight is probably the greatest piece of emotional storytelling in any superhero movie and one of the best in any movies when starks watches the winter soldier killing his parents you can read the slow realization sinking in the pure blind hatred boiling up he killed my mum he yells and she wasnt even called martha and its time for chris evans to shine while he realizes theres no arguing when his eyes tell you he doesnt want to fight but he knows its unavoidable    and there will never be a better fight scene than the airport battle in any movie ever    if the plot and the initial character motivations have some gaps and holes the movie build a great fun action packed and emotional piece of entertainment that might not be as good as cap 2 the winter soldier but its still worthy of praise    ps yep they got spidey right finally the same cant be said about aunt may though
Aug 7 2016,positive,good production value for this film and decent actors my main problem with the movie with it was predictable and a little boring as a result of it most of the scenes where in the trailer
Aug 7 2016,positive,i am a big marvel fan and this movie was way better than i expected its  funny intense and action packed love this movie so much cant wait for the bluray
Aug 7 2016,positive,great story amazing mix of serious and laughs and they finally made spider man cool again
Aug 7 2016,positive,loved it but im biased i am obsessed with this marvel franchise from the very beginning all the way up to now there hasnt been so much as a hiccup in the collection say otherwise and ill send my buddy the hulk to pay you a visit love you stan lee
Aug 7 2016,positive,years of build up lead up to this epic and thrilling clash of your favorite superheros just lock in on the superhero and superhero violence and dont mind another lame marvel villain with a non sensible plan
Aug 7 2016,positive,was skeptical but wound up really liking it
Aug 7 2016,negative,this isnt a civil war but a tag touch football game could have been so much more sad really
Aug 7 2016,neutral,alright in action but kind of silly to say the least like a comic book lol
Aug 7 2016,positive,a fantastic follow up to captain america winter soldier and now embedded as one of the top 5 films in the marvel franchise
Aug 7 2016,positive,thoroughly enjoyed great popcorn movie
Aug 7 2016,positive,the only issue i had with it is that the movie ended
Aug 7 2016,positive,its ok but its not on par with the marvel standard in my opinion
Aug 6 2016,positive,second best superhero movie of the yearbut still awesome
Aug 6 2016,negative,there was just too much politics involved that i lost interest i already get enough politics on facebook and in the news why would i want to go to a movie that only adds to it
Aug 6 2016,positive,4 stars a wonderful live action comic book movie i wouldve preferred a longer version however because the plot was a bit heavy i think it would be nice to see good 3 hr comic book movies live action
Aug 6 2016,positive,best movie of the year so far
Aug 6 2016,positive,marvel had done it again  they managed to make another action packed movie along with a compelling story  what makes this movie so intriguing is how well numerous superheroes were brought into this film yet it was clearly still captain americas story  marvel is definitely in this game for the long run
Aug 6 2016,positive,i wanted to see this movie for the conflict and darker side of marvel i got once again a humor filled team fight and a no death ending i cant take marvel seriously
Aug 6 2016,neutral,after all the hype it didnt pay off captain america civil was a very disappointing movie for me heres my reasons why lets start with the good  the action is great its well done theres no shaky cam and no unnecessary closeups its all done well  ant man spider man and black panther are easily the best parts of this movie black panther kicked ass i cant wait to see his own movie in 2018 spider man and ant man where funny and they had some great moments  in the short time theyre in the movie    the airport fight besides some characters making some dumb choices and a twist that wasnt executed to well enough the fight was good enough  the things i didnt like are  no daredevil they pretty much crammed spider man in the movie there is no reason for daredevil to not be here    so there is a character in this movie who im not going to spoil in the beginning of the movie who is completely wasted   some parts are completely forgettable  ok my final point is my biggest problem with civil war this is a huge spoiler dont any further unless you dont care or have seen the movie ok now                  no one dies which is already a problem because someone does in the comic book it makes me think marvel doesnt want anyone dying because its too dark but i could be wrong
Aug 6 2016,positive,one of my favorite marvel movies ever
Aug 6 2016,positive,one of the best marvel movies
Aug 6 2016,positive,a fantastic story from beginning to end comic book critics will complain that it isnt true to the comic books but in my opinion marvel does not need to be anymore this movie is the best marvel movie second to guardians of the galaxy in my opinion and does such an effective job at introducing new characters and making you invested in them and the entire mcu take notes dc
Aug 6 2016,positive,another great captain america movie by the russo brothers but it feels like more of an avengers movie that could be because of the fact that there are most of the avengers in it and they are fighting but this could have easily been called civil war   again the russo brothers deliver a very actionpacked blockbuster which surprisingly has a lot of grim consequences on the marvel universe but still is a really fun standalone movie because it is dealt in the typical marvel way   spiderman was amazing in this movie tom holland was great and the character did not feel stuffed into the movie he just came into the movie very smoothly and a movie with so many characters no character i felt was sidelined and everybody felt like they had to be there except crossbones he was just there for an action scene   overall this movie was really fun and is a very different and awesome marvel movie thanks to the russo brothers and the writers
Aug 6 2016,negative,a waste of time doesnt fallow the comicbook dont waste your time 
Aug 6 2016,positive,this movie was amazing i give it a 9510
Aug 6 2016,positive,best big budget film of the year
Aug 6 2016,positive,the return of the living dead
Aug 6 2016,positive,the best film yet in the marvel universe best superhero movie of all time
Aug 6 2016,negative,plain boring same as any other avengers movie nothing new actually fell asleep at 1 stage of the movie
Aug 5 2016,positive,strong story stronger choreography among the mcus best
Aug 5 2016,neutral,i am not gonna address the plot problem this one has but what makes me give it a negative review is that i found this movie impossible to watch in a single sitting plain screenplay sketchy vfx average acting performances that makes a point that you should stay away from the screen when this movie is on the movie just doesnt end and marvel fails to find a good villain the airport war scene was less interesting than seeing a man snort for an hour i expected a lot better movie than this
Aug 5 2016,positive,it continues to amaze me how they are able to fit this many characters into a single movie while giving each of them their turn to shine  that might very well be what really makes marvel films so enjoyable to watch
Aug 5 2016,positive,was great iron man still has it i loved elizabeth olsen superb i did not miss paltrow at all did miss thor as did most of the girls in the audience the story was interesting and the visuals amazing as usual looking forward to the next installment
Aug 5 2016,positive,the new standard for ensemble cast superhero movies  at this point most will have seen the preceding movies and so the movie can flow without the continual rehashing origin story of every character and move the plot along  great action scenes great character building  seriousness offset with levity  just great
Aug 5 2016,positive,marvels best movie yetnailed everything especially spiderman
Aug 5 2016,positive,better than the first in the series but not as good as the second
Aug 5 2016,positive,a solid follow up to winter soldier but i think that one is the best captain america movie    spiderman was handled really well and i am looking forward to his standalone movies i did find the whole aunt may tony stark scene completely missed the mark but doesnt detract from the movie    now this charge is somewhat spoilery you have been warned but how can ironman blow off winter soldiers arm and then not be able to eviscerate captain americas shield    overall a very good movie that had tons going on and is worth watching multiple times
Aug 5 2016,positive,i really loved the story but why the heck did tony not just shoot both cap and bucky and leave his shield was not there
Aug 5 2016,positive,its good like we have come to expect with the mcu this film reflects other films in the last few years incredibly well and the russo brothers do a great job on the characters one of the best marvel films to date worth a watch
Aug 5 2016,positive,another great movie from marvel studios and disney very good story excelent action great actors and good comedy
Aug 5 2016,positive,while its a perfectly good film it gets overhyped all to easily and a roster of fan favourite characters seem to distract people from its muddled plot and general clunkiness around the edges
Aug 5 2016,positive,what really needs to be said about this movie it was by far the movie of the year
Aug 5 2016,positive,best movie ever i even have smile on face thinking about ant man and spidy d
Aug 5 2016,positive,this film is so good
Aug 5 2016,negative,ugh could not finish this dull movie with poor acting and lame action and effects a couple funny lines but not worth it what is wrong with people
Aug 4 2016,positive,its about time spiderman joined the avengers
Aug 4 2016,neutral,really disappointing finish in the end it feels like nothing was accomplished the fact the the characters are fighting without the intent to kill each other makes it much less enjoyable
Aug 4 2016,positive,i want to start out with the cinematography first then the visual effects     the cinematography as every film fan knows should be unique to its nature and genre this has to be the film that uses lenses and quality as if your watching a romantic movie and surprisingly it goes so well with this technical and visual masterpiece   as you may know movies these days are almost the same where theres just destruction of multiple boring cgi buildings and cgi explosions however this film delivers its own unique action sequences which will entertain film fans and especially superhero fans    only downside is running time extensive running time should be delivered for fans who are willing to watch it on their own time at home normally people would not watch it through a pact space in a theater overall great movie four stars     gean kaurgill
Aug 4 2016,positive,marvel has done it again introducing a famous story arc from the comics and slightly changing it to keep things fresh the russo brothers kill it with some new cast members like black panther who we see for the first time in the mcu and spiderman who is no longer owned by sony we see him for a little time but he is just the spiderman that we wanted captain america and ironman get political and aggressive being played by a villain who relates a puppet master who could have been better but played his part the story has great dialogue and character interaction balancing many characters from the mcu and giving them all some screen time the story was well played out only problem of mine was that some scenes had poor looking cgi that momentarily take on you out of the film but are too little to ruin the film
Aug 4 2016,positive,alas weakest of the marvel films to date plot holes you could fly a quinjet through every reason iron man had to fight was illogical and flawed smartest man on the planet shouldnt have been so foolish new heroes all well done though the movies saving graces
Aug 4 2016,positive,best superhero movie of all time loved every minute of it
Aug 4 2016,positive,going into this movie i was extremely pumped the trailers were great i even reread the civil war comic was i disappointed absolutely not this movie blew me away i loved the action sequences the internal conflict between these characters and the finale was downright amazing    when talking about this movie it is impossible not to talk about spiderman i really liked how he was introduced and his witty comments during the airport scene were really cool tom holland was great he actually felt like a random highschoolerturnedsuperhero and you really felt for him    this movie was almost perfect but something was missing    after the first action scene a lot of the scenes involving cap and bucky felt a little rushed also around this part there is a scene that no spoilers i didnt really understand fully until the ending second viewing much better    all of the scenes with bucky and black panther were really great you really understood black panthers motives and it really captivated me     the ending fight with the twist no spoilers again really felt emotional and you understood both cap and iron man all in all i really liked this movie and its a definite would watch again
Aug 4 2016,positive,another great marvel movie  lots of character development action and humor  exactly what i like when i go to the theater
Aug 4 2016,positive,comic book movie overdrive at its best russos can do no wrong
Aug 4 2016,positive,the russo brothers do it again by making captain america badass in his threequel by having iron man and cap battle between the accords captain america civil war is even more mature with action than any other marvel movie to date
Aug 4 2016,positive,probably the best marvel movie to date 
Aug 4 2016,positive,one of the most complete comic book movies of all time i still prefer tws  a little more but this is definitely one of mcus best movies
Aug 4 2016,positive,hands down one of the best comic book movies ever im shook the culmination of years of world building brought to one movie wow
Aug 4 2016,positive,one of the best actionfilled dreamcometrue superhero fighting movie  a must watch 
Aug 4 2016,positive,the movie was well balanced characters screen time included didnt carry the emotions it needed for the story to have weight fighting scenes of course were choreographed well and a few surprises for the viewer
Aug 3 2016,positive,loved the depth and action
Aug 3 2016,negative,most overrated movie
Aug 3 2016,positive,we loved this movie so much we saw it 3 times in the theater
Aug 3 2016,positive,avengers disassembled  marvels captain america civil war finds steve rogers chris evans leading the newly formed team of avengers a year after the events of avengers age of ultron after another international incident results in collateral damage the avengers are pressured by tony stark robert downey jr and united nations to install a system of accountability while tony stark votes to institute this new system of checks and balances steve rogers past experiences with government interference lead him to rebel against the new system the result is a heart wrenching divide between the members of the avengers that will forever change the marvel cinematic universe    the russo brothers  my adoration of the russo brothers goes way back to their days directing episodes of my alltime favorite television show community part of the reason i fell in love with community is the russos mastery at cinematography this love affair continued when they were enlisted by marvel to direct captain america winter solider a film considered by most including me as marvels best the film had depth intrigue action and a great cameo i love me some abed the russos continue their takeover with captain america civil war    building a universe  captain america civil war owes a great debt to the russo brothers for understanding how to properly expand upon the marvel universe after watching the disappointment that was batman v superman all eyes were on marvels own hero vs hero slugfest the russos built on everything that the previous films have set up to bring us a tense and emotionally driven conflict between our favorite marvel characters although the film contains more characters than ever before the film manages to balance out everyones roles and motivations while introducing brandnew characters like black panther and spiderman dont be fooled though this film is very much a sequel to captain america winter solider centering on the turmoil between steve and tony the film explores a conflict that has been boiling ever since the very first iron man the result is a fully flesh out story that really makes you care about the characters youve followed for all these years hail russo    the conflict  unlike batman v superman what really worked for captain america civil war was its ability to properly establish a coherent conflict that would pit our heroes against one another throughout the entire film it is understood why each character makes a stand against the other steve is motivated by his past experiences with governments shortcomings and his friendship with the winter solider tony is plagued by his past failures weapons of destruction ultron that have fueled his desire to really make a difference the film benefits from building off the previous films before it but it still works as its own story this story is possibly one of the darkest in the history of the mcu    webslinging fun  not all is dreary in captain america civil war although the film takes its characters and subject very seriously it manages to be equally entertaining and hilarious everyone gets the spotlight in this film but the definite stand outs are spiderman black panther and antman    after 12 years we get a proper spiderman tom holland that feels like he was peeled off the pages of marvel comics he is funny witty and true to his character black panther chadwick boseman is also a refreshing addition to the avengers that promises to be very unique to the heroes we have been introduced to this is probably the character i am least familiar with but they do a wonderful job in giving the character motivation and some pretty spectacular moments    one of my biggest gripes with antman was the lack of humor in the film its freakin paul rudd for goodness sake i should have been peeing my pants of laughter instead paul was rather lukewarm in his solo film but the russos redeemed antman in captain america civil war paul rudd was hilarious and had some rather gigantic scenes hes grown on me and i look forward to seeing much more of him as antman    some flaws  there is little that captain america civil war did poorly the central one being how they handled the main antagonist although i understand the central conflict was steve and tonys idealogical battle i felt that baron zemo daniel brühl should have offered more to the overall film he plays a major role but it felt so subdued that he almost didnt feel necessary to the film    it also felt like the russos took a page out of paul greengrass book in using an excessive amount of shaky cam during a majority of the action scenes it felt off compared to their directorial efforts in winter solider    captain america civil war verdict  marvel continues its dominance as it wages a very onesided war against fox and warner bros captain america civil war manages to outdo the best marvel film ever winter solider where iron mans trilogy failed to live up to expectations captain americas final film really delivers on everything the previous films have built on regardless of whether steve was around or not every hero was treated with respect and properly represented their comic book counterparts the conflict felt real and felt like it will have repercussions for the future congrats russos on another success    what are you doing still reading this review go watch the film its a must see
Aug 3 2016,positive,an instant superhero classic that pins two friends against each other in a film that does not disappoint the action is fresh the comedy is welltimed and the new additions to the mcu are welcome
Aug 3 2016,positive,spiderman enough said
Aug 3 2016,positive,lot of fighting not clearly stated why and very clearly afraid of losing characters should had waited to get a few more characters in the movie
Aug 3 2016,positive,another good addition to the mcu good mind you not great while the film balances most of its characters around with good reason unless youre a randomly appearing spider some of the underlying character decisions seem misplaced and unwarranted along with this any emotional heft regarding the danger of characters is lost with endless misplaced quips and jokes specifically in characters that dont make sense to make them combine this with the mcus inability to kill anything that isnt introduced in the same film beyond these flaws lies an entertaining and action packed popcorn flick
Aug 3 2016,negative,really couldnt watch this for second  time
Aug 3 2016,positive,this movie was both suspencing and full of action it turned out just like i hoped
Aug 3 2016,positive,this is the best mcu movie yet from marvel it has the best spider man live action version yet it the best captain america movie ever made
Aug 3 2016,positive,captain america civil war is a flawed but fun summer blockbuster the action is exceptional and well choreographed with a standout sequence in the form of the airport standoff and the pacing was good but the film declined to take any risks  spoiler don cheadles character recovers the plot was slightly cartoonish in certain parts and the story was also fairly by the numbers though it was slightly thought provoking that was no clear sense of who was right and who was wrong at first they did not fail to include the predictable plot point of a secretive villain pulling the strings all along but it was interesting enough to support the film the performances were memorable overall but fairly unremarkable for some roles that includes tom hollands spiderman the soundtrack was anything but memorable since i dont recall a note of it but the directing is fairly solid and the cg effects consistent the drama falls flat the majority of the time witch i didnt expect given marvel track record ad the scheme of zemo relies heavily upon coincidence and there were more plot holes than expected but the film had wit  ill throw you a bone spidey and it was polished and their were various standout sequences besides the amazing action that i enjoyed with adjusted expectations after i had experienced a good amount of the film after considering everything i enjoyed captain america civil war not as a thought provoking drama but a fun summer blockbuster id give captain america civil war a solid 710
Aug 3 2016,positive,omfg probably the best in the series i cant wait for the next chapter
Aug 3 2016,positive,captain america civil war is an actionpacked blockbuster that feels like a recap of everything in the stories of iron man  captain america up until this movie all of which makes captain america civil war one of the best if not the best installment in the marvel cinematic universe  the russo brothers solid directing also gets you that much more excited for avengers infinity war in 2018
Aug 3 2016,negative,overratedjust overratedbullshit
Aug 3 2016,negative,when marvel first released incredible hulk and iron man starting of their universe i was stoked and it started off strong since though the films are just repetive pointless comedy and random references from the comics thrown in no meaningful character development all the characters feel like they are written the same trying to be each other
Aug 3 2016,positive,best of the franchise so far so many new characters so many cool interactions and a little pinch of darkness makes this dish 2016s main course loved it
Aug 2 2016,positive,my second favorite movie of all time
Aug 2 2016,positive,good but not great these movies are getting a little over the top     i am getting tired of seeing humans being able to fall hundreds of stories and have not a scratch fits punching steel no problem     marvel feels tired to me now
Aug 2 2016,positive,probably one of the best trilogys that the marvel universe has brought us first avenger killed it winter soldier was an amazing thriller and with this third i guess act to this story you really get to see how far not only captain america has come as a character on the big screen but also the winter soldiers character as well the action in this film is perfection the use of humor in my opinion was so on point and the story never in my opinion felt dazed or u got tired of it this film had a good pace in tone and was very captivating some minor things tho the so called villus was very 5050 and his plot and placement in the film was kinda ehh and the idea of the ending which if you havent seen the film spoilers when u have the package from cap given to stark and him saying ill still be their for you and all that as touching as that is i didnt think it was needed cause they have the infinity war coming i dont want it to be the o gangs back together and everythings fine to me that kinda makes this film fall down a bit i wouldve wished theyd kept a more darker tone towards the third act and make it where barons plan actually makes more of an impact like have bucky die have cap tell stark f you stuff like that wouldve made it more kinda true to the grittiness of the comic and made a much more better beginning to the infinity war spoilers no more lol over all good use of all characters and many having giant roles great film hope people have a blast watching it follow me on instagram chrisaldana1 thanks happy movie going
Aug 2 2016,positive,captain america civil war was amazing in my opinion great couple big fighting scenes did a great job introducing black panther and a brand new spiderman cant wait to see them two in their own solo movies its a great start to the mcu phase 3
Aug 2 2016,negative,i got in the theater thinking that i was watching a good movie and what i got was the worst superhero movie ever i swear that there is something wrong with critics these days how is batman v superman bad and this is good probably paid off by marvelthey are complete liarseverybody says this is an emotional movie and its not at allits got the worst plot ever why didnt iron man just destroy the quinjet and the worst villain everi mean the avengers accidentally killed his family so he plans to kill them welldozens died because of the avengers baron zemo was one of my favorite marvel villains and now marvel ruined himi was so dissapointed by this version of spider man he didnt even say with great power comes great responsibilitythe only good thing that came out of it was chadwick bosemans performance as black pantherdo not watch this unless you love terrible movies
Aug 2 2016,positive,civill war has the same story as batman vs superman  the main villain    zemo  who does not like nothing like zemo   has the idea as lex to have the two main superheros to fight against each other   and the only good part was spiderman antman  black panther and the fight with all the superheros and story is a bit boring and cartoonist
Aug 2 2016,positive,striking and consistently engaging captain america civil war is a wellcrafted comic book blockbuster that manages to find time in its overcrowded plot to examine its characters and convey moral  emotional conflict in this epic superhero showdown
Aug 2 2016,positive,decent but not fantastic
Aug 2 2016,positive,besides avengers original and guardians of the galaxy best marvel movie ever
Aug 2 2016,positive,way too long and boring
Aug 2 2016,neutral,hey look another avengers movie
Aug 2 2016,positive,overall its a good film but it just doesnt do enough to become a great film even with the excellent new additions of holland and boseman
Aug 2 2016,negative,for me this was like making a rift in the mcu making the audience pick sides and when it came to it kiling blow or something it didnt come wich i found like the missingthing if someone died okay fans would have been pist or angry but it would have meant something the whole fighting and the whole plot now for me the whole plot stands on that spoilers bucky killed iron mans parents and that the only thing and they kept the feud kinda settled but with open end
Aug 2 2016,positive,it is an amazing movie right up there with the other 12 mcu movies because its awesome mature and fun
Aug 2 2016,negative,terrible plot  the terrible half funny puns make this movie funny where there should be a heart warming moment until spiderman came in i was almost asleep  i love marvel but this movie flopped hard its like they took the die hard villain added him to 21 jump street for no reason
Aug 2 2016,positive,this movie is the best film i have ever seen from marvel personally it leveled with the avengers which is very difficult to do
Aug 2 2016,positive,the best marvel movie ever
Aug 1 2016,positive,i wasnt dissatisfied with this film as i dont expect supreme satisfaction from an mcu film anymore except for as a young child when i saw iron man i have never been blown away by an mcu film i understand the appeal and the films are wellwritten acted and produced but they are still dumb not all films can or should be thematically abstruse operatic in tone and reminiscent of ancient drama and not all films that do establish these identities are good however for captain america civil war to be the endallbeall that i was hyped up to believe it fell short and left me with an eh it was good feeling the marvel cinematic universe has evolved into a drug for many audiences its darkest approaches still incorporate some myopic opinion on life and inject some of that mcu humor and while some may argue that these implements are consequential of a modern superhero films quality i must staunchly disagree
Aug 1 2016,positive,perhaps the best captain america film and it is sooo great
Aug 1 2016,neutral,not my favorite and a bit long and boring
Aug 1 2016,positive,i absolutely adore this movie the choreography was beautifully done there was a lot of comic fan service which i adored the only thing i wish they did was give crossbones a bigger role in the movie
Aug 1 2016,positive,this was great furthered the story along i totally enjoyed the fight scenes go team cap
Aug 1 2016,negative,incredibly boring movie to watch and absolutely unnecessary downey jr looks tired and old and cant stomach his constant fixation on buckylike get a life man
Aug 1 2016,positive,another incredible installment to the marvel universe
Aug 1 2016,positive,terrific movie heartfelt and beautiful one of marvels best entries
Aug 1 2016,positive,dispute resolve and intensity throughout best of the three by far
Jul 31 2016,positive,action filled but not as good as i thought it was going to be
Jul 31 2016,negative,why do superheroes have to fight  arent there enough bad guys to put away  just burning out the comic book genre here
Jul 31 2016,positive,if i could give this movie a zero star rating i would i only gave it 5 stars to grasp your attention this movie was absolute garbage it couldnt even bleim kidding this movie was amazing it had stunning visuals amazing action sequences and great story development
Jul 31 2016,positive,smart sleek and loaded with some of the best superhero action in recent memory civil war might not always carry the weight that its title suggests but its nonetheless an mcu highlight featuring a jawdropping finale fight
Jul 30 2016,positive,emotional fun breathtakingly one of the best marvel movies to date
Jul 30 2016,positive,best movie ever  i could watch it 100 times and it would still be a great movie you want waste your money on this movie
Jul 30 2016,positive,one of the best entries to the mcu although it lacks a villain and the actual villain is quite annoying still a great movie and well become a classic in the future
Jul 29 2016,positive,fantastic moves well feels visceral the problems seem a little manufactured but the exploration of the threats history relationships and ethics are quite drawing
Jul 29 2016,positive,marvel  nothing else to say  a
Jul 29 2016,positive,it was great how the russo brothers managed to fit all the superheroes that were not the avengers i think tom holland was a great spiderman chadwick boseman needs some work to be black panther a superhero whos never been on the silver screen before
Jul 29 2016,positive,this film is the mcus best film not saying the others arent good because so far all mcu movies are good bbut some are better than others but this one beats the others and gives us something new this movie is so fun to watch and this movie is an avengers film but at the same time it is a captain america film i have seen this film twice and both times i enjoyed it the same they also introduced spidey and black panther perfectly and i cant wait for their solo films i love this film and hopefully what happened in this film effects the whole mcu marvel you have done it again this movie is so fresh and it also has funny jokes at the right moments
Jul 28 2016,positive,overall i enjoyed this movie this movie felt more like avengers 25 than a solo captain america film on of the other issues i had is that this movie very loosely follows the civil war storyline from the comics
Jul 28 2016,positive,gaining remarkable critical acclaim above the high standard of productions in the marvel cinematic universe captain america civil war had too much remarkable hype to disregard    as a huge fan of all the films in the marvel cinematic universe with the exception of the incredible hulk 2008 i must admit that i was less enthralled with captain america the winter soldier 2014 in comparison to the others i felt that it lacked the same energetic pace and comic timing as the others due to its greater ambition on being a serious espionage thriller even though it was still a fun time i found it relied on an overly familiar premise which it took very seriously and that bucky barnes was short on characterisation with the story leaving him as more of a simple archetype captain america civil war not only compensates for those shortcomings but it reinvigorates bucky barnes as a character of nothing but necessity for the marvel cinematic universe   the film puts a lot of emphasis into characterising bucky barnes establishing his background and how he struggles to cope with his sleeper agent status the inner conflict he battles as he fights to reclaim his identity while evading authorities makes him both a great hero and villain for the story and how the characters view him is what splits the heroes down the middle and puts them at war bucky barnes is just one of the many figures who are given rich characterisation in captain america civil war because even though the abundance of characters makes it potentially just a third big avengers battle movie christopher markus and stephen mcfeelys screenplay isolates who deserves to have their story told and pursues that without coming up short on the stylish value of the film   captain america civil war is the most characterrich marvel film to date and certifiably one of the finest achievements of the mcu captain america civil war forces the avengers to confront the damage they cause and the lives lost in the process with real emotional strength without detracting from the occasional comic edge of the film with the multiplefilm buildup to captain america civil war viewers have had time to adjust to the humorous fun of the series while it has gradually grown in strength for dramatic plot points and characterisation so when this plot point is introduced it isnt melodramatically dropped upon viewers instead it becomes a turning point for the series and the start of a new dramatic direction for the new generation of the marvel cinematic universe the main two characters are captain america and iron man whose friendship humanity and patriotism is all put to the test along with the superheroes around them the dialogue given to the characters proved to be truly some of the smartest writing in the entire marvel cinematic universe the political discussion that sparks the start of the titular civil war is one which may divide viewers particularly as the film progresses and we see how far the rabbit hole goes there is so much political drama occurring in the time outside the battle that captain america civil war finds a way to keep entertaining every moment it moves along steadily so that viewers have the time to embrace the character development and comprehend the large scale of events happening throughout the narrative universe and it remains gripping the entire time none of the intensity brought on by the action spectacle is lost in the dialogue since the two flow with each other very smoothly the characters discuss some really serious concepts which are thought provoking and mature without condescending the audience with complicated terminologies tedious melodrama or ridiculous sentimentality in a clear sign that the marvel cinematic universe has stepped up in maturity the dialogue in captain america civil war manages to implement in uses of the words sht and bitch without it being purely for humorous gimmicks many superhero films fail to match script with spectacle but captain america civil war is undoubtedly the finest superhero feature to ever make such an achievement  however the standard of writing in the film does face one setback with its main villain as smart as the antagonist of the story is it seems like his motives are a bit of a copout there is only so many ways you can characterise the antagonist of a superhero film as its usually a quest for power or vengeance and in the case of captain america civil war the story falls into the latter unfortunately it chooses a blankly simplistic path in doing so and puts his determination to stop the avengers on a path of ridiculous simplicity while the conflict between the characters and political themes of captain america civil war really raise the stakes for its dramatic nature helmut zemo does not live up to the same standard as a character since he has simply directed the blame of his familys death in damage caused by the avengers when countless lives were threatened by terrorism its not impossible to sympathise with the character but somebody could have thought up a more innovative idea as to why was out for vengeance because this one just feels slack it doesnt cause any major detection in the film but it just comes up generic and doesnt offer the character any really powerful moments to show off the brilliant acting talents of daniel bruhl if it did that then perhaps we could see a greater extent of helmut zemos madness and fully understand his need to destroy the avengers but amid the battle between heroes there doesnt prove to be much screen time for the villain  he pops up sporadically says some things and then disappears while the chaos unfolds to the rest of the world daniel bruhl is still a convincing fool in the role its just that the standard for characterisation in captain america civil war is of a higher standard than any other mcu film and i feel that helmut zemo does not live up to that  to say i was majorly bothered by the films treatment of the villain would be a lie when there is so much more to enjoy in captain america civil war namely amid the serious nature of the entire experience there is still great room for audiences to have a fun time the screenplay is serious not but bereft of the distinctive sense of humour which has propelled the series for so long and in terms of being a visual experience captain america civil war is the greatest action film of the year so far it takes minimal time before this is clarified because the intro action scene is brilliantly paced moving along intensively fast but confining its scale to small so that a large number of characters get to show off their skills without the view losing focus everything is shot with cinematography that balances intense closeups with more distant shots that emphasise the scale of the battle and the nature of the setting around them and the film mediates topnotch fight choreography with the assistance of visual effects to ensure that the action testifies to the talents of the people working both behind and in front of the camera the magnificent musical score of henry jackman helps to keep the feature powerfully atmospheric the entire time and its mediated at a sensible volume with the sound editing  the overall quantity of action in captain america civil war is perfect the film doesnt hide its story behind the spectacle but it mediates a strong quantity of it over the course of the film so that the film never loses focus on its pacing and whats also impressive is the variety of action that audiences get to experience in the film with the superheroes in the story pitted against each other there is an endless visual feast of superpowers on display which audiences can marvel at these are used in a series of scenes which depict the characters fighting with close oneonone combat or showing off their powers to keep each other at a distance as well as that we get to see car and motorcycle chases and characters in aerial pursuit of each other which takes the battle to the sky there are even elements of parkour implemented into the film when steve rogers first helps bucky barnes escape the authorities the entire escape is choreographed and captured much in the same style as the iconic french action film district b13 2004 as a fan of that precise film and parkour in general i was ecstatic to see it present in captain america civil war without it having been forced in there   of course the major action scene that audiences will enter captain america civil war with the intent of viewing is the big battle between the two teams of avengers choosing a team to support in the battle is one not easily done but this is the moment where audiences can stop thinking and just sit back while the experience unfolds without being overblown or prolonged captain america civil war perfectly lives up the hype behind it every character gets engaged in an exhilarating battle with someone else where the films focus gives enough attention to everybody for everyone to show off their powers there are momentary breaks from the action for the characters to remind audiences why this is happening or where things are going next as well as allowing them a chance to crack a joke but it never detracts from the consistently fast experience the action in  captain america civil war is captured with visual expertise and lasts an engaging long time with a rich atmosphere of intensity and it is of such quality that it should fill the gaping hole left in viewers after the underwhelming experience of batman v superman dawn of justice 2016 the rest of the story should help do that too   frankly captain america civil war brought out the child in me who loved superhero movies so much that it made me want to grow up to be a superhero myself while it had the adult in me really questioning the politics behind the battle so it provoked all kinds of thoughts in me and in a remarkable achievement captain america civil war spreads out its characterisation well enough to bring out the best focus in every cast member and evoke intense performances from everybody present in the film  chris evans delivers his most personal depiction of captain america to date while almost every other mcu film has relied primarily on his energetic patriotism and soldier discipline captain america civil war focuses more on him as a person expanding upon what was sparked by captain america the winter soldier captain america civil war shows steve rogers morals being thrown into question as his personal beliefs come into conflict with his directive as a warrior of justice finally we see captain america being genuinely humanised in an intelligent way and chris evans manages to ensure this happens with his real charisma while maintaining the same comic charm muscular appeal and brilliant fighting talents that make captain america such an iconic superhero in the first place chris evans really conveys to audiences the confusing struggle he faces as he has to battle the justice system to protect his friend its a sign of genuine vulnerability in the character which is all too sympathetic and it sheds new light on the superhero while displaying a greater extent of chris evans acting abilities we see him delivering an emotionally restrained performs where the conflict is internal but the charisma is clear and it really makes him a perfect lead chris evans is at his highest standard as steve rogers in captain america civil war the the variety of chemistry he shows off with robert downey jr and sebastian stan is brilliant  robert downey jr is similarly awesome with the legacy of tony stark having been established by the iron man trilogy 200201 robert downey jr is similarly challenged to face new ground in captain america civil war the arrogance and egotism of the character which was used largely for comic relief in many of his other tales evolves into something new in captain america civil war it becomes the source of his real pride as a superhero and his determination to fight for what is right and this leads to some really sophisticated tension in his chemistry with chris evans as the film goes on this only grows as we see him becoming more fierce and aggressive in the role without ever dropping off into melodramatic territory we see the darkest side of tony stark that the mcu has ever displayed and effectively the most human similar to chris evans robert downey jr displays what lies beneath both the exoskeleton suit of iron man and the the playboy facade of tony stark an emotionally damaged and vulnerable man who is driven by his own insecurities robert downey jr is incredibly intense in captain america civil war and the chemistry he shares with chris evans provides some incredibly enticing drama that anchors the heart of the film firmly within a characterdriven narrative  sebastian stan is also brilliant i never saw much potential in the character bucky barnes but thats simply because the mcu never really did anything innovative with him in captain america civil war that finally happens while he was just another soldier in captain america the first avenger 2011 and a rather silent villain captain america the winter soldier he finally becomes an actual character in captain america civil war bucky barnes battles his identity as the winter soldier with a path of intense unpredictability which ensures that viewers can never be certain of his motives and sebastian stan manages to consistently capture both the fierce and aggressive nature of his brainwashed new identity and the sympathetic human side to the character sebastian stan has to play multiple characters with the one role and convince audiences that he is both a ruthless villain and a man with true vulnerability and he does it brilliantly sebastian stan captures every edge to his character while putting a relentless physical effort into his performance to ensure that he kicks some major ass during every action scene sebastian stan certifies bucky barnes as an unforgettable and compelling character for the mcu with his powerful performance in captain america civil war  and paul rudd is one of the most welcome returning cast members in captain america civil war antman 2015 was a greatly entertaining film though it did have a formulaic narrative to it the thing which really sold it was the performance of paul rudd in the titular role so bringing him into a superhero ensemble with the sole purpose of battling with and against the avengers as well as making viewers laugh is exactly what the film needs amid everything serious in captain america civil war paul rudd is consistently hilarious because his comic gimmicks are used to soften the intense mood of the story they are spread out amid his scenes to not overuse them and he manages to hit the right note every time with his natural charm and swift timing paul rudds performance just boosts the excitement surrounding the upcoming antman and the wasp 2018 and he proves a perfect part of the avengers team  however paul rudd is not the only main source of comic relief in captain america civil war as he shares that status with newcomer tom holland cast in the role of spiderman tom holland puts up a hell of a fight to claim the spotlight in captain america civil war and even the fact that spiderman is no cinematic newcomer and is one character in a crowd of many superheroes tom holland makes his brief appearance one that is impossible to forget spiderman is a character that has been toyed with in the cinematic universe over the course of five films since the 2000s but only in tom holland have they finally found the perfect actor tobey maguire was a good peter parker and andrew garfield was a convincing spiderman but only tom holland perfects the feat or successfully portraying both only 19 years of age at the time of filming captain america civil war tom holland perfectly conveys the young and naive nature of peter parker of course his ability to grasp the characters intellectual capacity is extremely convincing as well he is perfectly reserved and geeky in the role of peter parker playing with a nerdy stereotype through his own inherent charm which prevents any kind of cliche onedimensionality from taking over tom holland works the geeky nature of peter parker to brilliant comic effect and manages to implement it into moments of him being spiderman reminding audiences that the character is a teenager bent on having as much fun as he can in the process of standing up for what he believes in tom holland is hilarious as spiderman delivering every line with excitable energy and a subtle serious nature to him while performing with a rich physical passion for spidermans abilities as a superhero frankly i was reluctant that captain america civil war was going to be introducing a third actor to play spiderman since viewers have been repetitively pummelled with the character over the course of five films since 2002 but captain america civil war gets everything right they cast the perfect actor and establish that his uncle ben parker is already dead to ensure that audiences will not have to sit through another origin story with spiderman homecoming for the first time since i was a child watching the trailer for spiderman 2 i find myself extremely excited at the release of a new spiderman movie and seeing tom holland working alongside the always delightful marisa tomei is an experience i will thoroughly look forward to marvel fans can rest now that a perfect spiderman has finally been found in the unknown tom holland  chadwick boseman is an actor i have had long respect for so his introduction to the marvel cinematic universe as black panther is something i most valiantly support the character is not one that im all that familiar with but anchored by a strong performance by chadwick boseman he is very hard to forget in captain america civil war tchalla is a character from a different culture to the westerndominated culture of the avengers as a result the personal motives behind tchallas pursuit of bucky barnes are made unpredictable by the mystery of the character black panther is a justifiably aggressive character who fights with a controlled ferocity that makes him intimidating while the fact that we see tchalla change before he becomes the character gives us a greater understanding of him black panther seamlessly works his way into the narrative and provides a different kind of hero for the story one whose animalistic fighting style and cultural background certified that he has enough difference to stand out from the crowd of characters if that isnt enough then the performance of chadwick boseman should sell it his perfection of the characters african accent and emotionally fuelled line delivery makes tchalla a certifiable character while his physical energy makes him kick ass as black panther  don cheadle makes a passionately patriotic return to the role of james rhodey roads bringing in the intense charisma of a soldier and giving robert downey jr a perfect side kick his voice makes a strong dramatic impact being shouted beneath his war machine suit anthony mackie captures a similar spirit in the role of falcon with the determination to really command his team as a leader and a follower at the same time and paul bettany takes captain america civil war as an effective chance to expand upon the character of vision with a consistently sophisticated line delivery that supports his vast intelligence paul bettany manages to put some slight elements of humanism into vision while maintaining his artificial intelligent brilliance  captain america civil war doesnt do too much to expand upon the characterisation of either black widow or hawkeye but scarlet johansson and jeremy renner give strong performances in their respective parts elizabeth olsen also makes a welcome return as scarlet witch as does william hurt and as a fan of both jim rash and martin freeman the fact that they got bit parts in captain america civil war was most satisfactory without being any kind of a distraction from the story stan lees cameo is also a pivotal gimmick    captain america civil war takes maximum advantage of its hugely talented ensemble cast with a story that pits them in a intelligent story of political turmoil and rich characterisation while maintaining visual expertise to find success as a remarkable action spectacle
Jul 28 2016,positive,fantastic marvel movie the only gripe i have is this movie really doesnt add anything to the universe
Jul 28 2016,positive,great movie and i got extra excited to see the black panther and how dope he was
Jul 28 2016,positive,captain america civil war brings one of the most anticipated marvel moments onto the big screen iron man robert downey jr and captain america chris evans are split into different teams due to their views with the governments decision against the avengers each team consists of characters from another marvel movie and only two who dont have a movie yet black panther chadwick boseman and spiderman tom holland join the marvel cinematic universe for the first time and the actors are very fitting for the roles civil war is marvels best work so far and will be very important in the marvel cinematic universes timeline especially for the final two avengers movies avengers infinity war parts 1 and 2
Jul 28 2016,positive,new spiderman was great usual fantastic action the film annoyed me more because tony stark was a dick than anything else
Jul 27 2016,positive,the best marvel movie
Jul 27 2016,positive,beginning of the movie was slow but i get why second half of the movie more or less i was drooling because i couldnt take my eyes off the screen
Jul 26 2016,positive,this movie was everything that i was hoping it was the plot had depth but was not preachy and enough levity to keep the film buoyant i was thouroughly entertained
Jul 26 2016,negative,if you like this youre the reason why every superhero movie is done exactly the same this movie had huge plot holes witty dialogue childish fight scenes and some hot actorsactresses it wasnt well written there were no good character twists and it blatantly ruined the characters already developed in so many ways
Jul 26 2016,positive,see it twice get ready for the next chapter in the marvel story
Jul 26 2016,positive,captain america sequels are getting way better than the avengers sequelstoying with the idea of damages to public by superheroes is done wellalso good character introductions to that of spiderman and black panther
Jul 26 2016,positive,i actually really liked this one good action as always but the movie did a good job of letting you take a side without leading you to one or the other
Jul 26 2016,positive,this movie isnt that good to be praised as the best movie of mcu but it is good with some great cameos and a huge action packed movie
Jul 25 2016,positive,marvel continues its renaissance of great directing  and in this case a story of the characters and the characters alone     captain america civil war is a fight that stands on its own its a personal fight  of emotions thats new to the mcu moral questions logical character motivations splendid chemistry and they even put old events in a brand new perspective marvel finally hits on all fronts the film is spent more on character depth rather than on humor  its a more mature and serious film than what we expected to see team cap vs iron man is full of characters yes but it surprisingly wasnt that messy as one might suspect too many yes but worth it ohh yeah this film and its events are all greatly motivated  both characters and action the action might not be topnotch due to some lack of uniqueness and long term entertainment too long and meh for my taste add some expositions shakycam and a less great ending  well its not a perfect film still its one heck of a superhero flick  a flick thats not only action and cgi but most important  its a film of characters     personal rating 80100  critical rating 80100
Jul 25 2016,positive,thoughtprovoking actionpacked and occasionally quite funny captain america civil war may feel more like a third avengers movie minus thor and hulk but its visual effects plot and performances from its cast especially tom holland as mcu spiderman help make this other superhero showdown a fun time at the movies
Jul 25 2016,positive,one of the best movies of the year i can watch  this over and over
Jul 25 2016,positive,just got back from captain america civil war i was completely blown away by how awesome it was this might be the best marvel movie to date i almost forgot that it was a superhero movie it was that good it was like being on a roller coaster that doesnt take any stops or detours definitely worth the price of admission if you havent seen any of the other films in the marvel franchise you may be lost and confused at times but if thats the only complaint i have then thats good i give this film an a
Jul 25 2016,positive,captain america civil war wins the ensemble super hero film war of 2016 personally i care to see a bit more of a mature theme for much of the mcu think deadpool daredevil  jessica jones considering all these mcu films through whatever phase were in now have been spot on this one is no exception theyve created a world and now its time to tear it down from the foundation batman vs superman dawn of justice was a mess and the xmen age of apocalypse film sits well in its canon but still doesnt have the consistent  narrative and fleshed out in film characters to pack the same punch if you are a fan of the mcu this is the current pinnacle of said achievement
Jul 25 2016,positive,the marvel cinematic universe do it again with an exciting fresh story about the physical and mental conflict between heroes with strong motivations allowing audiences to feel for both sides and become part of their arguments performances on the whole are great as always and chadwick boseman and tom holland are introduced in style the action is filmed incredibly props to the russo brothers which allows and interesting and fast script my only issue is the little time daniel brühl had to prove himself onscreen
Jul 25 2016,neutral,sadly this movie shows the same issues that were brought about with age of ultron too many characters harsh tonal inconsistencies surprisingly underwhelming effects unnecessary shaky cam and weak character motivations make you feel as though were past the peak of comic book movie greatness and are now moving into a saddening decline
Jul 24 2016,positive,excellent action and plot one of the better movies of the marvel series
Jul 24 2016,positive,whoa that was a highly enjoyable action movie compared to avengers age of ultron which was all action and little storyline this had a good balance of the two and was a lot more fun also i really enjoyed the new versions of spiderman and black panther which both felt promising definitely a step in the right direction
Jul 24 2016,positive,quite possibly the best superhero mashup movie ever made
Jul 24 2016,negative,its a shame that they called it civil war it was a far cry from the comics and seemed to just be a ploy to make robert downy jr happy
Jul 24 2016,positive,it was a great movie with tons of superheroes and action the only reason why i did not rate it higher is because it started off slow
Jul 24 2016,positive,good movie but not a great movie
Jul 24 2016,negative,another stupid addition to the marvel franchise that doesnt give other super hero movies a chance
Jul 23 2016,positive,cool if u like marvels characters a lot of them are in here next time you are bored watch this
Jul 23 2016,negative,this is one of the worst movie in the whole yearboring this movie is not great at all its just overrated
Jul 23 2016,neutral,too confusing and all over the place
Jul 23 2016,positive,great story  cap finally gets some depth
Jul 23 2016,positive,absolutely loved it showcasing the greatness of the mcu
Jul 23 2016,positive,one of the best marvel movies to date nearly flawlessly handles the plethora of characters that couldve very easily been a confusing hodgepodge
Jul 23 2016,positive,another excellent movie from marvel studios  the cast was excellent  both spiderman and black panther were excellent additions to the roster  plus team stark kicked captain america and his teams ass  poor cap  he was the loser of his own movie 
Jul 23 2016,positive,i never thought id say this but spiderman was awesome finally somone gets it right no offence to sam raimi but that toby maguire iritated the crap outta me waaaaaaaaaaaaaa wine sum more ya little bitch lame the green goblin was cool though
Jul 23 2016,positive,best comic book movie of the year
Jul 23 2016,positive,my favorite superheroes are batman and superman and saying that i gotta give it to this movie it was much better
Jul 22 2016,positive,great film only knock is that tony starks decisions leading to catastrophic effect is getting more than a little played
Jul 22 2016,negative,boring some really stupid predictable parts storyline garbage bunch of rapid meaningless action sequences sound on special effects weak
Jul 22 2016,positive,almost too many characters to manage but its like another avengers movie if you love marvel movies you cant not love this
Jul 22 2016,positive,great plot great cast enjoyable throughout both positive and negative views on control of the avengers this movie is flawless a masterpiece for marvel
Jul 21 2016,positive,this movie is really good its a perfect blockbuster time is less focused on steve rogers which was disappointing but i can forgive that because the other characters got some attention the action is amazing in this movie go watch it and you will find something to like in it regardless of its problems
Jul 21 2016,positive,there is nothing to say other then the film is perfect it was great seeing black panther and spiderman both for the first time in the mcu together the russo brothers sure know how to deliver the goods and looking forward to seeing them direct the two part avenger movies coming in 2018 and 2019
Jul 21 2016,positive,the shot with cap and iron man holding his shield to stop the repulser beams will go unmatched forever  gets us more comfortable with the characters in an uncomfortable way cant wait to buy this movie
Jul 21 2016,positive,pretty good but it was sort of dragging its feet to the ultimate showdown 75 of the movie talked about how bad it would be to sign an accord and back and forth bickering before the fight time started i think more of the action could have been placed into the movie but im guessing down the road we will see more of the fight getting ready to happen once more marvel movies are released
Jul 21 2016,positive,4th best marvel movie after winter soldier avengers iron man loved the downplayed villain and truly letting the movie be about an avenger civil war instead of having them unite against a common enemy airport fight was great spiderman was great addition thoroughly enjoyed it except that was one of the weakest apology attempts ever
Jul 21 2016,positive,for me the best cap movie to date
Jul 21 2016,positive,one of the best cinema experiences of the year
Jul 20 2016,positive,another near flawless marvel movie to continue the saga almost perfect yet the whole thing felt like the middle of an avengers movie instead of an entire blockbuster film this takes a slight break from the intensity that fans are use too by subtracting a supervillian and having them all fight amongst themselves it was a new interesting concept but slightly lacked the same adrenaline rush that some of the other avengers movies had no sign of hulk or thor but surprise cameos from antman and a bizarre choice of an unknown face for the new spiderman
Jul 20 2016,positive,great super hero fun
Jul 20 2016,neutral,way to much talking the trailer showed the action scenes nothing special
Jul 20 2016,positive,amazing  just amazing from the action packed fight scenes to the character development and introduction  the film nails it all  there are of course plotholes and coincides but as that happens in every film nowadays   focusing on the story is more important than nitpicking aspects  the villain wasnt necessary because in each team they see the other team as villains in their way  but still not pushing the limit of a kill  wich for me was necessary to make a 5 ou 5  but returning to villain  he is great  not super powered  just using his skills and pacience  brought more damage to the team than any other villain  his plan is confusing  but makes sence at the end where all the pieces come together   so i rated a 45 out 5  not a 5 beacuse of not having a casualtie  a few plotholes  and not much iconic music  for me it was good but not enough
Jul 20 2016,positive,the darkest more mature and complex marvel chapter so far captain america civil war brings both old and new superheroes to a breathtaking battle that opens a new phase for the franchise
Jul 20 2016,positive,of all the series in the greater marvel cinematic universe im still surprised that captain america is arguably the strongest this gets veers closer to being a popcorn muncher action flick then the social commentary of the last but at the end of the day it progresses the greater meta narrative
Jul 20 2016,negative,civil war  civil disobedience maybe  a couple of characters stand for something and the rest just play along simply because they were asked  a big battle breaks out and its comedy hour at the apollocute  they seem more interested in not hurting each other  once again marvel fails to deliver a villain thats not turned into a punch line  not much for a musical score which is typical of marvel so far  music helps create mood or tension but in marvels case it might distract from a punch line if sony had made a movie with that spiderman suit without the help of marvel the marvel fanboy collective groan could have been heard from outerspace  fanboys convinced themselves they like it because marvel can do no wrong starks mommydaddy issues arent any worse than bvs mommy issues  how long has this ridiculous plot been planned with bucky killing his mom and dad  im getting bored with this bucky character where are they going with him  marvel played it safe again  could have killed off hawkeye or black widow  they dont even have the intestinal fortitude to kill rhodes  the final battle was the only good thing about this movie but they stopped short of doing anything that might upset a few fanboys  captain america civil war  ages 812
Jul 20 2016,negative,winter soldier was awesome  not sure what happened here i didnt like it
Jul 20 2016,positive,after being detached from the marvel universe for a while this movie reignited my inner nerd and the writers have done a fantastic job at differentiating the members in team cap and team iron man which allowed me to understand the plot pretty easily kudos to the team for bringing black panther ant man and spiderman  into the action and this definitely drew more people to the cinema the only bummer was the overly fast paced relationship development between peggy and steve their relationship is allaround awkward but im not complaining too much it was about time for cap to get a little action  love love love this film
Jul 20 2016,positive,a few days agoi watched this film with my friend    the story is about some superheroes that fight with other superheroes  because the government wants to limit the superheroes so the  superheroes separate into two teams one agrees to be limited by the  governmentand the other team disagrees    i like this film because its the first time superheroes fight with  other superheroesand the fight is excitingand i was hooked by the  story     i recommend everyone to watch this film
Jul 19 2016,positive,awesome amazing one of my favorites and really hoping evans comes back for a 4th captain movie right now these are my favorites in the marvel verse story is great acting really good the new characters came out really well i think i saw it about 3 times in the theater
Jul 19 2016,neutral,captain america civil war is a normal superhero blockbuster with a good  special effects and a solid cast but is not enough to win a place on the podium
Jul 19 2016,positive,best superhero movie ever civil war is an action packed fun film i also think tom holland is the best spiderman ever
Jul 19 2016,neutral,a mediocre movie with predictable plot points and a stupid story
Jul 19 2016,positive,about  the  movie  hoe get
Jul 19 2016,positive,another great marvel movie i feel they did a better job with this civil war story than the comics did i just wish there was more heroes in the movie
Jul 19 2016,positive,with some truly impressive action and a spectacular ensemble of characters captain america civil war is one of the most enjoyable films that marvel studios has to offer
Jul 18 2016,positive,absolutely amazing exactly what i expected and more
Jul 18 2016,positive,basically a full avengers movie slick fast funny
Jul 18 2016,positive,not a huge fan of the consistent changing of spidey this one does a good job but for me isnt ageappropriate
Jul 18 2016,positive,love captain america hes my favorite marvel hero after spiderman
Jul 18 2016,positive,great characters great action  my favourite marvel movie yet
Jul 18 2016,positive,this was just a good movie it wasnt the best movie in comic book history but it was good the plot was unique but predictable a bet overratedyes a bit formulaicyes but thats what fans of this marvel universe love so much so this is spot on for marvel
Jul 18 2016,positive,brutal engaging and ultimately very touching civil war isnt marvels best but its certainly close
Jul 18 2016,positive,about as close to perfect as you can get
Jul 17 2016,positive,loved it really answered a lot of loop holes in the saga
Jul 17 2016,negative,a movie that focuses more on the civil than the war civil war is a movie that tried to keep the family friendly aspects that are now so common in these disney marvel movies they fail with an incoherent plot that relies on knowing the critics will give it a good review because its a marvel film the villain has such a terrible plan that could of only been even close to successful if you looked a few pages ahead in the script  the endless amount of quips from almost all characters not just spiderman and scott lang as a very big fan of the winteretardation soldier its clear this wasnt a russo brothers film but instead the marvel executives making a movie that could pander and make money from even toddlers  the excessive plot holes and disregard of characters actions in previous films cant be made up with some subpar action scenes
Jul 17 2016,negative,rooted and defended the film on imbd threads  finally saw it  i was so wrong    this is not the best marvel movie ever  winter soldier is the best
Jul 17 2016,positive,captain america civil war continues what was left off from captain america winter soldier  steve rogerscapts chris evans hunts for his long life best friend bucky barnes aka winter soldier  sebastian shan in between that time comes his duties as an avenger member   it returns the russo brothers  joe and anthony  who brilliantly directed the last capt america film  winter soldier     the leading big difference between winter vs civil war  besides the added superheroes of course is the cinematography  particularly the camera work during the fighting choregraphy scenes quite frankly i was quite annoyed by the shakyjittery jumpy camera work in the early part of the film     i did like one scene where it displayed of an early youthful tony stark robert downey jr  the trick photography was impressive and this part was significant because it played a big important part at the climatic end of the film     normally i would have been anxious to hear downeys usual zany charismatic tony stark character in either avengerscapt america or iron man film because of his oddly entertaining sense of humor but he was somewhat 99 seriousside only in this one and for the first time seemed misplaced i guess they didnt want stark character to overpower the steve rogers character    speaking of capt america  this film seemed more like an avengers movie than it was a capt america film not just because of the mass super beings in this one but such was made so much about the government involved civil war that not enough seemed as appealing and directed to the rogersbucky factor one group believes in protecting lives and mankind at all costs another believes there should be government control new rules and limitations on engaging the conflict and leaves it up to you to decide which side of the coin to go with     i did like the image and emergence of the black panther even wonderfully done by chadwick boseman the way  tchalla was brought into the foreign fray was ideal he was relentless and charming even in his pursue for revenge for the demise of his closest relative in fact it was set up such that there could be a path way for a future panther solo film down the road his battle with bucky and capt america would have been a lot enjoyable if not for russos intent on the shaky camera works      civil war features a slick cunning villain albeit no superhuman powers but to me there wasnt much appeal and intrigue to the baron zemo character daniel bruhl who is tracking down secret highly classified hydra documents to gain vital information that he thinks he can use to manipulate the winter soldier program that will help him topple an empire     actually what was thought to be impressive plan by zemo with the possibility of multiple wintersoldiers ended up disappointing my high expectation up for a soon happening  such as these  supersoldiers  being pitted against any and all incoming avengers  but it never materialized sigh     sorry but i continue to think that jeremy renners hawkeye is easily the most boring character of all the avengers   besides his variety of special weapon arrows i just dont find him the least bit appealing     theres the emergence of a spiderman appearance  en route to a future spiderman upcoming film  but i didnt get  a wow vibe for spidey  why did it seem like been there and done that  already and i wasnt left with an impression that the next spidey movie featuring tom holland would be any different than the past amazing spidey movies  also it was unclear on how stark discovered peter parkers identity       although im beginning to like what the scarlet witch elizabeth olsen is bringing to the avengerslike films im still somewhat the opposite for the vision paul bettany  theres nothing appealing about his cyborg personality that would make me want to crave even more to see him and have him even more involved in future films   black widow  scarlet johasson was puzzling confusing to a degree at one time she ever bit for stark and team iron man but just in a snap of the finger she instantly becomes team capt america    theres also the falcon  anthony mackie  antman paul rudd       with capt a civil war i didnt get near the same flow pace and wow factor as i got with  capt a winter soldier which didnt seem to let up and it help having some real close calls and easily far more clearer in its fighting choreography and camera work than civil war      what made up and gave it a rebound was the awesome epic civil war faceoff showdown at the airport betwixt team captain america  capt america scarlet witch winter soldier falcon antman  vs team iron man iron man war machine black widow spiderman hawkeye vision  one of the two times where the shaky camera work settled and subsided enough where i could finally see the fighting action  and choreography much clearly and to see the mixture and blend of superpowers and strategic counterattacking against another superhuman powered group with acrobats shrinking to gigantic chasing targetaiming brilliant hand to hand combat bionic vs spiderypowers flying dronegadgets skyair maneuvers etc theres even the awkward oneliner  sense of humor that is known to come with zany characters like ant man and spiderman    and all this and even without thor or the incredible hulk being present in this movie  the big fight was made out to be everything it was advertised to be and easily the most enjoyable scene   something can be made for the final battle at the films end between the 2 group leaders iron mancapt america and bucky winter soldier with a puzzling twist at the end to set it on fire that one on two battle     as with most marvel films  stay put until the lights come on  there are futureclips at the beginning of the credits as well as at the very end of the credits so do please stay put      coming away from capt america civil war  i have to say though it has its flaws  i still enjoyed it  but i thought it was a good film that could have been a great film  despite the much added superheroes included in this one in the epic airport battle it wasnt up to the level of capt america winter soldier imo   still do recommend it in dubiously      on a scale of 1 to 10  id give capt america civil war 80
Jul 17 2016,positive,entertaining and high budget
Jul 16 2016,positive,captivating and thrilling the whole way through civil war does a brilliant job of introducing fantastic characters to the mcu and balancing a great storyline along the way never has a marvel movie been this good
Jul 16 2016,positive,this is by far the best marvel movie of all time its action packed funny has a great story thats similar enough to the comic also black panther and the new spider man are awesome and funny and if youve seen all the films that have both iron man  captain america seeing them brutally beat each other can almost make you cry its just an over all great movie on every front 
Jul 16 2016,positive,marvel tapped some new material here  very entertaining and thoughtprovoking for the genre
Jul 16 2016,positive,what an awesome movie ive held out seeing these for so long because im not always the most interested in superhero movies i am so glad i gave this a shot a little slow in the beginning but once it picked up oh man what a fun ride i really liked seeing all the superheroes working together and i especially liked the addition of the new spiderman oh man his quirky humor and talkative nature made it fun plus my heart was racing during the epic all out battle in the middle i mean every single superhero fighting against each other what more could you ask for it was also cool seeing everyone divided and fighting against each other but seriously to bring all these different superheroes into one movie awesome love it
Jul 16 2016,positive,the minor plot holes keep it from being truly perfect but the russo brothers have crafted an unforgettable film and it will be recognized as one of marvels finest
Jul 16 2016,positive,the movie captures a great rivalry between captain america and iron man portrays spiderman almost perfectly chadwicks role as black panther highly impresses me the russos have balanced a good distance between steve and tony
Jul 16 2016,positive,best captain america movie best avengers movie went with a friend who hasnt liked any marvel movie and he loved it great film
Jul 16 2016,positive,iron man got beat up
Jul 16 2016,positive,as the comic book juggernaut pun not intended continues to grow there are going to be numerous comparisons between movies as they come out and how much better this film was over that one a film should be allowed to stand on its own even though i am going to be writing a special comparison between this film and the clash film from the other publisher after the mediocrity that was age of ultron captain america civil war has the ability to continue the greatness of the winter solider it doesnt have to stand on the remains of the film before it even though civil war plays more like an avengers sequel this is captain americas story         as the film begins the world is angry after the massive collateral damage thats occurred in the battles of the avengers tony stark robert downey jr faced with the real life cost of their wars spearheads the idea of the avengers to be monitored and controlled by the government of course this splits the avengers into two camps which is going to happen when such a revolutionary idea is placed upon a group of people this is coupled to the fact that captain america chris evans has the added stress of finding and helping his friend bucky barnes sebastian stan aka the winter soldier as the story progresses we learn that there is a puppet master pulling the strings on the situation continuously driving a wedge between the already fractured avengers          civil war is what a great movie should be the film takes the audience for a ride literally and emotionally we travel the world as this characters many of whom we grew up with since we were children build for their cause its these same characters that cause us as an audience to finally choose a side in the ultimate confrontation that builds throughout the film its an experience that sucks you in and involves you in the action thats happening up on the screen a hallmark of any good film in a world flooded with comic book films this film will be one that stands out         this film has everything in place and gels in every way and is currently the one stand out in a summer movie season that seems to be more about malaise than masterpieces obviously there will be more films and civil war makes me want to see them the film made me want to go back and check out what i missed antman review coming soon a stunning film in a bloated market
Jul 16 2016,positive,absolutely phenomenal fun dramatic and touching  with great tone variety and range civil war is both enjoyable and intriguing by being a deconstruction of heeroes we have known for 8 years    you have never seen avengers at their lowest and the mcu have never been in the highest
Jul 15 2016,positive,once again was worth a price of admission
Jul 15 2016,positive,best superhero film of all time
Jul 15 2016,positive,captain america civil war is one of the best marvel movies ever the thought of some of the best marvel heroes fighting each other is unbelievable this movie ties together the best movies these movies contain the iron   man series ant man the captain america movies and reveals the new spiderman  i would recommend this movie to anyone
Jul 15 2016,positive,i might have seen to many of these to be dazzled it all looks fake and contrived
Jul 15 2016,positive,love all the new marvel flicks this one was also good but too many holes in the plot line kept me from being able to immerse myself in the fantasy
Jul 15 2016,positive,firsttimers to the series may get lost but dedicated fans will be treated to an intelligent characterdriven film with spectacular action
Jul 15 2016,positive,great movie its amazing i loved it i cant wait for the next avengers movie it keeps you wondering where its going to go
Jul 15 2016,positive,it was good my kids enjoyed it this genre is starting to fray for me
Jul 15 2016,positive,i thought this film was quite well done and very different from the previous captain america films  i didnt think it had the same focus and development for captain america that winter soldier did but thats obviously due to the fact that there are a lot more characters in this film to deal with  given so many characters i thought it was balanced fairly well  the major focus was still on cap and bucky from the franchise sharing with tony stark but i thought the smaller stories were told well the scarlet witchs guilt story visions development all fairly brief but well done  i especially have to say that i thought black panthers introduction was done tremendously well and this film and story was a great opportunity to introduce him  i think that was one of the best parts of this film  spidermans introduction was a little shakier in this film but once he got in costume he was an incredibly entertaining part of the movie  i really enjoyed tony starks development in the film building on his previous appearances and going back into his past with his parents  i had a sinking feeling through the whole movie of how that was going to tiein to winter soldier and that hunch proved correct  i really like the climax of the film as it came about very unexpected  it seemed very standard the goodguys fight each other but see the error of their ways and team up to fight the villain at the end  but they walk into that base and that turns on its ear so fast and so well and we get the real fight that everyone was expecting  i thought that was really well done  all in all i think civil war tries to pack a little bit much in and feels like a bit of a behemoth but for all that it still delivers and i really enjoyed it
Jul 15 2016,positive,this movie was nearly flawless just an amazing masterpiece for marvel i dont think i can say anything that hasnt already been said everything in it was just awesome and i loved every second there is no reason to not like this movie its the best comic book movie of all time 1010
Jul 15 2016,positive,as close as you will get to the perfect comicbook eventcrossover simply brilliant and balanced expertly
Jul 14 2016,positive,like a fine wine marvel gets better with age

Jul 14 2016,positive,fun action packed and perfect  all you need to know
Jul 14 2016,positive,captain america civil war is a movie that will emerge you back into your inner child
Jul 14 2016,positive,from best action movies i have ever seen  trust me you must watch it and youll enjoy
Jul 14 2016,positive,in contrast to last months gritty frustrating nonsensical dc hammer blow civil war is a powerhouse showcasing great character development motives and ideologies you understand as they have been built up over 7 films my only real negative not even that is with marvel films plots starting consistently showcase villainsbig bads of the movie being direct results of a specific characters actions such as ultron being created by starks mistakes simply as so far if the heros didnt exist thered be no problems but the way they use this to set up the final battle is really interesting and totally new steynton end it on in all best marvel movie yetcould well be
Jul 14 2016,neutral,captain american or i like to say ironman 4 civil war is very well made comic book movie but it plays it too safe in a time where more risks should be taken
Jul 13 2016,positive,best movie everi love captain america so muchit was like omgmy new favorite movie
Jul 13 2016,negative,eh 2nd movie best so far
Jul 13 2016,positive,overall a pretty good movie
Jul 13 2016,positive,phase three of the marvel cinematic universe kicks off with a bang in the form of one of the series best films yet
Jul 13 2016,positive,the best of them yet  what can touch this in its genre  nothing
Jul 13 2016,positive,a fun superhero showdown
Jul 13 2016,positive,not on par with the winter soldier but it comes pretty damn close
Jul 13 2016,positive,i gave the third cap movie a rare 5 star because it was simply an amazing movie the characters were great the intense drama was intertwined with hilarious jokes the action sequences were flawless the only downside was the villain zemo although he was not the comic book adaptation that loyal marvel fans anticipated he was still the witty character we have all grown to love his plan was a little unrealistic but how it played in with the story was just perfect cant wait for the next marvel movie
Jul 13 2016,positive,captain america civil war
Jul 13 2016,positive,having the idea of an incredible film like this is one thing knowing how to put the ideas together to create your masterpiece is another   captain america civil war was a well written well directed and well put together masterpiece  dawn of justice is an example of a potential masterpiece a wonderful idea but terribly put together  with captain america civil war a crowded canvas doesnt really matter civil war was a creative idea and well painted this is a masterpiece  i rate it a 45 rather than a 55 something was missing a major ingredient made this film seem cluttered or overcrowded  civil war is a mustsee for comic fans or at least  people who watched the other marvel movies to understand it
Jul 13 2016,positive,an awesome movie the best mcu movie after winter soldier thank u russo brothers
Jul 13 2016,positive,better than i had hoped
Jul 12 2016,positive,this movie made me so happy and i loved it so much its a great film and i think all of you should see it oh and spiderman was awesome cannot wait for his next movie
Jul 12 2016,positive,this movie is everything that the mcu has ever tried to be it shows that even though you dont have those godly characters you can still have a movie that is action packed captain america civil war has the grittiest action we have ever seen in the mcu this gets me very excited for what is next in the marvel cinematic universe
Jul 12 2016,positive,great movie awesome charactersspiderman is the best part
Jul 11 2016,positive,very solid film that will keep audiences entertained to the end
Jul 11 2016,positive,it should have been called captain america avengers 3 because thats what it seemed like  incredible from start to finish it gives just enough time to all the characters and leaves you begging for more even after the 2 and a quarter hours of movie    well worth the imax price
Jul 11 2016,negative,bad movie spiderman was only added as a cash grab terrible villain
Jul 11 2016,negative,overrated  this was not the best marvel movie  winter soldier is the best marvel movie so far  its not even close to matching rating of predecessor
Jul 11 2016,positive,hey everyone spiderman voice    this is by far the best superhero movie yet i put the word yet at the end of the sentence because im still waiting and looking forward to suicide squad and other superhero movie that hasnt been released yet although im a dc and a marvel fan this movie is the one i enjoyed the most    the movie starts off nicely building the scenes for the main event the characters are well put together tom holland as spiderman is as great a spiderman is in the comic book and black panther is also good the cgi is also great i really cant add any insight on this cause ive been sucked into the movie and hardly any focus on it although the villain is not that good it hasnt affected the movie overall the actions are great the best action scene that ive seen in a movie 1010 the airport scene is the most spectacular thing that happened youre always at the edge of your sit the plot is great theres this clip that will horrendously trigger something at the end    this is really a great sequel to the captain america franchise or maybe the best marvel superhero movie to date
Jul 11 2016,positive,this movie good just good nothing really special about it the action was good the acting was okay the writing felt okay and the phasing good the only thing it gets a 35 stars are two reason black panther and spider man these characters stole the show with pure awesomeness i do have to say spiderman had a little more of a personality both were handeld perfectly but it doesnt exuse the movie for being just goodokay
Jul 11 2016,positive,might be a bit biased as captain america is my favorite marvel super hero but this movie was amazing some cried about lack of action and plot but it was their and fit in the context of the story and characters
Jul 11 2016,positive,its action packed theres drama beteewn both sides and the best spiderman weve seen yuu will never get board
Jul 10 2016,positive,this is a near masterpiece
Jul 10 2016,positive,great movie the ca line of movies continue to be my favorite super hero movies
Jul 10 2016,positive,civil war begins with political pressure to limit the avengers on what they can do due to the collateral damage they have caused steve rogers doesnt want these changes to be implemented but tony stark does so when the avengers break apart and pick different sides and the internal conflict begins between friends this film is dark suspenseful and action packed the introduction of the black panther and spiderman really add to an already great film
Jul 10 2016,positive,captain america civil war couldve won a 55 but heres why it didnt  spectacular cgi phenomenal acting good writing among other things prove why captain america civil war could potentially be one of the best films this year has to  offer but it doesnt due to the repetitive character writing marvel not every character in your films needs to be a comedian and drop a joke every 3 seconds you can do light hearted films without it being nonstop quips and jokes although this movie gets very dark  in conclusion captain america civil war without a single doubt is worth the price of admission that fans of the comics and newcomers to the films alike can enjoy
Jul 10 2016,positive,everything was amazing except the interpretation of robert downey jr because he neded more humor
Jul 10 2016,positive,ant man and spiderman earned this movie an extra star  the best captain america movie
Jul 10 2016,positive,even the 13 th installment of marvel cinematic universe was totally marvellous marvel rocks
Jul 10 2016,neutral,one of the worst movie of marvel i have ever seen
Jul 9 2016,positive,not being a huge superhero movie fan i can honestly say that this movie was extremely entertaining and fun
Jul 9 2016,negative,long boring slow plotstory even more complicated and all over the place the bvs disneymarvel made this movie just to sell toys and video games not a very good movie at all pretty much no story in this one
Jul 9 2016,positive,this movie is amazing it is full of action
Jul 9 2016,positive,look im not a marvel fan in any sense of the word but even i can appreciate how good this movie was definitely the best marvel movie ive seen and it goes without saying the best captain america movie
Jul 9 2016,negative,is this tony stank terrible writing is that suppose to be funny
Jul 9 2016,positive,good movie but would been a 5 star with thor and hunk love spiderman and antman part in this movie
Jul 9 2016,positive,boom boom boom   best movie ever so much action
Jul 9 2016,positive,this movie has it all great characters emotional moments funny moments and great action sequences and who doesnt love spiderman and black panther
Jul 9 2016,positive,loved it cant wait for more mcu films
Jul 9 2016,positive,hard to see these guys fight each other but the story  acting and message were courageous and daring but there was a respectful presentation of very current ideas
Jul 9 2016,positive,i love seeing a different take on tony stark
Jul 9 2016,positive,fantastic great balance of character development humor  and felt fresh and new still even though its the teenth in the series
Jul 9 2016,positive,one of best of marvel but it was too busy in midle of the film
Jul 8 2016,positive,amazing chris and robert were absolutely amazing they have you on the edge of your seat and those fight scenes were epic not forgetting the helicopter scene other than that i do think just because this is a major movie adaption it should be allowed to have lgbt relationships steve and bucky have a lot of chemistry and to be honest a relationship between them is 10000x better than the one they tried to make happen
Jul 8 2016,positive,awesome touch good job
Jul 8 2016,positive,the war that i was waiting for battle between friends it was well worth it we just need more heroes
Jul 8 2016,positive,amazing movie it made all of my geek fantasies come true i just feel like some parts of the plot were a tad too convenient and some of the jokes fell flat but other than that amazing
Jul 8 2016,negative,hollywood cliche from start to finish snoozeville
Jul 8 2016,negative,there is a civil war story and this is not it  grown adults in costumes pulverize one another over freedom or compromise  robert downey jr does all he can to elevate this comic fare to resemble reality  marvel does stick the landing on spidey this time  pass  see instead dark man xmen dick tracy
Jul 8 2016,positive,great movie i cant wait to add this one to my 3d movie collection
Jul 8 2016,positive,so good i went back to watch it 2 more times
Jul 7 2016,positive,your classic marvel movie yes its big yes its loud yes its just like any other marvel movie the formula for these movie seem to never vary its almost a perfect recipe for success but at some point you have to ask yourself have i seen this before and yes the answer is yes with that being said great special effects and really unique new characters
Jul 7 2016,positive,gives a great feeling ive only ever felt since the winter soldier really strong throughout with great action pieces and surprises aplenty
Jul 7 2016,positive,one of the best superhero movies out there the airport fight was just awesome spidy was the best part black panther got full marks w casting tonys past was touching great action flick as well i loved black widow for the first time her look body language was more confident in this outing i wasnt disappointed w scarlet witch  tony just a great watch
Jul 7 2016,positive,civil war is an action centric and character driven movie with a strong emphasis on the moral questions surrounding the nature of the avengers the narrative while being fairly well written and excellently paced unfortunately lacks the explanation of events to the audience
Jul 7 2016,positive,what can i say that hasnt been said marvel is killing it
Jul 7 2016,positive,wow that all i got to say
Jul 7 2016,positive,the movie was okay except everytime they punched each other they said sorry wtf there supposed to be beating each other to a bloody pulp also they should have got a better actor for spiderman
Jul 7 2016,negative,i am a marvel fan since 2008  batman v superman storyline was better than civil war     bvs cinematography might have been terrible  but still for me it is all about a good story  i have already watched it 2 times  i just cant want to watch civil war a second time
Jul 7 2016,positive,hey zack snyder this
Jul 7 2016,positive,good movie saw it last night the bad part was when iron man pal died because as a boy i loved iron man
Jul 7 2016,positive,i realise we are just over halfway through the year the this was hands down movie of the year
Jul 6 2016,positive,spiderman was lame i would rather see tas andrew was excellent i also rated 55 bvs
Jul 6 2016,positive,intensly thrilling the whole time
Jul 6 2016,positive,45 stars  the ever expanding marvel universe is embroiled in conflict and great care is taken in navigating the busy playing field an expertly crafted story fueled by incredible action and exciting new characters makes for a fantastic superhero entry the climactic clash between captain americas and ironmans opposing teams is an absolute knockout favourite performance tom holland as peter parkerspiderman
Jul 6 2016,negative,this movie is for 10 year olds  not for adults      civil war did not live up to its title  just a bunch of camera cut playful  cheesy fighting scenes  no one died  no deaths anywhere  xmen at least has deaths gore and kills   civil war my ass
Jul 6 2016,positive,it makes up for age of ultrons mediocrity and adds to the super hero genre which was getting incredibly tired it does a good job juggling all the characters and almost never feels messy
Jul 6 2016,positive,as a movie this was much better compared to batman vs superman you can tell the protagonist and the antagonist apart
Jul 6 2016,positive,great movie with a great battle scene done right they allotted a perfect amount of time for each character during the fight
Jul 6 2016,positive,the film is well paced well made entertaining and funny  it gets you really involved with the characters and makes it difficult to chose a side  but i would have liked to call this film iron man 4
Jul 6 2016,positive,simply incredible a must see at any age
Jul 5 2016,positive,great from start to finish
Jul 5 2016,positive,i took away 12 a star because iron mans actions in the film makes no sense like batman trying to kill superman for no good reason
Jul 5 2016,positive,great action sequences but do we need to show good guys fighting against good guys  think of better story lines
Jul 5 2016,positive,i being the only one didnt like spiderman all that much because he was sidelined
Jul 5 2016,negative,way too long boring at points too many movies in one
Jul 5 2016,positive,as a huge comicbook fan and a person that loved this moviei say that you cant give cacw 90 and bvs around 30especially after the uc bvs became a much better movie than it once wascw was a good moviemaybe marvels bestbut i dont think it deserve 90we all know that spiderman stole the showhe was the man that everyone lovedtom did a great job portraying spiderman
Jul 5 2016,positive,i finally watched civil war this weekend and was surprised i enjoyed it more than i expected i know the capt america films have had a lot of good reviews more so than the last avengers but ive been bothered by the whole aspect of how violent the avengers have been just easily killing their foes like all of the soldiers i understand they are saving lives but a hero is not supposed to kill aside from the hulk the others should have more control i also understand caps issue of not letting the government control them because who knows what they would use the avengers for i like how the issues are related to what is going on with the violence around the world i also really liked all the characters including the new ones and love ant man the battle scenes were intense
Jul 5 2016,positive,captain america civil war is amazing this is the best captain america and superhero movie yet the plot of this movie is awesome this movie is actionpacked surprising and very entertaining marvel has done an amazing job with this movie i would very much suggest this movie
Jul 4 2016,positive,awesome action packed marvel movie
Jul 4 2016,positive,this film was everything batman v superman dawn of justice should have been for the dc universe captain america civil war was absolutely fantastic unforgettable and defining for the mcu     this film is just the right amount of action and drama and also had fabulous acting by both chris evans and robert downey jr a great part of this spectacle was the use of avengers that do not always get the spotlight like scarlet witch vision war machine black widow and the new spiderman captain america civil war is a film to be excited  for and a film that gets fans excited for the upcoming additions to the mcu i cannot wait to see what comes next
Jul 4 2016,positive,the best of the summer blockbuster films a little darker than ca the winter soldier this movie lives up to its hype and is one of the better entries in the marvel cinematic universe
Jul 4 2016,positive,another homerun by marvel
Jul 4 2016,positive,captain america   marvel movie   enough said
Jul 4 2016,positive,so flipping awesome i couldnt handle the action
Jul 4 2016,positive,excellent movie great action sequences amazing story all around an incredible film
Jul 4 2016,positive,was never a fan of superhero movies but this is a fun time if you like superhero movies you will like this
Jul 4 2016,neutral,please replace scarlett with emily blunt whos marvels first choice for black widow i dunno but scarlett just doesnt look convincing in action roles and doesnt do justice to black widow props to scarletts stunt double the real black widow
Jul 4 2016,positive,absolutely the best marvel movie after avengers 2 groups going against each other over brotherhood captain willing to save one of his brother and leave his team after that they became friends again i dont think i ever saw a movie like that in my life where a group of teams works together but divided over a issue and later reconnects its so worth it to watch it again
Jul 3 2016,positive,holds up really well  if not the best hero movie has to be in most top ten   interesting in repeat viewing to see shell of winter soldier driven story without civil war part
Jul 3 2016,positive,the best fight scene of all time this is marvel best film to date
Jul 3 2016,negative,face it disneys mcu franchise is for the children  disney is not brainwashing me  civil war is one big dumb kids movie  adults need to grow up
Jul 3 2016,positive,my favorite movie of all time this movie was perfect the pace of it i cant complain the story was nicely told the way they introduce new characters to the avengers is just perfect great action scenes very exciting movie i highly recommend this movie to anyone seeking excitement in a movie
Jul 3 2016,positive,even friends can be your biggest enemies    captain america civil war is behind iron man winter soldier and guardians of the galaxy of being the best movie in the marvel cinematic universe or mcu for short the movie has its flaws but that doesnt stop me from liking it i dont know about you but the captain america series are the only movies in the mcu that actually get better with its squeals the action the effects the humor the characters and its stunt work has improved from the first movie    what this movie dose so well is that its really hard to pick a side because both sides have a very good reason to be at each others throats one minute im rooting for tony and the next im rooting for cap its conflict like this that i couldnt decide for myself on who side i was on or who was right but thats just the fun of it    tom holland as spiderman might be one of the best adaption of the character that weve had sony studios has made over five spiderman movies and the two actors who played spiderman maguire and garfield did their very best of what their got but didnt quite capture the character that we know and love but the spiderman in this movie has a screen time of 30 minutes or more and holland managed to capture the character so perfectly that it makes sony studios look lousy he was excellent in the role and i would go as far to say that he was a billion times better than maguire and garfield in my opinion i cant wait to see more of him in spiderman homecoming thats out next year    speaking of good casting  chadwick boseman was pretty damn awesome as black panther boseman can basically play anything and im not kidding you when i say that as he played jackie robinson james brown and now black panther chadwick boseman has some crazy talent and him as black panther was spot on casting im looking forward to seeing his solo film coming out in 2018    if you thought the stunt work in winter soldier was outstanding then wait until you see the stunt work in this movie as it was justincredible all the heavy praise belongs to the stunt team for doing the impossible    now for the problems daniel brühl is a boring villain i honestly cant remember much about his character in the movie and thats because he was pretty forgettable that came across a bit too harsh didnt it it really sucks for me to say that because daniel brühl is great actor and sometimes he can be the saving grace for a movie thats either good or bad he wasnt awful or anything like that its just that i didnt find him treating at all    martin freeman is a great actor and im glad hes getting more meaty roles but he doesnt do anything special or interesting in this movie yes i know his character is probably going to developed more in the next movies but my problem here is that he really felt out of place in this movie at times the movie itself completely forgets about him so every time he popped back up on screen i was like oh martin freeman is in this movie i totally forgot about that but thats just me    the story was a bit meh and there was a little bit too much quick cut edits in the fight scenes that i couldnt get all that infested with now dont get me wrong i like the airport fight and the iron man v cap fight because those scenes didnt have stupid quick cuts and i could easily see whats happening i think its the handtohand combat fights that are too cutter for me to see whats going on thats just my opinion    overall captain america civil war lives up to the hype of being a great superhero movie and being a good movie on its own marvel is having a great track record thus far with the box office success great reviews and many upcoming spin offs civil war is most likely going to win every fanboys heart and its not hard to see why
Jul 3 2016,positive,really good felt more like the avengers civil war though
Jul 3 2016,positive,most amazing  movie ever
Jul 3 2016,positive,filled with outstanding action sequences and a more mature plot than most of the other mcu movies civil war is a thoughtprovoking superhero flick that might be the best marvel movie ive seen yet
Jul 3 2016,positive,marvel movies are always good
Jul 3 2016,negative,big budget big bangs big cgi but ultimately boring intellectually very unstimulating
Jul 3 2016,positive,just like so many other marvel films it was great
Jul 2 2016,positive,its ok any marvel film going to be fun
Jul 2 2016,positive,spiderman was amazing
Jul 2 2016,negative,downey was not very entertaining  this movie is seriously overrated
Jul 2 2016,positive,this was average  tarzan is better than this lol
Jul 2 2016,negative,what boring movie  i cant understand why critics gave it 90
Jul 2 2016,positive,i love the franchise this was definitely tme too much everything but im not going to hold that against them its kind of what you sign up for with the marvel franchise i mean just look how many people are on the poster
Jul 2 2016,negative,generic and boring      critics obviously paid  time to overthrow rotten tomatoes
Jul 2 2016,neutral,and they all live happily together again
Jul 2 2016,negative,dumbing down children and adults intellectual my ass nothing mentally challenging in this superhero movie
Jul 2 2016,negative,this was sooo boring  i was expecting winter soldier quality  instead i got rated g quality
Jul 2 2016,neutral,i hope spiderman homecoming doesnt turn out like this
Jul 2 2016,negative,dumbing down society theory this movie is a good example     reduce the intellectual content of writing to make us more stupid
Jul 2 2016,positive,have a drink loads of popcorn kick back and enjoy more of the same far better than superman v batman
Jul 2 2016,positive,a film that is filled with plot holes but gets a pass because they crack jokes every 30 seconds  vision could have hacked and disabled the jet captain america and winter soldier escaped in also a high security facility doesnt do background checks on a doctor whos about to examine the most dangerous prisoner on the planet
Jul 2 2016,positive,we all know whats good about the movie with a huge ensemble it managed to give each superhero the screen time heshe needed it didnt feel forced at all the 18minute or so airport scene was perhaps the most talked about because of spidermans appearance while thats one explosive fight i didnt feel that there was seriousness in the fight they all held back i thought it was a farce     i thought the best parts of the movies are those that put me through the emotional wringer  the moment iron man finds out the truth about the death of his parents it was intense and powerful
Jul 2 2016,negative,after critics falsely rating ghostbusters with a 75 how can you trust them at this point  this was an average movie for children  finding dory and jungle book was better than this
Jul 2 2016,negative,lol 90  a snore fest
Jul 2 2016,negative,spiderman is annoying
Jul 2 2016,negative,now this is one big gay pun
Jul 2 2016,positive,could have been better
Jul 1 2016,positive,loved it one of my favorite superhero movies the characters are great marvel did it again
Jul 1 2016,positive,i wanted a little more humour between iron man and ant man  also it would have been amazing if they killed of somebody captain america
Jul 1 2016,positive,i thought it was great but tom holland as spider man will be hard to get used to
Jul 1 2016,positive,after watching cacwit now is my favorite mcu movieone of the best marvelyouve done it again
Jul 1 2016,negative,50 rating would have made sense
Jul 1 2016,negative,two hours of action sequences
Jul 1 2016,positive,the movie had everything that a fan like me wanted great action great comedy an interesting story that makes sense and lots of the cap  if you love marvel movies and just love movies in general i would highly recommend that you go and see this movie
Jul 1 2016,neutral,way more dialogue than necessary too many sub stories that ultimately weighed down the movie
Jun 30 2016,negative,immature  this movie was for the kids  deadpool or doctor strange  will be the best marvel movie this year
Jun 30 2016,positive,one of the best and most exiting marvel films to date
Jun 30 2016,positive,one of the best marvel films you will ever see
Jun 30 2016,positive,awesome in my opinion just as good as or better than the avengers movies going through a few different peoples playing the hulk and a few playing spiderman
Jun 30 2016,positive,i loved the movie and thought that it was cool to see all the characters
Jun 30 2016,positive,its no winter soldier but its still pretty darn good
Jun 30 2016,positive,not much to say other than another very well made marvel movie    solid storyline acting cgi
Jun 30 2016,neutral,this movie was not very intriguing even as a marvel fan it felt more like padding to hold us over till infinity war comes out i really had to sit forward in my seat in order to stay awake during the talking sequences and they make up a lot of the movie but the fighting sequences i would even go as far as to say aw inspiring wait for this movie on dvd for seeing because believe me the fighting sequences are worth seeing
Jun 30 2016,positive,diverse cast of characters no hulk 
Jun 30 2016,positive,some parts are really good other parts are predictable
Jun 30 2016,positive,captain america series in this marvel franchise never lets one down regardless of what is going to reveal about the true colour of the captain facepalm he is still the captain for now standing up for righteous cause and true justice and integrity civil war really is a lot better than one had expected and brought in so much laugh
Jun 30 2016,negative,all these critics always seem to praise disneys marvel and trash dc comics lets make it clear please  marvel is for simple people and dc is more aimed at the fans that read and know the story lines and not just about action like marvel does their movies if the critics dont understand the dc story lines then say it and stop trashing the dc movies just because you as a critic are dumb to story all i see are a bunch of biased critics
Jun 29 2016,positive,lived up to all the hype great movie
Jun 29 2016,positive,one wordspectacular this is the pinnacle of what a superhero movie should be one where as an audience member you are able to sympathize with the heroes hopes and beliefs this film does a wonderful job at making both sides captain america and iron man seem right about what they are fighting for if thats not enough the movie perfectly establishes the newer characters into the story without allowing the rest of the movie revolve around them too much to the point where it detracts from the main characters more is revealed about certain characters and their actual connections and it gives the audience a chance to see them at a new light i found myself split on the decision on which team to follow through the entire film this is how you properly create an engaging story about hero vs hero the only flaw that i can see is the abundance of constant fyi for the majority of the action scenes this film shows a bright future for the marvel cinematic universe and i simply cannot wait to see how they top this one
Jun 29 2016,positive,really solid flick not as good as the avengers 1 however but better than the the avengers 2 age of ultron
Jun 29 2016,negative,i really cannot understand the critics here i guess they were reviewing a disney film for kids rather than a marvel franchise film about comic book superheroes the film has good nonstop action but nothing else its full of contrived plot and uncharacteristic behaviour it should have been called an iron man or avengers film none of which i like
Jun 29 2016,positive,captain america civil war not only settles vital moral debates amongst its stellar cast but also assists in setting up future installments and define a new direction for the franchise
Jun 29 2016,positive,a fun actionpacked superhero film that gets confusing at some points
Jun 29 2016,positive,best marvel movie in the mcu yet
Jun 29 2016,positive,so basically civil war is a tale of revenge from four different perspectives the first part where capt and the gang are trying to stop rimlow from winter soldier from obtaining a vile containing a deadly virus this is a quick fight to start the movie and of course ends with some civilian casualties partly because of scarlet witch the second tale of revenge involves black panther who is really prince tchalla who lost his father in a bombing that is meant to frame bucky winter soldier which is a part of the design to start tearing the avengers apart from the inside the final tale of revenge involves zemo daniel bruhl who lost family in the sokovia attack iron man age of ultron and is the mastermind at trying to create the civll war between the avengers i must say this movie was very good but missy and i agreed not quite as good as winter soldier the one thing i really liked about this flick is how some of the things played out i never really liked the idea of good guys fighting each other so the fact that this movie kind of plays out as a draw is superb for me i know there is still a long road ahead where we may actually see some superhero casualties but for now i like this film as is and although i thought for sure war machine and scarlet witch were going to bite it that did not happen       i thought black panther was awesome great great character and am looking forward to seeing his debut film when it gets released ant man was good as expected and although spiderman had some funny moments i kind of felt like he really wasnt needed as he just seemed really out of place in this flick i did like the tiein with the woman who plays the warden from suicide squad making an appearance and will be interested how they continue to tie that together the only thing that really bugs me about this movie is just how gullible iron man really is for a man who is incredibly smart stark fell for the governments pity party for civilian casualties being the fault of the avengers when in reality the death count would be much higher without the avengers this is further proven as they all buy automatically in to the idea that winter soldier was being the vienna attack the final revenge factor involves iron man and winter soldier and to some extent is understandable from starks position but at the same time the fact that stark knewknows why bucky is the way he is you would think that would raise a red flag in his mind that bucky wasnt himself when he committed his crimes so from that angle i just think that team iron man was a tad bit to gullible in thinking that the avengers should be blamed for any casualties since there is no way to guarantee everyones safety when trouble arises       in the end i see some of what shake mentioned about the storyline angle but i do think it comes back to the type of characters and the actors who portray them bvs still has some time to grow as it is just kind of kicking off but the persona of the characters in cacw just massively crush it out of the park for me there is just too much to like with these films and im not sure if bvs will ever really be able to compete with it but as i said there is still time with future endeavors in the works for that saga the easter egg at the end was cool as well but doesnt really set anything up other than change leadership of the avengers over to iron man there was a reason i was team ca before seeing this and it never wavered during or after the film      910
Jun 29 2016,positive,great marvel flick the series was wearing on me and i thought they were running out of ideas this wouldve been a perfect avengers movie cant wait to own it
Jun 29 2016,neutral,not really good as a whole should maybe have changed the captain america civil war to captain america v iron man marvel here is just making an extra billion before showing off the last 2 marvel legend showdown
Jun 28 2016,negative,watch the child heroes
Jun 28 2016,positive,awesomedownload a must
Jun 28 2016,positive,a real thrill ride that felt more fleshed out then avengers  it spoke to collateral damage and the consequences of their actions which is a topic i have never seen in a superhero movie before  bravo
Jun 28 2016,positive,best of the marvel movies done yet as good if not better than both averaged movies a must see and one for your home movie collection
Jun 28 2016,negative,the movie was great but it seamed more like the avengers
Jun 28 2016,positive,the movie dares to look into the consequences of super powered battles  very well done
Jun 28 2016,negative,movie is way too long and too much talking i felt asleep twice good part of the movie is where they fight each other but it is not fight to the death kind of fight everyone held back their power so at the end it feels shallow and gimmick
Jun 28 2016,positive,absolutely loved this movie it had a bit of everything i cant really say there was anything that i didnt like about it
Jun 27 2016,negative,did nothing for me at all  worst one yet  seems like captain america was just mad that iron man ate his last cookie or something
Jun 27 2016,positive,great action packed movie
Jun 27 2016,positive,not as good as the second one pretty good story and nice special effect it will build up to the next avengers movie i cant wait
Jun 26 2016,positive,not overthetop funny but definitely has its humor in the right places serious when it needs to be not drab  loved how well they gave each character appropriately allocated screen time with just enough detail for each to make sense a hard task to do with so many characters to keep up with
Jun 26 2016,neutral,the only good part about this movie was when they actually fought each other and when tony stark recruited spiderman
Jun 26 2016,positive,civil war is like a nice italian dinner you walk away satisfied and licking your lips  enough fighting to keep the kids 7 entertained enough depth to keep the adults glued to the screen
Jun 26 2016,positive,it was one of the best marvel movies i saw in my life the one thing that bothered me was the fight scenes at the beginning the camera work was so bad at that point it was super shaky and i couldnt even see what was happening but the shakiness got better after the first fight scene every other fight scenes had better camera work the story board is brilliant its incredible i love this movie
Jun 26 2016,positive,awesome but didnt blow my mind kinda predictable
Jun 26 2016,positive,easily the best mcu movie to date  it does what bvs did not do respect the source material and tell a straight forward story  all the characters had their moments to shine but spiderman antman and black panther really stole the show in this one  it really got me excited for a new spiderman movie and a black panther movie  the only weakness of the movie was the overall villain but he was okay
Jun 26 2016,positive,meh probably the worst of the avenger super hero series thus far a few good scenes
Jun 26 2016,positive,you are a fool if you do not see this movie the action the twist everything about this movie is amazing it answered a lot of question but also opened new ones makes me excited for the other movies to come out seriously you need to see this movie in order to understand previous movies the marvel movies are all connected so do not just watch one and call it a night
Jun 26 2016,neutral,once again a marvel film relies on relentless fight scenes to make a film the story line is there but lifeless i fell asleep twice
Jun 26 2016,positive,this was a great marvel movie they did a great job integrating the many other characters i loved the new spiderman and hope they make a spiderman movie worthy of him for once i have faith in marvel
Jun 26 2016,negative,left the theatre early way way way too long slowmoving plot
Jun 26 2016,positive,one of the best marvel movies this far maybe as good as winter solider plenty of action  drama  character building a fun ride from start to finish
Jun 26 2016,positive,i liked it but what was with spiderman 
Jun 26 2016,positive,adding some real tension to the marvel cinematic universe all your favorite characters have something to do both fun and rather  dramatic
Jun 25 2016,positive,fantastic so well done
Jun 25 2016,positive,awesome i cant think of any other words to describe this movie except awesome from start to finish pure awesomeness without given much away let me say two break out characters who stole the show were antman and spiderman and kudos to robert downey junior who made me really feel hatred towards iron man
Jun 25 2016,positive,the captain america movies have never been lacking and marvel certainly wasnt going to let that happen in cacw civil war was probably the best avengers movie that i have ever seen and it wasnt even an avengers movie     probably one of the only things that annoyed me was the marketing campaign civil war despite what the marketing team would want you to believe is not a dichotomy of good and evil right or wrong captain america or iron man and what was so amazing about the movie was that it illustrated both sides of the argument shown in the film black widows flip flopping between rogers and stark was also addressed which made it easier to understand her motivations and ultimately made her even more likable i mean who doesnt like black widow     oh the other thing that annoyed me was spider man although he was perfectly likable and actually provided a good outlet of comedic relief it was annoying to see another skinny white boy as spider man when the friendly neighborhood spider was unveiled in the trailer a plethora of cries called for miles morales a spark of hope that i was clinging onto that said please marvel do something good for us alas it was easy to disappoint not to mention that aunt may seems to be getting younger and younger through every reboot of spider man    but this was by far the best captain america movie and by far one of my favorite movies of the entire year no questions asked its packed with action and sentiment and is a perfect blend of  unsurprisingly  captain america and iron man
Jun 25 2016,positive,best captain movie yet
Jun 25 2016,positive,good but also just more of the same all these marvel movies are blurring into one at the moment
Jun 25 2016,positive,very nicely done  i just disagree with who they chose to play spiderman and disagree that tony stark helped spiderman with his suit and all because that did not happen in the comics  the guy that plays spiderman is just too young
Jun 25 2016,positive,a reminder that disneys the avengers was not  a fluke and that every bit matters from the actors the stories and the teams behind the cameras  civil war accomplishes what so many big budget action films dont  it intelligently entertains    these characters have motivation and purpose  the script is was written by those who paid attention to what the characters would want to do and the story is woven deep within that concept  the disney move machine is in top form with obvious love being given to every detail from those behind and in front of the camera    i detailed synopsis is not required  if you have even the slightest interest in this genre you will enjoy it immensely
Jun 25 2016,positive,great stuff when it concentrates on the intellectual aspect of the conflict maylays at an airport are all saturday morning cartoon fare but the real fight comes toward the end when friends lay into each other over loyalties and nobody is a clear cut winner not better than winter soldier but well worth anyones attention consummate acting and directing a big jump from the days of 1990s rubber suits and boring villains
Jun 25 2016,neutral,probably marvels finest production stellar direction stellar cast stellar movie
Jun 25 2016,positive,same thing different sequel
Jun 25 2016,positive,very enjoyable id see it again
Jun 25 2016,negative,it was okay 90  is getting really carried away i loved ca2 winter soldier btw
Jun 25 2016,positive,marvel certainly has their formula down though its one that has become too predictable and boring in my opinion also why the hell didnt they give vision a true artificial intelligence that has the ability to bend matter more lines more story etc hes one if not the most intelligent and most powerful character on earth if not the galaxy for the writers and director to have you believe an ai would simply sit in the background not doing anything for the majority of the film is fuckin stupid
Jun 25 2016,positive,wow the movie was greater than i ever had imagined it to be that character of vision who is starks ally is just suchâ aâ characterâ likeâ tony he really saysâ someâ of the mostâ outrageousâ things his humor matches that of starks that is for sure downey jr always adds his own brand of humor in these marvel films  i love that about him laughter is good in any sort of aâ movieâ no matter the genre  there really wasnt much of a warâ brewingâ between the characters ofâ captain america and iron manâ theyâ both did notâ see eyetoeye on things theâ sameâ situation can occur in lifeâ today people will not agree on everything but it is the tactful way in which to handle things  captain americaâ handledâ them in aâ respectableâ manner fighting for what he wantsâ andâ believesâ was true whereas iron man justâ wantedâ to fight literally to stop the captainâ and what happened a war  someone realizedâ theirâ mistake and apologized i will not say who but once that happened another secret isâ revealedâ and thatâ openedâ up another way between the two but inâ theâ end the sameâ thingsâ happened someone apologized inâ lifeâ peopleâ will realize the truths that they are meantâ toâ realizeâ and seeâ you cannot forceâ truthsâ ontoâ peopleâ whoâ are not in the proper mindset to see it whenâ you wantâ them to see it but when they choose to see it inâ theirâ ownâ time that is what i pulled from the confrontationâ between steve and tony during the filmâ i loveâ seeing the black widow kick butt scarlett is one mightâ feistyâ badass to put it mildly i love herâ attitude her pose her controlâ her everything the film had stellar acting flawless action scenes and there was never a dull momentâ theâ movie was explosive and that is putting it accurately lol scarlet witch really added that flare to the filmâ the young actor who portrayed the role of spider man was very comical for the short time he was on screen it wasâ justâ hilariousâ to see that and for the character of auntâ may played by tomei i agree withâ whatâ tony said his auntâ is too hot to be an aunt lol paul rudd as antman added more humor
Jun 25 2016,positive,another great marvel movie
Jun 25 2016,positive,marvel studios does it again with what i think is probably the best marvel film to date captain america civil war is a hit and jammed packed full of action from start to finish highly recommended seeing this movie well done action nonstop and tons of marvel heros to like
Jun 24 2016,positive,this movie is a home run it is very fun and i love the story there is also great humor plus i love the new spiderman    55
Jun 24 2016,positive,was it good sure good plot good conflict does that mean i want to buy it or watch it again nope the film was surprisingly slow for marvel and a bit melodramatic i didnt even notice jokes kick in until spidermans entrance and while i still have mixed feelings about him being on an avenger team he brought some semblance of fun back into the characters which left again rather quickly when he did    so i appreciate the plot points of the film and the overarching concepts while missing the fun and charisma of these characters
Jun 24 2016,positive,the best captain america yet
Jun 24 2016,positive,awesome movie didnt like the conflict but thats the story line it worked
Jun 24 2016,positive,i enjoyed this movie but probably have to watch it again because the girl behind me talked for 34 of the movie i cannot stress this enough shut up in the movies so when i finally told her to that was the end of that   anyway great action and great story the black panther was great and really hope they do an origin story i did think that cramming all the heroes in was a little forced and if it seems that way in this cap movie then i cant imagine what the new avengers is going to feel like fun and entertaining
Jun 24 2016,positive,really powerful story line  excellent appearance by spiderman  i really felt the depth of the characters watching this  as of this update both deadpool and dr strange are better 2016 movies
Jun 24 2016,positive,very funnyloved it
Jun 24 2016,positive,another fantastic moviego see it
Jun 24 2016,positive,cant wait until the next movie to come out comic nerd  lol
Jun 23 2016,positive,unlike batman v superman this movie shows a reason why they are fighting the airport battle is amazing
Jun 23 2016,positive,awesome completion action pact
Jun 23 2016,positive,best captain america movie ive seen so far
Jun 23 2016,positive,spiderman though soooo funny
Jun 23 2016,positive,its very good never wanted it to stop
Jun 23 2016,positive,best movie in 2016 easily i wish they focus more on the relationship between steve rogers and bucky more but the movie still did a great job on why bucky was so important to steve every characters in this movie made sense and no one felt like they were there just because they are part of the marvel universe and needs to be there to make people happy overall amazing movie
Jun 23 2016,positive,not a fan of captain america movies but this one was amazingspider man was awesome and antman too i would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of captain america and iron man
Jun 23 2016,positive,more of the same but quality more of an avengers movie than a captain america movie you might question some of the motives of the characters but you will certainly be amazed by how many stories and feelings the movie is able to cover and capture no ones story or arc felt halfdrawn
Jun 23 2016,positive,i think this movie is just the best mcu movie of all time
Jun 23 2016,positive,this newest install meant to the marvel cinematic universe mcr
Jun 23 2016,positive,the core of the conflict was abandoned 30min in the director seemed to regret creating too powerful of a being in vision as his role was reduced to minimal in order to not end the war before the hour things did get pulled together somewhat towards the end an entertaining watch overall
Jun 23 2016,positive,although its a bit long the high points are among the highest of the marvel franchise so far just when you think were sick of the cinematic spiderman universe the character manages to steal the show with a limited amount of screen time the lack of a strong villain makes the storyline less memorable but thats kind of the point if youre seeing this to see the main heroes beat each other up you shouldnt be disappointed
Jun 23 2016,positive,best marvel movie yetavengers 25  dialogue great plot moves along well
Jun 23 2016,positive,very good fun movie plot and villain were weak
Jun 22 2016,positive,strong writing and character motivations funny poignant action packed with amazing practical set pieces and a surprising amount of mature themes
Jun 22 2016,positive,better than most marvel films ultimately exactly what youd expectenjoyable but not memorable
Jun 22 2016,positive,omg love it sooooo much spidey is sooooo goood
Jun 22 2016,positive,an amazing action pack film watch again and again and again
Jun 22 2016,positive,with brilliant acting and superb story civil war perfectly begins the next wave of marvel movies and dares to do what dawn of justice could never do
Jun 22 2016,positive,great in depth story  better action scenes to compliment the already compelling story arc with a few suprising plot twists from about midmovie towards the final moments of the film  great postcredit scenes which connect cw civil war to upcoming marvel movies  there are brief moments when it may seem like the movie has some cheesy humor however     all in all  a great film to watch especially for those fans of the comic book universe as we see great icons clash together in this epic film  the best captain america film by far  i personally  watched the entire movie 5 times  the most i have done for any film  great watch 
Jun 22 2016,positive,my review is skewed by seeing the ratings before hand so i only saw the good in this movie but it was quite good nonetheless unlike the dark knight rises good political plot almost typical now  heros save the world world overreacts heros castrated bad guys cause problems heros save the day again but how each character tied in was very well coordinated a one of the few hero movies that does suck
Jun 22 2016,positive,84 on 10    not to be missed  recommended 100
Jun 21 2016,positive,by far the best of the captain america movies
Jun 21 2016,positive,while batman v superman flopped harder than a kid at his first diving lessons civil war satisfies superhero movie fans with its action its wit and its believable storyline    it would have to take something drastic to split the avengers  the storyline of civil war follows earths mightiest heroes as they are conflicted over whether the avengers should have to answer to anyone or should be free to intervene whenever they deem necessary  i hate to see heroes fighting against each other but the russo brothers make the action so fun and the dialogue so witty that im actually left wanting a little more    civil war is a solid installment in the avengers franchise and the russo brothers have proven themselves to be for lack of better words quite awesome at making superhero movies
Jun 21 2016,positive,with the marvel universe expanding so hugely it is very hard to say whether captain american civil war is the best movie released so far but it is certainly among the top deliveries from the marveldisneys franchise darker raw actionpacked and with the typical glimpses of fresh humor the third installment of the captain america spinoff is also a thought provoking movie which somehow partially escapes from the typical avengers extravaganza    as it could be expected after two avengers movies captain america civil war is directly related to the whole marveluniverse with no extraterrestrial threat to the world the group of superheroes if focused on fighting secret organizations and villains logically operating around the world soon evokes questions of responsibility and accountability for the whole team an issue that causes the split of the whole team forced to accept obeying to international rules or be considered outlaws the avengers have to take hard decisions and that results in captain america chris evans refusing to play according to the international rules split in two groups pressured by bureaucracy and fighting an untraceable enemy the two groups of avengers are facing the biggest challenge coming from within     talking about accountability we should say that this theme is actually civil wars biggest asset almost everyone among the viewers has wondered at least once in his time watching marvel movies to whom are these heroes accountable to what kind of rules do they have to obey who defines what is allowed and what is not all these thoughtprovoking questions are carefully asked by directors anthony  joe russo by depicting the choices each of the avengers makes they directing duo explores also the different aspects of the terms responsibility accountability and checks  balances this makes captain america civil war a different marvel movie one that is darker more serious and still pleasantly tensed needless to say the humor elements are also part of the story but this time they are mostly provided by the newcomers in the avengers univers antman paul rudd and spiderman tom holland both of them are refreshingly funny and blend excellently amidst the overall darker tonality     in conclusion captain america civil war is probably among the top 5 best movies from the marvelavengers universe carefully blending the typical oldschool touch of captain america with the big and noisy kitsch of the avengers this installment explores provoking themes and asks questions which you keep you intrigued and entertained throughout the whole 146 minutes
Jun 21 2016,positive,a little slow at first and some plot holes upon review but still a fun marvel movie and way better than all the thor movies
Jun 21 2016,positive,captain america civil war handles its stuffedtothelimit package superbly combining excellent writing thrilling action and a surprising amount of emotional heft to create a nearly perfect superhero film
Jun 20 2016,positive,great film marvel and disney does it again top 5 superhero movie of alltime amazing fight scenes fantastic pacing and arguably the best character balancing of all of the mashup super hero movies to date every character got their time to shine and respective story arc excluding jeremy renners nighthawk who was obviously there only to funfill his contact with marvel and have an even number on each side for the big battle royal at the airport they accomplished so much between so many different characters without confusing the audience that it sets the bar a bit higher for future mashup movies    the only reason i give this a 45910 is because i still do like care for bucky as an actor and i do not buy into the relationship him and captain have i am not a big captain fan in the first place and it makes me sad that he is soon to take over the mantle for future filmsspeculation and rumors not confirmed also a nice surprise is how enjoyable the black panther character is i believe he will provide a fresh new feel moving forward considering he is not an american and his abilities are tied to a family lineage which is unique in this cinematic universe so far this is a must see and if you can make it i encourage you to see it in theater for the full effect
Jun 20 2016,positive,ill admit i really wasnt excited for this one marvel movies were starting to get overbearing with films like age of ultron and antman which was at least a fun movie no this movie was fun had a decent plot and didnt require you to have to read a years worth of comic books to understand the characters as well as their morals
Jun 20 2016,positive,another great marvel to add to the series what makes this movie great is how it is a genuinely fun time many movies now get bogged down in being dark and this movie is able to have its dark moments but still leaves you with the feel good vibes that a comic book movie should     all the actors deliver spectacular performances in the rolls they have become so accustomed to playing the two most surprising performances come from spiderman tom holland and antman paul rudd as they both deliver two of the funnier sets of dialogue     there are two postcredit scenes for anyone who hasnt seen the movie yet these are not too critical to the story but do give you another smile before you leave the theater
Jun 20 2016,positive,this was a fantastic movie not as good as the first avengers but a close second
Jun 20 2016,positive,this is what avengers 2 should have been
Jun 20 2016,positive,all i can say is more spider man and iron man a movie with these two fantastic characters would break the space time continuum
Jun 20 2016,positive,with an exciting and engaging plot topped off with amazing special effects this film is a must see for all movie fans alike
Jun 20 2016,positive,love it its my favorite movie like it more than deadpool
Jun 20 2016,positive,overall i enjoyed this film as far as superheroes films go  i grew tired of the constant fight scenes and was confused at times at who was fighting whom  they put in a new actor to play spiderman  hell take time to get used to  he seemed rather wimpy for the spidy character  if you like superhero movies then youll enjoy this one
Jun 20 2016,positive,great twist cant wait for the next avengers movie
Jun 20 2016,positive,the russo brothers return for the final movie in this captain america trilogy that feels more like an avengers trilogy there i said it taking concepts and ideas from the 2006 comicbook storyline of the same name this movie introduces yet more superhero characters whilst continuing the saga with the more well known characters that being said bottom line as the title suggests its an internal civil war amongst the avengers one group against another over a set of ideals that cant be agreed upon hmmm strangely apt for these modern times methinks anyway i dunno why im writing all this because surely everyone knows    the plotugh the plot well i kinda summed it up just above really but in a nutshell the un wants to keep all superheroes in check because they are generally causing lots of damage and killing innocent people during their daring rescue missions to save the world i mean yeah sure losing innocent lives is a bummer n all butif its between that or an entire country or even the world getting destroyed then surely collateral damage must be acceptedright well apparently no and on one side you have captain america who thinks allowing the un to control the avengers is a dangerous move whilst on the other iron man who agrees with the government and wants to be somewhat locked down the bug being if they cant agree on this and they dont allow the un to run the show they all have to retire pretty stupid really because how you gonna enforce that against super people anyway naturally both heroes have team members that agree with them and thus you have the two superhero factions let the civil war commence oh and theres another uber villain in the mix again to throw spanners in the works at the same time usual stuff    so things kick off with a rather ropy action sequence that introduces us to the reason why the un wants to lock down the avengers and the flash in the pan showcasing of villain crossbones just when you thought they couldnt possibly get away with showing you more of the same shit all over again they do just that in other words we have the cap and black widow doing lots of martial arts type tomfoolery against faceless cannon fodder types spiced up with the odd bloody obvious cgi move falcon swoops in and does pretty much all he can do which is fly around and kick people you knowlike any fool could do with some training on those metal wings there are lots of stunts that are clearly not the actors usually shot from behind black widow gets trapped in an armoured truck with a grenade and somehow manages not to get killed and finally crossbones is dispatched whilst unfortunately wiping out lots of innocents at the same time    in general all the action is pretty much like this for the comicbook fanboys and marvel fanboys it will be a wet dream once again for casual viewers like myself it may start to become rather repetitive thats not to say its bad or anything but there is only so much kicking punching and general throwing of characters that one can handle before it all becomes a boring blur with added cgi shenanigans there is of course an exception to the rule in this movie well a couple at least there are two action sequences which the russo brothers have clearly tried to jazz things up a bit firstly the chase sequence where black panther is after bucky barnes because he thinks bucky assassinated his father now initially this starts off pretty normallyas youd expect with the usual fisticuffs although its some good fisticuffs luckily things take a different route as the sequence quickly descends into the realms of parkour across some rooftops to a degree and then into a full pelt chase on foot now while i cant say this sequence matches up to the sheer grit of the infamous chase sequence in action flick point break they have clearly tried to do the same sort of thing alas it still comes across as too flashy and full of cgi for me again thats not to say its a bad sequence far from it its very good very thrilling and most importantly its fresh yes the super speed running alongside cars or outrunning them is very clearly fake looking and kinda cheesy maybe they should of avoided doing that possibly it did look pretty shit    the second decent action sequence was easily the now infamous airport battle where we finally see all these characters together kicking ass with their unique skills this was never gonna fail lets be honest how could it all the avengers together split right down the middle knocking the shit outta each other wicked stuff this was the highlight for me what ive been waiting to see in all honesty and it didnt disappoint each character seemed to get a good amount of ass kicking time on screen each character got to use their skills and in general it just looked cool i loved seeing antman getting stuck in with his micro moves now i could nitpick it i could be really honest and say the cgi was all too obvious again with certain martial arts moves looking at black panther and his videogameesque flying kicks then you have the fact that vision could of wiped everyone out but kinda didnt in fact he did fuck all same with scarlet witch really on the subject of vision and scarlet witch what the fuck did she do to him back in the apartment i get she crippled him with her powers but then she knocked him down into the earth or something like deep underground  then i could be a real bastard and mention how falcon hawkeye and black widow are technically useless in this battle because they are essentially regular humans without any major weapons strength or armour to protect them but we all know that anyway lets not talk about the highly ironic fact that stark and co wanna reign in the cap and his team so they can all be under un control to stop unnecessary damage and go about that by destroying an airport hmmm    once we get past these actions segments things tend to revert back to the usual spiel i have come to expect with these comicbook flicks lots of exposition that usually involves secret projects and flashbacks this time it all surrounds baron zemo trying to find other frozen super soldiers in siberia so he can eventually lure in bucky stark and the cap to reveal a huge secret that would hopefully fracture the avengers bold move because lets be honest here he has no idea that his little reveal will cause the chaos he hopes for considering everyone knows that bucky has been brainwashed all this time so anything wrong he may have done in the past is most probably due to that well youd think that but apparently stark didnt know this really after all this time he doesnt stop to think about it for a second maybe i missed something but i dont get how stark doesnt realise thiseven though what he finds out is deeply upsetting for him also how in gods name did stark not detect black panthers craft flying behind him on the way to siberia surely his iron man suit would pick up that craft being so close and why exactly does zemo kill the other frozen super soldiers what was the point of that overall i did feel that the entire plot of this film was rather limp frankly bottom line its all about zemo simply wanting to reveal a painful secret to stark everything is simply building up to that one reveal and after all that surely stark must have realised bucky was brainwashed at the time surely    in general the effects ranged from being outstandingly slick with some great stunt work the young downy jr showcasing some excellent cgi to being blatantly obvious cgi with obvious stuntmen i dont really think there has been any major leaps in visuals since the last cap or avengers movies i really enjoyed seeing all the characters cant stress that enough i thought spiderman fit in beautifully and came across perfectly i enjoyed the team struggles the strained friendships something im sure many can actually relate to and the seamless plot continuity but i gotta be brutally honest here i only really saw this simply to view all these superhero characters together in the same film that was the hook for me that alone everything else i can take it or leave it whilst its by no means a bad movie i am finding myself suffering from superhero fatigue now simply because all these movies are blurring into one and i cant really tell them apart but admittedly that is just me whilst i didnt absolutely love it i didnt hate it either its a perfectly enjoyable marvel extravaganza that to me feels more like yet another very similar avengers chapter and for the record i was on team captain america
Jun 19 2016,positive,good way overrated
Jun 19 2016,positive,it was super cool now my fav movie for ever
Jun 19 2016,positive,i would have given a higher rating but jumped the shark with the shitty cgi creature nonsense

Jun 19 2016,positive,these comic book films apart from deadpool are getting a bit boring now
Jun 19 2016,positive,ok fell asleep a few times 
Jun 19 2016,negative,great premise but poorly executed and the spiderboy character suckedcostume and all
Jun 19 2016,negative,weak plot no consequences to the heroes action more like a transformer movie not a captain america movie its more like an iron movie featuring captain america   too many heroes
Jun 19 2016,positive,the comics are better cap could not fight iron man in a million years it was 
Jun 19 2016,positive,loved it would watch again
Jun 19 2016,positive,it was a really good plot on what most of the comic battles are to be wish the spiderman would have been played by the amazing spiderman actor this one did not really pull him off
Jun 19 2016,positive,this is the shit of superhero brilliance
Jun 19 2016,positive,5142017 2  a good movie and exactly what i expected i was not a huge fan of the plot and cause of the civil war though
Jun 19 2016,positive,the most amazing super hero film of all time  i enjoyed it so much i saw it twice it has great story great action and an amazing cast a must see
Jun 19 2016,negative,so this movie its more like a fight club that a civil war and the movie make no sense they want to kill each other but they are friend so they dont want to hurt each other but and the same time they shoot rocketthrown shit everywhere and some of them dont even know what exspiderman can do but no fuck given cap destroy a ramp on top of spiderman without knowing he can survive and make a stupid one line joke  seriously that what kid love  what happen to movie critics with 90 on rotten tomatoes  its a no brainer movie
Jun 19 2016,positive,in the long line of marvel movies that are coming out now they seem to be trying to oneup themselves with everyone thats coming out this movie is good and sets up the infinity war series coming pretty well i like the fact they introduced a few other characters into the avengers world being in a spiderman coming back and antman the airport fight scene was probably one of the best films and best action scenes ive ever seen in a movie i would suggest seeing this movie if you havent already
Jun 18 2016,positive,i liked most the quicksilva btw all over good movie but missing thor 
Jun 18 2016,positive,started slow but picked up later on
Jun 18 2016,negative,shaky camera action scenes are hard to follow right from the beginning of the movie so disappointed
Jun 18 2016,positive,the tension and conflict between cap and stark was magnified from the comic book in this mcu version with funny amazing spidey scenes
Jun 18 2016,positive,fun but nothing to brag about for the hype
Jun 18 2016,positive,not as good as winter soldier some fun fight moments but a bit boring in parts not the best marvel movie but not the worst
Jun 18 2016,positive,best movie of 2016by far
Jun 18 2016,positive,great movie with equally impressive action sequences and stellar character introductions including the black panther and spiderman loved it team iron man
Jun 18 2016,positive,i had pretty high expectations for this movie coming in and it far exceeded anything i could have hoped for such a great movie
Jun 18 2016,positive,less a captain america film and more an avengers film and is the best marvel film yet  the story centers around steve rodgers and tony stark but each of the avengers gets a moment to shine including black panther ant man and spiderman whos role is much bigger than the previews made it out to be  lots of fun with surprisingly human moments
Jun 18 2016,positive,the empire strikes back of the avengers not very much of a plot but more to set up the next film and lots of action very good action
Jun 18 2016,positive,outstanding  its  cool
Jun 18 2016,positive,captain america civil war is one of the better mcu films so far thanks to a really well crafted and sophisticated storyline a great political first half and an entertaining and comedic second one really good humor and absolutely terrific action sequences it does lack a bigger emotional punch it is way too long and it is stuffed with way too many characters thus seriously reducing the impact of some of them but most of the characters are memorable and well used here the team dynamic is great and it is undoubtedly one of the most entertaining marvel movies
Jun 18 2016,positive,i might have missed one of those films from marvel that put these new characters in to the timeline but it was weird to see this film and see new characters i didnt recognize as if they had been there all along i didnt get how it all tied in to the previous film    im not trying to trash it but i caught myself falling asleep three times during the movie it was a theater with big soft chairs maybe that was why but some things bothered me for instance why was spiderman in this and why was his aunt mae 38 years old and trying to get with tony stark didnt really jive with how i remember the actual comics being written never the less i enjoyed it a bit but it didnt meet my expectations
Jun 18 2016,positive,captain america civil war is a fantastic action filled movie with a lot of superhero drama in between that work really well for this movie it jugles a lot of charecters but everyone gets the time to shine   the only setback is that you have to watch most of the mcu movies to fully comprehand this movie specificly the captain america and the avengers movies
Jun 18 2016,positive,see more reviews like this at chrisbreviewsblogspotcom    i want to start by saying that this review will contain no spoilers so read on with security of knowing i wont troll you and ruin your cinematic experience i want to tell all our comic book fans that this is not a direct copy of the comic book storyline there are noteable similarities and differences which i will not disclose due to my spoiler promise earlier but dont walk in expecting a 2 hour version of the comic book storyline this is waaaayyyy different    this movie had a lot to deal with going into the movie i actually listed them they had to make the civil war conflict as dramatic and as impactful as the comic book version in both physical and political arguments it had to ensure that captain america was at the storys centre because its his movie they had to bring an end to the captain america trilogy and address things like his relationship with bucky buckys past cap finding his place in the modern world his romance with sharon carter etc etc it had to introduce new characters black panther and spiderman to make us want to see their individual movies it had to give each character individual screen time and address their development relationships and motives while ensuring they all had a decent storyline as well as handling this new bad guy and satisfying audiences by juggling all this and more together in a single movie and i must admit on the whole they thrived    the action of the civil war was epic showcasing each heroes powers the political arguments were enthralling allowing audiences to see where both teams of the argument were coming from captain americas relationship with bucky remained central in the storyline the whole civil war revolved around them loose ends were tied up in captain americas legacy with one or two left open ended no spoilers we will talk about the new additions later but they were handled with finesse and pretty much all the characters were given decent plot points and screen time according to their role the balance in this film was amazing i really enjoyed the depth in this film of the storyline and the political argument which turns into a physical confrontation whilst remaining central to the enigma of the winter soldier and caps pursuit for his old friend theres so much to compliment in these aspects     however in saying this i dont think that the relationship between vision and scarlet witch two more minor characters was explored enough in this film probably to keep you guessing going into future marvel films and we didnt get to see enough showcase of visions powers although i cant physically count the number of walls he floated through be warned not all of the heroes mentioned get a lot of screen time but there are reasons to that the ones most pivotal to the storyline get most of the attention and the others are mainly there to make one awesome battle sequence sharon carters role for example was very very minor    for those who are worried the trailers didnt give away the plot at all it was fantastic in that it kept throwing curveballs but i wanted some shots to be saved for the movie however for marvel though the marketing was held back a lot and this has paid off for viewers who havent seen past marvel films you will still have a rough understanding of whats going on but you would benefit from seeing some past films namely captain america the first avenger captain america the winter soldier and avengers age of ultron    alright actors now this film has the most heroes on screen ever so theres a lot here returning from previous marvel films chris evans robert downey jr sebastian stan scarlett johansson anthony mackie elizabeth olson don cheadle jeremy renner paul bettany paul rudd emily van camp william hurt and frank grillo among others with newcomers chadwick boseman tom holland martin freeman daniel bruhl and marisa tomei each performs well in their roles the standout was robert downey jr exploring more of an emotional range in this one as iron man as we take a glimpse back into tony starks past chris evans as the stubborn and determined captain america sebastian stan as the mentally unstable loyal friend bucky barnes scarlett johansson as the conflicted yet sarcastic black widow anthony mackie as the bad ass wise cracker falcon elizabeth olsen as the damaged and naive scarlet witch don cheadle as the pedantic rule follower war machine jeremy renner as the impatient smartass hawkeye paul bettany as the wise yet awkward vision who undergoes the personal journey of humanity in this film very interesting and paul rudd as the ever hilarious fan girl newcomer antman all reprised their roles with ease chemistry was evident between cap and bucky and witch and vision    now newcomers we all want to here about lets start with chadwick boseman as black panther perfection this character had a surprisingly high investment in this conflict due to very personal reasons no spoilers which was interesting to watch unfold and thats not even counting his kickass fighting skills with the stubborn determination of a king of wakanda he presents desirable qualities throughout and his personal journey is a good one comic book fans will be satisfied looking forward to seeing more of him in his solo film set for release in 2018 next spiderman even better a lot of people will be confused as to why hes a different actor and suddenly with the avengers to those people have a read of a more thorough description in my article marvel vs dc but long story short the character was owned by another studio who did a bad job with him and now hes back where he belongs in the marvel cinematic universe and it was a good choice as tom holland portrays the best on screen peter parkerspiderman yet hes a teen in this one worried about teenager things with teenager remarks and reactions which prove to be a hilarious contrast to the serious conflict transpiring around him tony stark is his mentor and robert downey jr is interestingly going to be appearing in spidermans 2017 film entitled homecoming not sure about the casting choice for marisa tomei as a very young aunt may though only time will tell if its good or bad the awkward geeky peter parker is portrayed brilliantly by holland before crossing over to the overly confident and sarcastic smartass spiderman who surprisingly kicked ass such a pleasure to watch these two make their on screen debuts in civil war making this movie even better    finally the villain baron zemo was unnecessary yes his little contribution caused the tension between cap and iron man to reach boiling point a second time but the reason iron man once again became hostile couldve been discovered some other way he took up too much screen time sorry daniel bruhl my last thing about characters is that i didnt agree with the major character deaths when you see this movie youll know what i mean but all im going to say is that i wasnt happy with that aspect    once again the russo brothers as directors have impressed me with their blending of genres to break out of the singular genre that is superhero action adventure comedy war romance thriller and family were included yes this is appropriate for the kids they may get a little bored in bits when theyre wondering why theres no action and they wont truly have an appreciation for the movie in its entirety but its still family friendly aside from the violence of course they might be a little confronted to see their favourite heroes fighting each other it really depends how much your kids like these characters the setting was very international in this one taking place in a number of different countries emphasising the scope that this conflict covered    the themes including revenge the past forgiveness morals and ideals freedom conformity safety and responsibility among countless others this was a very deep film the special effects were as usual flawless and used with ease to present our heroes powers and contributed greatly to the fantastic action sequences the costumes were upgraded for each of our characters which was good on the whole loved spiderman and black panthers costumes not loving war machines though the script was fantastic and the production value was brilliant as this film was shot in global locations    cliffhangers with marvel there will always be more at the moment its building up to a massive avengers showdown closer to 2020 when they go up against their biggest bad guy yet with a huge avengers line up between now and then there will be mostly new characters introduced to join the squad but characters such as iron man spiderman ant man and black panther will be seen in movies before then    this film was thoroughly engaging for me as there was always something to be watching thinking about or being shocked at not much boredom here others may be different but i was fine the cinematography was stunning some of the shots shown in this movie were visually spectacular while the camera was a little shaky in some bits it was fantastic in conveying whatever it needed to convey at that time    the directing by the russo brothers was flawless much like their work in the predecessor to this film the winter soldier its a good practice run for their directing role in the two part third installment of the avengers franchise infinity war to be released in 2018 and 2019 the tone was various and contingent on each character and moment it went from gritty to humorous to emotional this film was the emotional roller coaster i needed    the running time was decent for a film of this size and i wont be surprised if there are a few oscar nominations in the bag for this one the soundtrack was great the editing on the whole was great the sound editing couldve been a little better at times but was still outstanding and the choreography was to its usual standard of fantastic    in terms of box office this film will be very successful as arguably the best marvel film yet with sufficient marketing and a great track history this should break a few records the target audience was really more mature audiences in this one as oppose to little kids and i think thats a wise move on marvels part the audience is varying to attract new demographics constantly stan lees cameo wasnt my favourite on this one but still amused me nonetheless        to improve we couldve gotten rid of zemo and substituted his screen time for more battle sequences between our avengers and spending time in making the conflict more personal for the audience the fact that the title says civil war was true in some respects but in terms of conflict there was only one big fighting sequence dont get me wrong there was loads of action just not necessarily the actual conflict i bargained for i do like how efficiently captain americas story was blended in with the civil war conflict props for that    to conclude this was the best marvel cinematic universe movie to date whether it was the best superhero movie is unsure in my mind when you compare it with others like deadpool guardians of the galaxy the dark knight and captain america the winter soldier the russo brothers did a fantastic job making the rewatchability level very high im very much looking forward to further work by marvel studios including doctor strange later this year and spiderman homecoming thor ragnarok and guardians of the galaxy vol 2 in 2017 theres something for everyone in this and i honestly recommend this to all audiences if youre looking for an epic blockbuster a funny film a superhero film a film that challenges you mentally an action film a thriller or a film to see with your kids youve come to the right place

Jun 16 2016,positive,one of the best comic book movies to date in my opinion  i enjoyed it from beginning to end  worth pay full price for this
Jun 16 2016,negative,boring until spiderman shows up then its good
Jun 16 2016,positive,marvel doesnt disappoints again great movie on every aspect definitely brought me out of my seat seeing super heroes that a person wouldve expected
Jun 16 2016,positive,civil war is everything age of ultron should have been the characters are more interesting the plot more grounded and the action more tense
Jun 16 2016,positive,best movie ever i already love marvel but this is my fav marvel movie just if you are wondering if you should see it you should
Jun 16 2016,positive,a great movie that perfectly balances darkness and levity spiderman an black panther are integrated perfectly into this universe the battle between stark and rogers feels authentic and earned and despite it being an action oriented film the movie remembers to keep the actual philosophical argument very much present
Jun 15 2016,positive,this one is pretty good
Jun 15 2016,positive,this movie was actually really well done ive read the civil war comic and ive seen all the mcu movies leading up to this point i feel like the main issue i had was that it could have had more feels but considering the huge ensemble cast and the amount of characters involved its hard to really expect al ot of that there were so many different things going on they introduced the black panther and the new spiderman which were both really good in my view im excited to see where those characters go there were some really good shots in the movie especially when iron man was shooting his beam at captain americas shield that image was perfect the bad guys were good and fit really well into the plot of the movie antman was hilarious and i liked aunt may scarlett johannson is always amazing i was on captain americas side before the film and still fell the same after the movie although they did a really good job of showing the pros and cons to each side of the coin i saw it in the theater twice very good job marvel    building up for infinity war rewatching this one i have different feelings now  ive seen this movie 5 or 6 times now at least  my new feeling on this movie is that i feel its a weak movie for captain america  this is like the finale of his standalone trilogy but its more of an avengers movie than it is a captain america movie  i wish this had been another avengers movie and that cap would have had a third actual standalone movie  even the second had several other avengers but it was still mostly a cap story  this one shares too much story telling plots for the rest of the avengers and loses sight of the star of the movie  its still a great movie though
Jun 15 2016,positive,simply brilliant packed with amazing action scenes a deep plot and the best villian in any marvel movies
Jun 15 2016,positive,great movie no complaints
Jun 15 2016,neutral,i just didnt like this story at all
Jun 15 2016,positive,the best marvel movie yet
Jun 15 2016,positive,this movie was amazing had everything you want in a movie plus sweet ass superheroes battling without a doubt its the best marvel movie made to date its one you could watch over and over again and always find it exciting
Jun 15 2016,positive,marvel is always out doing them selves i was literally on the edge of my seat for some of this movie
Jun 15 2016,positive,this has to be the best movie of the year the only two things i didnt like is spidermans limited screen time and everytime they had a new location it would cover the whole screen
Jun 15 2016,positive,marvel can get things right when they want to there are some really stupendous moments in this film the drama is there and the action is there it is funny at moments they filled this one with all sorts of new stuff like black panther and spiderman and yet it did not feel just thrown together this is a great addition to marvel studios film collection i hope that the situation of this film spill over into the following films    spiderman also i want to point out was very well done as he is my fav
Jun 15 2016,positive,didnt care for the story line but otherwise a great marvel movie as always
Jun 15 2016,positive,the initial premise that gives rise to the civil war is a little thin but this film is incredibly entertaining when it really gets going more an avengers rather than a captain america film these are the superhero battles previously only dreamed about now visualised on screen the new additions to the universe particularly spiderman are great
Jun 14 2016,positive,is this better than the winter soldier well that certainly is debatable this is my pick for the best film of the year this is my favorite marvel film this period is perfection just pure thrills and fun meant to be watched over and over again let me put it to you this way i held off for a long time to posting this review because even saying how much i like the film felt like a spoiler     the plot is just so sound and perfect the action is topnotch youll be hard pressed to find a better lineup of superheroes that gel so well together when they clash the battles are just great our 3rd generation of the modern live action film series spiderman is just great and easily grows on you one of the youngest versions of the kid from queens is so fun should i even say anything about aunt may     this film is just so good and i cant complement it enough you just need to go see it i dont care if youre into marvel comics superheroes or none of the above you like movies you like good movies go see this film asap
Jun 14 2016,positive,while the first two captain america films were good they were a bit of a reach from great  civil war however does a great job of not only bringing captain america and the winter soldier into the full swing of the marvel cinematic universe but also handles a difficult conflict that can easily be applied to our society  besides creating a believable story line the film is also filled with top notch action  creating a fun and dramatic film with this many characters including new ones should have been pretty close to impossible but the russo brothers somehow found a way to pull it off
Jun 14 2016,positive,not the greatest superhero film but civil war is a fine installment of the marvel cinematic universe
Jun 14 2016,positive,great fun highly recommend it  yes there are a few holes but nothing to worry about really loved daniel bruehl as the villain and the spiderman dialouges are so well written so was the ending it helps to have seen the other avengers group or individuals movies for this one though
Jun 14 2016,negative,the director of the second captain america film presents the third film in the captain america series civil war being a big fan of the winter solider i had high hopes for this film but found myself quite disappointed to start off the film hardly feels like a captain america film and is more like an avengers film the film features all the super heroes from the previous films with the exception of thor and the hulk the film also adds spiderman to the mix the division of the team begins when a pact signed by over 100 countries calls for the avengers to be in check and have more scrutiny and responsibility for their actions the tension grows as captain america and ironman disagree on the matter throw in tons of over the top action scenes that feel bloated and pointless the threads that pull the team apart seem pretty trivial as well with the short and stubborn tempers of nearly all of the heroes in the film was tiresome the jokes in the film were also terrible and at 2 hours and 26 minutes the longest marvel film i was more than ready for this film to be over
Jun 14 2016,positive,1 of the top action movies i have seen so far it shows about friendships a tad pit of romance and the heartbreaking quote must see
Jun 14 2016,positive,awesome movie everyone should watch it
Jun 13 2016,positive,everyone loves this movie and ill admit its rather well done with notable highlights being spiderman and for once an actually interesting villain produced by the marvel movies however this movies praise are far too large its a little sloppy but a fun ride all the way nonetheless not 55 but more so a solid 355 just next time marvel please please please let one of the characters die there are no stakes if everyone lives in the end and continually cheat death
Jun 13 2016,positive,one of the best mcu movie
Jun 13 2016,positive,captain war civil america is about a 100 year old war vet who has a disagreement with a rich robot boy because of the big bad gubment he then finds out that his only living 100 year old friend with a prosthetic arm maybe blew up the un he gets scared and goes looking for him he gathers up a team of illegals including a teenage girl bug boy and arrow man to follow buckos intuition against robo boys and widowmakers feelers turns out buko aka cold commando is right and an adventure ensues that might split the avenger apart  was it good yeah was it long yeah did it have an after credits teaser yeah stan lee was there too yeah and it was made my disney marvel in the superhero series that keeps making good action flicks with a little substance too yep  okay it fits the checklist its a disneymarvel movie you know its going to be good they always are why are you reading this this was was even better than the usual id say but alas i wish these has more of that sweet hot sticky salty plot and story elements instead of kicking ass as robo boy likes to say if it did id give it a nice slick 4  overall id give a 35 good fun not spectacular or a masterpiece still worth the price of admission if you wanna relax and eat popcorn and not want to think too hard
Jun 13 2016,positive,awesome movie i thought the actual civil war would be more emotional drivenit was more like a contest but turns dark toward the end must see
Jun 13 2016,negative,dull compared to all the other avengers movies ive seen  i havent seen ironman3 but i cant imagine it being worse than this one
Jun 13 2016,positive,the best marvel movie so far
Jun 13 2016,positive,awesome  saw it the day it came out and seing it and seing it again this week
Jun 13 2016,positive,captain america civil war    i saw this because it was 100 degrees outthere was nothing else to  see in town and it got good reviews so a short review is in order    pros no pepper pots no hulk no space aliens head human villain played  by daniel bruhl no thor spider mans acrobatics antman was cool  shockingly plot had some surprises trailer for dr strange played by  benedict cumberbatch black panther kicks ass captain america is  actually not a rule following annoying frat boy kiss ass in this  one     cons rhodes in an ironman suit what a selfrighteous prick  spidermans dialogue and childishness hawkeye is a waste of time  wanda the witch is misused vision was not a sight to behold no one  died in all the fighting the plot has big holes if you care to look  a dearth of decent female superheroes a weak origin story for black  panther set up had flaws like the fact that no one admitted that  without the avengers things would be worse     push wanda still a cool character even if out of place black widow  also seemed out of place here special affects sometimes  special other times not so much rogers is still captain america     rating matinée     there was enough entertainment and an actual plot to bring out the  characters the final battle was not overblown and while the middle  battle was it was still fun an actual moral dilemma present in a  superhero action film is refreshing even if it is too simply presented    now can we have spiderman and black panther join up for a movie  without all those other clowns call it good friends defeat umbrella  corp or some such thing     peace tex shelters
Jun 13 2016,positive,very watchable i enjoyed very much
Jun 13 2016,positive,very well done good writing and directing
Jun 13 2016,positive,action story and humour  with a cameo appearance brilliant film
Jun 13 2016,negative,boring confusing unconvincing terrible
Jun 13 2016,positive,pretty good movie the main epic fight only lasts for about 5 minutes
Jun 13 2016,positive,it may not hit all the peaks that ultron did but it is none the less a tremendous entry into the surprisingly not exhausted genre
Jun 13 2016,positive,felt more like an avengers movie than captain america
Jun 13 2016,negative,i was greatly disappointed by this movie the plot had more holes than swiss cheese  i dont understand how it could have such high ratings  it was nearly as bad as batman vs superman  first for zemos plan to play out as it did too many things were left out of his control  i mean is he psychic then you have captain america going crazy harboring a criminal psychopath who can literally still be set off to kill by a few words this movie was all kinds of ridiculous
Jun 12 2016,negative,this movie felt a lot like the midseason slump of an otherwise moderately entertaining tv show its an erratic overlong story in an erratic overlong movie that doesnt have much of the zing thats characterized previous installments    is this the twilight of the comic movie golden age perhaps if so thats okay
Jun 12 2016,positive,i can do this all day captain america    geekgasm everywhere one of my favorite comic book series is finally a movie  and the movie is kick ass spectacular every character has a great amount of screen time black panther is brilliant character development and i can go on all day even if you are not a fan of superhero films this movie is a must this is my favorite film of the summer only complaint is the villian was not fully flesged out and certain parts of the comic series i would have left in in my opinion team cap all the way and this movie goes all the way 55
Jun 12 2016,positive,very entertaining and one of the best marvel movies ever made
Jun 12 2016,positive,enjoyed watching this one
Jun 12 2016,positive,i dont get high reviews  the movie was a mix of action and long parts with too much dialog that you had to sit through to see the next action  the dialog parts were just too boring  i was not interested in the movie  maybe i am just not that much into superheroes   i loved deadpool and critics are rating this movie higher than deadpool  makes no sense
Jun 12 2016,positive,following the success of the winter soldier civil war once again reafirms the russo brothers talent for delivering exciting gritty and intense action on a big scale thoughtprovoking themes and expertly crafted characterizations that are true to its cb source all of this while at the same time introducing some new faces to this still expanding universe in an admirably organic manner a script somewhat reminiscent of bvs doesnt change the fact that this is one of the mcus best entries yet
Jun 12 2016,positive,might be the best super hero movie yet  i liked the story much more than i expected from the ads  i am bored with super hero movies that seem to fixate on introducing characters  this was a great story  keep captain america coming
Jun 12 2016,positive,best movie ive seen all year
Jun 12 2016,positive,now thats how you do a super hero movie dc are you taking notes it was great from beginning to end cant wait to see more spidey tom holland was a perfect choice for the roll missed me some hulk but hell be back for thor now if we could just get him a stand alone movie wed be all set
Jun 12 2016,positive,probably the best superhero movie behind the dark knight and definitely the best marvel film yet
Jun 12 2016,negative,just an over all stupid movie  only deadpool could have saved it but instead they brought in yet another peter parker
Jun 12 2016,positive,fantasic best of all the marvel movies ive seen but it felt more the the movie the avengers 2 should have been and not as much a captian america i love the kids playing spiderman
Jun 12 2016,positive,loved this movie for what my opinion is worth it was better than winter soldier and that is saying a lot just a great job of getting the entire cast involved and the action was excellent
Jun 12 2016,negative,overhyped and terrible illogical relationships theres one fight scene where spiderman has the upperhand then suddenly gets taken out and the character actually says couldnt you have done that earlier which actually is the problem with the entire movie characters have no substance they react however is convenient to the story with no continuity or consistency got bored and wanted to leave more than 30 minutes before the end not as good as xmen apocalypse very unbelievable character dynamics of wanting to kill eachother then suddenly friends again then wanting to murder eachother then acting like nothing happened plot was terrible all fanboy fun stuff and i havent even watched the previous movie due to lack of interest want my time and money back to see a different movie
Jun 12 2016,positive,really well executed i was wondering where marvel would go it seems every movie so far in the mcu ends up being some dire world threatening event after so many similar movies it will start to get old civil war took such a fresh take on super heroes it was all about the characters it juggled plot new characters conflicts back stories good villains and meta narrative perfectly     super impressed with it all
Jun 12 2016,positive,a must see for any superhero fan i would have liked to see a few more surprises i find marvel are putting loads into the trailers which is slightly annoying captain america was awesome as usual if not slightly more powerful wouldnt have thought he could take on iron man but nice
Jun 12 2016,positive,well worth your time not a flat note in the whole film great introduction of new characters in the mcu
Jun 12 2016,positive,one of the greatest superhero movies of all time great plot line side characters and themes
Jun 12 2016,positive,peggy carter would have kicked steve and sharons asses but eh what can you do heteronormativity oh and spiderman was really unnecessary truly his presence in the movie is just to advertise the rerenewal of the movies do we really need a third spiderman cant we finally have a black widow movie instead
Jun 12 2016,positive,fucking incrediblenuff said
Jun 12 2016,positive,marvel movies are normally well done this lived up to its expectation
Jun 11 2016,positive,team cap all the way
Jun 11 2016,positive,one of the strongest additions to the mcu captain america civil war is a satisfying actionpacked extravaganza boasting its impressively mature storyline
Jun 11 2016,positive,great movie good story line and action  new characters awesome
Jun 11 2016,positive,fantastic play i like captain so much
Jun 11 2016,positive,one of if not the best movie of the avengers movies
Jun 11 2016,positive,amazing well thought out and the intro of black panther and spiderman were top notch  must see
Jun 11 2016,negative,not worth rating what a waste of time worse yet way to ruin the character of captain america
Jun 11 2016,positive,i loved every second of this movie and i cant wait until the next movie marvel cooks up
Jun 11 2016,positive,an excellent superhero film easily in discussion for best marvel movie to date where other superhero films fail when putting too much into one movie somehow the russo brothers make it all work sacrificing only a small handful of plot holes if youre worried about not being able to follow the massive fight scene dont it has the most emotional impact of any marvel movie the story is smart and very entertaining and with solid acting by all especially newcomers this is not so arguably a must see
Jun 11 2016,positive,great movie and the saga continues
Jun 11 2016,positive,the best of the capt americas so far the civil war was believable unlike the nonsense of batman vs superman i mean really nice to see iron man a little more serious and appreciating the gravitas of the moment favourite moment the battle at the airport with a hilarious spiderman supporting best spiderman yet well worth seeing
Jun 11 2016,positive,the best spiderman movie ever    even more characters then ultranationalist  but didnt feel bloated like ultron did at times  the long run time left me still wanting more black panthers peformance is incredible  a few characters didnt get developed much as id hoped  like vision  scarlet witch but we did see the start of whats hopefully a great deeply intuned relationship
Jun 11 2016,neutral,i was excited to see this movie based on the reviews and the rottenness however i was extremely disappointed and literally hated this movie almost the entire 2  hours  the only redeeming quality was spiderman not even my love for robert downey jr could save this movie however i did give it 2 12 stars because of rdj
Jun 11 2016,positive,incredible action packed film with a shocking twist in the plot
Jun 11 2016,positive,2nd only to iron man marvel finally brought grit back into their saga i was getting tired of the
Jun 11 2016,positive,i thought it was really good and plot was amazing storyline made sense characters and cast palmed their roles really great
Jun 11 2016,neutral,it was lacking at the end it worked you up to some big battle that youre expecting to happen and then falls short into a miniscule story about a single characters stubbornness to see the bigger picture  the effects and battles were cool though  the story really lacks that juice at the end which was very disappointing  it just didnt live up to the hype for me so i will not be drinking the avengers juice today definitely not like the previous avengers movies
Jun 11 2016,positive,it was a awesome movie
Jun 11 2016,positive,one of the best super hero movies
Jun 11 2016,positive,dont like them fighting each other because none of it is for the kill nothing to die for so we dont get the best out of it
Jun 11 2016,positive,it may be just another episode in the mcu show but a very entertaining one nonetheless
Jun 11 2016,positive,excellent not a dull moment thought provoking yet with some mind blowing action sequences would watch again at the cinema which is a rare thing for me
Jun 11 2016,positive,i love this movie one of the best movies of the year its definitely a must see
Jun 10 2016,positive,ill be honest guys this movie was just a little too slow for me i know a lot of people are saying it amazed them when they first saw it but it didnt really amaze me i didnt really think it was that amazing its alright it was just too slow for me
Jun 10 2016,positive,great movie lots of action cant wait for the next one they need to keep putting out better and better movies so everyone is interested in watching all the universe
Jun 10 2016,positive,great story very unnecessary shaky cinematography
Jun 10 2016,positive,powerful conflict great acting with a wonderful story to follow makes this one of the greatest marvel movies to exist so far
Jun 10 2016,positive,marvell  libertarian theme  just in time
Jun 10 2016,positive,predictable but extremely beautiful and watchable at the ending the twist and fight was a little hard to suspend my disbelief for but the rest of the movie i was hooked
Jun 10 2016,positive,when a superhero movie never feels silly or kid oriented while watching you know it is truly special
Jun 10 2016,neutral,the first hour and a bit was really slow and boring but it picked up with action and turned into a good movie loved the new spiderman
Jun 10 2016,negative,good film but bloody hard to follow the plot
Jun 10 2016,positive,great movie strong addition to the marvel collection and setting up for a lot more moving into the future  go see it you wont be dissappointed
Jun 10 2016,positive,such an amazing film loved it
Jun 10 2016,positive,this movie was everything batman vs superman should have been great storytelling along with a great way of setting up characters for the future of the mcu one of the best movies so far this year truly a great way to start off phase 3
Jun 10 2016,negative,it is one of the worst marvel moviethe movie is too happythey said that the movie would be darkerim very sad with marvelit is because of it that i prefer dc 
Jun 10 2016,positive,ever since the trailer came out the world has been divided into two groups team cap and team stark as the excitement keeps on building we were waiting to find out who wins i personally was on team stark but i thought that cap would win because its his film not the avengers we would be extremely disappointed if it was not great the day we all waited came may 6th the day of the civilwar we enjoyed the movie it was good they really had no winner because they would have disappointed half of the marvel fans i felt that it was a great movie but a little more events could happen like deaths and all we are not at all disappointed if marvel makes blockbusters like this they are in for big success
Jun 10 2016,positive,best marvel to date towards the end i was gripping my pants it was so intense
Jun 10 2016,positive,captain america civil war is one of the best marvel movies up to date personally i would place it right after guardian of the galaxy in the second place
Jun 10 2016,negative,no different than the freak of the week tv episodes users the same theme as the last few super hero films too easy
Jun 10 2016,positive,finally a less childish movie from marvel funny but courageous enough to touch some serious themes
Jun 10 2016,positive,loved it probably has about a 20mins or so they could cut out of it though
Jun 9 2016,positive,a fun movie that handles a surplus of characters brilliantly and explores human themes like most superhero movies never do giving it a great distinctiveness character tension and thrilling action sequences is what it is built on but gives a sorry attempt for a villain that could have been better was almost pointless and wasnt needed
Jun 9 2016,positive,i loved it     the action sequences were amazing story was actually well integrated into the universe lots of thrills humor action and tear jerking moments yes i meant that one     black panther and spiderman stole scenes entirely cool and kick ass not to mention tom holland adequately played the spiderman we all wanted to be as a kid    and cap and iron man did the usual job as franchise anchors of delivering an altogether kick ass film while i feel like the film could have been better had they saved it for phase 4 or 5 with plenty more franchises and characters on hand or had they introduced more franchises in this story frankly it felt more melee than war i still loved the film    side note fox please give up and hand the x and fantastic four rights back to marvel studios the xmen continuity is a wreck and you reached strike three with the fantastic
Jun 9 2016,positive,fantastic my favorite marvel movie to this date i was very pleased with almost every element of this film
Jun 9 2016,positive,absolutely loved this movie there was great chemistry between everyone and the newcomers shined just as much as the leads which is a difficult feat i also liked the big location titles steve and bucky gravitated towards each other and sam and bucky had a banter that added years on my life overall it went past my expectations
Jun 9 2016,positive,love love this movie 
Jun 9 2016,positive,total blast even some of the expected twists still packed a punch do to the brilliant story telling and incredible action sequences
Jun 9 2016,positive,awesome movie definitely a must see
Jun 9 2016,positive,it is always interesting to see two super heroes going head to head i must say that this film was one of the best
Jun 9 2016,positive,one of the best marvel movies so far
Jun 9 2016,positive,im a huge fan of the mcu but this movie is nothing more than a ploy to introduce new characters who have upcoming films the reveal is interesting but the story is ludicrous and civil war battle is absolutely pointless
Jun 9 2016,negative,it was all action with no plot disappointed
Jun 9 2016,negative,this movie sucks balls
Jun 9 2016,negative,to many movies of avengers movies   together  apart what a waste of time
Jun 9 2016,positive,saw this three times at the cinema and each time i was not bored amazing film
Jun 9 2016,neutral,full of action and story character background but not enough to wow me
Jun 9 2016,positive,one of the best marvel superhero movies and this installment is better than the winter soldier it has humor and great action and the acting is as good as it need to be it probably is 20 minutes longer than needed but i was invested from the opening until the end a great escape to the movies for sure
Jun 9 2016,positive,if movies were ketchup this one would be heinz  everything else would be hunts
Jun 9 2016,positive,very good movie but most fiction cience
Jun 8 2016,negative,this movie sucked plain and simple people just jump on the bandwagon and automatically like this bullshit its a really bad movie
Jun 8 2016,positive,the first half is good not great but i can pinpoint the moment it turns great spiderman the second they introduce spiderman its like the movie remembers what made the mcu successful in the first place being different in a year of darkertoned superhero movies the welcome difference is marvel and its sense of humor once it picks that back up the movie becomes great
Jun 8 2016,positive,airport scene blow me away
Jun 8 2016,neutral,no title screen wtf its not called marvel thats what it looks like this was just as bad as the first avengers the pacing in this movie is really terrible it goes up and down throughout the movie and drags on during the dull moments way longer than needed it has some good actions scenes but not as good as the first avengers the best scene happens about 30 minutes before the movie ends then the final battle scene is just captain america the winter soldier and ironman punching each other they should have switched those and that would have made it loads better they through in spiderman and antman too just because they had the money to do so it works out great for that one battle scene but that is all there was it does have some comedic relief but it wasnt as good as age of ultron they throw in everyone from the avengers except thor and hulk just to make it more of an avengers movie i would not recommend seeing this in theaters maybe on dvd when it comes out and skip most of the slow parts
Jun 8 2016,negative,more like captain america civil pillow fight and shoehorned characters that people like just because
Jun 8 2016,positive,chris evans 5 stars  robert downey jr 5 stars  scarlett johansson 5 stars  sebastian stan 2  anthony mackie 4  don cheadle 3
Jun 8 2016,positive,loved this movie  the captain america movies are much better than the avengers movies by far  antman was fantastic and robert downey jr was solid as always  highly recommend
Jun 8 2016,positive,my favorite marvel movie yet this movie had a very good story although there were a lot of characters they all had a role and all got some screen time the captain america franchise continues to get better and better i also loved the characters they added into this movie such as black panther spiderman and antman slowly started off with iron man then added thor and then captain america made a couple of those then made the two avengers movies and then antman and deadpool and theyve already announced that theyre filming deadpool 2 black panther and another spiderman movie i love what marvel is doing with the mcu i hope they continue to expand and keep making awesome films
Jun 8 2016,positive,awsome movie something that i would see again
Jun 8 2016,negative,captain america civil war is overstocked with characters and drawn out action sequences there is little in the way of plot and the thought provoking themes are left superficial and uninteresting
Jun 8 2016,positive,loved the action scenes  great super hero action  it felt like watching a comic brought to life  all the heroes in the movie looked great  after some discussion with twanna i am on ironman side
Jun 8 2016,positive,already seen it multiple times it was action packed and every minute had me on the edge of my seat
Jun 8 2016,positive,plays more like an avengers movie but nonetheless is the rare superhero spectacle that doesnt get bogged down in its spectacle highly recommended
Jun 8 2016,positive,very good movie once again  marvel comes through with another blockbuster
Jun 8 2016,positive,would get 5 starts if the villains plan made more sense and if they didnt waste crossbones character and if they also made more sense of the government wanting control over the avengers but mostly good over all
Jun 8 2016,positive,what happens when u take our childhood heroes divide them and let them fight nerve wrecking soul shattering masterpiece of cinema deep characters believable conflict great action and amazing performances will keep you at the edge of your seats marvel and russo brothers did it again civil war is not just adaptation of comicbook story line its actualy logical step in developing mcu not all the time heroes can be united and share same vision of worlds problems and knowing the biggest threat is yet to come that makes it even more engaging
Jun 8 2016,positive,really good but i just wish they took more risks
Jun 8 2016,positive,brilliant action and full of great cast conflict being centered and live up fan expectation even with many superheroes russos brother cleverly funtioning every character and fill it with bright humor
Jun 8 2016,positive,i am not a big super hero fan however i was thoroughly impressed with this movie
Jun 8 2016,negative,eh maybe i just dont have taste but im not really a fan of all of these disney marvel movies they dont seem to break new ground or take chances with anything and all their characters are less than onedimensional i dont really know anyone else that doesnt like them though so maybe im just weird
Jun 8 2016,positive,awesome action good story line great characters awesome movie overall

Jun 7 2016,positive,almost perfect best marvel movie since winter soldier id correct spideys cgi thtas it
Jun 7 2016,positive,no onedimensional characters
Jun 7 2016,positive,this film is easily one of the best comic book films thus far with a great story that divides fans and fantastic introductions to characters joining the mcu it is hard not to grade this film well the biggest negative was once again the villain who seemed to be based highly upon convenience which was no surprise in the mcu
Jun 7 2016,negative,wow what an amazingdisappointment  it was a series of letdowns and depressing solutions  it was beautifully shot and acted  some parts were even fun but you didnt feel like celebrating at the end  its like going through a divorce where its not fun to watch or be in
Jun 7 2016,positive,really liked this movie great action good look at some of the other characters from the marvel universe
Jun 7 2016,positive,it was an average superhero movie at best marvel has a tendency to have repetition throughout their films unlike dc one thing i would like to mention concerning the critic consensus here on rt is that it says this film boasts a decidedly noncartoonish plot and the courage to explore thoughtprovoking themes i dont understand how this is praised for those characteristics while dc movies are constantly bashed for them
Jun 7 2016,positive,another one of the best marvel movies so far
Jun 7 2016,positive,nice to see spidey and ant man join in fun
Jun 7 2016,positive,good movie that gets me all tingly for the future of spiderman if nothing else since this was essentially avengers 25 im sad we wont get another movie with this many characters until infinity war in 2018 if you liked other marvel movies youll like this one plain and simple falls somewhere between winter soldier and age of ultron for me
Jun 7 2016,positive,great movie the marvel universe never disappoints although the title is captain america  civil war spiderman and antman steal the movie only complaint is that civil war wasnt a stand alone movie as it should have been
Jun 7 2016,positive,not only is the story strong and you completely see both sides this is the masterpiece in the mcu and i have to mention spiderman well done  a
Jun 7 2016,positive,this movie is really awesome interesting entertaining with the comedy action and drama combined the civil war between superheroes gives us a great moment
Jun 7 2016,positive,this movie is phenomenal fantastic story spectacular visuals action scenes  characters i cant wait to watch it again
Jun 7 2016,positive,now that was a good superhero movie  after hating xmen to my very chore i needed to reconnect with marvel the opening scene is very well filmed and gets you on the edge of your seat the avengers battle featuring spiderman and antman is perfect and is a pure delight to watch blackpanthers character is also very intriguing the battle between ironman and captain america is just a tat too long but hey why not 
Jun 7 2016,positive,avengers 25 not a captain america movie movie title has nothing to do with the comic book story line not bad but not great
Jun 7 2016,positive,entertaining popcorn movie
Jun 7 2016,neutral,movie was done well but the only problem i have with this is same i had with age of ultron way too much joking during what is supposed to be a serious battle it just took everything thing leading up to it pointless to me just not for me
Jun 7 2016,negative,this is movie is good but not as good for 90 on rotten tomatoes
Jun 7 2016,positive,great movie probly tied with avengers  for my 2nd favorite marvel movie just behind winter soldier the airport battle scene was by far the best action scene in any comic book movie total nerdgasm
Jun 6 2016,positive,definitely better than the disaster that was batman v superman although not as good as the winter soldier
Jun 6 2016,positive,best marvel effort to date civil war shows that superhero movies dont need to rely on humanityending stakes with the clichè explosions and big action scenes to be compelling
Jun 6 2016,positive,it saddens me that this is the commercial garbage which people are entertained by these days
Jun 6 2016,positive,can we get fox to sell the xmen franchise to disney because disney is doing such an amazing job with the marvel franchise right now
Jun 6 2016,neutral,captain america civil war is more of a soap opera than it is a superhero movie plot twists such as stark learning bucky killed his family while rogers knew and kept it a secret from him end up detracting from the point of the story which is that the government is trying to dictate what the avengers can and cannot do that is the point not that stark is fighting to get revenge for his mom and dad or that rogers is fighting to protect his best friend because of this the audience ends up getting sucked into a feud thats purely juvenile but what is worse is that all of the other characters end up having roles that end up becoming virtually pointless their opinions on what originally divided them is never fully developed or heard which is a missed opportunity and because of that the audience is alienated from their points of view which definitely should have been seen
Jun 6 2016,positive,im not a great fan of action movies but this one was really good entertaining funny and full of action captain america civil war is a great work from marvel entertainment
Jun 6 2016,positive,amazing  i am on team captain of course even though tony stark makes a good argument  anyhooenough of that  spiderman is amazing and i cannot wait for the new spiderman movie  this kid nails it and yes its a kid finally  loved the black panther and of course vision and the scarlet witch you can see a romance developing at least it is one sided from the vision  this movie delivers and the ending leaves you hanging a bit  happy with the falcon and hawkeye  love it  will be buying this for my collection and the extra scenes  if you havent seen it see it  comicbook fans and movie fans alike will enjoy this one
Jun 6 2016,positive,wow what a fun movie  i wasnt a big fan of the first captain america but i did enjoy the winter soldier though not to the extent of the critical acclaim that it received  i tried to avoid all trailers and spoilers so that i went in with as little fore knowledge as possible  with expectations kept in check i will state that i left the theatre thoroughly impressed  if dawn of justice showed us how not to do a superhero vs movie civil war showed us exactly how you do it  characters were given clear motives writing and cinematography were excellent  despite having some dark content the film gave us a few light moments here  there to give us an emotional break  by far my favourite captain american movie if not the best ensemble superhero movie to date
Jun 6 2016,positive,a film that sets the bar for future marvel flicks to come
Jun 6 2016,positive,outside of the slight misdirection of commercials and trailers they made the movie seem like the team cap vs team iron man fight was the focal point captain america civil war was once again another great blockbuster film with great action scenes exposition scenes and roster of characters the producers of the movie were right youre going to leave this film with a completely different view on both main characters
Jun 6 2016,positive,best comic book film yet i had too much fun
Jun 6 2016,positive,the whole universe being built up really helps civil war takes the mcu into new heights bringing in new characters and giving us the best spiderman yet civil war helps with strong directing from the russo brothers that balance out a huge story with so many characters and they make it work the story leads to a huge twist ending and a violent final fight but despite its serious tone we still have humor from these characters we have grown to love and our hearts break a little seeing them fight on to infinity wars marvel
Jun 6 2016,positive,this was a good movie i like all the capt movies that is the end of my review  now for my rant on reviews  it was very similar in theme to batman v superman though  both were good movies in my opinion  they both had similar problems  the main difference is this one was light hearted   almost too much as it kind of took away from what was going on   bottom line it was not 60 better than batman v superman  it was more what you expect from a super hero movie  which doesnt make it bad just not ground breaking  it would have been if they followed the comic books but then someone would have to permanently die in a marvel movie  the sad truth is had people not been so biased against batman v superman i probably wouldnt have noticed  frankly i was surprised at how many glossed over the issues with this movie and praised it for continuing to be like the other movies in the franchise and not pushing the envelope
Jun 6 2016,positive,outstanding the film itself is great as everyone has claimed but what amazes me is the buildup to these events ross dislike of superheroes starks attempts to prevent or prepare for the next big bad and ultimately failing almost flawless how these and many other ideas were intertwined and work so well in this film the action was close to unparalleled as classic marvel characters fought each other this is gonna be tough to beat
Jun 6 2016,positive,amazing movie  the best captain america movie from the trilogy  the title might refers to steve rogers but believe me  the whole cast just nailed it  from robert downey jr to elizabeth olsen everyone plays perfectly their parts and all together deliver what we call a marvel movie the action the story  the characters  everything is just perfect  im so proud to be a marvel fan because this movie shows what marvel can do  the russo brothers did an amazing job and cant wait to see what the will do with infinity war  the did something that no other director can do  they didnt made someone to look the bad guy at the whole movie i was changing sides and i couldnt be mad with someone  and the end makes me more and more excited about the infinity war  so congratulation to the whole cast and of course the russo brothers 
Jun 6 2016,positive,better than batman v superman
Jun 6 2016,positive,captain america civil war is not only the greatest  marvel movie of all time its one of the greatest films of all time
Jun 6 2016,positive,now this is a verses movie not like the other one from dc
Jun 6 2016,positive,theres something about some of the marvel movies that i find bemoaning when the first part of the movie is constantly being slowed down due to a bunch of gerbil that filmmakers feel the need to explain making sense to some but is hard to understandfollow for others bit of a buzz kill with that being said once spiderman managed to get himself in the mix this movie was awesome this actually brought aspects of the dark knight to the avenger team it got very dark very quickly i must admit my favorite moment was when tony stark plays around with spidermans tech that scenario was ingenious i dont want to say too much about this movie because i managed to avoid  spoilers like the plague and i am glad for it go see it if you havent yet you wont regret it
Jun 6 2016,positive,after the long wait and the huge build up captain america civil war lived up to its hype not only being filled with amazing action sequences boasting some of the best in the mcu yet it also is one of the most serious and emotion filled films to come from the mcu yet with its more mature story unlike some other films from the series this one causes you to think much more about what is going on as you try to decide whos side youre on which is difficult as arguments for both sides are solid and well thought out all this and the inclusion of two more amazing characters makes civil war easily one of the best super hero films made in the mcu or anywhere else
Jun 6 2016,positive,one of the greatest superhero movie of all time  i love how marvel ties in all of their movies  with heroes and antiheroes that you care about and relate to
Jun 6 2016,positive,it has amazing characters and performances an emotional and intense story and beautiful direction it just lacks the menace and consequence from films with powerful villains such as age of ultron
Jun 6 2016,positive,not a bad film for what it was as a kids filmnot quite sure how powerful heroes can lose the way some didit was nice seeing the new spiderman but other than that i believe the director could have told it better
Jun 6 2016,positive,so far best movie of the year
Jun 5 2016,positive,best one yet now waiting the next one
Jun 5 2016,positive,if people didnt love this something is wrong with them this has to be one of the greatest movies of all time as of right now its my favourite movie of all time 55 perfection an absolute masterpiece diehard marvel fan till the end of the line c what i did there best comic book movie made as of now best hollywood movie ever made as of rn
Jun 5 2016,positive,watched it twice already its some of the most fun youll have at the movies this summer
Jun 5 2016,positive,this is one of the best marvel movies to date
Jun 5 2016,positive,it can be slow at times the jokes dont always hit the conflict between rogers  stark doesnt quite seem like enough to carry an entire movie becoming a little repetitive at times along with an ending that kind of undermines the whole movie despite those complaints it is intense it is funny and it is a much more serious and dramatic marvel movie that raises the stakes and tension much more than most movies probably the best marvel movie to date
Jun 5 2016,positive,the perfect setup for justice league
Jun 5 2016,positive,a near flawless movie if they kept the same tone throughout the film
Jun 5 2016,positive,its amazing to think that less than a decade ago superhero films were completely independent of each other the characters that featured in them never crossing paths or interacting with the release of iron man however marvel studios introduced the concept of a shared universe in which all of their heroes would coexist and eventually team up to form the worlds first onscreen super team following solo adventures for each character 2012s the avengers was proof that all the studios hard work had payed off and now with captain america civil war the formula they introduced has been fine tuned and perfected by joe  anthony russo in order to produce possibly the greatest film the superhero genre has ever seen    as much avengers 25 as it is a sequel to captain america the winter soldier civil war brings together all the main players of the marvel cinematic universe along with a few new faces and pits them against each other over 2 and a half hours dividing the team is the sokovia accord a document signed by 117 of the worlds nations which is intended to keep the avengers on a tighter leash to minimise civilian casualties when the un deems it acceptable for the team to act its this accord which replaces the superhero registration act seen in the comic book storyline of the same name and is a great example of how marvel uses the events of one film to heavily influence another and take full advantage of their shared universe    on one side of the divide is steve rogers his ideology as captain america making him believe that the avengers shouldnt serve any countries agenda on the other is tony stark still struggling with his guilt after creating ultron while the two heroes have had disagreements in the past theyve yet to come to blows in a literal sense and witnessing it finally happen in civil war is satisfying as any superhero battle could ever hope to be in order to further muddy the waters between the two caps childhood friend bucky barnes  last seen being mind controlled by hydra as the winter soldier  has been accused of a terrorist attack in vienna leading iron man and his team of proaccord heroes to hunt down the oncesoviet weapon    while there is an antagonist in the film in the form of zemo  more on him later  each of the existing avengers that are present as well as the newcomers are treated as both the heroes and the villains of the film their motivations making it hard to determine exactly who is right and who is wrong the films marketing campaign urged fans to pick a side out of team cap and team iron man but in reality its not that simple when each of them is fighting for what they believe is right its because of this that the confrontation between the two sides is so engaging neither of them being guilty of fighting for the wrong cause but instead just the one they believe in and the fact that all of their actions are completely in line with what has already been established within the characters is a testament to just how carefully marvel treats their heroes on the big screen    this level of care is recognisable within the small character interactions that litter the film  whether it be during a set piece engaging in conversation or simply a throwaway joke the russo brothers are able to expertly balance both action and humour and while avengers age of ultron tried too hard to make everyone a wisecracking asskicking demigod to the point that it became irritating civil war has much more in common with the winter soldier tonally its this tone that makes each interaction and quip feel much more natural and earned and its pleasantly surprising to see robert downey jr play a much sterner version of iron man than has appeared onscreen previously which paves the way for sam wilsons falcon paul rudds antman and tom hollands spiderman to steal all of the films best lines    speaking of spiderman both he and black panther prove to be exciting additions to the mcu and fit right into the preexisting universe tom holland plays peter parker and spiderman as equal parts goofy and brainy expressing his interest in each of the heroes costumes and weapons as he dukes it out with them while chadwick boseman is excellent as black panther exhibiting composure and ferocity as he hunts bucky in order to carry out his vengeance the russos ability to juggle new characters amongst the old is extremely impressive and both of the new additions are used wisely within the films narrative their abilities and personalities shining through enough to understand who they are as individuals yet not so much that it takes away from the excitement of seeing their solo films in the coming years    if the thought of more superhero films doesnt make you experience euphoria however the airport battle that features within civil war almost certainly will this may not just be the standout scene of the film but also the greatest sequence ever featured in the superhero genre each of the characters being given a chance to showcase their own unique fighting style the russos proved that they could handle action scenes with ease in the winter soldier but this is unlike anything else seen in a superhero before an all out brawl which pits the avengers against one another and all of it being captured perfectly by the directors the interactions between the characters continue to entertain throughout this scene particularly spidermans amazement at standing alongside and against his heroes while the wall crawler and antman manage to steal the best parts of the battle as it escalates towards a climax of gigantic proportions    when theyre done fighting each other though the heroes turn their attention to the films primary antagonist whos been hiding in the shadows orchestrating the events playing out onscreen this antagonist is none other than daniel brühl who is excellent as helmut zemo a sokovian citizen stricken by grief after a tragedy that is all to relevant to the films plot its because of this tragedy that their is a hint of sympathy to be felt for zemo but make no mistake his plan is nefarious as it is meticulous the endgame being completely logical unlike lex luthors in the recent batman v superman and the character proves to be one of the best villains that the mcu has delivered so far    amongst all of these thrilling aspects however there are minor flaws to be found despite all of the characters featured at the heart of the film is a story about captain america and bucky and the lengths the former will go to in order to protect the latter its because of this that the film exists under the captain america title but its a shame to say that the titular hero doesnt receive any standout moments chris evans is on fine form as cap once again yet its the films new characters that linger in the memory after the credits and the two postcredits scenes have finished rolling     similarly some of the films smaller characters feel like wasted potential while all of the central characters are well developed and extremely close to their comic book counterparts agent 13 and crossbones are given very small roles when each of them could have occupied an interesting space within the mcu agent 13 as a modern day peggy carter and crossbones a recurring villain unfortunately they turn out to be nothing but bitparts in a film that is too big to properly justify their inclusion but with so many characters present it was inevitable that some would feature less than others    its also a shame that despite the film being a lot more violent than any of the previous mcu films it still feels very safe beneath the intense action sequences this is still very much a film aimed at all age groups in hopes of making 1billiom at the box office and marvel still have a plan which they have to stick to in order to properly tell the story they wish to tell while this doesnt make the film any less thrilling it does lessen its impact slightly knowing that the characters will return in just a few short years however satisfying that thought may be    captain america civil war is the best entry in the mcu to date and possibly the best superhero film to ever grace the silver screen both the characters interactions and the set pieces are handled masterfully by the russo brothers who now find themselves in the directors chairs for avengers infinity war if its even half as good as this bring it on
Jun 5 2016,negative,one of the worst films ive ever seen  only the 2nd movie in 15 years ive walked out on  very overrated
Jun 5 2016,positive,yeah sticks to comics fairly well  great intro to more marvel characters
Jun 5 2016,negative,i was almost about to sleep 3 times during the screening  no engaging story boring fight scenes and notsofunny funny partsdisappointed would be the word on this one
Jun 5 2016,positive,a very confusing plot
Jun 5 2016,positive,excellent story and featuring many storylines
Jun 5 2016,positive,a great flick spiderman
Jun 5 2016,positive,amazing feet of cinematic entertainment
Jun 5 2016,positive,best of the marvel movies so far captain america civil war explores some very human themes in the context of current political issues  how many of us would choose a friend in the face of overwhelming pressure to conform
Jun 5 2016,positive,more laughs than our 1861 civil war
Jun 5 2016,positive,one of my favorite marvel movies so far amazing addition to the brilliant franchise
Jun 5 2016,positive,amazing film with astounding cinematography i hated the character of vision but other than that this film is flawless
Jun 5 2016,positive,spiderman was the shining point in this serviceable yet disappointing film bogged down by a lengthy introduction when the hits come hard they ultimately come a tad too late for the viewer
Jun 5 2016,negative,loud and corny  too bad scarlet johanson has forgotten her great acting skills from we bought a zoo
Jun 5 2016,negative,spoiler warning    to put it blunt nothing happens the only major thing that happens is captain america losing his shield and thats it it makes me wonder why you would need to see the movie for the over all series rhodes becomes partly paralysed but thats fixed by the end of the movie what was good was the three new characters ant man spider man and black panther though they were more cameos for future movies the action was more show than meaning in fact the main fight really did not make sense and seemed forced what adds to the lack of purpose in the movie is how the winter soldier is lazily written off by being frozen again which also did not make sense  over all i think marvel had a good run on phase one ok on phase two and now slowly becoming boring
Jun 5 2016,positive,i give this an a96
Jun 5 2016,neutral,overated movieafter the story line im not a captain america fan anymorethis its what marvel came up with as the plot for the movie its important but not for a whole movieand villain is the worst i have seen nothing special
Jun 5 2016,negative,this new avengers movie w8its cpt americas really sucked pretty hard despite the good acting the plot is insignificant it has nothing to do with the civil war from comicsit looked like dodge ball gone wrong if they had settle this down at hawk eyes place without having to destroy an airport or bothering anyone else would have probably been better  the first part is so boring i would have killed myself becomes interesting in the second part with the fights aunt may is almost younger than peter wtf
Jun 5 2016,positive,an epic addition to the prestigious marvel cinematic universe
Jun 5 2016,negative,tony start is a different character i like the iron man from the 1st  2nd movie and the avengers
Jun 5 2016,positive,amazing movie really liked the humour
Jun 5 2016,positive,captain america civil war was great amazing acting by everyone especially spidey and antman and it was one of those movies where they thought about the plot and the script to make it look smart in a way
Jun 5 2016,positive,i came in the theatre with very low expectations for this movie following age of ultron and winter soldier  i know i must be the only one who didnt liked it    civil war was exactly what i never expected to see in such a movie  a deep plot with real concerns that is attached to a brillant humor reuniting a huge cast yet letting every caracter has his  her space in the movie  nowhere does that movie feels rushed it has the best twist ending i saw in a long time that even i has a comic book fan didnt saw coming and it introduce new caracter very well     overall a must see movie and probably the top of the summer so far
Jun 5 2016,positive,the best movie of 2016
Jun 5 2016,positive,brilliant movie with accomplice story ark for all of the characters while the bigining might be slow the air port sceane really makes up for it action is amazing while focusing in on every single chacter to the best amount of time so that it doesnt feel to crowded over all i highly recommend this movie as it is an awesome summer block buster
Jun 4 2016,positive,the best marvel movie yet
Jun 4 2016,positive,captain america seemed to be the villain in his own movie when he wanted to protect winter soldier not much of a civil war in the movie i say zemo plot  was extremely dumb and a waste of time only things good about this movie was all the superheros together and the 1st appearance of black panther and spiderman in the mcu
Jun 4 2016,positive,awesome the best one of all the dc avengers franchise
Jun 4 2016,positive,one of the best movies marvel has made
Jun 4 2016,positive,i really loved how nemo was orchestrating everything and his emotional beat in the end  the airport sequence is blockbuster fan boy joy really loved it just didnt bring something new and stay with me as hard as winter solider hit
Jun 4 2016,positive,very well done my favorite movie of the year so far
Jun 4 2016,positive,a thoughtprovocative yet actionpacked romp into the marvel universe
Jun 4 2016,positive,im gonna keep this nice and short loved the movie while some may argue it was lacking in some areas its still worth the watch its packed full of humor you would expect from the lovable comic book characters while still having the awesome action that you would expect from marvel overall rating 45
Jun 4 2016,positive,great movie filled with action comedy and a good plot with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing without losing you all together though called captain america 3 this is more like an avengers 2 12 sans thor and hulk setting up the inevitable avengers 3 part 1 also keep an eye out for the new peter parker which i honestly liked more than the last one as marvel prepares us all for a reboot of its spiderman reboot now with a less matronly aunt may
Jun 4 2016,positive,anoter great movie from the mcu not only are the older characters very solid but the new introduced characters manage to steal the spotlight in this characterpacked epic it may end up not being your marvel favorite but will certainly be on your top
Jun 4 2016,positive,oh my goddddd is all i have to say 
Jun 4 2016,positive,really the film that avengers 2 should have been
Jun 4 2016,positive,i liked it but it had too much politics for me to enjoy  superheros should be above the government not controlled by the government capt america was right
Jun 4 2016,positive,it mixes excelently the best of the winter soldier  and the avengers
Jun 4 2016,positive,this movie really brings the mcu to a hole new level
Jun 4 2016,positive,its a damn good watch
Jun 4 2016,positive,loved it  action was great
Jun 4 2016,positive,captain america civil war or as it should be called avengers 3 is the first entry in phase 3 of the marvel cinematic universe at just under 150 minutes this is a massive behemoth with high expectations this film was a great entry in the mcu whilst it wasnt as good as winter soldier or a few others it was still massively entertaining the plot was surprisingly thoughtprovoking with an excellent plot twist that changes the future of the mcu and the wide array of superheroes made for great banter the villain however was underused and unmemorable which is a waste of talent from the likes of daniel bruhl
Jun 4 2016,positive,i saw the movie and now i am in love with it
Jun 4 2016,positive,this was a kickass movie the action was amazing the emotion was real and it lived on the captain america legacy i was especially excited to have tom holland to be starring as spiderman overall excellent movie
Jun 4 2016,positive,captain america civil war is marvel at its best the action and emotion in this movie is at an all time high one of the mcus very best a long with the avengers favorite moments the airport fight scene giant man bucky and cap bucky and falcon black panther chase scene everything spiderman iron man vs captain america vision cooking and okay just everything awesome movie
Jun 4 2016,positive,this made me want a spiderman movie really bad i enjoyed the fight scenes but the plot was mediocre
Jun 4 2016,positive,this movie is all about consequences sorry but not sorry for the spoiler i appreciated the approach and premise but its a bit overdrawn to make a 3hour movie about it that and its still to be continued love the new characters overall a well done action adventure flick rating 8  10
Jun 4 2016,positive,this kind of ideas have creativity xmen should learn to have new thinkings
Jun 4 2016,positive,not a fanboy so i really loved some of the aspects that bothered those more dedicated to the comics okay story line awesome characters and great comedy
Jun 4 2016,positive,its a really good film from start to end and you cant help comparing it to batman vs superman and saying see this is how you do it dont be so stiff have a some fun your ordinance has seen it all before so dont bore them they know the characters so just have some fun it means the film is fast and for some will be generic and a blur as we have seen it all before but it is really well done the only problem with this movie is the next one they need a new villain we actually love and care about who wins we need a death we need a shock and to cry or this franchise is in real danger of feeding us so much candy we get sick of it
Jun 3 2016,positive,it was really good pf course capt is better than iron man
Jun 3 2016,negative,way too forced and unnecessary
Jun 3 2016,positive,it was very good however the plot was kind of all over the place and i thought the casting was excellent
Jun 3 2016,negative,sucked plain and simple thrown together and  wish i saved my time
Jun 3 2016,positive,freaking awesome movie disappointed by the ending
Jun 3 2016,positive,they topped winter soldier this was the best installment in the mcu yet  cant wait to see what happens next
Jun 3 2016,neutral,im vary bitter sweet about civil war black panther was awesome suit actor and all tonys heart crushing mind set makes me want to hug him and make him a hot glass of tea through out  the movie the new spiderman shows great potential and i hope to see him again the effects were spectacular as always the plot over all left me heartbrokenmy biggest problem is that it is a well done movie over all and for the people whove seen nothing but the movies theres is little to not like about but for the hard core fans or  just those that have read the comic books captain america civil war shows just a small fraction from its comic book origin and as one of those hard core fans it hurts deeply and the ending made me want to just stare and a blank wall for a few hours feeling the pain for the iron avenger i hope the next avengers movie will help me change this  sweet and bitter taste in my mouth
Jun 3 2016,positive,captain america is back and with him he brought a lot of new friends this captain america movie features almost all of the players from the avengers plus spiderman black panther and a nice extended cameo from antman great action scenes great story i was entertained from start to finish plus if youve watched and remember the other marvel films youll catch a lot of the witty dialogue  its one of the better superhero movies ive seen in a while and a massive improvement over the disappointing batman versus superman
Jun 3 2016,negative,its boring as hell not comic book related and just boring
Jun 3 2016,positive,my new third favorite marvel movie behind avengers and guardians of the galaxy  fun characters and script with a focus on a personal story to both cap and tony  the airport scene is also probably the most amazing thing ive ever witnessed in a theater
Jun 3 2016,positive,i didnt know who to root for great action and actors as always just left me a little conflicted
Jun 3 2016,negative,civil war was very uninteresting film the plot was hard to follow the plot also felt shoehorned in the movie has the word war in its it title and no one even got really hurt besides war machineoverall i give civil war a c
Jun 3 2016,positive,probably going to end up being the best comic book movie of the year
Jun 3 2016,positive,i loved this movie maybe not as much as everyone else but still loved it i love when these characters interact with each other the introduction to new characters the action scenes are great and that fight scene at the airport was great i look forward to the spin off movies and more avengers
Jun 3 2016,positive,amazing movie it doesnt go along perfectly with the actual 2006 comic book story line but it came very close this is one the whole family can see disney is doing a great job with their marvel cinematic universe i keep wondering when are the comic movies going to slow down if this movie answers that question at all its going to be awhile it definately had the best fight scene out of all mcu movies if not all comic adaptations together at the airport black panther and winter soldier brought the actionespecially handtohand combat to another level in this entry alot of critics say its another avengers movie and while theres nothing wrong with that its still a captain america movie when it comes down to it maybe cap on steroids compared to the previous 2 entries but still a captain america movie non the less it definately makes me excited to see a blank panther stand alone and totally turns my stance in another new spiderman movie around him and antman provided the right amount of comedy when needed theres just nothing bad i can say about this movie you leave the theater wanting more without feeling like you missed something looking forward to the next mcu entry in doctor strange this fall
Jun 3 2016,positive,personally i believe this is the best marvel movie to date the villains plan is not to destroy the earth or kill the avengers his plan is to tear the avengers apart apparently he succeeds this movie does have a lot of action but not as much cgi as avengers age of ultron the russo brothers know their comic books and know how to entertain the comic book fans definitely check this movie out
Jun 3 2016,positive,its a masterpiece   action packed with a ton of nerdgasm and thought provoking themes to the point you wont bother enquiring about its runtime its not just a better avengers movie than the last avengers movie but also the best ending to the mcus greatest trilogy  alongside amazing action sequences and opposing ideologies it manages to retain the humour weve come to expect while seamlessly introducing the regal black panther and arguably the best spidey yet  cemented with action scenes that have purpose and a villain with true motivation despite his brief role marvel once again achieves coherence with multiple characters its great to see tony starks backstory fleshed out in a devastating way while the cap storyline comes full circle with its refreshing and fitting tone alongside its breathtaking action captain america civil war kicks off phase 3 in a monumental way and will be remembered as one of the greatest superhero movie of all time
Jun 3 2016,positive,this movie is fantastic  its as thought provoking as the dark knight and as fun as the original avengers  i regret is that i cant give it 6 stars
Jun 3 2016,positive,i think this is the best one that mcu has ever made the story plot is good and joe and anthony russo did a good job they make it fun but the cgi of the film is a bit bad
Jun 3 2016,positive,i didnt enjoy this captain america film as much but i do like the other movie winter soldier a little better but extremely exciting definitely a summer film to go see
Jun 3 2016,positive,awesome action packed from start to finish
Jun 3 2016,positive,the story is about how captain america saved his old love at all costs and broke up with iron man and finally he proved that hes the one who always make things right
Jun 3 2016,positive,while not quite as good as winter soldier another great movie by disneymarvel well done making it where it was hard to choose one side
Jun 3 2016,positive,i think it was really hard make a movie with many characters but well done marvel
Jun 3 2016,positive,god i love marvel i think this is the best yet i love they add spiderman but not forget about antman adding his character is to the story line makes the movie even more fun to watch he plays his character perfect and always gives you a laugh cant wait till the next marvel film or tv show
Jun 2 2016,positive,decent story with some of the worst cgi i have ever seen in a megabudget super hero film i was taken out of the movie several times by the effects however the filmmakers made it easy to be torn between the two opposing sides which given the plot is no easy task
Jun 2 2016,positive,captain america civil war is a definitive end to the captain america trilogy with spectacular fight sequences character development and the introduction to two great marvel characters being black panther and spiderman the flow from the winter soldier also directed by the russo brothers was done flawlessly with only minor continuity issues which also meant people who have not seen the second film could watch it with very little questions of the story line the movie was perceived to be more of an avengers style movie but as anthony mackie quite rightly said it really plays well with the storyline of cap and how hes evolved into his own man him doing his own thing everybody coming together to fight for the common good of man there were five main character standouts to myself in this film and they were iron mantony stark black widownatasha romanoff black panthertchalla antmanscott lang and by far the best adaptation of spidermanpeter parker tom holland is everything a comic book fan would have been waiting for in spiderman and for all those with fatigue with the character trust me he will not disappoint or give reason to continue that fatigue black panthers introduction was probably the best as his character is almost seamlessly put into play with the avengers and creates an interesting dynamic going forward for the infinity war films in this film there is the best comic book movie fight sequence that has ever been seen and will leave you wanting more there is an incredible amount of spectacular visuals and great dialogue along with the political and humorous nature of this film works incredibly well and does not distract the audience from the plot or action in conclusion a greatly executed film with engaging dialogue with humour sure to have the whole family in laughter and realise that choosing your side was actually the hardest part to decide score 810
Jun 2 2016,positive,the film is just more of the same stuff marvel has been producing since iron man in 2008 dont get me wrong the movie is good but it isnt exceptional it doesnt feel as strong as most of marvels earlier films but is nonetheless enjoyable albeit a bit stale
Jun 2 2016,negative,went in to see this movie with my girlfriend she is a big united states conflict buffwas extremely disappointing none of it seemed to take place during the civil war every part of it was historically inaccurate if they are making a movie called captain america civil warmaybe make sure that it is blatantly obvious that it is in fact not about the great war that took many peoples lives a horrible spit in the face on a historical conflictit is not given the attention and care necessary for either side of the war
Jun 2 2016,positive,loved this movie it did a great job at putting all the characters together it was very good at having balance betwen dark and humor it was fun and spiderman stole the show i have been waiting for this spiderman he is perfect black panther stole the show too they also did a great job at buliding the new avengers vision and scarlet witch go see it over ninja turtles
Jun 2 2016,positive,probably as good as a marvel movie can get russo brothers youve done it again
Jun 2 2016,positive,very good but character development suffers a bit from  of characters
Jun 2 2016,negative,this movie made me sleepy  they fight each other and then they get back together without the captain  who will later join the team again  he is suppose to die and come back to life or wake from whatever sleep he is in and the rejoin team  doesnt matter he joins the team again  their version of story is horrible  comic series is boring but better than the movie  i forgot all about baron zemo    their marketing for the film was great  the movie itself is really disappointing
Jun 2 2016,positive,civil war is an absolutely fantastic addition to the mcu it is based on the very good comic book story arc by mark millar whilst not as big of a scale as its source material it delves deeper into the characters and gives us a more personal adventure this film enhances my trust in the russo brothers taking over infinity war like the winter soldier this film brings the psycological thriller genre to the mcu keeping it fresh the registration act is put in place due to the small trust the government have in these super beings these questions make sense can we trust this power whos responsible for the damage should power like this be monitored the heroes collide in one of the most mezmerizing battle scenes ever put to screen the russos do brilliant at creating creative action scenes of awe however shaky cam was a minor problem near the start of the movie the action does a splendid job of managing to create a cool battle whilst providing humour and fleshing out characters this done with some brilliant dialogue everyone in this movie has clear motivations the psychology of cap and iron man make sense we also find ourselves introduced to two new characters black panther is thrown into the story in a way that felt natural and not at all shoehorned his vendetta against bucky was a great way to blend him into the story casting chadwick boseman was a fantastic choice the movie even manages to develop tchalla spiderman was portrayed almost perfectly by tom holland this parker is younger and inexperienced this creates funny interactions between him and other characters holland looks the part and plays peter and spidey just like he is portrayed in the comics  the movie is certainly a big step for the mcu the ending left me unsure at first but upon reflection i realised the potential it leaves for future movies characters and relationships are developed well especially black widow and black panther the pacing of this film is even and exposition doesnt slow it down the cgi in some scenes do feel a little to polished and animated this doesnt affect the movie experience this movie had so much to carry and sees to hold it all with ease this film introduces spidey  tchalla brings in antman who was awesome sets up the registration act develops the characters and gives us more insight on them creates a relationship with steve and sharon brings bucky into the picture and shows us his and caps friendship gives us more than a few awesome fight scenes and creates a satisfying conclusion all in the runtime of 2 hours 20 minutes thats really impressive the russo have proved once again how masterfully they are are their job marvel supplied us with the greatest marvel movie yet
Jun 2 2016,positive,very fun a great spiderman all around a good job with this movie marvel keep it up
Jun 2 2016,positive,in my opinion the best marvel flick now marvelsthe avengers was a success because it was the first flick to involve multiple comic book heroes this one may not be the perfect adaptation of a comic book but the title civil war is justified but you can for the first time since the dark knight trilogy compare this to a real life situation just the idea not the gimmicks of course being titled captain america the movie is more sympathetic to caps view infinity war may see others aspects too they could have involved maria hill and nick fury somehow but they were probably trying not to make the flick bloated thats where it has succeeded over dcs dawn of justice and of course much better characterization and acting top marks atomic complaints with the plot at the most i would give it 95
Jun 2 2016,positive,loving all them varvelers
Jun 2 2016,positive,this is the second avengers movie people were hoping age of ultron wouldve been and for the bucky barnes lovers its part 3 in his saga which were excited to hear will go on in infinity wars
Jun 2 2016,positive,not really a captain america movie more like avengers 25 which isnt a problem however though i enjoyed it i wasnt overly impressed with it spiderman was hands down the best part of the movie
Jun 2 2016,negative,not for me i really wanted to leave the movie theatre and dont understand the 90 on rotten tomatoes the beginning first third or half was ok
Jun 2 2016,positive,although its not quite as good as the winter soldier its still a great marvel movie the plot is interesting and adds new characters to the big screen i would definitely go see this movie again
Jun 2 2016,positive,awesome movie gets better each time hope they can keep up the momentum
Jun 2 2016,positive,im excited to see where the story lines are going and i really enjoyed seeing some of the backstories that are getting fleshed out
Jun 2 2016,positive,it was good but in my opinion this is not my favourite marvel film
Jun 2 2016,neutral,this is such a disapointment after winter soldier probably my favorite marvel avengers movie the plot makes no sense there is little character development just a lurch from one action scene to another
Jun 1 2016,positive,excellent great loved it thanks i want more and more
Jun 1 2016,negative,more like civil bore  punch someone throw something say cool line  repeat for two and a half hours and then take advil  id be fine with a break from super hero movies for a good 510 years
Jun 1 2016,positive,another amazing movie
Jun 1 2016,positive,great action movie also great character development and story arcs
Jun 1 2016,positive,captain america civil war is a few notches above the average marvel movie thanks to an exciting premise and good effects the movie is overlong and by now all these marvel spinoffs and sequels are starting to lose their edge it seems like now its only about the money
Jun 1 2016,positive,writing as an occasional marvel viewer and one not privy of the other realms and media outlets of the marvel universe captain america civil war does not disappoint in delivering an action packed and comedic viewing experience    civil war deals with an issue superhero films have seldom dealt with  the regulation of such bodies as the avengers this serves as a fresh and thought provoking story arch which includes ample names from the marvel universe one could be forgiven for mistaking civil war for an avengers movie given the high level of character interactions    spider man is also debuted once again back into marvels world which is done excellently with a truly funny sequence of events leading up to the main spectacle    with a cornucopia of emotion provoking scenes and a broad story arch civil war is a must watch for any fan of the captain america franchise
Jun 1 2016,positive,not the best mcu movie to date that was captain america the winter soldier but easily my favorite right now let me watch it 15 or 20 more times before i let you know if its my permanent favorite as they all are within a few months of their releases
Jun 1 2016,positive,it was a great movie i saw it after the premiere night on may 6 and i think this i one of not just the best superhero movies but one of the best movies ive ever seen i highly recommend you see it
Jun 1 2016,negative,wow  i dont understand all the positive reviews  i usually like marvel movies but this was pretty terrible  it was too long and frightfully boring  the spiderman character was ridiculous  such a disappointment
Jun 1 2016,positive,ive seen it 3 times and have never been bored during any of the times i watched it i think this is the best work by marvel to date
Jun 1 2016,positive,captain america civil war is the latest installment in the marvel cinematic universe and oh my god this movie did not fail to deliver the movie has everything action drama comedy the movie keeps the audiences on their in every action scene captain america vs crossbone to the airport fight scene tom holland as spiderman is the best onscreen spiderman he completely nailed the character as a nerdy fanboy peter parker with signature wittiness and   humorous one linear in the end captain america civil war is one of the best marvel movie up to date surpassing deadpool
Jun 1 2016,positive,i was one of the greatest marvel movies ive ever watched very well construct i used to hate capitain america but chris evans with great performances changed my mind
Jun 1 2016,negative,plot was ridiculously implausible  thanks for saving the world but some people died so we have to hold you accountable is the basic theme   there were some funny parts but over all a huge disappointment and not worth the price of admission  waste of time
Jun 1 2016,positive,more aptly named civil disturbance still amazing to see so many characters interact well together on screen with nods to other story arcs and seeds planted of what could be next
Jun 1 2016,positive,similar to what iron man did for starting the mcu back in 2008 civil war is the perfect start to phase 3 while it does feel like an avenger 25 civil war had a great story definitely emotional and fantastic characters in the movie thankfully marvel got the rights back to spiderman because tom holland is the best portrayal of spiderman ive seen so far along with great performances from basically everyone chadwick boseman as black panther was a fantastic addition to the mcu and gets me more excited for his solo movie in 2018
Jun 1 2016,positive,when it comes to superhero movies you want to be engrossed in action while still given the opportunity to stop and think civil war delivers both with a steady barrage of beloved heros you didnt know you wanted black panther spiderman etc the audience is kept on their toes as the villain of the movie turns out to not be who he seems the selfawareness perpetrated through questioning what many viewers dont think about gives the movie a fresh feel and leaves moviegoers questioning the actions of any other hero movie they watch
Jun 1 2016,neutral,hated the camera work it was all over the place
Jun 1 2016,positive,great movie really enjoyed it it was full of action which you expect from a good marvel movie
Jun 1 2016,positive,captain america has beaten the dark knight for best trilogy
Jun 1 2016,negative,bland dialogue adds just an excuse to have heroes fight each other like 12 year olds  this is what happens when disney fires joss whedon
Jun 1 2016,positive,great movie great plot great action great new character introductions great fight scenes great movie
Jun 1 2016,positive,this movie was really good just that some scenes was a bit corny for me the cinematography in this movie was really good though the angletaking from the camera were really clever the way they characterised baron zemo was a bit strange for my taste because the version on the movie and on the comics were really different and it just doesnt suit me however the way they portray the war was pretty good and the amount of action and theoretical stuffs were truly well balanced
Jun 1 2016,positive,this was a good fun movie  though it seemed a bit long and too much flash with not enough substance and therefore a letdown compared to the winter soldier  it still seems odd that this wasnt labeled as an avengers movie  i would have preferred this film to have been a more personal piece between cap and bucky  as it was despite its runtime this was little room for much more than mindless action  that being said it was done well but again it felt more like an avengers movie than a captain america one especially since it was largely a direct sequel to age of ultron
Jun 1 2016,positive,the best superhero movie i have seen in a long time
Jun 1 2016,positive,the whole movie was just excellent
Jun 1 2016,positive,this movie surprised me in a couple ways possibly because i refuse to watch every freaking trailer or teaser that reveal far too much or possibly because its just that damn good   there are things here that i cant talk about due to spoilers so ill keep it suitably vague   for starters this is a great film the perfect mix of action humor character and storytelling these movies continue to to challenge and go beyond what is expected out of these types of movies   for a movie like this a comic book movie to make me care and feel more about these characters than any decent drama has in a long time is really saying something by the end i found myself truly saddened and bothered by what i was seeing on screen this is not a negative thing i love it   by now everyone knows spiderman makes an appearance in this and its done perfectly the kid who plays him is great and the humor is spot on   i love that this string of moviesavengers and cap films specifically address real world issues collateral damage  is something almost no one wants to talk about its a side effect of freedom with a capital f so its no big deal right wrong innocent people die while heroes are supposedly saving the day from the bad guys   i have to process it a little more but this may be the best of all the marvel films so far
Jun 1 2016,positive,i have never laughed so much during a fight scene a proper change up from the usual array of overly complicated colors and shapes blurring in front of your eyes in which we are impressed through confussion more than actual story telling skill   you can feel in all four corners of the screen the desire to instil a pumping heart surrounded by a few funny bones in the movie the i could do this all day line in particular is a great throwback to the start of the marvel series with it pressing down on your chest like a welcome hug from a long lost friend   the introduction of new characters spidermanblack pantherantman is full ear to ear smile experience and one that you mention as soon as your cheeks leave the cinema seat popcorn kernels and all  if you a fan of marvel youve already watched it if you a fan of a moderately lengthy film but one that leaves you feeling upbeat and wanting to try that backflip you reckon you can pull of then give this a go you wont be disappointed  oh an no portal in the sky with a million cgi critters coming through the dark puppeteer of this adventure has depth chaos and intrigue to keep you watching
Jun 1 2016,positive,basically this is just a very long fight scene
Jun 1 2016,positive,a valant effort at compiling the epic civil war into a movie however not the greatest superhero movie of all time
Jun 1 2016,positive,best superhero movie of all time
May 31 2016,positive,captain america 3 civil war was made by the russo brothers who have also made another hit marvel movie the winter soldier they have done such a great job on the winter soldier that this movie was already known to be a sure hit marvel wanted them in particular for this movie because of what they have accomplished thus far this movie is a complete turn in comparison to most action movies instead of fighting villains they actually leaned towards fighting the other heros turning on each other there is quite a bit of drama with constant changing of personalities and attitudes on the situation   the directors decided to not use thor or the hulk but in turn they did decide to finally include spiderman spidermans personality was quite different in this one than some of the other spiderman movies then again that tends to be a recurring tendency with spiderman they still brought a man with a very boisterous attitude and very talkative he is constantly talking and regardless of the seriousness of the situation   they do not ever disclose on what supposedly happened to thor and the hulk though they do mention it once in the movie that they are missing and none of the other than avengers know what happened  the biggest part of the movie is that they are all forced into the realization of the aftermath of all of the past battles they have had although before they never thought about the damage they have done now they are simply being reminded of it they no longer view it as collateral damage but as an unacceptable loss they all must make a decision to sign a contract with the government to continue being avengers or be vigilantes  retire they can either go with tony stark who contrary to what you would think believes in submitting to a higher government or they have the option to go with captain america who is leading the group as vigilantes they are all criminals after beginning that route but they believe its the only way they are constantly faced with many challenges both physically and emotionally bringing back many past memories and hardships the criminal is constantly trying to rip them apart making them divided and fight against each other many of them are constantly making their decisions and are torn on which side they should fight for they have many fights but the finale is not unlike that of batman versus superman it was very intense and very emotional it will catch you in their intense passion for what they are fighting for just as tchalla says near the end  vengeance has consumed you its consuming them i am done letting it consume me  if you are someone who is into action movies this is the right movie for you its almost nonstop gripping action with but brief intermittent rests it has a level of sentiment that you can relate to the armrest clenching heart stopping shocks are something you definitely wont miss out on with this movie
May 31 2016,positive,i enjoyed civil war a lot certainly more than bvs but it was still more spectacle than narrative zemo was a bore and crossbones was a waste it feels exactly like the kind of bloated overstuffed and ultimately disappointing crossover event on which it is based    there were also so many trailers teasers tv spots and featurettes released that the movie felt like a series of ruined jokes and surprises oh hey its that crossbones scene from those early production stills oh hey its that building explosion from the teaser oh hey its that antman scene they released online oh hey its that fight scene from the trailer oh hey its spidermans funny line from the tv spot etc etc the movie wasted all of its surprises in its marketing campaign
May 31 2016,positive,marvel just overall nailed it action was spectacular not too slow like in most movies it felt genuine and raw i became engrossed in the film couldnt stand cap and iron man fighting felt like a family getting divorced
May 31 2016,negative,boring and corny some characters were 99 lame oneliners natasha threw a straw basket from pier 1 and knocked the bad guy out damn those splinters there were some good scenes for resting your eyes andor naps i dont think i blinked through the entire xmen apocalypse movie now those are fighting scenes
May 31 2016,positive,fully expands the superhero genre into new depths with a dynamic and thrilling storyline
May 31 2016,positive,a decent movie with amazing effects but the kind of movie i forget about 15 minutes after i see it
May 31 2016,positive,the goat of marvel films in my opinion
May 31 2016,positive,the first hour drags a bit due to the russo brothers having to tie up all the loose ends left from the mess that was age of ultron however once captain america moves forward with the winter solider it just gets better and better with every scene
May 31 2016,positive,this was a very good movie  the only thing i have a problem with it is that some of the dialog went on for a little to long  even some of the fighting scenes went on for to long for me  still a very good movie
May 31 2016,positive,if i tear myself in half dont come back for me    due to the mass destruction caused by the level of the missions the avengers have faced the government wants more knowledge and control of their actions  too many people seem to die while the avengers are saving the planet and iron man agrees while captain america feels collateral damage is part of the job  the two rival and the avengers as we know them pick sides meanwhile a villain may try to take advantage of the split avengers    the futurist is here gentlemen he sees all he knows whats best for you whether you like it or not    anthony and joe russo directors of captain america winter soldier you me and dupree and episodes from the television series lucky and arrested development as well as the upcoming avengers infinity war 1  2 delivers captain america civil war  the storyline for this picture is fairly straightforward with some great introduction of new characters and splashes or magnificent action scenes  the special effects are remarkable but the film relies on them a bit much    this job we try to save as many people as we can sometimes that doesnt mean everybody but if we cant find a way to live with that next time maybe nobody gets saved    we went to the movies to see this opening weekend and found it very entertaining and well done  it wasnt perfect or as good as the first avengers movie or first iron man but it was fun and well done  overall this is a wonderful addition to the genre with a bit of cheese and an unfulfilling ending for those who read the comicsgraphic novel this story was based on the conclusion could have been betterbut definitely a must see for fans of the marvel universe and super hero genre    we dont really need to start a conversation    grade b
May 31 2016,positive,this was the worst captain america movie so far  and the worst marvel movie in a while  too slowly paced for me
May 31 2016,positive,while i would halfheartedly recommend this movie i have to acknowledge its plot holes and lack of direction including using fight scenes to make up for lack of story filled with likeable characters this film manages to meet my expectations of being just another superhero movie which is as silly as the rest but it somehow leaves something to be desired
May 31 2016,neutral,this movie is a like a 10 year old childrens fantasy pitting two teams of good guys against each other just to serve the juvenile desire of seeing who is stronger the whole registration plot has essentially been the backbone of the xmen story for decades and when someone actually gets hurt during the time they spend trying to kill each other they act all offended and surprised what did they expect to happen while dropping cars on each other and firing lasers and arrows at each others heads and someone please get tony stark some help have any of his socalled friends noticed how depressed the man is
May 31 2016,positive,aint nuthin wrong with that
May 31 2016,negative,i love super hero movies but i got to say this movie was disappointing the action and fighting scenes are all over the place the camera shakes so much that you dont even know what is going on they need to make better fighting scenes where you can actually follow the fighting sequence the avengers 2 was the same thing they need to learn from jackie chans fighting scenes captain america is a blockbuster movie they are expensive to make the studios should spend the money in the fighting scenes too much cgi and nothing looks real anymore i can just stay home and play a video game and the graphics are going to be so much better the story line was lame they portrait captain america as hes doing something good when in reality hes helping a bad person who has murdered a lot of people get away and be free the worse part everyone is trying to help him i never write reviews but im very close to never watching another super hero movie again
May 31 2016,negative,what an amazing piece of childish garbage this is besides displaying superheros showing off their confusing abilities and chewing on half baked lines of dialogue that seem robbed from the facebook wall of a medicated teenager ill with overflowing insecurities what are these films doing in terms of storytelling emotional connections or believable character development to see what you was and witness what you have becomewhat a pity hollywood what a painful pity
May 31 2016,positive,great but drawn out    being a fan of iron man  captain america  i found that this film was played up more than it truly delivered i still recommend seeing the film but i found myself wondering how much time has past since the movie started because it felt that the story line or lack there of was being very drawn out    there were a few good action scenes as well as starks jokes here and there
May 31 2016,positive,this is the one film i had to see twice in one night because it was just so good and brilliantly done 910 on my scoreboard
May 31 2016,positive,i like it so fun spider man was in it and black panther was it black panther was criying because his dad died
May 31 2016,negative,these are horrible movies weak plot same old storylines boring actors
May 31 2016,positive,excellent installment to the franchise black panther and spidey stole the show
May 31 2016,positive,marvel just imporves themselves by this movie a great story along with watertight screenplay and it deeply explores all the characters at a length of 147 minutes it did not feel boring or long even for a minute which i think is a rare achievementblack panther and spiderman are greatly introduced to the mcu and i look forward to more of them the fight sequences are just out of this world especially the scene in which both teams clash it just entertains you alot with its action sequences character interactions and their relationships and some hilarious humour also overall it is the best mcu movie till date and one of the best superhero movies of all time a big screen experience not to be missed
May 31 2016,positive,must see in imax the airport scene ftw
May 31 2016,neutral,i have no loyalty to anything other than to a high standard and what i want out of a film i have seen everything from dc and marvel starting with batman in 1989    after seeing iron man v captain america dawn of avenging civil war im probably one of the few who not only appreciates but prefers the batman v superman film over the latest blatantly similarly themed marvel hero vs hero film its not the first time critics have been wrong or that fans emulated the responses of their beloved critics but it has revealed to me much insight into why they seem to sit on such opposite ends of the spectrum    i really wanted to like this film more than i did first having seen batman v superman and then as well as judging it upon its own merit marvels entry is everything you would expect minus maybe giant man if you didnt see a trailer with that part in it at the time its straightforward vanilla and palatable to general audiences it reinforces liberal and conservative binary political stereotypes as well as sanctioning the idea of submission to authoritarian government control visually it fits right in with the mcu and the rest of their almost completely forgettable scores    nothing sums it up more than when cap says if we sign this we surrender our right to choosewe may not be perfect but the safest hands are still our own never mind that whole no you move eulogy speech however half the avengers sign themselves away with the sokovia accords without skipping a beat without question without even genuine honest discussion among themselves and rebellious tony stark is immediately on board all because he is guilt tripped by one mother no one ever speaks up and says hey how many more lives would have been lost if we hadnt intervened in ny sokoviastarks mess and of course nigeria dont the avengers exist to specifically bypass the limitations of governments to take care of threats they cant handle on their own yes but no one mentions that at all    further displaying their wonderfully efficient team dynamic everyone takes their side on the issue after a brief exchange of disagreements and goes off to do their own thing eventually needing to recruit more people to fight their personal battle for them including a teenage spiderman a cool call for moviegoers to enjoy but arguably another irresponsible call for stark what is even more ridiculous is that after realizing he was wrong about buckys involvement which sparked the whole thing tony still just takes all his pent up anger about his parents death out on captain america and bucky unrelentingly playing the part zemo had set up for him even after being made aware of it in that case maybe i do understand why tony stark is so willing to submit to control after poor judgment calls like ultron and his fit of rage he is more of a loose cannon than anyone else on the team maybe even the absent hulk    how could anyone trust these 100 countries and their corrupt governments to properly manage and use the avengers as their will thats how another vietnam or afghanistan or gaza strip but worse begins how can anyone defend submission to government control in the usbecause they know whats best for uswhen the whole country is founded on the idea of choice and rebellion against an oppressive government so because a small percentage of the general public and governments especially fear the power these individuals have they have to respond with their own flex of power yes of course there are going to be casualties whether it be war any kind of conflict or life in general i personally would feel safer with the avengers out there combating villains saving everyone they can while still in full control and able to put governments in check when they too get out of line    dcs approach in bvs without going into too much detail here is darker more symbolic and psychological scratching at the surface with an emphasis upon questioning ourselves our beliefs our perspective our reality with great analogical religious parallels it is visually more arresting and with a memorable score that enhances the on screen drama    i know this is sensationalized reality like any comic book story but while civil war feeds us another easily digestible dose of colorful oneliners and fun packaged in what weve all come to expect from marvel films which is good the other challenges established norms and further invites us to delve into humanities dark psyche which is better personally i will always prefer and find art more relevant when it challenges established thinking and power structures versus those that mirror or reinforce them it doesnt matter what the press saysor the mob says doesnt matter if the whole country decides that something wrong is something right
May 31 2016,negative,boring obvious plot poor attempt to compete with bvs spiderman is its only saving grace
May 31 2016,positive,it was good but too many countries were being shown
May 31 2016,positive,great movie well paced never bogged down everything i hoped for and more
May 31 2016,positive,civil war is a huge marvel event and as i feared this movie suffers from trying to fit too many things into a single movie if ever there was a time to make a two part movie this was it it is still an enjoyable movie with great action sequences and special effects
May 31 2016,positive,its a decent movie with the fighting scenes being the only entertaining parts for me
May 31 2016,positive,best movie in the mcu so far
May 31 2016,positive,slow to start though entertaining captain america civil war had unexpected plot lines when the united nations wants to begin oversight of the avengers program it is ironman who is in full agreement and captain america who opposes it clearly this is a deviation from past films where captain america stood for authority and ironman was the independent spirit    the movie introduces two new characters the black panther and spiderman the latters character as a talkative teenager intent on gaining tony starks approval the movie appears to be a vehicle to set up a new course of storylines for the future
May 31 2016,positive,enjoyed didnt like he died    wonder woman is an extra add
May 31 2016,positive,by far the best cap movie ive seen  highly recommended if you havent already seen it
May 31 2016,positive,very good movie we have the impression to see avengers the actor of spiderman is less interest
May 31 2016,positive,civil war is soooo good better than bvs and so action packed i adored all the characters  cw is fun bold blowminding emotional truly epic and with a very balanced story
May 31 2016,positive,honestly this movie was one of the best movies ive ever seen
May 31 2016,positive,amazing special effects
May 30 2016,neutral,although marvel tries to reach out just a little bit more it ultimately falls short in the goals it set for itself showing more of the same and less of the sane    captain america civil war follows the aftermath of the events of ultron as steve rogers leads the team of the new avengers after another fatal incident it comes to fruition that the superhero program is growing out of control and something has to be done the new compromise will send ripples between families and civil war will ensue     this is probably one of the most difficult and disappointing reviews ive ever had to write after putting much thought into this film and how it played out ive come to a very disappointing conclusion ive long anticipated this film ever since it was announced and ive been drooling at the thought of a dark serious and emotional marvel film even if it doesnt turn out to be that that doesnt mean it still cant be good however after much conflict between myself and my morales i have to say that this was a mediocre if not below average film     writing a film of my own my perception of dialogue has changed a lot not only am i more picky but i notice lazy dialogue a lot more easily although the russo brothers have shown that they can direct story driven films nothing here felt that captivating other than some comical one liners during the action scenes i was bored by most of the dialogue going on it seemed like it was real easy to write it wasnt too mind boggling impressive and no one ever said anything really that powerful the dialogue here was lackluster at best and most critics passed over it for the fact that this was a marvel movie    even though civil war is printed on the front cover this is not a story about that rather its a story about captain americas relationship with bucky barnes and how he must sacrifice everything in order to save that im perfectly happy with the fact that they focused heavily on that aspect and the personal journey of each character but this was a misleading title in all retrospect for me it just doesnt make too much sense as to why the story lines of bucky barnes and the avengers are intertwined i felt like these couldve been two completely separate movies but they were more or less mashed up to create one movie i like each idea separately but not together i just dont see everyone agreeing to basically fight over this one entity even if they are fighting for a bigger picture    surprisingly i just didnt like the acting in this movie it just didnt feel as natural to me as it did in other films and the flow just wasnt right i dont know if it was their chemistry with each other at this point the lack of meaningful dialogue or just poor execution on their part i felt like this wasnt chris evans or robert downey jrs best performance and they both looked tired however the brightest actors in this movie were the ones with the least amount of screen time actors such as paul rudd and tom holland x show that they do belong in the marvel cinematic universe and they play their characters perfectly although i wasnt the biggest fan of the ant man film i certainly love paul rudds portrayal of the character even though i loved andrew garfield im certainly supportive of tom holland and i cant wait to see what he does next    except for the one big throw down between all the major powers i wasnt too impressed by the action either it was just more of the same stuff the camera work was shaky or it looked very cgi the action was entertaining enough but whos to say i cant watch the same action scenes in any other marvel movie yes the superhero brawl was spectacular all of the characters personalities shined in the moment combined with humor and surprises and it was probably one of my favorite showdowns in marvel history however most everything else felt bland    like i said i do enjoy the concept and the idea of the story i just feel they didnt execute very well the thing i was most looking forward to was the fact that there wasnt really going to be a villain in this movie arguably there wasnt any villain but dont be mistaken there was someone puppeterring everything or at least they tried to make it seem like that baron zemo is the hidden driving force of the movie whether you realize it or not yeah the whole united nations approval for battle ignites the civil war but hes the prime reason for splitting up this family of superheros they tried to be smart with his character and they tried to make him a meaningful villain but he wasnt and it just felt like a waste i wouldve preferred it if 100 of the conflict came from the superheros themselves rather than at the hands of some powerless unmotivated nobody they do a good job of showing both sides giving you reason to root for both sides but they were unable to go the full mile by executing it without a real villain per say     this is meant to dig deeper into the minds of each character but it just doesnt do that if you really really think about it we werent given any real reason to follow along with the characters or this story although he says it i just never felt like steve rogers shouldve actually abandoned the entire avengers program causing havoc among nations just for bucky the incident with scarlet witch was none more too devastating than what other big names caused clint barton showed up out of no where to join a fight he had little reason to fight for i guess because scarlets brother saved his life iron man did get some depth but half of it felt forced and generic while the other half didnt really add up and although black panther was a very nice addition to the cinematic universe his character was much too one dimensional and erratic to become likable or relatable yes he did have a character ark by the end of the film but he was so blindly driven that i was given no reason to cheer for him    in the end ive only felt that two marvel movies were deserving of a rotten rating the incredible hulk and thor i never thought that civil war would be the next thor for me i was so disappointed on many levels and the more i think about this movie the worse it gets because of all these flaws i feel as if i have no other choice but to execute this movie marvel is doing the same exact thing over and over again and until we start to speak out about it this phase of superhero movies will grow old very soon before you know it
May 30 2016,positive,this movie is without a doubt marvels best work it is action packed while also devealoping the characters of the mcu such as black panther and buckey there were absolutly no flaws in this film
May 30 2016,positive,great movie great action
May 30 2016,positive,plot differed from that in the comicsgraphic novel  great action scenes and lots of them  new characters including black panther introduced  thor and hulk absent  new version of spider man debuted  worth seeing on the big screen if you liked the previous avengers movies or were a fan of the comic books
May 30 2016,positive,if civil war isnt the best marvel film to date it certainly ranks up there it ties the mcu threads together most effectively and its almost all character based which makes it all the more hardhitting from a personal and thematic standpoint it also nails the introductions of black panther and spiderman while offering up several fantastic set pieces and is just an overall joy to watch marvel once again has shown how it is done
May 30 2016,negative,a lot of this movie does not make sense
May 30 2016,positive,i miss the winter soldiers maskeyeliner aesthetic but when he threw that battering ram with one arm  then stole that motorcycle i forgave him     black panther is amazing  the action scenes are top notch and the movie  flows enjoyably for over 2 hours       i really dislike the avengers films because they have too much crap going on and theyre too muddied with all the characters  this movie had most of the avengers but its well balanced and perfect
May 30 2016,positive,what separates what the avengers universe is able to do so often especially in these last two installments of captain america is the elegance these films have    the inner conflict starks feel is real the loyalty cap shows for his friend is admirable the youthful glee of spiderman is authentic and the maturity of black panther is inspiring  even the films villain is someone by the end you feel sad for  you get the action you get the fun and at the same time you get an unexpected level of depth
May 30 2016,positive,fantastic entertainment while sharing a few of the same themes as bvs the approach could not be more different this did run the risk of being another avengers movie but by then end there is no doubt that this is captain americas story while the airport scene seems to get the most play i found the climax at the end to be much more exhilarating
May 30 2016,positive,pretty good movie that puts an end to the best trilogy in the marvel universe it had the potential to become the best movie of the marvel universe and one of the best superhero movies ever but unfortunately it did not reached that potential but that does not mean its not a good movie i think is on the level of the avengers but inferior to the winter soldier
May 30 2016,positive,in the third installment of the captain america series its fair to say marvel pulled out all the stops to dazzle audiences in a way that brings back memories of 2012s the avengers in captain america civil war the incidental devastation left in the wake of the diverse group of beloved superheroes actions has finally caught up with them as the united nations seeks to enact control over the avengers predictably there is a natural schism that happens between the two camps in the group with those who are more hawkish led by captain steve rogers chris evans and the dovish sect headed by tony stark himself robert downey jr    what makes civil war more meaningful than its predecessors is that fact that it makes viewers think at the heart of the film is a stark philosophical divide that really drives a wedge that pits heroes against heroes in this respect there is more meaningful dialogue in civil war than its prior films and due to the large cast of characters crammed into the film including black widow scarlet witch antman falcon war machine vision hawkeye and newcomers black panther and spiderman it feels more like a third entry in the avengers compared to being primarily about captain rogers however things are kept in perspective thanks to a story arch that follows the troubles of bucky barnes sebastian stan which always brings audiences back to the focus on captain america    but if youre thinking civil war is truly a thoughtprovoking piece of cinema its not there are plenty of action sequences to go around the highlight of the film comes about threequarters of the way through when the two factions wage total war against each other on the runways in an airport the scene offers anything any marvel fan could hope for from insane camerawork to awesome cgi effects and plenty of oneliners to go around most of which come from iron man spiderman and antman while there are other scenes that are pretty cool this one really makes the movie    its true that were likely in a period of superhero fatigue but captain america civil war is evidence that its still possible to do a film like this justice
May 30 2016,positive,great blockbuster action acting and cinematography cannot make up for shitty writing and plot holes a good film outside of its writing  but i personally dont like it and disagree with its 90 7510
May 30 2016,positive,read the comic and the film speaks to me not to have or spiderman switching sides in the war  im disappointed as the civil war this more for a school fight 
May 30 2016,positive,so many marvel and dc comic based films popping out like wild fire though the only question becomes does the story follow the comic well that shouldnt be the question the question should be is it entertaining if we were to evaluate each film that is based on a comic a book or a true story then wed see that none of the stories match up yes captain america civil war 2016 stepped outside the bounds a bit from the comic stories and who really cares it does say the movie is based on characters in a comic it doesnt say this movie is based on book 14 etc    captain america civil war 2016 is a fairly done film with a ton of hiccups within the green screens graphics story and a whole lot more but was it entertaining yes the movie was entertaining and no it didnt follow lick for lick with the comics but it was a fun flick i love the cast that they have been using i really enjoyed that they brought in antman and spiderman is this a blockbuster hit no and i havent saw a blockbuster hit in years so if you like comic related action films then check captain america civil war 2016 out its worth a viewing  woodbangerscom
May 30 2016,positive,great popcorn fare marvel has does an excellent job delivering interesting mash up movies the allstar cast is a hard act to juggle but civil war hits the mark    robert downy jr is as memorable as ever and chris evans continues to prove he was a great choice the film is a predictable affair with grandiose fight scenes but with solid execution the films main villain was well chosen to drive the plot the film is really successful because it captures the recipe that makes a great comic book sharp dialogue interesting interpersonal dynamics and just enough connection to emotionally rewarding topics to keep a viewer engaged comics are supposed to fun and their characters lovable enjoyable and inspiring the point is to find entertainment and comedy mixed with a little hope and heft marvel keeps delivering that formula civil war captures all of the spirit of the comics and the excellent cast makes it all sing    spiderman was also finally given the identity he deserves as cute charming and fun he is blissfully unaware of the power he can wield and simply wants to impress his pseudo father figure by horsing around with the boys     another strong entry to the marvel cannon and a great summer blockbuster
May 30 2016,positive,the best superhero movie ive seen
May 30 2016,positive,the best marvel moviehands downspiderman was great and black panther is everything i thought he would be from the comic books
May 30 2016,positive,pretty cool  longer than it needs to really be but its not as bad as avengers 2 which had some pretty awful editing and felt like it was 4 hours long  but definitely check this out if you like marvel
May 30 2016,positive,the movie has a slow beginning but overall is worth your money
May 30 2016,positive,loved it so much all my favorite super heroes in one place cant wait to see it again
May 30 2016,positive,even with good action sequences and so so plot captain america may find hard to commander his own movie and struggles over many avengers
May 30 2016,positive,great managed to fit in a lot gracefully
May 30 2016,positive,saw it pretty awesome
May 30 2016,positive,the best captain america movie you will ever see
May 30 2016,positive,choppy parts didnt seem like a whole
May 30 2016,positive,my favorite of all timeaction suspense clever full of heroesjust yummy
May 30 2016,positive,incredible movie  for marvel films it ranks 2 right below captain america winter soldier in my opinion
May 30 2016,positive,im not into the comics so this is based strictly on the movie less humor than usual in a marvel movie but still delivered i have to watch it again but i thoroughly enjoyed it
May 30 2016,negative,not really my cuppa tea 
May 30 2016,negative,this was a disgrace to marvel movies long drawn out hated every second
May 30 2016,positive,amazing after waiting for sooooo long for this movie to come out i am happy to say that this movie was totally worth the wait as many people have been saying this is the best marvel movie ever i had my doubts with integrating spiderman into civil war but joe and anthony russo played him in perfectly also tom holland plays the role so good you should check out this movie for sure
May 30 2016,positive,anthony russo  joe russos exciting brilliantly engaging blockbuster superhero spectacle it concerns the morale conflict and the consequences that befalls the avengers after a massive battle leaves many civilians dead and the result of this deadly collateral damage is the world leaders and politicians decide to push a hero registration act which would control their actions by a outside governing body it caused a major division in the avengers with tony stark aka iron man brilliantly by robert downey jr who is trying to get the heroes to sign the act after he was confronted by a grieving mother who lost her son during the events in age of ultron but steve rogers aka captain america played sensationally by chris evans believes that no government can fully protect the world so the heroes began to take sides  black window war machine well played by scarlett johansson and don cheadle join iron man while falcon goes with captain america but matters really take a turn for the worse when their is bombing during ceremonial signing of the accords and the culprit seems to be buck barnes aka the winter soldier wonderfully played by sebastian stan the brainedwashed supersoldier and childhood best friend of steve rogersthis now will escalates into an allout war between the heroes which will also included the scarlett witch the vision sharon carter hawkeye ant man the black panther and the scenestealing spider man astute direction by anthony  joe russo who give their epic jawdropping and inventive action sequences with terrific cgi visual effects exceptional supporting performances by anthony mackie jeremy renner chadwick boseman paul bettany elizabeth olsen paul rudd tom holland frank grillo william hurt martin freeman marisa tomei john kani and john slattery a winner all the way and marvels finest film yet highly recommended
May 30 2016,negative,difficult to keep up with who is good vs who is bad from one confrontation to another
May 30 2016,positive,saw it twice once in dolby cinema at amc16 burbank excellent movie an amazing balance of good storytelling fast paced action and mind blowing visual effects must see 
May 30 2016,positive,i am on tony starks team    i think this was a good movie but a bit drowned in violence some of it funny as they add spiderman and antman to the team missed the hulk and thor a bit    for me i am just not that into the comic books and so wrong person for this movie    it was well done and often funny and nice
May 30 2016,neutral,maybe the only thing i liked about this movie was the fight between all of the different superheroes i thought there was to much talking g and there shouldve been more action
May 30 2016,positive,excellent as usual but i still think this should have been an avengers even though it focused a little more on ca than the others
May 30 2016,positive,more of a new avengers film than a stand alone captain america picture the inner turmoil of the squad is well played out and the action is up to scratch it does fall short of the best of the humour of the franchise but still this has enough new things going on to avoid the growing super hero fatigue
May 30 2016,positive,civil war had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish its intriguing theme actionfilled plot and humorous scenes really made this movie come together
May 30 2016,positive,was ok  got better and better from the start  spiderman was a great addition  enjoyed the first one much more
May 30 2016,positive,marvel at the finest
May 30 2016,positive,is it the best marvel film not quite but a fantastic action film the actors are fantastic and the plot generally works really well    the film really isnt a captain america film its really avengers 3 especially as it really picks up from age of ultron    i really enjoyed black panther whos introduction was very well handled his character was compelling and felt like a suitable addition to the mcu captain america was very well played by chris evans the captain america series has been very well put together after starting rather slowly  the action was generally very good and most characters was given plenty of time however some such as vision were a little under done considering the importance placed on the character at various times    whilst i enjoyed the spiderman character i felt his introduction slowed the story and felt a bit out of place  some of the action was unusually shaky especially the early fight scenes  the airport scene has been talked up a lot in the reviews ive seen however whilst it was a good spectacle i felt the endless banter and jokes diminished the impact of the events taking place    the film is another very good marvel movie although im sick of stan lee cameos which really could have been called captain america v iron man as its as much an iron man film as it is a captain america
May 30 2016,positive,captain america  iron man get into a pissing contest against each other then get into a big silly punchup where no one dies finally they just kind of made up in the end isnt this arc supposed to leave a bigger impression  results in huge consequences for the avengers eh the silly inconsequential punchup is entertaining i guess
May 30 2016,positive,i hope the russo brothers make the infinity wars as compelling and exciting
May 30 2016,positive,its an amazing movie but not that great compared to the last captain america movie and the ending its a bit hanging but its a good  movie
May 30 2016,positive,really good movie but could have been about 2030 min shorter
May 30 2016,positive,hands down the best marvel movie outside of deadpool im not a big fan of marvel universe but this one got me it was good never missed a beat still deadpool was the best
May 29 2016,positive,one of the strongest entries into the marvel cinematic universe civil war outlines a good blend of personal drama and ideological politics making for one great action flick the first act is predictable and formulaic but the film grows steadily stronger as it goes along leading to a great climax part of its problems are the lack of real consequence the threat of failure which leaves out potential performance intensity and meaning also its about time the handtohand combat scenes be given some artistic filming style because the quick cuts and shaking camera movements are no longer acceptable in a professionallymade film that could use the creativity
May 29 2016,positive,when i heard the title captain america civil war i reluctantly thought it was going to be the marvel version of batman v superman dawn of justice and i am glad to say that it didnt compare in a good way    whilst bvs struggled to portray the building animosity between the two title characters civil war did a fantastic job at splitting up the beloved avengers and ending in an epic final battle which brings me to my next point  it didnt necessarily feel like a standalone captain america film and it become more akin to another avengers instalment instead sans thor and the hulk though    another qualm i had was the fact that elizabeth olsens russian character wanda had somehow lost the terrible accent that we heard in age of ultron and had become an allamerican avenger whilst not having to endure the horror of it again it still didnt sit well with me that they chose the easy way out    the film also introduces a few new faces tom holland as yet another spiderman and chadwick boseman as black panther  we can expect two new standalone films for these guys in the near future    all in all it was an enjoyable actionpacked saga and with all of its cgi glory my eyes wouldnt budge from the screen    motherofpopcornwordpresscom
May 29 2016,positive,beat all dcs movies
May 29 2016,positive,entertaining smartaction and great characters but marvel has step their foot into dark grimy and political filmmaking which made it uninteresting at some times
May 29 2016,positive,the best fight scenes in a marvel movie to date
May 29 2016,positive,not my favorite captain america movie but still good i love the ant man cameo
May 29 2016,positive,you cant get away from the fact that this is a disney movie designed for profound box office success     still as far as popcorn movies go this one is superior particularly in imax 3d
May 29 2016,negative,disjointed uberbusy fluttery batterboring action scenes  annoying characters and a convoluted apathetic plot  i dont get how this movie gets good ratings at all epic fail and no fun
May 29 2016,neutral,just too darn long and slow   there were a couple of good fight sequences the airport scene was pretty good   but the rest was just plodding   it feels like the franchise i can no longer tell the difference between avengers movies and captain america movies so ill just call them the same is collapsing in on itself  too many characters  too much plot line  it is just really hard to get emotionally engaged and care about any of them   and unlike in the first avengers movies there is no single character that carries the movie
May 29 2016,positive,its difficult to not like a mash up mix up of the marvel maniacs who populate this crazy kinetic cgi driven film buy hey its a blast  the gangs all here and there are delightful little surpirse nuggets out of super hero left field to enjoy  most enjoyable of all is paul rudd returning as ant man and what a hoot he is  is he big is he small is he huge is he microscopic  see this to find out  even a pubscent spider man wanne be appears and is delightful as a klutz with the ability to project sticky webs to thwart any grown ups that get in his way  overall this is a fun ride and worthy of your time
May 29 2016,positive,captain america civil war directors anthony russo joe russo is all about the past still informing the present  for steve rogers chris evans the time he spent growing up with bucky barnes sebastian stan feels like it was yesterday seeing as they both lost so much time in suspension the loyalty rogers feels towards bucky has not been dimmed by time so no matter what heinous crimes and assassinations bucky committed as the winter soldier he sees a time when they were young and innocent theres a moment when theyre reminiscing about a girl they used to know and bucky says she must be 100 yearsold now and captain america lays his hand on buckys shoulder and says so are we buck  its this connection to the past that allows stevecaptain america to create the civil war among his fellow avengers      its also memories of the past which drives iron mantony stark robert downey jr into creating a simulation machine to try and relive and change the exchange he had with his parents the last time he saw them before their death that cgi technique which made downey look 30 years younger was pretty cool this event is also what drives him into unrelenting battle with captain america as past grief becomes more important than the matters at handread post captain america civil war directors anthony russo joe russo is all about the past still informing the present  for steve rogers chris evans the time he spent growing up with bucky barnes sebastian stan feels like it was yesterday seeing as they both lost so much time in suspension the loyalty rogers feels towards bucky has not been dimmed by time so no matter what heinous crimes and assassinations bucky committed as the winter soldier he sees a time when they were young and innocent theres a moment when theyre reminiscing about a girl they used to know and bucky says she must be 100 yearsold now and captain america lays his hand on buckys shoulder and says so are we buck  its this connection to the past that allows stevecaptain america to create the civil war among his fellow avengers      its also memories of the past which drives iron mantony stark robert downey jr into creating a simulation machine to try and relive and change the exchange he had with his parents the last time he saw them before their death that cgi technique which made downey look 30 years younger was pretty cool this event is also what drives him into unrelenting battle with captain america as past grief becomes more important than the matters at hand
May 29 2016,positive,my only issue with super hero movies is the innocent carnage i love that they dealt with the issue headon in this installment
May 29 2016,positive,i want to start out by saying this was a very good movie but it is not great sorry but we have to get out of this habit of every marvel movie being blown out of proportion as being great had the russo brothers not had to contend with adding characters at the end of production it could have been closer to the winter soldier but it did not meet that quality the zemo character is an absolute embarrassment to the comic book fans and just continues to show that mcu does not know how to use their villains that airport scene that everyone is talking about was one of the worst sequences i have ever watched on screen especially in comparison to the end fight with wscap vs iron man now black panther captain america and the winter soldier characters were absolutely amazing iron man was okay throughout the movie until the end where he watches his parents being murdered on screen and we see why rdj is on top of his game in conclusion 758 out of 10 that is a good score and i cannot comprehend why people must over exaggerate the quality of this movie the winter soldier is a 910 civil war is not but that does not mean it is still not a really good movie ps cannot wait until we finally get thanos
May 29 2016,positive,honestly this movie could have been better it was good and maybe i expected too much the trailers built up too much suspense for this movie that i personally thought wasnt all it was supposed to be but i would recommend seeing it
May 29 2016,positive,the best captain america movie to date  though a lot of superheros to keep track of especially for someone that does not read the comics
May 29 2016,positive,the model by which all multihero movies will be judged
May 29 2016,neutral,to many characters and to much violence i do not connect to any of the characters they all make unwise decisions the movie almost forces you to caps side but it was entertaining albeit flawed
May 29 2016,positive,best villain yet introduced to the marvel universe  although this movie would be tough to watch not knowing the story the character build up between both teams is great  the dialog and playful banter adds levity and humor  the emotional tug between friends makes it memorable  this movie is a solid a
May 29 2016,positive,the best trilogy of hero films thus far it has similar themes as batman v superman however this film does it much better so far its made 1 billion at the box office causing warner bros to rethink its long term plans in my opinion this film is the best executed super hero film that ive seen
May 29 2016,negative,the movie was good but way to childish and i put 055 because it is overrated
May 29 2016,neutral,its just another superheroes movie theres no difference with other marvel movies except for the new characthers but it brings nothing new
May 29 2016,positive,the only problem i had with the movie is that it had a some cursing in it though ot was very few times i mention only because the marvel movies ate generally kidfamily friendly  we have watched pretty much all the marvel movies and if i  remember correctly none of them had any cursing in them all in all i still think it was a great movie 
May 29 2016,negative,quite boring but cap was right and iron man was wrong 
May 29 2016,positive,great fun well done
May 29 2016,positive,action driven movie that unfortunately has huge plot and character holes feels like a long movie and is with it going for 25 hours but that would be nothing if it could really carry it that long sometimes it seems they are just fighting just to have the cool fight scenes
May 29 2016,positive,i was pleasantly surprised its probably one of the best of the series including avengers
May 29 2016,positive,while the airport action scene was great there wasnt much at stake
May 29 2016,positive,exciting fight scenes performances good but the plot is superficial at times but it is by far the best film of the marvel
May 29 2016,positive,third favorite mcu movie to this date finally bringing in the more realistic approach to superheroes while also continuing the winter soldier plotline consequentially the reasoning behind it being called captain america civil war not avengers the chemistry between the characters the moralistic dialogue and the line between enemy and friend help ensure this as another one of marvels classic movies if only the other superhero against superhero movies could be this well executed and thoughtprovoking
May 29 2016,neutral,i witnessed the marvel cinematic universe take off with iron man which i watched captain america thor ect i fell in love with the avengers when it came out and thats when i started paying attention to this universe however as the movies progressed and especially after age of ultron i grew to realize that all these films are following a curtain formula a formula that has been abused to death after they saw how amazingly the avengers did and unfortunately for me this is a formula that im starting to see threw and am getting tired of which is concerning for this franchise if its going to be going until 2028 this film just does this formula again but with some slight differences im not saying its badmore like mediocre and the side plots i didnt care for at all all i wanted to honestly see the avengers fight over theyre differences and i think thats the main thing people wanted to see  for me chris evans amazing performance as captain america and the amazing fight scenes is what makes this film worth a watch at least once
May 29 2016,positive,it was every bit as good as i had hoped
May 29 2016,positive,every captain america movie is better than the last
May 29 2016,positive,pretty awesome movie had no idea the scarlett witch is an olsen sister
May 29 2016,positive,best superhero movie ever
May 29 2016,positive,this movie was amazing you have to see it
May 29 2016,positive,everyone already knows how good this movie is it ranks up there with winter soldier and the avengers as not only one of the best marvel and comic book movies made but a damn entertaining piece of action cinema    ill start off by saying that it isnt perfect the villain is relatively weak the stakes arent as high as they could be and things are patched up a bit too easily by the end that said i have a hard time thinking of another movie that was able to make me feel like a kid again its a saturday morning cartoon come to life though without  ever feeling implicitly childish some will want to fault the movie for this but i think its the movies greatest strength not everything has to be gritty or real or ponderousits ok to just be fun and wellexecuted    compare this to batman v superman which given its inclusion of the two most popular superheroes in the world should have easily topped a billion dollars but hasnt and wont batman v superman was unrelentingly grim that could have been forgiven if it wasnt simultaneously incoherent and confused about what it and its purpose was all of the emphasis on style over substance worked against the film and made it feel sophomoric civil war on the other hand knew exactly what kind of movie it wanted to be and stayed true to itno pretenseand its a much tighter film for it    this film sets the bar for how we should expect a superhero movie to make us feel no longer can or should we be content with mediocrity like xmen apocalypse
May 29 2016,positive,this captain america installment ups the hand to hand combat and the humor  great addition for marvel movie fans
May 29 2016,positive,mrbacblogwordpresscom for a proper review of sorts
May 29 2016,negative,sadly boring and loooong
May 29 2016,positive,as a huuuuuuuuuge dc fanboy huuuuuuuuuge batman obsessed crazy person i still cannot believe how fucking perfect this movie is its a culmination of almost a decades worth of storytelling and it shows  damn near perfect also what up dean pelton stoned
May 29 2016,positive,now i went to this movie with my son who loves this series of films if you have not seen the previous films there is a little bit of catching up to do this is a great film if you are into this series and like watching the battles between the superheroes and the bad guys alike it is pretty light hearted and does not take itself too seriously if you are not into this series the film is passable and pretty good entertainment and a bit of escapism with great special effects and more story than what you might expect from this type of film i enjoyed the movie however i like movies in general and it is not often i dont like them it is not going to win an oscar but if you want to do something  for a couple of hours this film is worth a bit of a look
May 29 2016,positive,this movie is great easily one of my favorites in mcu
May 29 2016,positive,i think its funny that the critic consensus states that the movie has a noncartoonish plot and the courage to explore thoughtprovoking themes well im sorry capt critic but who is this movie for anyway i took my son whos 10 and he enjoyed it to a degree actually saying at one point he got sleepy well kid your dad snapped off a few snores too because of the fact that the movie has a tendency to take itself too seriously near 2 12 hours in length indicitive of said seriousness im 52 and have loved marvel forever and a day reading the comic books endlessly as a kid key word here kid yes if marvel starts gearing itself too much towards adults it defeats one of the main purposes of marvel kids if i want deep themes ill go watch some matrix or 12 monkeys or something i watch marvel for the kid in me that being said the film also had a problem with the overloadfactor were seeing now from marvel movies ten twelve fifteen super heroes now i didnt find the complexity and resulting chatter chatter chatter or the character packed action highly problematic but i just hope this doesnt set a trend forever and a day all that being said it was still an enjoyable movie but for me it didnt quite hit it like ultron did a more cartoonish movie if you will again enjoyable but lets tone down the narrative and length as well other than that its a four starer
May 28 2016,positive,best superhero movie any studio has made
May 28 2016,negative,colossal bore  omg how many hours is this moronic punchfest
May 28 2016,positive,great movie overall the ending and lack of risks this movie takes is what makes me take it down to 4 stars         spoiler cap should be dead
May 28 2016,positive,this was way better than age of ultron and cap is quickly becoming one of my faves black panther was an excellent addition to the cinematic universe and was perfect     looking fwd to whats next
May 28 2016,positive,awesome movie black panther is now of my top favorite marvel characters
May 28 2016,positive,the airport scene is maybe the best sequence in the marvel universe ive ever seen loved this movie
May 28 2016,positive,reasonably paced and fairly fun at times
May 28 2016,positive,no doubt appealing to the legions of marvel fans who will throw their money at this film cacw is perfectly enjoyable and action packed summer fare chris evans and robert downey jr continue to lead the pack agreeably and several set pieces are great including a fan boys dream of an airport sequence the central conflict of the film is very much more internal to the group of superheroes instead of another world destroying climax however marvel still seems like theyre mining their catalogue of comics instead of putting a passionate stamp on any of the movies in short they all feel the same fun and frothy sure but they seem like dutiful obligation instead of truly great cinematic experiences still the new film in the series is solid summer fun rating 74
May 28 2016,positive,it must be very difficult to write movie scenes involving 20 superheroes that are fighting each other even though they are friends in which they cause injury to each other without killing all the while not destroying friendships for future interactions
May 28 2016,positive,i really loved the avenger vs avenger fights in the avengers movies thor headbutting iron man still being my favorite moment out of all of the movies  there is plenty of that in this movie  it certainly didnt disappoint in that regard  the airport scene was a fantastic part of the movie    but what made this movie so great was that despite this all of the fantastic action coming across the screen i was more interested in how the plot was going to develop  very well thought out and they made a good show of trying to show why both sides had valid points      to be honest though i was team cap the whole way  from the movies first teaser up until the end credits captain america was right in my mind  maybe i am biased by how stupid and idiotic iron man is in the recent civil war comic run but so be it    anyway another fantastic entry in the mcu  they are really doing a great job of making this one interconnected saga  i didnt feel like the developments in this movie were forced or new in any way  this has been coming for quite some time now and that is what makes this movie and all of the others so great
May 28 2016,positive,sprawling and simply magnificent captain america civil war shocked and floored me with just how near perfect it was just when i assumed the avengers series had settled into a predictable groove and pattern marveldisney went and raised the bar for what this genre can accomplish loosely based on one of the most popular comic book arcs of the last decade civil war centers on the schism that occurs within the avengers and their allies when the collective of world governments wish for tighter regulation of these superheroes seeing as the last few years of battling aliens and rogue ai has led to a fairly large collateral body count captain america takes umbrage with this in addition to protecting his long lost friend bucky barnes aka the winter soldier who he believes is being framed for a series of recent terrorist attacks iron mantony stark adheres to the new regulations believing that oversight is needed people take sides shit blows up i have to admire the filmmakers for acknowledging civilian cost to previous entries as other series  warner brosdc and 20th century foxs xmen have been routinely criticized to the point of absurdity on this issue while the mcu has gotten a free pass and it is an interesting point to cross swords over even if most of it could have been avoided by a simple discussion andor vote the sole weakness of the movie is how these characters are forced to the point of violence when such options were available    but once things get underway all is forgiven combining the serious lowkey bourneesque moments of the winter soldier with the outlandish fun of a fullfledged avengers installment civil war breezes through its almost twoandahalf hour runtime without one reaching for their watch or phone the conflict brings out the best of each character on screen in tandem with their combat abilities and fighting style everyone gets a moment to shine and no side receives any more favoritism than the other there is a showstopping barnburner of a fight at an airport and a twist toward the end that surprised even me the final duel of iron man vs captain america and the winter soldier was perhaps the greatest superhero duel currently on celluloid with it being surprisingly evenhanded and tragic and the main villain was a simple relatable one that deserves more credit that he has received thus far oh and the new spiderman was fun as hell and black panther was cool as shit    okay the answer to the inevitable and tiresome question of how this compares to batman v superman is simple dawn of justice was an average beautiful misfire that received a tad bit too much hate this is a goddamn masterpiece any questions while it may not be as tightly directed and written as the winter soldier it is certainly the best avengers movie and may simply be the most fun see it
May 28 2016,positive,i havent seen any of the captain americas before but i enjoyed this
May 28 2016,positive,captain america civil war  more like avengers 25  right from the beginning we get the amazing action we love about superhero films but also the intelligent realism when it comes to the consequences of said actions  with amazing debuts of new characters awesome battles beyond imagination and some bits of fun along the way and we get a film that shows how strong the marvel movie franchise is and that its success will not be ending anytime soon  and that we can expect greater things from upcoming marvel films  i was worried about the larger number of characters in this film much as i saw did not work for spiderman 3 amazing spiderman 2 or batman vs superman dawn of justice but as shown in the avengers avengers age of ultron and the better xmen films this films writers and directors demonstrate they know how to handle it  an awesome day at the movies
May 28 2016,positive,very good movie cool drama between the good guys  the fight scenes were a little too herky jerky for me but very entertaining  definate must see 
May 28 2016,negative,poor direction too much for one movie
May 28 2016,positive,didnt wanna watch it turned out great
May 28 2016,positive,very good loved the teams
May 28 2016,positive,best captain america yet a must see
May 28 2016,positive,one of the best team up movies since the first avengers film  not as good as winter soldier but certainly worth a watch for the scenes with antman and spiderman
May 28 2016,positive,one of the best so far
May 28 2016,positive,marvels best film so far had me watching it two times
May 28 2016,positive,while it does not reach the heights of winter soldier civil war is still impressive on its own and is thankfully one of those rare good third movies it promises that the audience will get to see two of the most famous superheroes of all time battle it out and certainly delivers on that to the full what i loved so much was how focused the story was civil war could have easily tried so hard to foreshadow what is to come in phase 3 but instead it simply sticks to captain america  friends vs iron man  friends right up to the end the hallmarks of what make marvel so respectedthe fun action the witty oneliners and the distinctive memorable personalitiesare all there which is enough to give casuals a recommendation and plus i have to give props to black panther and spiderman as the noobs bp has a journey of his own that can be best described when seen and spiderman was like quicksilver in xmen days of future pasthe doesnt stick around for that long he has only one job but boy does the guy make the best of what hes got seriously thoughtom holland was really funny in the role the only major gripes i really have with this are that baron zemo wasnt that welldeveloped as a villain thankfully hes not part of the central focus and antman couldve been utilized a bit better though giant man was really cool to watch    one theme i noticed in the movie was how actions always have consequences and that rings true in this filmevery event in the movie has a consequence that is shown onscreen even if it is just a new report on a tv screen thus giving the full emotional impact necessary to care about the films grave subject matter ambitious to its core the film dares to make the audience think about which side they are on one major highlight in the movie was when the avengers are arguing over the nature of the sokovia accords and many of them state excellent points that are later reflected as the story plays out is the right to intervene in grave matters a privilege or a right how far does the regulation of superheroes actions go until it gets out of hand and right up to the end civil war leaves it up to the audience to decide for themselves what they think it doesnt choose a side but just presents the situation as it is    final verdict is captain america civil war a good movie fuck yeah
May 28 2016,negative,cookie cutter marvel fare  way too much time spent on side characters which i dont care about
May 28 2016,negative,good action as always no progression on any story
May 28 2016,negative,the movie captain america civil war did not like it at all honestly expected more from this production of the russo brothers is achieved not aprecciar darkness and realism that promised to confirm the movie the end has this slogan came out really avengerningún injured or killed in the filming of this movie now my faith in crumbles marvel to see unhappy as you consider it as one of the best
May 28 2016,positive,very exciting and fun to watch 
May 28 2016,positive,basically the third avengers movie i mean who dislike the avengers they are always the best
May 28 2016,positive,not crazy about the direction they took with this story line
May 28 2016,positive,really good movie plot was a little ridiculous and wish they had gone in another direction def need to see it and buy it on bluray
May 28 2016,positive,a story about friends in an ideological war
May 28 2016,positive,same store nothings new
May 28 2016,positive,the latest movie in the marvel cinematic universe civil war between iron man  and captain america who are both the core of the avengers they stand for two viewpoints about freedom and rules its not only funny but also lead people thinking 9510
May 28 2016,neutral,the number of buildings and lives destroyed by super heroes continues in capitan americacivil war it begs the self same question raised in the film  when is it no longer worth it when is the fact that these heroes choose not to use guns to save lives so absurd in the carnage and destruction that they leave in their wake that it is no longer worth it for me it was this film where the destruction of an airport threw it over the top as far as super hero movies go this one does not break new ground as a result the best i can say about it is that it is average
May 28 2016,positive,the story was well done and movie well acted this is a fitting third installment to the capt america trilogy
May 28 2016,positive,good movie really good storline but misses something in translation of the winter soldier piece
May 28 2016,positive,that motor cycle snatch mind blown
May 28 2016,positive,a must see all around great movie
May 28 2016,positive,marvel good as always
May 28 2016,negative,boring movie plz disney sell marvel to fox plz
May 28 2016,positive,quite an exciting film but quite long  lots of action and fighting  a mixed cinema audience from possibly too young children to over 60s  i was definitely one of the mature ones in the audience
May 28 2016,positive,loved all the variety of characters
May 28 2016,positive,about 20 minutes really make this movie worth watching the fight is funny action packed and interesting the events surrounding bored me a bit
May 27 2016,positive,reallllllly good superman dies though
May 27 2016,positive,not much to say that hasnt already been said it was awesome
May 27 2016,positive,perfect in every way
May 27 2016,negative,watching these guys try to kill each other for 2 hours is just so much less fun than seeing them work together also black panther complete lack of reasoning before acting is so unlike the current comics where he is one of the smartest characters in the marvel universe
May 27 2016,negative,didnt like it too tired of the disneymarvel formula
May 27 2016,positive,it wasnt great but it wasnt bad either  the story seemed kind of forced  i understood the general theme of why the story is what it is but didnt feel the reasoning anybody took any real sides they tried to show why but to me it just didnt stand up and in the end it still didnt feel meaningful
May 27 2016,positive,well directed and acted  the simple vapid presence of a movie over two hours is lacking the premise of internal conflict of the avengers presents itself in the title and actions only to portray a potentially larger issue which sadly defaults to petty squabbles based off overall plot issues that since tony stark told the world hes iron man the amount of conflict has increased  that ll said entertaining as usual a higher focus on action than typical one line zingers exception spider boy
May 27 2016,positive,perfect this movie has everything cap iron man black widow spidey black panther antman a great story amazing effects and so much more brilliant
May 27 2016,positive,great possibly the best of the avengeri mean captain america movies
May 27 2016,positive,loved it marvel just kills it every time best movie just love love it
May 27 2016,positive,i was worried about how this could have gone but all for nothing  it was just fine
May 27 2016,positive,captain america civil war is a film that wants to keep the marvel universal active and alive this was a fun and action packed film that knows that there is a time and place for everything we have anthony and joseph russo as our directors and have directed the previous captain america the winter soldier and the upcoming avengers infinity war i believe they did a great job with winter soldier and are back in the game with civil war we are brought on an adventure across the globe from the united states to germany    jumping right in we are given the context of what events have transpired from the year 1991 after a tragic accident the avengers find themselves on two separate sides of a political debate causing captain america and some of his team to break away from iron man throughout the film tensions arise as the once superhero dream team turn on each other creating multiple action scenes and plot twists to be revealed i quite enjoyed the ambient sounds music and the props were on point  it seemed like everyone was in sync while making this movie the scenes flowed well as well as the transitions that came in and out from the beginning to end the special effects were well done and didnt feel overdone it was a good mesh of film editing overall the costumes looked great and looked like they were straight out of the comic book this movie was based on as for the acting i have mixed feelings chris evans captain america robert downey jr iron man and scarlett johansson black widow were great in the movie and knew how to play their parts elizabeth olsen wanda maximoff and anthony mackie sam wilson did okay on their parts i have to say that i did not care for jeremy renners clint barton performance in this film as he did not seem to convey any emotion or character same goes for tom holland spiderman but i will give him some slack for being new on the scene i would however would have preferred tobey maguire from the raimi trilogy in spider mans part back on to the plot i liked the story but it felt formulaic as in go to the places we have already been and stop the bad guys again it had its ups and downs but stuck to a coherent narrative and was straight forward however i did not care for the overall conclusion of the movie but i still liked the classic marvel after credit scenes    i would give it a 3 out of 4 stars it was a fluid rollercoaster ride that was enjoyable from beginning to end there were some problems with the acting and actors it wasnt really a film that had me on the edge of my seat but i was certainly glued to the screen wanting more i wouldnt say is was the best of the captain america movies but it was not the worst of the marvel cinematic universe the experience was an overall enjoyable one i feel like the directors took this in the right direction and i cannot wait for this to play out in the new avengers
May 27 2016,positive,this movie was amazing  great action scenes and the new characters spidermanblack panther really added to the movie plus they were well casted and acted  with that being said the only reason i didnt give it a five is because i think theyre trying to hard to preserve characters and missed a golden oppertunity to do one or two in properly  i was a huge fan of the civil war comics and by the end i feel they strayed too far away from it to be 5 though  great movie near mis on the perfection
May 27 2016,positive,awesome and exciting i cant wait to see what else marvel has in store
May 27 2016,negative,stop saying this movie is good just stop
May 27 2016,negative,another blockbuster a movie about saveing a friend you could call this movie a saveing private sleeper spy its seen so meny times before the cool fighting sceens and high end produktion is the only thing good about this movie it feels like the actors just need to collect their paycheck ps thanks for ruing spider man worst movie of them all in the series it should not have been called captain america it should have been called avengers civil war
May 27 2016,positive,a wonderful movie just long enough a good amount of humor emotions action and a fantastic introduction of new characters i highly recommend it and will see it a third time in theaters
May 27 2016,positive,exciting fun the entire family enjoyed this one the new spiderman was really amazing
May 27 2016,positive,largely boring forgettable adds little to nothing to the franchise
May 27 2016,negative,fell asleep twice my husband had to leave the theater 45 mins into it to walk around to keep from falling asleep
May 27 2016,neutral,laughable characterization and poor writing with an acceptable amount of action that falls far short of the civil war this was supposed to be based on the source material  by the end ts has convicted himself for creating ultron and then steps it up by actively trying to murder someone and no one arrests him  audiences apparently are turning their brains off as quickly as they do their phones
May 27 2016,positive,best movie in the mcu so far
May 27 2016,positive,it has a star studded cast that includes the folks who play the super heroes and i expect it to be very good when i see it with my grandson this weekend
May 27 2016,negative,horrible horrible horrible ridiculously unrealistic and such non stop crash banging violence i wanted to leave but stayed because somehow my boyfriend loved it
May 27 2016,negative,two and a half hours that youll never get back   like like an 30s musical with too many costars this halfwit waste of pixels is a nonstop busby berkley fantasy of computerized mayhem with special attention being payed to the attention span of 12 yearold patrons it made us long for the days of the softcore parody  flesh gordon etc  in another year or so millions will line up to see the next chapter just to see if captain america porks his niece
May 27 2016,neutral,such a weak plot and i never felt invested like i did with the winter solider its been a long time since i have seen a movie with the bad guy used as such a red herring truly a wejustfoughteachotherfor2hours superhero event that ultimately changes nothing and leaves an unresolved feud between two great characters i know im a minority but this was disappointing
May 27 2016,positive,nonspoiler this movie does some things that have never been done in cinema  the universe concept is something that has been dabbled with in the james bond franchise and the serials of yesteryear   the shear amount of payoffs from the longform storytelling model that marvel has been attempting to cultivate are nothing if not impressive      the film presents interesting complex relationships between multidimensional characters  the actions sequences are well catered to each character in abilities and personalities  the dialogue is charming poignant and never forced or overbearing   the themes are both current and timeless  the pacing provides a fastmoving never boring story but also provides the essential quiet moments that many movies forget about  this is an amazingly wellmade movie    some criticisms levied against this movie are fair if overblown  spoilers        the most common criticism is that the villain helmut zemo relied heavily on luck for his scheme to succeed  i argue that throughout the film zemo takes advantage of circumstances and manipulates them to suit his ultimate goal  i think one improvement would have been that he timed the death of peggy to prevent steve from properly opposing the accords prior to their ratification  her death did serve that purpose in the script but it seemed to be a coincidence      the third act relied on a series of events to occur   to accomplish zemos reveal he would have to present the footage while iron man and bucky were in the vicinity of eachother  tonys rage would allow him to kill bucky an act for which steve could never forgive him  in the climatic scene steve was there which meant that tony would have to fight him as well   there is some convenience in that only tony bucky and steve came to the bunker but one could argue that zemo had the opportunity to adjust his plan following the conclusion of the airport battle in germany   the logic is all there if you care to look at it but if you dont care the movie is still fantastic
May 27 2016,positive,i fought it totally irresponsible to allow this amount of violence in a family movie   i spilt all my popcorn while fred smelt  my balls but as i didnt want to  look at fred sniffing my balls i watched the film and this made me think how the film has deviated from the plot it went from respectable film to something i wouldnt let snout my ball   i mean look at a good film like batman and robin woohoo for bat nipples
May 27 2016,positive,to much shaky camera and not enough plot think i need a break from xmen movies for a while
May 27 2016,negative,i think they let the interns do the cgi parts poorly done  too dragged out i give it a 45
May 27 2016,positive,one of the best super hero movies but was a little confusing
May 27 2016,positive,this was an awesome movie  not quite as good as the avengers but on par with avengers age of ultron if youre even just a casual avengers fan you have to see this movie even if its just to see spidey in a marvel movie for the first time by the way hes more than just a cameo and is really funny 
May 27 2016,positive,love it good action and comedy
May 27 2016,positive,a satisfying conclusion to the captain america trilogy and felt like the much needed avengers 2012 sequel we all needed with hardhitting emotional arcs it definitely pulls on the heart strings whilst still keeping the marvel comedy in balance
May 27 2016,positive,with a year full of superhero movies packed to the brim with characters this movie manages to balance them all with tact while i feel like antmans presence while always remarkably entertaining was a bit cut short and awkward i feel like the balance of characters was good finally marvel deals with the consequences of the actions in the universe so far and the ending was satisfying without wrapping up the conflict in a neat bow because that would never happen im excited to see the newer characters develop further along the road as well as see how this movie effects the older founding characters
May 27 2016,neutral,spidey and antman were the highlight the rest was formula driven fare no real emotional beats to this movie pretty superficial 
May 27 2016,positive,captain america civil war is everything i dreamed of when i was younger my favorite super heroes battling each other that was something only my action figures could achieve i finally saw it on the big screen and i was in awe the whole time my only complaint is that iron patriot isnt compelling and he never will be it was just kind of dull when he was around and i wasnt ever attached
May 27 2016,positive,there is not much left that can be said about this movie the performances are amazing the cast is fantastic the action is by far some of the best that air port scene is a master piece this has arguably the best on screen spiderman and the villain though not as menacing as others is more thought provoking and interesting compared to some from past movies not better than winter solider but still up there at the top of marvel movies the russo brothers have shown again how amazing they can be and make you look forward to the next avengers that much more
May 27 2016,positive,the first movie ive been compelled to actually see in a theater in many years a fantastic sequel to winter soldier and could almost be called avengers 3 a good mix of action and humor the plot is something meaningful to me and i was team cap all the way im actually considering going to see it again
May 27 2016,positive,well civil war was a great film best film of 2016 so far definitely the best in the mcu i support team cap i love the action sequences and the new characters especially spiderman best scene is the airport scene cant wait to see the next wave of mcu films
May 27 2016,positive,best marvel movie to date
May 27 2016,positive,finally a marvel movie which is both smart and action packed as well as having a great sense of humour in between the serious action sequences first off the stunts too many movies these days rely so much on cgi fight scenes along with long ranged weapons not in this movie so much of this movie felt as if they were done on set with actual stunts its scary how much fighting skill the characters show and it honestly felt like something out of a game which is more than what other movies can say     the characters motivations were so clear and you cant hep but pick a side at the beginning of the movie but see yourself shifting your stance throughout the movie this is further emphasised by the fact that the characters had to deal with the really real consequences of people actually dying it seams that its about time that our heroes finally faced the music and look at what happens when theyre left unchecked even the villain felt real and he became what he is as a direct product of the heroes actions the relationships between the characters feels like its being tested more than ever and its interesting to see what theyre willing to do when it comes down to it     let me be the first one to say this but please let there be a blackwiddow standalone movie already i its feels like shes been in the shadows long enough and even though she was in this movie i almost forgot about her at the end of it but i would say that this movie has one thing going for it it made me feel invested and interested in quite a few characters and let me tell you that if any movie about them comes out which im pretty sure it will i cant say that i wouldnt want to watch just out of curiosity     this movie is a great departure from the greater than life action sequences that isnt always matched with a good storyline a marvel movie which i can definitively say is both fun to watch and think about even after ive left the theatres
May 27 2016,positive,i love the movie i have seen it in theaters butbi want to see it again
May 27 2016,positive,amazing couldnt say enough about the film  one word spiderman two words
May 27 2016,positive,dont confuse this with superman vs batman its a lot better not just endless fights lots of great super heroes and fine special effects with some good story this really builds on the previous captain america movies and has some good iron man thrown in too
May 27 2016,positive,16th of december 1991
May 27 2016,positive,it was ok kinda feel like ive seen all these marvel characters so much it wasnt really anything new
May 27 2016,positive,marvel with the the touch of the russo brothers will always do the right thing
May 27 2016,positive,the airport scene saves this movie which otherwise is a little bit whiny
May 27 2016,negative,what a load of bullshit hail everything marvel  everything else it bad   this site is biased af
May 27 2016,negative,boring so far the worst captain america film
May 26 2016,positive,captain america cw was such a great movie with an all star cast with a few new characters as black panther and spider man  it was a wonderful script with great direction by the russo brothers maybe the bedikian brothers should try the next phase of the marvel universe franchise  this movie was much darker than any of the other marvel movies  definitely put this one on your to do list
May 26 2016,positive,good movie very well directed and acted especially with respect to carefully juggling the dozen or so leading characters without making things seem clumsy
May 26 2016,positive,another spectacular film by marvel if you are a fan of any of the super heroes from the marvel comics this movie is really awesome especially with the cast this time around
May 26 2016,positive,awesome every fight scene was glorious and the airport battle is everything
May 26 2016,positive,i liked it but i dont like when characters do something out of character just to make a contrived storyline
May 26 2016,positive,great depiction of captain america and iron mans relationship my favorite movie in a long time
May 26 2016,neutral,the thematic elements for a solidly good possibly even great film are present at the outset as civil war begins by pretending its going to be interested in exploring the very interesting and very relevant issue of the massive destruction to lives and property left in the aftermath of the violent battles that are de rigeur in all of these films and then proceeds to hypocritically up precisely the same kind of body count without ever truly exploring the issue as it devolves into just another series of evermoregigantic slugfests as an example of cinematic craft its top notch with all of the departments turning in impressive work but the script despite its pretentions just ends up being kind of you know stupid manages to be both extremely entertaining and extremely disappointing simultaneously
May 26 2016,positive,thought the story line was excellent the improvements of falcon were good  the introduction of the black panther  new spiderman were spot on perfect excellent job
May 26 2016,positive,very good mix of humor and action spiderman and black panther stole the show both were awesome   good tension builder
May 26 2016,neutral,by no means a bad movie but one that i did not care much for that came and went like a blur of superhero stuff    im not a huge marvel fan but i saw that a lot of people were saying that there is depth and character in this new captain america movie just because it takes time with characters does not mean the characters are developed and just because they mention interesting themes does not mean theyre thought provoking ones marvel movies still dont come close to art house films or oscar bait dramas in terms of characters depth or interesting storylines nor do they touch prestige shows on television i still have hope that maybe the new spiderman movie or ryan cooglers black panther movie can give us this but from what ive seen here i dont believe any movie with 8 or more avengers at once will be able to do it    when the film acknowledges and creates conflict out of the fact that they kill people when they destroy buildings its good to see that theyre doing it but nothing about this idea actually gets developed enough to become worth caring about even though this conflict draws obvious parallels to the uss conflict in the middle east it doesnt bother to explore a political stance and settles for the mere idea that maybe theyre killing people and its bad     the russo brothers do an okay job with action scenes because the continuity is well established but the direction isnt stylish or interesting visually and the fast cutting doesnt do much to separate these scenes from any other action movies i do appreciate the practical effects and the action was thankfully down to earth which was unexpected for such a big movie there werent any giant space alien robot battles like there were in avengers or guardians     i felt that the stakes were surprisingly low and it killed a lot of the action scenes for me many scenes involve people trying to kill the winter soldier and captain america not wanting them to do that and most of whats at stake is just that captain america would prefer they not kill him the other action scene is the airport scene which has fun with itself and thats why its good but its odd that theyre fighting each other yet they dont want to kill each other the stakes in the drama seem like they should be high considering everyones now thinking about the civilians but the movie diminishes this conflict by putting so much importance on the winter soldier characters conflict which is a distraction from the interesting questions at hand     humor is rare here but its done very well when it comes and proves once again that humor is one of marvels best redeeming factors i really enjoyed tom hollands appearance as spiderman in the film because it didnt take itself so seriously his and antmans presence in the airport scene added a needed comedic dynamic to that battle scene which helped make it the only memorable action scene in the film    as far as characters go theres something about the russo brothers touch that puts the characters at a distance its like were always watching them from some glossy mint conditioned packaging and were not able to get inside their skin or explore their human qualities the approach the camera takes in how it films the actors does a lot and in many of these superhero films it limits how much we can get in their heads while there is an effort made to develop character it feels insignificant kind of like it was thrown in so that the russos could say see theres character     there is also an effort made to establish depth or at least the illusion that there is depth and its a flimsy one the mere fact that the avengers kill civilians and that maybe they shouldnt isnt deep and thats about as far as the film goes with that theme a theme of revenge is introduced later on and i give that credit for being somewhat present throughout the film in retrospect but theres nothing unique about this theme and it has been done better in hundreds of other movies    i think people are holding marvel to too low standards this movie isnt a good example of character depth or engaging story as an action movie its not so bad but its nothing spectacular for a lot of people having superheroes in the movie is an advantage by default but its not for me theres very little i will remember from this movie
May 26 2016,positive,long overdue review from when i saw it on opening night     this is a high quality marvel film ranked number 3 on my list behind avengers 1 and guardians of the galaxy that reaches amazing highs but still ultimately let down by the same issues that have plagued marvel films from day one    first the positives this film has some of the best action scenes going around that airport scene is the culmination of all the work marvel has done this point with their characters i liked the fight between batman and superman it was impressive but in all honesty those two versions of those characters hadnt earnt that fight the gang of marvel characters have been with us for years now and we have been building to moments like this for years    a big plus spiderman tom hollands perter parker is a young version of spiderman that we have yet to see on the big screen until now hes only in the 3 scenes and they are probably the best scenes in the movie black panther is a great new addition to the team as well as he provides a bit more of a serious character to the mix that really helps but one cant help but think he would have left an even stronger impression if spiderman was left out of the film im ready to see the solo spiderman film next year from what i saw but im not jazzed to see a black panther solo film just yet marvel should seriously consider getting him in another ensemble film before his solo debut in 2019    now for the bad the villain i think was intentionally low key to keep the focus on our feuding heros but i think he suffers from being one of many low key villains with the exception of loki and to a lesser degree red skull in the first cap movie there have been no villains that have left a powerful impression on audiences even thanos hasnt got off his chair yet and showed us what hes got avengers 3 is gonna have to do a lot to convince they can raise the stakes with a truly compelling villain speaking of raising the stakes    marvel doesnt kill any of their heroes of substance we lost quciksilver a hero we knew for all of 45 minutes of screen time in avengers 2 since then none of our heroes have left us sure this film examines the idea of human casualty extremely well but do we care about random guy in building who died in fictional action films no we care about the characters we have invested hours into and none of them have ever been in genuine threat in future films this does need to change without spoiling too much there was an opportunity in this film to have that happen but fails right at end    all the negativity aside this is a really great marvel film where relationships take centre stage and all the time we have spent with these characters pay dividends in the end as the avengers take a new form that will impact future films    any fan of the marvel universe has probably already seen this needs to see this and for those that are thinking theyll give it a go this is an okay jumping in point if your okay to catch up on the films later
May 26 2016,negative,god this was bad even for a marvel film i actually feel asleep watching it the only funny moments ware with antman dont know how it has such a high rating here but i guess marvel fans will give a good rating to anything with the marvel name on it
May 26 2016,neutral,this proves marvel should stick to the formula of a cartoonish plot  it got bogged down with story too much  if it wasnt for spiderman and antman it wouldnt have had a feel of a marvel fun picture
May 26 2016,positive,all i really cared about was spiderman tm
May 26 2016,neutral,meh  spiderman was right  action was fine  too many stupid jokes in these movies  didnt really follow the comic story yes i get its a movie and its different but didnt really even stay close  andthe reason for civil war and best friends pissed at each other was a stupid bad guy and one had information about the others parents death  let down ending
May 26 2016,positive,very good movie not the best with the avengers but good they finally got spiderman right
May 26 2016,positive,very good movie one of the best ones ive ever seen
May 26 2016,negative,quite boring and far too long
May 26 2016,positive,actionpacked  storyline  could have been more but all in all very good
May 26 2016,positive,great movie    the last marvel movie of any note i am quitting support of the franchise after they make capt america gay
May 26 2016,positive,best superhero movie marvel has made
May 26 2016,positive,yet another marvelous film from marvel they display a great contrast of both sides of the ball really making you question whos right and whos wrong     the action scenes were no short amazing and thrilling
May 26 2016,positive,really enjoyed it its what bvs wishes it was that said i was missing the gravitas on the first view i want to see it again to see if it was just my mood that day
May 26 2016,positive,went to see this movie and i am blow away how amazing this movie is  its a must to see
May 26 2016,positive,a great cast and great direction help create one of the best movies of the year balancing humour action and drama as perfect as we come to expect from a marvel film captain america civil war is a fun and satisfying summer blockbuster that will be ranked among the best and set a new benchmark for future superhero team up movies
May 26 2016,positive,very good film maybe a marvel film will be in my near future
May 25 2016,positive,i was never a huge cap fan in the comics but the movies have made me a bigger fan be it his own movies or the avengers movies cap is one of my favorite live action superheroes now it was easy to be on his profreedom side in this movie it had excellent fight scenes with the only draw back being way too long ongoing sitdown conversational scenes between the great action
May 25 2016,positive,spiderman enough said
May 25 2016,negative,oh my god it was so boring    i cant even bring myself to say more
May 25 2016,negative,90 are you kidding  this was a horrible movie
May 25 2016,positive,its both entertaining and boring
May 25 2016,negative,i love all the avangers and capt america movies this one was a never ending nightmare no story for the first half more boredom at the second many people left the cinema in the first half and no one waited for the after credits   one word for the directors when you shake the camera like crazy its not action its chaos
May 25 2016,positive,with a excellent mix of action background good personalites and comic relief civil war stands out as one of the best marvel movies to date
May 25 2016,negative,welp two and a half hours of nothing new spiderman was refreshing and the only reason for the two stars
May 25 2016,positive,such a great plot there is so much depth to this hero vs hero movie that dawn of justice lacked spiderman and black panther are amazing
May 25 2016,positive,this movie is perfect the cast even thought is a big one all shine this is marvel pinnacle surpassing this is gonna be tough to
May 25 2016,positive,if youve watched every film in the mcu starting with the first iron man this movie is the culmination of everything built up between tony and steve  marvel has earned every payoff and action sequence in this film and not just simply for having this be the 13th movie in the mcu and not the second or third  however if you have not seen any of the other previous films at this point youre going to be fucking lost at least in some ways its still a comic book movie  its a commitment for sure so its up to you  but if you like this shit at all its easily in the top 10
May 25 2016,positive,great movie lots of action and actually a few surprises marvel does it again
May 25 2016,positive,the most fun ive had at a movie since mad max fury road and in many cases more so i didnt think itd be possible to top the first avengers movie in terms of action set pieces and allaround spectacle but i was so happy to be wrong the action sequences are astoundingly wellchoreographed in particular the airport fight scene as far as the story goes considering its a film series about costumewearing superheroes its surprisingly relevant and deep  this is in my opinion the best marvel movie to date
May 25 2016,positive,this was a well done chapter in the avengers story worth seeing in 3d
May 25 2016,positive,it needed more plot and conversation and less fighting all of the fights in this movie couldve been avoided if someone had simply explained themselves beforehand teamspiderman
May 25 2016,negative,subject has nothing to show but useless avengers appearences and pretending to be a civil war a movie about local conflict between cap and stark would be much more interesting as its the only thing to be good in this film being avengers 25 just adds a completely unsatisfaction with characters illogical movements with a bit of washy action scenes
May 25 2016,positive,cap vs iron man  i mean good vs bad  yeah
May 25 2016,neutral,too long got a bit silly with all the various characters turning up preferred the previous ca
May 25 2016,positive,a great movie with  superb action sequences one of the best superhero films of all time
May 25 2016,positive,the captain america films are by far the best series of films in the marvel universe so far i enjoyed aspects of this one more than the winter soldier but i still feel the winter soldier is the better film in the end
May 25 2016,positive,55  one of the best super hero films ever made and definitely in the top tier of marvel movies  well written and thought provoking and even the minor characters are well utilized
May 25 2016,positive,civil war gives marvel fans the great comedy and action scenes theyre known for while also showing a darker more mature tone to set up future marvel films
May 25 2016,positive,marveldisney continues with the radical notion that a movie about superheros can have a compelling narrative structure and treat its audience like adults and captain america civil war is a better movie for it   tony stark robert downey jr who stopped selling weapons and became iron man because his actions cost lives comes to the realization meta humans fighting in major urban centers could also cost lives  understanding that running a successful business doesnt qualify a person to execute military actions around the world he tries to convince steve rodgers chris evans and the rest of the avengers still on earth that its time to give control over to the united nations  rodgers disagrees feeling nothing should stop a person from doing what they think is right when a friend is accused of a terrorist attack the avengers pick side on how to act    everyone is good in this movie but robert downey jr who has been stark for 8 years carries the heart of the entire story  this might be the best acting in any superhero film since the dark knight
May 25 2016,positive,rethinking the concept of what a traditional trilogy has been as in each film reflects beginning middle and ending chapters marvels third steve rogers film 2016s captain america civil war doesnt close out a contained story but continues the mega studios dominance on creating escapist entertainment with enough wit and charm to steamroll into other entries  returning directors anthony and joe russo who helmed 2014s excellent winter solder use civil war as ascension of topics and story threads that have technically been building since universal studios 2008 lackluster the incredible hulk and like the other many components to this franchise it is an enjoyable ride to see new and familiar faces show up and that is a partial hindrance to the russos aesthetic going into this entry where in winter solider the filmmaking was visceral and the action grounded when told through a few vulnerable characters civil war has the obligation of needing to be an avengerslite affair and it doesnt add up as well as it could have after seeing characters shrink sling and defy gravity which is amazing and then go back to the grounded approach there is an unwanted feeling of having your cake and eating it too it leaves the finale feeling flat due to the escalation of what was seen previous but thats the difficulty with these franchise entries where the bigger picture breadcrumbs from marvel have to build toward the next where certain things need to happeneven at the detriment of an aesthetic from the filmmakers example is the awkward cavepool scene featuring thor in 2015s age of ultron there isnt much closure with captain america civil warit only leaves more questions characters and places to seebut it continues marvels solid work of assembly line filmmaking
May 25 2016,positive,with this summer superhero blockbuster we are treated to is a rollercoaster ride where the heroes become involved in a law and orderlevel morality argument over the nature of free will where the avengers must rely on their own moral compasses to determine which causes require their attention and that of having an external control group to ostensibly keep them from running off the reservation and getting involved willynilly in incidents that dont concern them     what makes it work is that this film is more than just spandexwrapped heroes bashing each other but fully threedimensional characters fighting for realworld issues    for the rest of my review follow the link    
May 25 2016,positive,by far the best marvel movie thus far
May 25 2016,positive,the 3rd installment in the captain america franchise and the 13th in the marvel cinematic universe and this is my of both the story is great action spectacular and the introductions of new characters like black panther and spiderman are done so well its scary marvel knows how to make great movies and i cant wait to see whats next in the mcu antman is spectacular scarlet witch and vision have great moments there is really nothing i can say bad about the film some may dislike the villain or slight shaky cam but i didnt mind either this is my favorite marvel film to date and my favorite movie of the year so far spectacular
May 25 2016,positive,a great movie overall at some points i asked my self why some things were happening but overall it was extremely enjoyable
May 25 2016,positive,great action movie with good plot
May 25 2016,neutral,it checks all the boxes of what a fun and enjoyable superhero film should be but it abandons all pretense of stakes or answering the difficult questions that it brings up halfway through in favor of showing as many heroes as possible in an admittedly fun action scene that seems to only justify one side of the conflict
May 25 2016,positive,the idea of the film is very brilliant wherein  a person wants to take revenge for loss of his family who were the fatality due to the avengers war against hydra and others he uses the weakness of the avengers and pits them against each other a lovely thought which makes the action in film have reason a film must watch
May 25 2016,positive,a nearperfect superhero film weve had plenty of time to invest in these characters and as a result there is genuine care about what happens to them the conflict between teamcap and teamironman was well executed because i still dont know after two viewings which side i think was in the right all the returning characters were given at least one cool thing to do each and the new characters spiderman and black panther were introduced perfectly as a result of civil war im legitimately excited about black panther and spiderman homecoming the villain played by daniel bruhl was very understated and provided a different kind of bad guy to what we normally get in a marvel movie the way that so many characters and plot threads came together has given me plenty of faith that these directors will be perfect for the infinity war films in a few years time
May 24 2016,positive,i loved it spiderman was amazing tom holland did a perfect job as the wall crawler black panther was flawless everything i hoped he would be on screen and of course paul rudd was again an incredible antmanscott lang so awesome a few scenes were drawn out making this a very long movie but im a marvelcandonowrong marvel fanatic 
May 24 2016,positive,having seen this movie twice now i am elated in that nothing is lost upon repeat viewings of the film on the contrary what you find is that upon second viewing you notice much more than you thought was initially there and this is in no small part due to the intricacies of this film and the cornucopia of characters this movie juggles although the russos are tasked with juggling over 2 dozen characters main and supporting characters they pull it off without a proverbial hitch as they along with the and i dont use the word lightly craftsmen auteurs christopher markus and stephen mcfeely who upon minor research i discovered to have also penned the narnia trilogy along with a few other films many of which are part of the marvel cinematic universe because of this the directors writers and creative team who will also helm the two upcoming thanoscentric films of the mcu have given me more than confidence that they are indeed up to the task     the movie takes full advantage of its entrenchment within the mcu bringing in characters from the very depths of the mcus archive general thunderbolt ross however regardless of this entrenchment the movie craftsman experience which can be understood rather well regardless of your level of knowledge of the prior mcu entries this serves as a big plus because even the uninitiated can enjoy this film along with this movies juggling act and its reaching into the depths of the mcu for characters previously featured captain america civil war also introduces two major players into the fray black panther and spiderman both of which will be receiving their own films within the next 3 years     marvel at this point is known for its definitive castings even when they on the seldom occasion recast and chadwick boseman and tom holland black panther and spiderman respectively are another 2 of those definitive castings of which only marvel studios makes    for those who in seeing the trailers worried that this cap film may just be avengers 25 fear not the movie is definitely capcentric and when you see the cap trilogy as a whole is the logical conclusion to this character s arc within the trilogy as he is now on the other side of where he began mirroring iron mans arc in his respective trilogy beautifully in leading to this film having fought a hostile emey threat twice hydra but in different forms the clash of ideologies between friends seems absolutely essential    the theme of captain america civil war is friendships as i think his film we see the power of the bond of friendships as well as the power that the fraying of friendships carries with it and having the triangle of rogersstarkandbucky carry the film give the overall theme all the more gravitas when you see the two factions make their choices as they are all friends before they were foes    now to the villain and baron zemo the villain here is yet another great antagonist crafted by the creative team unlike loki ronan malekith and the like this villain doesnt have to do much to achieve his objective and at the end of the film youre left sympathetic towards his reasons why hes doing what he does the villain mirrors the civil war occurring between the avengers as there are clear pros and cons to each side so that youre left arguing long after the runtime has expired as to whos side youre truly on     the film is a must see for both the initiated and uninitiated but trust me when i tell the uninitiated in the bunch that a viewing of the prior 12 entries of the mcu will greatly heighten your enjoyment of captain america civil war i know i didnt go into depth of the roster of avengers we know and love but i did that on purpose for you so that you can discover it all for yourselfi dare not rob you from the gems that this movie has to offer this is moviecriticrob from the youtube channel aptly named the movie channel and im signing off
May 24 2016,negative,while i was a huge fan of the writing pacing acting and overall production of the first two captain america movies i found this one to be pretty boring it wasnt paced very well i wasnt all that invested in the narrative and the major fights were just soso    i also hated the new rendition of spiderman and have grown pretty tired of the depictions of him as a highschool super hero despite him having so much more complexity in the comics
May 24 2016,positive,marvel does it again this movie had me hooked from beginning to end there are so many cool twist and turns the new characters are awesome the action is stunning and it leaves you wondering whats gonna happen in the next marvel movie these characters are in i did feel the villain was weak but tolerable and finally we get an awesome spiderman performer one who doesnt take off his mask constantly or wines although i dont know why they call it captain america civil war thats my only problem with this film they call it captain america but iron man and other members of the avengers are a big part of it and the new characters are key so i wouldve called it marvels civil war but i digress
May 24 2016,negative,the action scenes distract the audience from the bad plot it is just a movie to see our favourite heroes fighting but there is no story development neither an evil plot or good villain it is just an ego fight between the heroes to make the fanboys happy and an introduction to spiderman
May 24 2016,positive,took me a few views to come to this conclusion its a flawed film due in part to having such a large cast of characters to flesh out in 2 12 hours leaving some important ones underdeveloped  i did love what they did with black panther and spidey  those beats were brilliant  ultimately a good film that i expected to be exceptional  well see what they do with infinity war
May 24 2016,positive,this movie is everything batman v superman should have been  black panther and spiderman are introduced to the marvel cinematic universe mcu in a way that seems organic  the plot makes sense  the stakes mean something to longtime fans of the mcu  theres plenty of action and laughs
May 24 2016,positive,do not know how many times ive watched this i love it
May 24 2016,positive,this is how the avengers franchise should have started the other movies cant add up to this spidey is awesome as long as he is wearing the mask
May 24 2016,negative,well i reserve the right to upgrade my review if you know i can stay awake for the entire length next time but to say this movie cost 250 million dollars i couldnt tell it looked too cheap the falling scenes looked like they simply dropped dummies and there were way too many cartoon characters running around it made it look silly and none of the characters received adequate depth i expected more from a marvel movie sorry again i may give it a second look when it gets to redbox
May 24 2016,positive,90     this addition to the mcu lives up to all of the hype it received and payed us back with all of the action well timed humor and fun superheroes that marvel fans have come to expect
May 24 2016,positive,before even writing this i know i am in the minority i am one of the very few it seems that was not blown away by civil war just my opinion  first off are the positives spiderman and black panther these two characters were awesome and really gave the film life for me antman was funny as usual and some of the fight scenes were amazing the airport scene was the saving grace   however for me the plot was garbage heres what i dont get in the opening battle scene scarlet witch stops the bomb from going off but cant quite get control of her powers and it ends up killing some people terrible however she saved hundreds of people by doing that a few died yes but she saved hundreds so the us government uses this as a catalyst to limit what the avengers can and cant do they are using destruction and death to prove a point showing them scenes from new york city in the avengers first film the country in age of ultron that was destroyed and the recent explosion from the films opening i found it really interesting that no one mentioned that the us government literally dropped a nuke on nyc in the avengers to stop the alien invasion they are giving the avengers a hard time and yet they had no problem almost leveling nyc huge plot hole  what weak villain too you mean to tell me that in just over a year this regular soldier orchestrates this ridiculous plot to tear the avengers apart he infiltrates how many secret organizations and manipulates the greatest heroes in the worldin a year nope and even after the whole thing comes apart where we see that the winter solider killed starks family while still brainwashed mind you they still fight bucky was a sleep agent and had no control over anythingand everyone knows thisand they still fight that was such a weak plot point   the only character in my opinion with any actual reason to go on one of the many vendettas in this movie was black panther he thinks bucky killed his dad so hes going to kill bucky simple right makes sense but as soon as he learns that bucky wasnt actually the killer and he was a puppet of hydra when he did those terrible things he forgives him and stops the realy bad guy so if it wasnt for panther the bad guy would have got away free by offing himself while the whinging old guys bitched downstairs     it had good spots but overall this was very overrated
May 24 2016,positive,after about eleven years of watching and reading marvel  from comics to video games to movies to tv shows  i have never had as much of a great time as i had watching captain america civil war is that a great amount of hyperbole probably yes but hear me out    captain america civil war is based on the civil war comic series which feature marvel heroes captain americasteve rogers chris evans and iron mantony stark robert downey jr facing off in an incredible battle the comic series had multiple issues and pulled several elite characters into it creating an epic battle along with an epic concept captain america civil war did not disappoint    the films plot revolves around the idea that there have been too many casualties surrounding the avengers  including their battles in new york washington and sokovia the united nations present the remaining superheroes as thor and hulk have disappeared with a document called the sokovian accords which state that the heroes can do their jobs only when they are told to do so and if they act outside of their boundaries then they will be arrested tony stark and several others agree to sign the document while steve rogers declines to sign the superheroes form their teams throughout the movie and they eventually clash in a captivating and entertaining battle    captain america civil war includes the debuts of great characters such as black panther chadwick boseman and the new spiderman tom holland i cannot say enough how incredible of a job tom holland does as spiderman as he is just one of the many actors in this film that creates intrigue and entertainment with their characters as far as the storyline goes the audience is presented with an excellent conflict which only furthers the anticipation as to who is going to win the battle with other marvel films the good guys face the bad guys and the good guys usually win while some may get hurt they usually end up fine at the end in captain america civil war the audience does not have that luxury of just siding with the good guys both teams present great points and deliver spectacular dialogue that keeps the audience involved in whatever is going on    technically marvel studios proves once again that it knows how to make a film everything from the lighting to the camera shot variety is darn perfect while the introduction is a bit messy and hard to follow it is a minor setback in an otherwise great film on a personal note the fight choreography is what stood out for me i like realistic approaches to stories and films in captain america civil war some of the fights feel almost too real as every punch and kick means something every blow and action creates a devastating impact that is so compelling you needed to just sit back in awe of what is transpiring    in conclusion captain america civil war will get you on the edge of your seats and leave you fully entertained and satisfied i believe the movie is intended for the other side of 13yearolds as the action scenes are very intense and the occasional cursing is rough as well i give this movie 5 out of 5 captain america shields because of its brutal fight scenes beautiful story flawless visuals and incredible dialogue    reviewed by brandon c kids first film critic age 17
May 24 2016,positive,absolutely fantastic movie except that its in no way cap 3 its either iron man 4 or avengers 25 i cant decide go in understanding that and youll love it
May 24 2016,positive,first things first the movie was way beyond extraordinary especially the fighting scenes it was more than what i was expected we could get every element in this like hilarious moments serious darker intense moments and i really didnt except much serious and darker part in the climax it was great about winter soldier and made it better furthering the story this is yet another addition to the marvel franchise and its an entertaining story spider man black panther and ant man they really stole the show in the airport scene the film is one of the best of mcu almost on par with avengers winter soldier ironman and guardians of the galaxy   trust me guys you will enjoy this
May 24 2016,positive,it hits all the notes it does everything i expected yet also sneaks in a few surprises lighthearted moments and a perfect reference to another revered movie
May 24 2016,positive,this movie was so amazing great fight scenes funny humour excellent character involvement everyone must watch this movie because if how amazing it is
May 24 2016,positive,its a fun funny superhero film worth seeing on the big screen the villain and ending was a let down for me
May 24 2016,positive,it was very well done some of the cast decisions were a bit disappointing seeing how marvel always linked its movies youl know what im talking about once you watch it over all it was great plot on your edge and thrilling story also the decisions they made to reunite the heroes
May 24 2016,negative,wasnt much of a civil war
May 24 2016,positive,loved it they made spiderman a little wimpy but overall liked the movie looking forward to the others
May 24 2016,positive,if you stripped away the powers this movie would still be amazing
May 24 2016,positive,great movie thought the villain should have been different 
May 24 2016,positive,i loved it i had low expectations for this film as i havent been a big captain america movie fan though i love avengers this movie was a lot better than i anticipated it seemed more like an avengers movie minus hulk and thor great action intriguing storyline and i was fully committed when i realized spideman was in it by the way why are there 900 different people playing spiderman overall a great film and a mustsee if you love marvel like i do
May 24 2016,positive,better than i thought
May 24 2016,negative,over rated nonsense seriously 90 rating is a joke xmen got a 52 and is in a completely different league tomatometer cannot be trusted
May 24 2016,positive,fights are amazing it feels like really big wwe match or a moba game
May 24 2016,positive,amazing marvel hits another home run
May 24 2016,negative,a dumb plot fueled by the inconsistent stupidity of all the flat characters involved some of whom are extremely forced in
May 24 2016,positive,another home run for marvel  very well done  just sad seeing cap and ironman fight   whether seeing it in 3d or 2d it is a must see
May 24 2016,negative,not a whole lot of anything new more marvel nonsense
May 24 2016,positive,captain america civil war once again follows the tone of what winter soldier had and if it isnt broke dont fix it captain america civil war gives us an engaging story to follow and the russo brothers prove once again how much of an investing yet kick ass character captain america can be but not only do they do that with just captain america but also with every other hero and character stark is the best hes been since the first ironman and the new characters like black panther and spiderman feel organic to the plot because of the wonderful script civil war is an emotional thrill ride with a lot of fun action sequences and emotional character moments showing the mcu at its best
May 24 2016,positive,one of the best superhero movies ever
May 24 2016,positive,pretty good instantly forgettable though
May 24 2016,positive,great movie the best action scene in movie history spiderman and black panther are awesome
May 24 2016,positive,this is by far the best marvel movie yet and the 2nd best superhero movie of all time
May 24 2016,positive,fantastic movie with great ideas cameos and plot twists
May 23 2016,negative,his is a little better than ultron but not b much this movie way overplays the collateral damage issue  even if you accept the motivation of the characters to reform their vigilantly behavior the movie still does not work  the villain is never developed and just provides multiple excuses for the super heros to fight each other  too many heros  only captain america  and maybe black panther have any real motivation or makes any sense  the worst is vision they had no idea what to do with that character  there is one twist at the end with the winter soldier that fits but otherwise the ending is a let down     the villian is just a n excuse to ge
May 23 2016,positive,some awkwardness to the conflicts but great pacing good story nice character development and good action  brings some intelligent tread about the need to regulate the superheroes without grinding down into a political flick  slick action overall
May 23 2016,positive,sure its a little clunky in spurts but it delivers big time and rockets to the top heap of marvels monolithic franchise
May 23 2016,positive,marvel cinematic universe and super hero are literally divided before an after this film this master piece is best super hero movie of all the time
May 23 2016,negative,pretentious slow moving and generally dull takes itself way too seriously when the plot itself is very weak a lot of the scenes were just filler to introduce new characters into the avengers brand or promote the fact there is going to be yet another spiderman reboot  all for one fight scene then they fade back into irrelevancy by the cliche anticlimactic sorry bro ending
May 23 2016,positive,loved every moment  and the popcorn wasnt bad either 
May 23 2016,positive,come on it wasnt that bad if youve watched the other marvel movies and want to check this out then id recommend it you do need to see the other marvel movies to understand the movie fully however
May 23 2016,positive,best then superman vs batman better it have black panther i was in there doing back flips in cartwills i was dabbing all day for neaveah david carrilo in axel hernandez
May 23 2016,positive,great movie 2nd best action hero movie behind avengers
May 23 2016,positive,a mustsee  also a mustread  theres little overlap so both comic and film can be enjoyed as independent works
May 23 2016,negative,im a big marvel and avengers fan and im sorry to say this one did not do it for me beautiful visuals some nice humor and the premise is fine and a plausible reason for the superheroes to have an important philosophical disagreement but i felt they skipped over a lot in lieu of fight and chase scenes and its just too dark  too painful all superhero movies have some dark side but this one was short the victorious payoff moments to balance it out it left us leaving the theatre on a lownoteheavy not what i count on from a marveltype superhero movie
May 23 2016,negative,very tedious hyper active costume play  time to stop this superhero slop show  its 2016 after all
May 23 2016,negative,as a captain america fan i was very disappointed the movie really shouldnt be titled as a captain america movie because its more of an avengers movie and i dont particularly care for the avengers movies too many boring characters but even taking it as an avengers movie i still thought it was weak i was waiting for some kind of left hook in the movie but it never came it was very play it safe i would probably like it if i were 12 years old but not so much at 31 also i dont like how marvel keeps bringing in random characters more boring characters like the witch and black panther while other solid characters like the hulk and thor fall by the way a little it just seemed like a halfhearted movie with no oomph to it
May 23 2016,positive,my son  i totally enjoyed it  totally awesome
May 23 2016,positive,are we even talking about this as with most marvel movies this movie is so good it doesnt even need to be reviewed
May 23 2016,positive,best captain america thus far i didnt like the previous ones well winter solider was ok i happy that it was worth all the hype and way better than bvs but that goes without saying because of the mix reviews and im not a marvel fan but their movies have been good looking forward for the next one which under fox xmen doctor strange not sure of but this movie glad i seen this in theaters
May 23 2016,positive,great movie a bit unhappy but great
May 23 2016,positive,that was probably the best film ive seen in ages i have a headache thats my 10yo daughters review and shes not far wrong in fact the best film shes ever seen is probably walle or spirited away but ill let that pass    this is in the top tier of mcu films if only for how it aims high and just about makes it i bought most of the plot machinations that lead the avengers to split and duke it out in an evacuated airport theres enough humour and knowingselfreferential gags to lighten the often sombre tone there are great setpieces throughout especially the climactic airport battles i love antman not seen his film yet and the new spiderman is fantastic i didnt miss ms ppotts at all i really like black panthers story arc    but there was quite a bit of niggly stuff i couldnt shake after destroying 2 major metropolises is the straw that breaks the camels back and lands the avengers in a whole heap otrouble really a dozen people dying in a hotel and spoiler alert after 2 hours of steve rogers wanting to defend and protect dear ole bucky that storyline just fizzles out unresolved in every possible way and after the socalled climactic airport sequence they drag out a further 40 minutes during which the imminent threat of a miniarmy of psychokillerwintersoldiers disappears in an offscreen blink of an eye and it turns out niki lauda was behind everything despite coming from the devastated ruins of segovia he seemed to have unlimited resources and abilities    so much to like so many niggles to get niggled by and it gave me a headache too
May 23 2016,negative,i am not sure what movie everyone else saw but what i was the second half of the avengers age of ultron that i had seen the prior year  it starts a fight in a middle of a town square and that leads people wanting the avengers to be accountable for their actions and as the deal went they had to sign a sort on to a sort of watch dog type of program this pitted captain america against iron man and the twin girl that switched sides after her brother died she was basically under lock and key due to her not being able to control her powers reminded me a lot of the blonde twin and daughter of the cheerleader who was destined to save the world in the returned now over again heroes all of the issues that they face both personally and with each other lead to the dividing of the superheroes as they were fighting against each other we also see the return of antman and a very green spiderman whom iron man visits in the teens ny apartment and spends time and flirts with his aunt and brings him back to the fight while spiderman added a source of amusement with his ongoing cracks and mistakes i was confused  i mean first i had already seen this in avengers why am i paying to watch it again and how can no one else notice then in regards to iron mans love life it seems like he kinda just gave up on every being with pepper and moved on while i was left saying ummmm what happened to pepper as it was addressed a little in age of ultron but not in captain america    the whole movie ended with them locked up and after having recently watched batmanvsuperman where i was shocked first at how bad batman really was killing as if it were just a sport and superman acting all high and mighty and them becoming more and more hostile towards another until supermans mom who has the same name as batmans long dead mother was kidnapped and the 2 were placed against each other when if they just would have taken the time to talk they could have avoided draining each other of energy so that when mr bad showed up maybe superman wouldnt have died thats where my movie ends with the world burying superman while the family privately buries clark and lois is left with just a ring to hold on to    while i know other people got a entire movie thats the end of mine and knowing that the comics have him coming back to life isnt helpful and no other movie is even in the works right now     so the lesson from all the latest superhero movies i have seen is basically telling me that love doesnt conquer all saving the world only gets you in more trouble for not falling the rules and even superman can die where does a person go when even hollywood looks like they are giving up
May 23 2016,positive,thanks to my older brother i was a genuine marvel comic book geek at about age 6  yes i learned to read by reading comic books   the avengers were my particular favorite  but i was not a captain america fan  he neither turned me off or got me interested  he was kind of a place holder  so when i heard marvel was making a ca movie i wasnt too excited until i saw it    to my great surprise these three films have become just about my favorites in the marvel movie universe and that is saying a lot      marvel made a genius casting call when they got chris evans to play cap  he brings so much to that role     hes the paradox of the gorgeous captain of the football team guy who should be the center of attention and popular with everyone but evans plays him like the outsider the guy who never fits in  i love that       as to this particular movie i dont want to say too much about the plot  like winter soldier before it the punch line took me very much by surprise    it doesnt go where you think its going almost up until the very end   theres the requisite mega superhero battle but it manages not to overwhelm an excellent script   i will say that a very young spider mans midmovie entrance comes close to stealing the show and provides some of the biggest laughs in what is a pretty serious movie    the ending leaves you wanting to know how they are going to resolve this  cant wait to see what marvel does with this situation in avengers 3  its going to be very very interesting
May 23 2016,positive,this is what superhero movies should aspire to be after watching the shitstorm that is batman v superman courtesy of zac snyder captain america civil war  by the russo brothers is exactly the pallet cleanser you need    this movie has managed to blend intricate mature and deep storylines with lighthearted comic book goodness in a fashion that only the russo brothers could especially after their success with captain america winter soldier     this movie has the best marvel fight scene thus far and arguably the best superhero plot except nolans the dark knight probably     dc comics and warner bros studio this is the standard that you should achieve if you ever want to beat marvel in terms of depth and entertainment
May 23 2016,neutral,much more of an avengers movies
May 23 2016,positive,an avengers film titled as a captain america film  the predictable storyline disappoints but the action scenes keep it moving cdw
May 23 2016,positive,the best ive seen in a while
May 23 2016,negative,cap im mad at you iron man im mad at you boom bang explosions cap ill be there for you the end  ps sassy spider man
May 23 2016,positive,pretty good one this  and captain americasoldier winter are the highpoint not only the mcu but the superhero genremaybe not quite the civil war story from the comic which i wished for but honestly the comic storyline civil war  can not be covered in just one movie and there are other reasons toowell in short its was really an amazing movie
May 23 2016,positive,great action and entertaining but overrated nonetheless    i never expected to say this honest to god but i loved batman v superman more  perhaps ive been super excited for bvs ever since i was a kid and i only saw this movie as another marvel movie and dont care much for it  thats how it turned out  for kevin smith to call it the greatest comic book movie ever is reaching  i just saw the movie as more of the same  perhaps ill enjoy it better in the future as i have with antman but this isnt a landmark film    avengers was a landmark the dark knight was a landmark iron man was a landmark and man of steel was a landmark civil war is just another 1 hr long episode of the marvel series
May 23 2016,negative,i like rdj as tony stark and expected this to be good fun after witterers wittered about it recently  but this   im not the biggest fan  of superhero movies but this was really rubbish
May 23 2016,positive,instantly up there amongst the best of what marvel has done i loved that it addressed the human cost of collateral damage something that these types of action films always ignore all the drama and action created in this film came from a very real and emotional place everything was tied up in a few things that had happened and the varying results could be felt from different viewpoints one of my favourite things in a film is when you can empathise with the villain marvel hasnt always done villains that well but this film was different and all the better for it there were still a few cheesy quips thrown in especially during the less intense moments of action but thats to be expected plus some of the lines were great especially involving spiderman who was excellent this hit the perfect balance of being interesting emotional and entertaining and i completely loved it
May 23 2016,positive,didnt compromise the validity of who captain america is that very fact along with some amazing scenes of character development and action i give this movie an a it wasnt great but it was very good
May 23 2016,positive,not the best marvel movie but it had a lot of great elements to it
May 23 2016,negative,dark and violent just not my cup of tea
May 23 2016,positive,as it comes to the comics the premise of civil war has been changed to fit the universe to make it fit with our modern heros today adding only 6 heros on each side of tony stark and steve rogers the 2 heros clash when a registration act called the soviet accords demands the heros to be put on the govt leash while a good idea to tony steve refuses to sign these accords just like the comics while that stays the same the rest of the film  goes into its own story to completely make this a captain america sequel and does this work yes it does civil war proves that the russo brothers who will be taking the reigns of the anticipated infinty war have what it takes to put a dozen super heros in 1 film and make them all relevent and give them all time to shine while the story is basic there are other layers that surprised me that give these emotional characters a driven part and reason for their action this film also introduces 2 new heros on top of that and make them 2 of the best parts of the movie id say civil war is  absolutely  one of the best marvel movies with one of the best action sequences of all time but the fact that it had a strong story as well to keep it together is just mind blowing 
May 23 2016,positive,with all the personalities civil war truly plays out like a third avengers movie besting age of ultron 2015 for emotional depth but lacking the breezy joy of the avengers 2012 the story is at its best in quieter moments when it focuses on the personality of the individual the narrative gives clear understandable reasons as to why each superhero aligns with the side that they do chris evans and robert downey jr deserve major kudos for anchoring the production with sincere performances that captivate our attention thats not easy to do with a cast of this magnitude in a film full of many highs i did not expect antman  spiderman to be at the very top  both have amusing vignettes that make the promise of 2017s spiderman homecoming and 2018s antman and the wasp something i am now willing to embrace rather than dread additionally the heavy emotional burden that bucky barnes carries as the winter soldier is emphasized his relationship with steve rogers his buddy since childhood is affirmed as well these cast members stand out in a roster that is uniformly excellent i could cite more characters and the traits that make them interesting but that would spoil the fun of discovery its their complex backstories that help secure our interest in the personal dynamics of these people they give the heroes depth that is what makes captain america civil war so gosh darn entertaining    fastfilmreviewscom
May 23 2016,negative,i really dont understand how anyone can like this movie better than previous mcu films  black panther is boring and pointless to the story especially since his wife is not allowed in the mcu due to licensing  zemo is poorly portrayed and simply terrible and the premise is dry  as a comic book fan i am getting really tired of the mcu taking fantastic comic book arcs and using them to market their films then destroying what made those comic books so great  this should really be called captain america adventures in buckysitting  wait for the blu ray if you have not seen it yet
May 23 2016,positive,fantastic installment from the marvel cinematic universe evans  downey shine
May 23 2016,positive,i did not think id enjoy this one as much as i had
May 23 2016,positive,great fun the reintroduction of spiderman was a highlight highly recommended
May 23 2016,positive,i love the marvels this was to me a great movie with mind swings tony has manicured up in this movie and showed a lot more sincerity only part i seen in the movie that i would have left out was spiderman spiderman to me was a waste of time he looks like a cartoon in the movie
May 23 2016,positive,best superhero movie ever
May 23 2016,positive,black panther  spiderman  antman  
May 23 2016,negative,not a captain america fan but i ironman rhodes spiderman to name a few are amazing as always
May 23 2016,positive,absolutely fantastic movie marvel have a fantastic way of making you want more and civil war keeps it coming in spades if you watch just 1 movie in the cinemas this year make sure its this one
May 23 2016,positive,it had fun moments tho mostly felt rushed its like a retitles avengers  the acting is fine fx fine the only problem is it was kinda rushed like batman v superman spiderman is only in the movie for 1 fight scene that lasts 510m
May 23 2016,positive,could have used zemo better
May 23 2016,positive,ehhh looks like the same old marvel stuff ill wait til dvd if i can be bothered to rent it lol
May 23 2016,positive,worth watching entertaining enjoyable
May 22 2016,negative,it sucked i walked out slow start
May 22 2016,positive,a very good superhero movie which is memorable even if its plagued by an extremely forgettable villain
May 22 2016,positive,fun and electrifying ride
May 22 2016,positive,a very good superhero movie with amazing performancesbut plagued by a villain so forgettablehis name is all i can remember now
May 22 2016,positive,i have watched this movie 3 times in the theatre and still couldnt get enough of it such a brilliantly crafted script where each character gets hisher moment to shine and yet it distinctively feels like a captain america movie its serious when it is supposed to be serious its funny when it supposed to be funny  i went through so many human emotions while watching this movie even i cant describe its so good  performance  top notch by everyone especially rdj  chris evans   story  brilliant  action  there is nothing like this ever put together in a movie screen before its just phenomenal  scene stealer  black panther spiderman  ant man perfection
May 22 2016,positive,i think its my favorite captain america movie even though it really is an avengers 25 movie  great fights scenes to do with so many main characters as well  looking forward to this new spiderman as well
May 22 2016,positive,i loved it teamcaptainamerica
May 22 2016,positive,bucky is innocent protect him
May 22 2016,positive,while superhero action packed movies the summer rage  this one has to be rated towards the top  although one maybe excused if finding the superero flix becoming pedestrian  tiresome reviewer  getting older  jaded hope young  new fans are excited and enjoy this rite of movie passage  ra reviews
May 22 2016,positive,best blockbuster movie of the year
May 22 2016,positive,great movie ant man was hilarious really look forward to the stand alone black panther movie
May 22 2016,positive,pure marvel really love the movie 
May 22 2016,positive,great movie mervel has done it again they introduced black panther perfectly and had great setups at the end for spiderman homecoming and black panther it had everythong you could want out of a superhero movie action drama and much much more a must see movie this summer
May 22 2016,positive,some of the best action set pieces of the past decade  how any screenwriter tasked to tell a new story about these characters is able to come up with something is impressive  but to come up with something good  worth watchingnice work markus  mcfeely
May 22 2016,positive,despite not much development for some of the side avengers such as spiderman hawkeye antman and vision captain america civil war has an exciting story which seems like a satisfying conclusion to the avengers saga despite two more movies confirmed
May 22 2016,negative,this movie was horrible how did this get 90 on rotten tomatoes  this movie was soooooooooooo boring  you would think they could do something cool with all this money and rights to the marvel nameinstead they just write a bunch of poop dribble with no content at alljust cg digital explosionspoop dribble at best
May 22 2016,positive,the fight choreographers could learn a lot from daredevil on netflix after seeing those fight scenes nothing measures up the action scenes in this film are too chaotic its difficult to tell whats happening this film is well done overall
May 22 2016,positive,first half was kinda slow but the ending was very good  didnt like the ending that way because now the next movie will spend half the time fixing it
May 22 2016,positive,fun movie looking forward to the  black panther  ant man and spiderman movies
May 22 2016,positive,best since original avengers movie
May 22 2016,positive,one of the best movies marvel have to offer scenes in the movie were entertaining to watch
May 22 2016,neutral,seemed pretty long and kind of lamei truly rhink they were stretching for a marvel movie
May 22 2016,positive,the russo brothers return for their second outing in the mcu with captain america civil war the movie has all the comedy and action for a regular mcu movie but with a darker and more serious tone than any movie that has come before chris evans shines again as the titular hero while rdj does a fantastic job playing a different side of tony stark a   panther h
May 22 2016,positive,this movie was awesome pretty long but didnt notice
May 22 2016,positive,i went into this movie being team captain america but left team ironman maybe this was due to my own bias towards loving antiheroes  which is exactly what stark played  or the fact that steve rodgers story wasnt the focal point of the movie this film has an avengers 3 feel to it and proceeds as if the audience knows this isnt a standalone film the russo bros are fantastic directors for the capt america movies giving them a mature realworld political thrillerfeel but perhaps not the best with nerdy humor some of the scenes were the avengers are sitting around talking couldve used the joss whedon touch the biggest pros for me would be the fight choreography the seamless introduction of two new main characters and the management of all the other characters the cons would be the villain  who really wasnt needed at all  and martin freemans role plus his american accent yuck i mean come on if youre gonna hire martin freeman then you need to give him something substantial to do overall this is highquality mcu film lots of fun and should be seen on the big screen civil war is not as intelligently written as winter solider but it is lots of fun and theres plenty of superheros punching other superheros
May 22 2016,positive,entertaining good fight scenes seemed a bit gimmicky by pulling too many different characters from other series was more of an avengers plus others than a captain america movie
May 22 2016,positive,very well put together blew me away
May 22 2016,positive,i loved this movie my favorite movie of all time
May 22 2016,positive,plenty of action but although the basis of the conflict was important the action overpowered the ideas  most of the time you forget why theyre fighting
May 22 2016,negative,not really getting the hype the story seemed pretty haphazard it didnt carry any real emotional weight i think they shouldve left out all the other heroes and just focused on cap and iron man to give it more of an emotional punch spiderman just seemed thrown in there no real explanation of how tony knew he was peter parker the casting for aunt may is pretty ridiculous i also dont understand why they bothered with zemo the villain in this movie couldve been any joe blow who lost his family this just seemed like another typical marvel movie there have been stronger ones than this it was ok but did not live up to the critical hype for me
May 22 2016,positive,one of the best super hero movies you will ever see
May 22 2016,positive,its fast its loud its another superhero movie things do make more sense than your average superhero movie though certain aspects the politics for example tries to resemble reality which is a nice change of pace the primary villains premise is still about as hollow aswellmost villains premises
May 22 2016,neutral,it was like  fox kids  channel made a movie
May 22 2016,positive,i loved this movie but i was so conflicted i do not like captain america and iron man fighting it hurts my heart lol will definitely see it again
May 22 2016,positive,pretty much the best marvel universe movie in a while there were tiny things that i could complain about but all in all it was a fine romp and the characters pretty much stayed true to themselves plus they did a good job of integrating the new characters into the movie without making it seem contrived
May 22 2016,positive,captain america civil war is essentially what the previous marvel films seem to have been mounting to  the tension between teammates that has permeated previous films comes to a climax here in civil war  generally this may be considered the best of all the marvel films to date outside of maybe guardians of the galaxy but it isnt without problems  my first beef though a small one is the fact that this is labeled as a captain america movie when much like the previous captain america film it doesnt deal with just captain america  this film felt more like an avengers film than anything  sure cap is the center of the story with his old time buddy bucky being the concept that tears the avengers apart but it is the avengers being torn apart that this film seems to be all about  they make a very distinct decision to include not only the original avengers but bring in the new ones as well as characters from previous marvel films and even someone appearing for the first time while keeping out 2 powerhouses in thor and hulk but once you get past this weird concept of an avengers film masquerading as a captain america film there is one more thing that kinda bugs me  this film as is often the case with superhero stuffs revolves around an evil master plan spoilers forthcoming this plan was built around bucky and seemed to ultimately have the end goal of bringing iron man and captain america into the same room in order to deliver some specific news and have them destroy each other  did the evil mastermind expect them to fight each other previously perhaps but that doesnt seem to be the case it seemed as though everything was riding on the final climactic scene but if thats the case theres a big problem  this final climactic confrontation isnt the result of the actions of this mastermind  in fact he could have been there waiting and only captain america might have shown up and presto he gets captured and thats the end  or if cap and bucky are stopped from reaching the plane nobody shows up  and he just waits and waits and waits until he eventually dies unless he brought provisions of course  civil war isnt a perfect film and it does leave a few holes in the plot which i would have liked to have been better controledexplained but overall it is still a very enjoyable superhero flick with plenty of friend fighting friend action and spiderman
May 22 2016,positive,yet another solid installment in the marvel universe but somehow this one felt less satisfying than previous chapters sets the stage well with a realistic premise but honestly spoiler alert i could have done without the buildup to spidermans grand reveal regardless the action scenes are top notch as always and the acting is superb it will be interesting to watch where the avengers go from here    side note this could have just as easily been avengers 3 instead of captain america everyone is here except for thor and hulk which a character even points out in the opening dialogue
May 22 2016,positive,solid teenage spiderman bugged the hell out of me though
May 22 2016,positive,entertaining im not that into the superhero movies anymore but this was certainly fun action i mainly watch these to maintain my geekcred at this point i honestly cant keep track of most of these superheroes though any more the plot was pretty shallow but i guess thats to be expected sfx were top notch though
May 22 2016,positive,best marvel movie yet dc should watch this and take a lesson on how to put a story together
May 22 2016,positive,really awesome movie butto many explosionsit looks like a danm michael bay movie
May 22 2016,positive,couldve seriously  been better but it is what it is and its likable but not bad or great
May 22 2016,positive,civil war is pretty much the marvel movie that we have been waiting for the amount of characters and content keeps you hooked in for the whole runtime which is not easy no part really felt stale either even with the villain who just makes everyone mad at each other now im just left waiting for the next big flick
May 22 2016,positive,loved the new recruits
May 22 2016,positive,a good movie it lacks in comic adaptation and movie story in general its not bad but it is neither the best one
May 22 2016,positive,engaging innovative and fun  i liked the interactions between the various characters both during peace and hostility
May 22 2016,positive,same plot as bvs it was like rewatching bvs just with more humar but still like the movie pretty good but not best of marvel
May 22 2016,positive,these famous celebrities group up to make one of  the most adventurous superheroes i have ever scene mixed with adventure comedy and a hint of romance this is the perfect movie for preteens and adults i highly recommend this amazing super hero production
May 22 2016,positive,an adaptation of one the most ambitious runs of marvel comics captain america civil war is a smart and extraordinarily exciting superhero film  in the wake of a suicide bombing during an avengers operation the un passes an accord to bring them under the control of a un council but when cap falcon and maximoff refuse to abide by the accord the avengers soon find themselves being torn apart  the plot tackles some surprisingly deep and thoughtprovoking issues in a surprisingly nuanced way that doesnt provide any clearcut answers  also the script does an incredible job at bringing together and using various characters from the marvel cinematic universe  and in addition to bringing together all of the avengers aside from thor and hulk some exciting new characters are introduced including spiderman and the black panther  full of thrills and actionpacked captain america civil war is a gamechanging film
May 22 2016,negative,must have used camera person from blair witch i got sick of seeing camera bouncing during fights so bad that the screen was a blur
May 22 2016,positive,the best of the bunch dont expect highbrow but does exactly what it says on the tin
May 22 2016,positive,this film combines all of the joy that the mcu has to offer with a dark and serious tone civil war masterfully portrays what kind of character work is possible now that the mcu has laid the ground work with their development    more than anything potential spoilers bucking the trend of the third act super kinetic cgi battle and giving us an intimate battle between two friendsheroes makes this my favorite marvel film
May 22 2016,negative,poor argument nice special effects
May 22 2016,positive,was hoping i could watch this after seeing the other avengers movies but not the captn movies i had a difficult time what was going on for the first 45 minutes or so is every character a superhero there are just too many damn characters  im bummed that the main issue ends up unresolved at the end but i get that they have to setup their future sequels and each of the actors have contracts and blah blah money money blah blah miss the good old days when superhero movies used to be small indie movies and not about broad appeal but really every trailer for this movie was another superhero movie how many of these can we do guys its trite but its clear to me were in a superhero bubble get out while you can marvel
May 22 2016,positive,the best captain america film yet  the movie has an interesting plot that causes conflict between the various avengers  the character decisions and their rationales are believable and add a great emotional element that enhances the action  i found myself conflicted between the positions and thus during the battle scenes was uncertain who was the hero and who was the villain  this aspect gave the movie a novel twist and emotional element that made it stand out above other marvel movies and far above recent dc movies  while not a perfect it is a great action movie that is sure to please most super hero fans
May 22 2016,positive,i very much loved this movie i saw it the day it came out yesterday 052116 as well as today 052216 the action in this movie is awesome the story behind it i love even more cant wait for the next marvel movie
May 22 2016,positive,amazing movie with very few flaws what the movie tried to do was act like it was the antagonists fault that this whole civil war thing began when it was clearly because of the heros destruction during battles he was just instigating throughout the whole film but on a good note the overall film had great choreography special effects plot and even the feels the only reason i would rate no higher is because of my crappy cinema experience where this little girl was singing and screaming throughout the whole film so i didnt get the best out of it personally
May 22 2016,positive,wow so much movie in so little time definitely one of the best captain america flicks that has come out dont want to spoil anything for anyone just know that to really understand the future marvel movies going forward you must watch this one
May 22 2016,positive,kinda felt all the way like an avengers movie
May 22 2016,negative,captain america as morally infallible ubermensh nope not buying it take your adolescentpleasing fountainheadinspired neoconservative nonsense elsewhere so annoyed i completely forgot to stay for the postcredits bit    of course if the writers  directors are setting us up for captain america as a bad guy this movie will go down as the cleverest and most audacious film ever made keeping fingers crossed despite obvious fact that hollywood doesnt have that level of philosophical sophistication
May 22 2016,positive,marvel studios manages to surprise me every single time i have been following the so called cinematic universe since its inception and it has panned out beautifully with a few bumps like the dark world and age of ultron civil war is replete with all their superheroes and one would feel going into the movie as if being thrust into another avenger film but the directors choose to instead reverse the role play by pitting its lead superheroes against one another cap america has always been our by the book guy but instead chooses to refuse to what the politicians have to say and tony stark who has been the eccentric egoistic billionaire opts to work with the government this is the master stroke that drives the film and we get a fair share of new heroes new revelations and surprising character depth the first half is particularly slow building up the story as it unfolds marvel goes more serious this time with humor quotient being turned down a significant bit it is quite interesting to see iron mans human side and the black panther is a welcome addition paul rudd is again spot on with his ant man and impresses yet again though i am not particularly impressed with the way spider man was introduced and i did miss garfield in spandex but i maybe mistaken all in all civil war is a welcome addition to the marvel universe with a generous dosing of high octane action and uncharacteristically serious finish
May 22 2016,positive,im not a great fan of captain america but this one had iron man and part of the avengers gang so yeah it was pretty good  positives captain america team vs iron man team ideals clashing  negatives i wished it was longer actually
May 22 2016,positive,loved it one of the best in the series the story was well executed and full of interesting twists
May 22 2016,positive,there are a few shaky moments near the beginning but beyond that we have some great action set pieces and every one of the characters manages to have their moment
May 22 2016,positive,out of all the captain america movies i enjoyed this one the best probably because of the ensemble cast maybe just a bit long
May 22 2016,positive,action character motivation and effects are all great all 3 acts of the movie are great too its really hard to point out any significant mistake in the movie because their formula is working its just too formulaic
May 22 2016,positive,best marvel movie since winter soldier
May 22 2016,positive,as the title says a noncartoonish plot provoking thoughts
May 21 2016,positive,its not on on christopher nolans superhero level but marvel studios really pushed the envelope in the cgi game here
May 21 2016,positive,the plot for civil war is surprisingly thought provoking but sadly comes when marvel fatigue from the rehashing of overstuffed action and the bloated cast resulting in a less enjoyable outing than its predecessors
May 21 2016,positive,with great action and fantastic production its a great violent movie but at a point the motive and plot seems to give way to an ongoing fight between sides
May 21 2016,positive,wow i was completely blown away
May 21 2016,positive,this is definitely one of the best marvel movies out there  i dont know if this is the best marvel movie that has been released so far or not whether it is or not is up to you but it is definitely up there with the best of the best    the good    the movie is fun while still being serious at the same time    the humor in this movie is great and doesnt take away from the seriousness of the movie    the new superheroes are introduce well  they dont feel forced into the movie but naturally introduced into the movie    the fights between the superheroes are great    the bad    there were a few moments when i felt the camera was too shaky during some of the fight scenes    i felt like the movie didnt do as good of a job of making you sympathize with iron man as i wanted it too  however it is a captain america movie so that does make sense but i just wish that the movie made me more torn between the different sides than i actually was    there didnt seem to be anything at stake until the end of the movie  even though the conflict between superheroes was good i felt like they were all still friends who would resolve their conflicts by the end of the movie    i didnt care at all about the main villain of the movie until the very end and even then i still didnt care that much about him  for the most part every time the main villain was on screen i wanted the movie to get back to the conflict between the superheroes    i had more questions at the end of the movie than i wanted to have  they werent big questions so it didnt bother me too much but they were still there    final thoughts    i thought that this was going to be my favorite marvel movie without a doubt  it is definitely up there as one of my favorite marvel movies but i dont think its my favorite  it is still a great movie i just didnt like it as much as i thought i would
May 21 2016,positive,i am not a fan of hollywoods new fixation with superheroes battling each other i did not see the batman superman movie and i delayed seeing this captain america movie for that very reason hope they get over it soon
May 21 2016,positive,the motion of the camera during the fight scenes really took a lot away from the fights different directors are not always thinking i like to analyze the fights and see them not just as a blur scene
May 21 2016,positive,hail the spiderman
May 21 2016,negative,so the overall message of this movie is that if your friend commits murder you should stick up for him no matter what worst of the marvel movies so far
May 21 2016,negative,i am a huge fan of captain america and iron man but i am not a fan of this movie it was a decent movie but not great it was better than ultron but not as good as winter soldier  the spiderman scenes are a treat  but there are too many characters it felt like a commercial for a bunch of toys or the next movie and too many of the cheap text overlays to identify the location made it feel like an expensive episode of a law and order tv show  it removed me from the narrative every time     but the acting was good and the special effects were amazing and who needs character development or narrative when you have good acting and amazing special effects
May 21 2016,positive,civil war is one of the few instances where an adaptation completely eclipses the story it was based on
May 21 2016,positive,quite possibly my favorite superhero movie ever made alongside deadpool and spiderman 2
May 21 2016,positive,all these superhero movies blend together to me although solid action and held my interest just did not feel any different from last one i saw i saw it in 3d and not sure if it had any 3d effects maybe i had defective glasses if you have time to kill and want to be entertained and not think then go see it
May 21 2016,positive,essentially a third installment in the avengers saga captain america civil war delivers massive thrills with a toptier ensemble cast breathtaking action and careful character progression that breathes life into its lengthy runtime without losing audiences patience a summer blockbuster hit in every sense of the idea this installment in the mcu is one of the highlights and sets a pace for future installments without threatening to subdue to its own audacity
May 21 2016,positive,best marvel movie the actors especially the ones who play captain america black panther and iron man did a fantastic job of conveying a story that was not too dark with enough joy that the movie is too happy this is the super hero fight movie to choose this year and probably for a long time
May 21 2016,positive,and now my inner child is that much more satisfied after watching this awesome movie one of the best marvel movies to date
May 21 2016,positive,by far best avenger movie to date  going to see it again tomorrow2 says after first viewing imax is the way to really enjoy it but standard 3d is sensory overload and distracting
May 21 2016,positive,very good movie tons of actions
May 21 2016,positive,one of the best movies in the mcu so far
May 21 2016,positive,a lot of fun with some epic action
May 21 2016,positive,amazing had all the elements that make a movie awesome loved it from beginning to end did miss the hulk
May 21 2016,positive,those able to withstand its occasional narrative flaws will be rewarded by a satisfying climatic confrontation
May 21 2016,positive,fun movie a little darker than i expected
May 21 2016,positive,good action movie that i did enjoy not as good as previous edition i am not sure why they have decided to have conflict with heros in all the new films this year
May 21 2016,positive,best comicbook movie of all time you cant afford to miss this one
May 21 2016,positive,really amazing just kinda unclear in the beginning 
May 21 2016,positive,it lacked something but since i wouldnt be able to say what 5 stars
May 21 2016,positive,the best superhero film since the dark knight
May 21 2016,negative,i need to go and see this a second time i thought it was actually crap the absolute worst dullest boring plotless marketing of marvel ive ever seen  maybe the critics are drinking the koolaid and perhaps all these ratings of 5 stars are marvel fans and cant see the forest through the trees but both my wife and i were stunned at how dull absolutely dull this movie was
May 21 2016,positive,not the best marvel movie but certainly in the conversation
May 21 2016,positive,spiderman the pre movie starting to lose my touch these movies are starting to feel really formulaic and making tony stark kind of unlikable wasnt as fun to watch seeing vision and the heroes banter was worth my money see it because everyone you talk you probably has
May 21 2016,negative,horribly boring anticlimactic movie just like the other 2 turd ca films
May 21 2016,positive,i wish there were more stevebucky moments in it there are too many characters in the marvel cinematic universe now and that makes it harder to create proper character development without making any of the characters relationships seem forced but it worked pretty well in this movie and the whole movie was very well directed
May 21 2016,positive,wow  a must see even for nonsuperhero fans  action sequences were incredible dialog entertainingmay be the best marvel movie ever
May 21 2016,positive,it met and even exceed expectations i read the plotsummary before see it and was still pleasantly surprised by the story and the ending
May 21 2016,positive,this film was a bit marmitey some will love the plot the transition from caps goodallamerican image to troublemaker the shift in relationships and the graphics  but others will find the camera shake too shaky and if not already inducted in to the mcu the whole thing might not standalone as well as other films  i personally loved it woot woot
May 21 2016,positive,great movie great action funny dialogue intriguing tense dramatic moments this movie completely deivered it is a great movie and a great addition to the mcu it is a great selfcontained movie that also sets the way for future movies and provides great new additions to the universe spiderman and black panther are presented in a compelling way and antman has a great moment the airport scene is perhaps one of the greatest action scenes ever    overall a great fun movie to see
May 21 2016,negative,not worth the hype clichãd characterization
May 21 2016,positive,best marvel movie in a while and im dc for life
May 21 2016,negative,meh definitely worthy of a red box rental on a slow night
May 21 2016,positive,captain america  civil war    review by zanele jiane    the movie is encased in a mini plot which has several protagonists and antagonists despite the multi character format it still does not feel overcrowded the pacing leaves enough room to breathe    this movie is riding on the unconscious overtly with becky and covertly in the leading characters tony stark is compromised from the word go by being directly blamed for a murder of an only child a blame he fully accepts when the united nations initiates a plan to domesticate the avengers tony is too compromised to fully assess the situation and immediately gives in to the initiative    the remainder of the movie is the result of this compromise the antagonist plays a very passive role as he sends the avengers to do his dirty work and they do so without knowing they were acting out someones evil plan    sebastian stan has always a victim of some super heros antics in the bourne ultimatum bourne delivers news that his sister marie is no more in drive he suffer burn wounds because of his opponent and in the avengers  age of ultron his family is killed in the climactic scene    tony stark is a wellcrafted character  he is very steeped in pop culture calling becky manchurian candidate in the avengers 1 he called thor point break also the shakespeare in the park a movie this detailed the directors were strong in that there is an emphasis in continuity ie starks black eye from the first fight is retained throughout the movie    steve rogers is resolute and highly consistent a work of a very fine screenwriting    the weakness of the film is that the characters are never vulnerable and deflates a potentially powerful conflict in the body of the film this was further deflated by the abortion of the winter soldiers who were deadlier than becky was this was the powder keg that was going to drive some sense into the avengers so they unite    another bone to pick is that the film is captain america but members of shield and the avengers are too prominent in the film that it seems we are watching the avengers it would be great for these films to retain their distinct characters because they are worth it and they have a story to tell  the battle sequences may have been inspired by the native american adage use the whole buffalo as anything in the vicinity of the fight sequence is gainfully employed to outmatch the opponent  recently fight sequences were do so as to disable the opponent case in point bourne movies but in the avengerscaptain america the fight sequences are the movie the sequences are so well choreographed its hard to look away even for a bit also the choreography is inspired    henry jackmans score is beautiful and serves the story just enough  it would have been great had he given us another magneto score are he did in xmen  first class nothing stood out for me score wise owen patterson the matrix has created a serious production design landscape that gets some serious trashing during the battle scenes    civil war does arouse the conscience and pushes us to definitely reflect on our actions and how past errors cam mean our very end when we flourish we may leave a scar behind  you may be minding your business  drive a nice car and someone may end up being hijacked because someone has spotted you envied you and failed to wait and want your kind of success immediately these ugly repercussions may be something we cant even help but it is happening we are failing each other whether we realize it or not
May 21 2016,negative,i really should stop going to films where most of the rest of the audience seems to have arrived on skateboards  but it was raining mme nield was scratching to be let out and i did abandon her two evenings on the trot while i gallivanted about swansea  the film  the ben  jerrys beforehand was the best thing about this loud bewildering overlong incomprehensible adolescent tripe
May 21 2016,positive,the event movie of the year  so in the wake of all the acts of destruction that wraps up pretty much every single movie in this universe the public and the government demand that all superheroes sign a registration act with the conceit behind it being that clearance must be given before they go ahead and fight villains in major metropolitan areas  not everybody sees eye to eye on this and it isnt long before all heroes must pick a side  even if you dont follow this universe or even if you dont follow movies in general there is no way that civil war is not on your radar  everybodys talking about this and rightfully so its damn cool that it has all come to this and this is sure to give you that same feeling that you got when you watched the first avengers  even without checking i am certain that this has already been said in other reviews but i cant help but compare this to batman v superman  in both universes the extent of the collateral damage has been extremely high whenever the superheroes hit the scene to save the day  while dc dismisses it with a few offhanded comments marvel has the gall to actually sit down and have debates about it so much so that it makes up a big chunk of the movie about a third of the runtime i would say  its a conversation that needed to be had so i am actually okay with them slowing down the pace to have this extensive discourse  it makes it feel more grounded in reality because this is something that should have already happened a while back  but this is still a comic book movie that you are paying money to see cool stuff in which brings us to the next item the action  you will know it when you see it but the action sequence that hits around the 100 minute mark is nothing short of amazing  it is fully realized and just overflowing with creativity  everybody is present for a reason and every single hero gets not one but multiple moments in a fight that isnt resolved in measly 4 minutes like in batman v superman but lasts a solid 10  15 minutes  its extremely well filmed and you can tell exactly why is happening at every moment  its so spectacular you are sure to wish that the theater had some sort of instant replay feature where you could immediately just watch it over again  the sequence is not only the standout segment of the film but arguably the standpoint piece to the entire marvel universe so far  unlike avengers 2 civil war pulls off its juggling act and never feels too crowded even in the face of having such an extensive lineup as well as introducing two new characters  i havent seen tom holland before but i think hes perfect for spiderman and he owns the part without them having to take the time with another origins story  chadwick boseman is also a talented actor and he makes for a great addition to this story as black panther  marvel keeps building this universe up and i thought that they may be reaching the bursting point with ultron but theyve really brought it back with civil war showing that they still have so much more to bring to the table
May 21 2016,positive,what a fun ensemble   the fighting scenes were well thought out and visually striking ha  worth it to see it in the theater unless you have a home theater jealous  acting was solid all around except for paul rudd love the guy but his head seemed like it was somewhere else for this movie  whoops are you supposed to put spoiler alert somewhere in here hopefully you knew ant man was in this one if you didnt sorry if you dont know who that is id google up on some of these characters if you dont this movie will have exploions  spoiler alert theres a scene with tony stark and peter parker that is incredibly awkward very memorable
May 21 2016,positive,in some ways i was glad this installment gave me the same elements i enjoyed from the first avengers movie in that it was lots of characters playing off each other and less of those alien threat storyline pitting the 2 teams against each other in words and action made for a great time i still need getting used to the russos fastaction directing method though the real highlight for me was the characters that injected humour in just some very small but significant moments of the movie it just gets me excited to see more of them in their future individual movies
May 21 2016,positive,very good movie on my top 5 marvel movie list must watch again and again
May 21 2016,positive,not bad could be better
May 21 2016,positive,quite near the best marvel has ever showcased captain america civil war is a highly entertaining serious superhero film that is characterdriven as well as actiondriven
May 21 2016,positive,good but not as good as winter soldier   the winter soldier was like a thriller with a good story and great standout moments civil war felt more like marvel assembly 25 too many characters for me with little back story spiderman for me was miscast he looks too young andrew garfield should have kept that role not a bad movie just not great either
May 21 2016,positive,loads of action with a plot that complicates the good vs evil question with one of defining civic morality and loyalty
May 21 2016,positive,awesome movie lots of actionsª
May 21 2016,positive,captain america civil war is one of many rare sequels that is the best of all 3 the story was compelling dramatic and well written the character development was well done the action was outstanding the humor and drama mixed well and sends the marvel cinematic universe to new heights as the movie iron man 3 should have been
May 21 2016,positive,idiot iron man must be died
May 21 2016,positive,captain america civil war is actionpacked thrilling fun and the best marvel movie since guardians of the galaxy and its also one of the years best films
May 21 2016,positive,what can be better than a bunch of superheroes trying to kick each others butts for well over two hours  however i wonder how many people missed the important scene that didnt even play until the credits had been running for quite awhile  luckily i was slow exiting and caught that scene just as i came off the last step before turning to leave the auditorium  when is the next installment  2017 or 2018
May 21 2016,negative,marvel thinks its ok set up two new franchises in a movie that relies on knowledge from at least two other franchises to understand every marvel movie is a set up for more movies when are we finally going to get to the grand finale they are setting up its frustrating that this is the 3rd movie in a franchise but requires knowledge from more movies other than the previous two captain america movies    spoiler alert  we focus on telling the story of so many different characters besides the ones the further the plot of this movie the main villain at the end was barely set up or payed off but hey lets watch people punch each other for two hours
May 21 2016,positive,this was a great addition to the captain america avengers and marvel movies i love how they are incorporating the damage that super heroesvillians create when they fight each other and how it affects everyone elses lives captain america is the model for america and how great we were and how great we can be again
May 21 2016,positive,it is a very fast paced movie in my opinion doesnt let you get bored a single second and when the movie ends you are wondering why did it finished so early
May 21 2016,positive,great action best spiderman yet
May 21 2016,positive,the best mcu movie to date with the russo brothers doing an amazing job in managing to tell an emotional story with so many characters involved a true masterpiece of film with new characters such as spiderman and black panther they live up to the hype and leaves you wanting more
May 21 2016,positive,incredible on the edge of my seat from the very beginning best marvel film to date highly recommended
May 21 2016,positive,marvel come out with another big hit with captain america civil war joe and anthony russos latest movie in the marvel universe comes off as both a straight up sequel to captain america the winter soldier and avengers age of ultron the massive set pieces and the fantastic introduction of both spiderman and black panther add more depth towards the movie this movie shares many story points as the disappointing batman vs superman however unlike batman vs superman captain america civil war embraces its comic book past while also being grounded and realistic civil war has what many consider the greatest comic book movie action scene of all time and that is what it is exciting actionpacked and not too cgi heavy while there is cgi it isnt overused the movie builds sets and builds a world characters and each one has a clear motivation the audience has a clear sense of that the audience will be torn just like the characters in the movie the directors arent afraid to discover many deep and adult thematic arcs inside the movie the vision is given a lot of time to grow as he and scarlet witch share some intimate scenes on the whole captain america civil war explores the characters of iron man and captain america getting inside their flaws and why they fight for what they do giving the movie an extra layer on top of the excellent action scenes the movie feels like it has real stakes behind it and is by far marvels best outing so far
May 21 2016,positive,great movie like how the exra action heros
May 21 2016,positive,the superhero smack down we all anticipated this delivers on major levels never have we seen superheroes have so many levels and layers to them when beating the living crap out of each other this is in the top tier of marvel movies
May 20 2016,positive,160520 it is as you would expect typical marvel fare good fun action entertainment but even with the multiple characters i wont give it more than 35 what marvel annoyingly did with their comic line they are now doing with movies shall we call them tendril films the infamous marvel universe that provided me with so much entertainment in the 80s and 90s satisfying yet exhausting on multiple levels no story is truly complete without the other im not even sure these films should be classified as art anymore art is no longer the purpose
May 20 2016,positive,best super hero movie out  period
May 20 2016,negative,the worst movie ever
May 20 2016,positive,top 3 mcu film watch it
May 20 2016,positive,another solid and intelligently crafted marvel film from the russo brothers
May 20 2016,positive,too many charactersand not a captain america movie it is really an avengers movie
May 20 2016,positive,my personal opinion on captain america civil war lots of people might think captain had made difficult choice but one question what if winter soldier had killed captain america war time love interest peggy carter for hydra would captain still protect barnes what is the reaction of captain newly found romance in 21st century agent 13 sharon carter the man she fallen in love with protect the murderer of her beloved aunt if captain choose to fight against barnes then he shown his true colors and how much respect he had to iron man and his parents especially howard stark just because of tony mercy captain still keep his head straight towards avengers and world or its only matters of seconds for tony tell the truth to the world captain america shield is more than just vibranium its represent people hope trust loyalty interest and future and captain wield it to protect a homicide criminal is that what avengers stands for secret guardian of injustice tony changed his mission from capture to kill barnes because he seen the danger and depth of wrath by winter soldier barnes is capable of making lots kids orphan like tony including hawkeye fellow avengers kids iron man cant allow that to happen scott lang is thief and criminal and public menace you can say he different now and dont judge a person based on his past judge as who heshe is today is that what captain america done with barnes the winter soldier is brainwashed mentally unstable a time bomb that can explode any moment and he is an elite lethal weapon of assassination and destruction that pose as potential imminent threat to everyone neither civilians or superheroes that barnes position today but captain saved him based on their relationship in the past tony is the creator of weapon of mass destruction and dealer for the army and lots of innocent life lost because of it but that was tony past he different person today he is a superhero and founder of the avengers lot of people might say iron man is an arrogant avenger what i say is if backstabbers betrayer and traitor can put on a fake good guy mask to hide their dirty little secrets the truth is deserved to arrogant a little captain america hide his secrets from avengers and world under his mask and muscle iron man doesnt because whether good and bad tony admit his actions to everyone scarlet witch upset she locked by tony in her room but rogers rescued her by sending in barton for his own good protect a murderer which one is worse staying silent in room with a friend or do everything in you powers to protect a criminal quicksilver sacrificed his life to save barton and barton rescue wanda to save a murderer who can kill barton and make his family orphan without him can scott tell to his daughter that be blew up his second chance of being a good guy by saving a murderer because captain america asked him to do so captain america is strictly following one law and enforcement philosophy here for the safety and protection of the winter soldier if you cant prove a crime then your are not guilty but justice triumph at the end when tony found the secret behind his parents death which turns out to be a brutal murder and the evidence for it next superhero act or sokovia accords i would like say one thing here superheroes are like power plant a nuclear energy if its let raw and unfiltered it may stay silent or explode violent law and enforcement rules and regulations are the circuits to channel that energy in the right way the villain is upset and angry with avengers for the death of his family without any supervision the avengers alone and solely responsible for their actions but with the accords the government taking that responsibility here for an example among 117 countries approved the accords 1 country need the help of the avengers and only avengers could lend hand the situation that country government can call the avengers for the help and the government taking full credits and responsibility for the avengers action whether is good or bad because they choose to seek out the help of the avengers now no one can blame the avengers for any collaterals damages or loss of life because the government chosen the avengers above all other options so no one need to seek out revenge or vengeance against avengers the accords is more or less keeping avengers clean from dirt and blood the avengers could have saved more lifes than the ones lost but if the government have not chosen to seek out the help of the avengers then the loss of life would be unimaginable even then only the government is one to blame not the avengers because the government chose not to seek out the help of the avengers but it highly unlikely the government would reject the help of the avengers when extremely necessary so taking all this into consideration my final verdict is tony stark aka iron man is right in this one i fully support teamironman
May 20 2016,positive,45 most likely best marvel  most definitely best spiderman
May 20 2016,positive,amazing work from the russo brothers they just know how to make a movie they pulled of amazing scenes and the airport scene was done so well it had so many characters yet they put the spotlight on all of them so many good emotions with steve and tony in the film the movie had some funny bits but was serious as you can get this is one of the best marvel movies yet to hit the big screen cant wait to see what the russos will do for infinity war
May 20 2016,positive,hey this is qr with another review and its is captain america civil war now since this movie just came out i wont spoil to much now your wondering is this like an avengers film yes and no it has all the usual avengers but it has new ones like black panther spiderman and it does focus on all the characters to have some spot light oh by the way this is not like the comic of civil war now that i got that out of the way what do you need in a marvel film stan lee jokes and a good cast and there all here  the story to be honest there a lot her to say but im not going to say it all in 1991 there was a mission for bucky before shield found cap and there was this stuff that makes people brainwashed which bucky was one of them the car with that is tonys parents present day is when cap wanda scarlet which falcon trying to find this bad guy and wanda does something to start our plot and now the government is sick of the avengers killing people by accident and they need to sign something tony is in too it but our hero cap does not want to sign because we need freedom with caps actions starts the civil war thats how far i will go with the plot because after that its spoiler zone but ant man is in this he is my favourite character because he is treated like garbage but he is so funny spiderman is really young but thats a good thing  and spiderman doesnt switch sides he stays on iron mans side and black panther he is a good leader to all and knows what he wants as a person this movie has a good score the music gets you in this is marvels best movies ever its has everything a marvel movie should have if i had to give it a rating 55 great film
May 20 2016,positive,epic intense interesting captain america civil war is something most superhero movies should be the trailers make it out to be a little more different than it actually is but other than that it is very entertaining
May 20 2016,positive,it was just awesome
May 20 2016,positive,way better than the supermanbatman film better writtenlighter long but fun to watch in 3d  so glad the hulk wasnt there but i missed thor  i should have watched the winter soldier and age of ultron films as a refresher on characters but whatever  the new spiderman here is way better than andrew garfield   definitely entertaining and i like guys in their 50s who are still superheroes
May 20 2016,positive,i love me some romanian sebas  the movie is great  a must see
May 20 2016,neutral,meh i found myself waiting for the next action sequence every time they would try to actually act this had some of the best action sequences of the marvel franchise but overall while i was sitting in the theater i was just waiting for it to end
May 20 2016,positive,bad villain good everything else you do the math
May 20 2016,positive,i really enjoyed the storyline as well as the action scenes great cgi effects i did see it in imax i love how they included so many characters from loved antman an overall great movie totally worth seeing even if youre not a marvel or comic book fan
May 20 2016,positive,another great movie from the marvel team also i have to say the russo brothers keep getting better with each film they balance the humor drama and action well without over doing anything  the additional new characters werent just thrown into the mix we get a basis of their lie and a bit of knowledge before they actually do anything  with this being the start of phase 3 im excited to see how everything will turn out even if they are planning a phase 4
May 20 2016,positive,6310  okaydecentwatchable
May 20 2016,positive,marvel doesnt deviate from its successful superhero template here
May 20 2016,positive,best marvel movie hands down plot twists cameos cant wait for infinity war
May 20 2016,positive,extremely entertaining with enjoyable action sequences that revive your childhood imagination the writers of captain america civil war manage to blend together a overloaded cast into a cohesive unit that combines for a thought through well put together storyline that has many different focuss into a consistent and coherent movie i say one of the best super hero films in a while go see it buckle up and enjoy the ride
May 20 2016,positive,captain america civil war shows a gutsy and interesting conflict with such scale and spectacle that it may as well have been called avengers 25 captain americas story still holds as one of the best of the marvel heroes and its unfortunate that civil war is difficult to follow without having seen the whole captain america saga as marvel can only last so long expecting mass audiences to turn up having seen 4 other films that being said since i studied up i had a great time watching civil war and consider it one of marvels top efforts the action was mostly excellent in particular the airport scene but with an exception to the first fight scenes which relied too much on shaky cam and less on choreography
May 20 2016,neutral,starts slow action scenes are the best part the airport scene is a must see for any comic book fan
May 20 2016,positive,combining spectacular action due to the work of the russo brothers a story that its interesting enough to keep you invested and just the right amount of humor captain america civil war achieves to be the best avengers movie and a great captain america film
May 20 2016,positive,very well put together marvel gets everything right that dc gets wrong it just works the comedy that sneaks in here and there is the most welcome intrusion
May 20 2016,positive,great movie effects storyline characters and dialogue all very well done
May 20 2016,positive,great movie best one so far more serious and action packed
May 20 2016,positive,i am a marvel so i support all movies and the fight between team cap and team im awesome
May 20 2016,positive,marvel enough said lol went on a date where it was the first time for my date to sit in a 4d seat that moves and had wind blowing in her hair hahahahahaahahah
May 20 2016,positive,good movie especially black panther iron man ant man and scarlet witch i wanted more of vision and less bucky first part is too slow
May 20 2016,positive,amazingi wish there was more fightingbut if there wasi would   r8 ¼¼¼¼¼
May 20 2016,positive,captain america and iron man take different sides to government decision to stand down the super heroes team top action film
May 20 2016,negative,i guess you needed to see the earlier films to enjoy this one
May 20 2016,positive,surprisingly intriguing for what may be becoming the overly familiar marvel universe focusing on what fuels the fear between supes and normals  the constant collateral damage of regularly saving the world bonus  baby spiderman
May 20 2016,positive,i enjoyed the movie though it seemed preachey at times plenty of action good plot but i must say i am tiring of these hero movies that create drama over themselves
May 20 2016,positive,i watched captain america twice already it was a big step up from avengers age of ultron marvel is officially the king right now especially since this is the only great movie that came out so far this year black panther was a great installment as well as spiderman unfortunately really did not like how is aunt was young when she is supposed to old
May 20 2016,positive,one of the better additions to the marvel cinematic universe it both carries the stories of the established characters to new heights as well as introduces new additions flawlessly well done
May 20 2016,positive,there best in the mcu so far
May 20 2016,positive,this is one of the best times ive had at the movies recently i was very skeptical about superheroes fighting each other but they figured out how to make it work
May 20 2016,positive, awesome as hell from start to finish captain america civil war was truly one of the best super heroes movie to date it might even be considered to be the actual best of the best the storyline was intense and full of action that made the entire film an on the edge of your seat experience the way each scene was synchronized portrayed the sheer genius in the overall execution everything was almost perfect from the unique designs of the outstanding characters to the unbelievable advanced powers they possessed there was hardly a dull moment in the whole movie the plot had a realistic feel to it that made you loss yourself in the multiple dilemmas that were being unravelled on the big screen what took this film to another level was the inclusion of aspects from previous marvel films which played a major role in the development of the final product teams were made and sides were chosen in the making of one of the most epic super battle ever conceived just when you thought the movie was over it pleasantly surprised you with more adventure that only enhanced the concept of the film this is most definitely a must see for various reasons all good ones there were so many amazing parts involved with the production that each scene was jamed packed with through the roof excitement of course i had to see it in 3d which was just ok and not great but there were plenty of other aspects that made up for the lacking surrounded with the third dimension the visual effects and computer generated images were beyond spectacular they were a perfect vessel to deliver the fury of aggression that was embedded with every action scene a new age of bad assery was established within this film more substance was involved in the form of right and wrong and good and bad multiple unbelievable and unforgettable events took place that not only shook the world of super heroes to the core but it changed the entire dynamics maybe even forever there were so many ups and downs moments that your mind had to maintain its focus in order to keep up with the fast pace action packed scenarios that continued to happen right before your very own eyes liberty and justice for all was one of the main focus of this theatrical episode and the importance of that carried heavily as the movie dove deeper into the plot the inclusion of a lighter side with some comedic parts made the atmosphere a tad bit loose so to ensure the audience that everything eventually will be all right this film for sure is deserving of 4 stars without a doubt the execution was damn there flawless with a number of twists and turns that only just enhanced the cinematic concept because of the massive time and efforts that went into conceiving this immaculate work of visual art you are transported to another world of movie magic where you felt right at home with a comfortable sensation that made you not want to leave the fight for peace and order throughout all of the lands ended in an epic actual fight for all of the ages the good news is that there is a hint for reconciliation and much more adventures to come just make sure that you stick around after the final credits for a little somethingsomething and believe me when i tell you that it definitely is a good thing yeah
May 20 2016,positive,this is probably marvel at its finest no lackluster villain who stalls and gets overpowered in the final act less cringeworthy comedy relief and an interesting internal struggle that keeps my attention i do take issue with some simplified themes but the action sequences and balancing of characters specifically all in the climactic airport fight sequence is something to behold marvel may be returning to regular comic book villains in the coming features so you have to enjoy the break from them while you can i know i definitely enjoyed it here
May 20 2016,positive,brilliant action packed and superman
May 20 2016,positive,just got back from captain america civil war everyone who worked on this movie should be commended particularly the writers they handled the themes of this particular story really well balancing the dark mature side of things with a sense of fun and excitement i believe their inclusion of spiderman played a big part in this his youthful naivete serving as an amazing foil to tonys bitter and world weary nature big kudos to downy jr whose acting was in top form as usual  my second shout out goes to the team that did the fight cherographycg fights the big climactic battle at the airport is chock full of creativity that i felt like a kid in a candy store then we have the battle of the three friends as i like to call it that pits tony cap and bucky against each other serving as the tonal opposite to the airport this battle was an emotional gut punch with friends that were more than willing to kill each other basically what im trying to say is that civil war knows when to be fun but also knows when its time to be serious oh and the fan service is fantastic especially the recreation of one of the civil war comics best images cap using his shield to block iron mans lasers at point blank range  tremendous film possibly my favorite of the marvel cinematic universe films will see again for sure    update there are a few issues that i didnt notice on my first run of this film the villain is really poorly done and was just an excuse to make the avengers fight each other i still really like this one but docked it a star from my original rating
May 20 2016,positive,well this movie is great  but it has the same issue like bvs there some scene that is not needed but in my opinion you should just see just for the  airport scene  and spider man one too so 84 and that was jegpictures review search us on youtubetwitterinstagram
May 20 2016,positive,enjoyed the new characters added terrific oneliners as always loyalties were shown in true marvel fashion  now time to move forward with the stories
May 20 2016,positive,did my best to forget the fact that the comic version of civil war exists and treated this as a brand new independent flick find it hard to believe that people complain about collateral damage when the bloody world nearly got destroyed by extradimensional beings like really and the answer to this is to have your team of superheroes your best hope of salvation to be tied down by a hundred layers of red tape pointless groupthink and bureaucracy so they cant do their job effectively and potentially watch the world burn smart     pacing went a bit too slow in the middle and plot staggered a bit towards the end no spoilers     the new spidey is essentially my favourite part of this movie and the main reason why its still 35 tom holland you nailed it nailed it love the dialogue love the battle love the character
May 20 2016,positive,the film was really good in general  the end was disappointing 
May 20 2016,positive,the twoandahalf hour run time may feel tedious for some but captain america civil war makes up for it with a phenomenal script excellent direction strong characters enthralling action sequences the leipzig airport battle may very well be the greatest in superhero history and the shocking ability to juggle upwards of a dozen superheroes without feeling overstuffed by far the best marvel film to date and a high benchmark they now have the difficulty of matching
May 20 2016,positive,first half was not very exciting that plus the very comfortable event cinema gold class seats put me to sleep a couple of times also so many characters and still no thor but all in all still really liked it whats not to like  its a marvel movie still cant understand why people dont know about the 2 secret scenes after the movie ends
May 20 2016,positive,yawn as usual  to many stars and not enough time spent with your favourite  the prev 2  capt films were better although this is better than ultron    spiderman and ant man steal the show    stay for the 2 end credits sequence
May 20 2016,positive,huge epic adrenaline pumping and thought provoking an absolute worth it and must watch for any marvel fan
May 20 2016,positive,a well directed acted and choreographed movie that is only as awesome and there are high stakes which arent exactly that high in the end result however still a lot of fun along the way
May 20 2016,neutral,some good fight scenes however its another very poor script not worth the admission
May 19 2016,neutral,caution    this review contains spoilers    disappointed the premise for the divide in the avengers is weak or at the very least not well fleshed out the result is basically captain dividing the team violently because he doesnt want anyone to be able to provide direction oversight or limitations on when where or how the avengers engage with threats or enemies despite overwhelming evidence of the collateral damage they cause this from the guy who has been reliably the inside guy he was proshield and went so far as to go thru an experimental program just to be eligible to join the army  captain has proven to be generally the most diplomatic of the group often explaining to stark why they should a work as a team and b follow orders so his willingness to immediately go rogue seems out of character additionally putting stark in the role of enforcer is at best a 180 from his usual buck the system attitude     and thats just the basic premise    the last 30 minutes final battle and ending feel just as if not more contrived i will have a difficult time watching future captain america and the avengers my favorites in the universe releases because of this movie
May 19 2016,positive,taking into account the amount of characters that interact it feels well balanced the story can be followed thanks to the good editing and writing some moments i feel were cut a bit too short and enough time was not given so the spectator could completely sink in the emotion of certain moments but still the pacing of the movie considering the many characters the time overall of the movie the story that needs to develop is rather amazing how they pulled that off the characters we have come to know and care for are there because they dont fall far from the source material and it the actors themselves show care and respect for their characters which translates in the audience being able to distinguish each one of them plus of course 8 years of mcu already on the wall the action is really and upgrade from everything we have seen so far the narrative allows the story to be followed and understood where each character shows its position in respect to the issue at hand the introduction of black panther and spiderman is handled very well technically is a very well made movie for the movie going experience it delivers in all aspects it connects to previous films there are some details dealing with logic that might distract a little bit but compared to the final product the movie really holds up and brings the bar to a new level in terms of superhero movie i personally loved the movie it is an awesome experience and recommend it big time
May 19 2016,positive,this movie was outstanding breath taking action sequences deep characters and an original story in short it was epic
May 19 2016,positive,though its not without its flaws this flick excells on nearly every level that its easily become my top three in the mcu
May 19 2016,positive,another excellent movie from the marvel team the action is amazing the story is solid and there is a good message in the end its a must see in the theater to get the full effect
May 19 2016,positive,wonderful action flick about revenge and friendship ill save time by saying its the best marvel movie yet and has great action written as well as winter soldier watch it
May 19 2016,positive,stranded in the middle of the marvel saga civil war tells a darker more psychologic thriller along with stellar visuals and cast
May 19 2016,positive,so good child hood dreams continue to become true
May 19 2016,positive,hit all the right spots for me expect for one stupid texting scene its a captain  america movie not an ironman movie and that is how it played out   picture 9  1 point for 3d sound 10 story 9 acting 8 happy it was better than age of altron 10 and the wife loved it
May 19 2016,positive,not the best marvel movie but good nonetheless started off really slow but the tension built as it went along cap continues to be pigheaded pretentious and naive tony continues to be driven by his overblown sense of guilt and need to fix things the fight choreography was fantastic black widow even got to use her fists instead of her thighs in this movie black panther was easily the best part of the movie
May 19 2016,positive,one of the most epic marvel movies ever sorry dc but marvel be getting stacks on stacks on stacks black panther was the bomb
May 19 2016,positive,once again marvel does it again  great story acting chemistry action sequences  and foreshadowing  the only problem is the knowledge that the actors will move on from the marvel universe franchise
May 19 2016,negative,i want to start by saying the reviews for bvs were so brutal and unfair that i will never take rotten tomatoes seriously again i enjoyed bvs a lot and i have zero bias towards dc there is only one thing i can say about this movie i would rather tbag a bear trap then sit through this movie again the tone of the conflict is so light hearted it made me not care about any of it stupid one line jokes and a simple plot spread out for 3 hours does not impress
May 19 2016,negative,i hate the new spiderman too much annoy kid
May 19 2016,positive,great movie a little long
May 19 2016,positive,this movie was awesome
May 19 2016,positive,brothers russo are back in the game for another slice of cpt america this new film has a darker tone but manages to really engage the spectator and give a whole new perspective of whats to come in the universe of the avengersthe story is pretty good and gives each superhero their time to shine while introducing newcomers here and there nice additions often well timed the thing is the brothers russo sure seem to understand the thin balance between intimate scenes and action scenes they may be playing with a huge budget but they have managed to keep the same energy and enthusiasm of two film school graduates eager to have fun with their great skills i like that passion in their film and the overall pumped up energy they display on screen definitely a solid third episode of the adventures of our favorite super heroes
May 19 2016,positive,this is an amazing film and thus far my secondfavorite of the year it is one of marvels very best that much is obvious robert downey jr and chris evans create two amazing characters that are so well put together along with sebastian stans bucky barnesthe winter soldierthe fight scenes are good the visual effects welldone and the plot thick with emotional story it seems the thirteenth is the charm in this case and it definitely sets uop for what is later to come in this amazing universe
May 19 2016,positive,by far the best marvel film it helps that it doesnt suffer from wimpybadguyitice a malady that afflicts so many of its mcu companions
May 19 2016,negative,richs popcorn review on  captain america the civil war  this is one very disappointing movie i am a captain america fan unfortunately i was very disappointed in this movie just didnt cut it for me lots of action but i believe it was headed in the wrong direction so i must give this movie a 4 
May 19 2016,positive,civil war is upon us friends become enemies and earths mightiest heros face their toughest test in the greatest instalment that marvel have yet to offer us civil war is a roller coaster of emotion that takes us on an epic journey that will tear apart the team we love and make them question what it means to be an avenger what is right and what is wrong what should be done and what needs to be done and how far are they willing to go to stand for what they believe in    capitan america has everything you need in an epic superhero classic the fantastical told story mixed with unforgettable action brings us closer to the characters that we have all grown to love     the divide amongst friends and the lengths that they must go to to stand for what they believe in tests them as not only superheros but as people as well the brilliance of how the movie plays out will have you gripped all the way through it will make you feel excited emotional and swelling with anticipation    the divide will see some of the group on a darker path than we are used to especially tony stark aka ironman tony must face his demons and his past to ramain true to himself and contain his pain and ego    i believe that this is a special watch for anyone who is seeking a rollercoaster of action humour and none stop fun the actors bring forward the chemistry that they have managed to build over the past films and are at the best and all are on point to deliver what is the best marvel motion picture yet    i believe that there were some aspects of the film that could have been changed to add more to the building of some of the characters i believe that with the vision only making his first appearance in avengers age of ultron he should have been added more given a slightly bigger role than just a glorified guard dog saying this when the vision was on screen he offered us sense of magic and class to the film that we have not seen before     they could have also developed scarlet witches powers more and shown us more of the power she possesses    this movie still stands our for me as the one to watch at the minute and with the inclusion of spiderman and black panther this film has got the whole world purring with anticipation for the next instalment
May 19 2016,positive,really good movie if youre marvel and youll enjoy it
May 19 2016,negative,the movie was absolute rubbish the plot seemed like it was written by a baby the acting was close to nonexisting robert downey jr made it perfectly clear that he was good at pouting and whispering because thats what he did the entire movie the actions were plenty however you wont have to worry about that in fact there were so much actions that it felt like it was too much at about half way through the movie i just felt like barfing eating my own barf and barfing again due to the action scenes also the reasons for fighting for the good guys were very unclear they seemed to be punching each other because everyone else was punching each other the directors were so afraid of demonizing any of the characters that the one good guy that got severely injured was because of an accident and not the fault of the other good guys i would rate this movie 210 instead of 010 because of black panther he was a good comedic relief his super power was his innate ability to run fast seemed a bit racist to me though and his claws    absolute garbage dont watch it if you dont want any of your brain cells to die off
May 19 2016,positive,marvel starts off the upcoming phase 3 with the thrilling captain america civil war simultaneously delivering a fresh blockbuster actionpacked thrill ride while fleshing out compelling thought provocking themes with sharply written élan and satisfying character standouts
May 19 2016,positive,i enjoyed civil war just as much as i did batman vs superman both of these great movies are a bit similar when you compare the two black panther was my favorite followed by spidermanboy great movie
May 19 2016,positive,better named avengers 25 captain america civil war seems to be more about ironman than anyone else the goofy were still friends right attitude through the film made it difficult to really get emotionally invested in it all in all if you like the avengers films youll like this one but dont expect any real plot or true enmity
May 19 2016,positive,civil war hit all the marks not a scene character or performance felt wasted or dull humor drama action performances characters plot everything was spot on i now have complete faith in the russo brothers ability to handle infinity war and bring the marvel cinematic universe as we know it to a close
May 19 2016,positive,incredible movie great action scenes great characters and a great coherent story
May 19 2016,positive,perfect in every ways as a comic movie as a triller as a continuation
May 19 2016,positive,filled with many surprises and also with a lot of humor captain america civil war is indeed the best comic book movie made  the action was great and the humor was really funny  there were times where you could joke around and other times where you had to be serious and marvel did a good job with balancing it  spiderman did a great job we finally have the greatest spiderman in tom holland and chadwick boseman killed it as black panther i cannot wait for their solo films  this is a good movie to watch and i recommend everyone to watch it  1010 perfect score
May 19 2016,positive,the difference between good and great movies lies in the treatment of characters  whether it makes the audience feel about the characters this is where bvs failed no one really cared about any of the character probably even the writers didnt care they were too focused on creating a spectacle of the battle between two heroes and this is where civil war wins marvel focused on the human aspect of the heroes  guilt insecurity righteousness friendship vengeance conscience compliance tradition legacy and the resulting conflicts and all this leads to the big climax when only 3 of them remain and boy does it leave you breathless and waiting for more   this is turning out to be a phenomenal year for disney zootopia jungle book and now civil war disney is surely back in the game lets just hope that finding dory keeps it up
May 19 2016,positive,loved it it is the best marvel film yet cant wait for the films to come
May 19 2016,positive,it doesnt get much better than this for comic book films  even though they did a good job keeping the story focused on captain america its really an avengers film
May 19 2016,positive,i loved it but i saw faults that kept this form easily being the best superhero movie ever
May 19 2016,positive,so good i had to watch it 3 times d
May 19 2016,positive,i really liked captain america civil war but this movie like most of marvel films was extremely forgettable i left the theater not remembering if any main characters died which is not a good thing while watching the movie i was really enjoying it definitely a more serious tone than other marvel instalments which i prefer but when i look at the significance of this movie in a larger world it makes me question if it was even necessary
May 19 2016,positive,action packed from beginning to end marvel studios expands its cinematic universe yet again in captain america civil war    as the avengers have stepped up to the plate toe to toe against the forces that threaten our humble blue planet public opinion of our heroes have been heavily tainted due to the high body count and absolute destruction left in the wake of events that occurred in new york washington dc and the fictional country of sokovia some hail the avengers as the only group able to battle such enemies but others believe that these events occurred because the avengers allowed them to happen think about it for a second if thor never came to earth then neither would loki if stark never invented the ai jarvis then ultron would never have been born captain america has been left in charge of the team for now but the us government would like them to register their identities and put themselves under their command although this entry lightly samples the massive 200607 civil war crossover events it does well on its own as the marvel universe expands    the plot is everything an action movie should be with a few twists and turns in the road it is of course as linear an event as you would expect you know catch the bad guy as every superhero film goes and it rehashes a few topics already touched on in the first avengers film where you have the typical hero vs hero situation that everyone seems to love yet the film does well in its intensity and is never cartoonish or convoluted within the borders of the storyline i didnt expect too much after seeing the winter soldier 2014 which i felt was probably one of the more boring entries from marvel but this film makes up for that slow movie expands on it and drives home quite a punch this is the film that i felt closes the second phase of marvel and leaves it open for new additions for the next    i found it difficult to put the focus on any one character because of the sheer volume of characters who star and interact with each other it is a captain america branded film but arguably he shares the screen with several heroes throughout the film and this movie doesnt necessarily feel too focused on him the major players all happen to pop in at some time barring thor and hulk but a few new faces have joined in the fray chris evans does well reprising his role as the titular character robert downey jr and scarlett johansson easily have as much screen time with the captain arguably more sebastian stan returns as bucky barnes and has certainly beefed up since his last incarnation as the winter soldier a few new faces enter the fray as well chadwick boseman as the black panther gets a poignant origin story here tom holland as the teenage spiderman is a welcome addition if you can ignore all other incarnations of the webslinger it fits better with the overall story if you do and you dont wont have to shake your head at the gaping plot hole he provides finally i was quite surprised at daniel bruhls portrayal as the manipulative and intelligent baron zemo and he was definitely the most human role in this entire film    however one small issue i had was with the motivations behind the main characters i did have a hard time trying to figure out what the divide was between these friends outside of tony starks and the captains motivations to keep the planet safe at all costs i didnt really get why stark would feel the need to register all superheroes if the government already knows who each superindividual is and where they are at all times wouldnt registration be irrelevant tony stark is one person who should be against this idea after all hes seen the chitauri army gifted to loki via thanos during the battle of new york and hes one of the few people who comprehend the magnitude of this threat that faces mankind from a galaxy away    on the flipside why does captain america whos been a government agent from the very start of his adventure oppose such a move from the us  hes been a soldier in the american army since world war ii if anything he should be the one supporting registration because he is already registered as a us infantryman whats the difference if they are or not it poses no threat to the avengers nor their members nor the winter soldier if he signed it he could still go on after bucky and keep his allegiance in tact an avid fan could easily argue these two roles should have been reversed from the comic book approach where it made a lot more sense due to the sheer number of mutants and superpowered individuals many of whom live in secret and have lives or families to protect cap goes against the governments plans for registration because he sees the act somewhat akin to what the nazis did to the jewish people in ww2 but im certain they wanted to adhere to the original comic event somewhat without too many alterations    the movie could have easily been called captain america vs iron man and still have done well as a set up to future civil war events i suppose marvel studios wants to plow ahead with its endgame before people lose interest by 2018 all in all civil war is an absolute smash from beginning to end and i think this will be noted as one of the more important entries in the marvel cinematic universe
May 19 2016,positive,loved it might as well have been called avengers 3 civil war
May 19 2016,positive,it was a good movie but the story line was irrelevant
May 19 2016,positive,the best marvel movie yet
May 18 2016,positive,one of the best movies ever
May 18 2016,positive,captain america civil war is the third film in the captain america trilogy while also being a direct sequel to avengers 2  of all the mcu films this is probably my favorite now  is it my favorite comic book film of all time thats debatable  do i think its the best comic book film of all time like many say  the answer is no  i dont even think its the best film in the mcu  while i enjoy it the most i do think the winter soldier and the first iron man have an edge on it  film like the dark knight batman begins and watchmen i dont care what anyone says are better as well in terms of quality  thats not including the animated films like the dark knight returns mask of the phantasm justice league gods and monsters just to name a few  civil war is an adaptation of the comic event of the same name though a loose one  the film does have heroes fighting heroes and the crux of the conflict is this new law that dictates that heroes have to register under the government  thats where the similarities to the comic stop  while the film features most of the avengers its still primarily a captain america movie  its also on a smaller scale as well than the comic and the avengers films  people like to say this is avengers 25 but its really not  the world is not at stake in this and the action while awesome is on a smaller scale than the avengers movies  this film does so much right  the acting is superb from everyone involved  the character interactions are amazing better than in the avengers films in some ways  the action is top notch despite not being avengers level  everyone is raves about the airport battle  i love that fight but my favorite action scene is the final one at the end  thats when the film kicks into high gear and becomes outstanding to me  i love the conflicting ideologies setup  each side has a legit argument but neither is entirely sound  you also understand how these characters got to where they are now  captain america no longer trusts the government as much because of what happened in winter soldier  stark believes that the avengers need more regulation because of what happened in age of ultron  he created ultron himself with no supervision by anyone and because of that the world was almost destroyed and many died  in that sense it is like avengers in that it is a grand payoff to everything that came before   i also like that this film has lasting consequences  this is not just a oneoff novelty for fans  really nothing is resolved by the end and the status quo is now changed  things dont just return to normal by the end which really makes this film have the weight it needs and makes it a necessary chapter of the mcu as opposed to just fan service and a filler slot until we get to infinity war  to replace thor and hulk who are absent for this film we have to new additions black panther ad spiderman  black panther i like a lot  the only place i know black panther from would be from the ultimate avenger 2 animated film  there i thought he was just okay but in this film he was one of the best aspects  i look forward to what he can deliver in his solo movie  spiderman i really like as well  tom holland is probably the best live action version of this character up there with tobey mcguires version in spiderman 2  i have to see his solo movie before i can declare him the best spiderman  the costume looks great though i still like the raimi one more     tom holland takes everything that worked with andrew garfields spiderman and perfects it  hes not the naïve jokey aspect of his personality perfectly  however what the raimi version of the character nailed in spiderman 2 anyway is the hardship peter has with being spiderman and living his everyday life  we havent gotten that with hollands version yet because in this film hes just a minor side character  i hope that gets tackled in his solo film  in this film spiderman basically like wonder woman in batman v superman  like with wonder woman i liked how spiderman is portrayed but his only role was to be a part of the big fight near the end like wonder woman  you could have removed him entirely and youd have the same movie  however i do not like aunt may at all here  thats a nitpick since shes just a cameo but i was not feeling it  she was far too young or at least she looked it  the best aunt may to me is still the one from the raimi films  those movies got uncle ben and aunt may down completely   the villain zemo i actually liked  i wouldnt call him an amazing villain but compared to most mcu villains weve gotten hes pretty good  id put him second to loki  unlike most other bad guys weve seen zemo actually has some depth to his character and you can even sympathize with him to a degree  hes not just some saturday morning cartoon villain that just wants money or power or is just crazy  many will be annoyed that his character is very different from his comic counterpart  like with iron man 3 it didnt bother me too much  zemo is not a villain i was familiar with  in fact i didnt even know he existed until this film  plus since he doesnt die at the end theres a chance he could come back be more like he was in the comics  the problem i had with zemo is you didnt need him in the film really  this film should have just been about iron man and cap and their teams fighting each other for their opposing ideals  you didnt need a villain  really having an actual villain actually makes the fights a tad more forced than need be  he does bring forth a large bomb shell at the end but anyone couldve done that  in fact that shouldve been done much earlier in the film and served as some of the basis for the conflict of the film  its fine as is but it couldve been better    plus while his plan is genius the details of his plan dont addup in spots  since everything else is working in the film and i was wholly invested it didnt bother me as much  if i wasnt invested that would have irked me more than it did  not to mention there was this other villain in the beginning that i felt was underutilizedcrossbone  he was built up at the end of winter soldier like he would be a big deal but he turned out to just be a oneoff villain  he didnt have to factor heavily in this movie but they could have brought him back later  it also irked me a bit that not a single character died  thats one thing thats bothered me throughout the mcu  this is a war and a major turning point in the continuity so it would have had a bit more weight if someone got taken out  there was a moment where it seemed like there might be a death but it doesnt happen  i swear if someone does not die in infinity war i will be rather pissed  overall civil war certainly lives up to the hype  this was the best time ive had going to the movies in a long time especially for a film of this length  its my personal favorite of the mcu now  its not the best comic book movie but its up there with the greats  i found it to be the most entertaining of all the mcu films even more than the first two avengers
May 18 2016,positive,good but not perfect some effect seems not smooth but overall this is a must see film of the year
May 18 2016,negative,egh not that they have much to work off but its starting to feel like these actors are mailing it in kind of like a game of thrones episode but instead of wishing we could stay with the characters longer im just happy to get through the scenes as quickly as possible now this was captain america why so bloated with unnecessary characters and on such weak plot just not much to like here at all how are these making a billion bucks apiece
May 18 2016,positive,marvel is approaching its peak i feel they get better at character depth and drama as they go  it helps you ignore things like wait  what was captain americas super power supposed to be again
May 18 2016,positive,i think this is the best film in the marvel cinematic universe yet i liked the previous captain movies but this one had the most amazing cast it really was avengers 25 as many had said and action elements to really push it over the top to supremacy i also really liked the political and moral elements kinda wished they could have just talked about their opinions more it was jampacked with marvel characters but each was well developed and we learned of their motivations for the side they chose such a good movie i may rank it higher than my original 4 star rating after repeat viewings  watched at chinook with sam may 17 2016
May 18 2016,negative,do you enjoy wwe wwe bunch of contrived fake fighting over contrived stupid reasons  by time it was over i felt like i was the recipient of all those contrived blows im thinking hollywood should respect its audiences more but with this crap getting stuck r high reviews i guess well be stuck with the same movies applying the same formulas just with different uniforms
May 18 2016,positive,what can i say when you kill it you kill it this movie hit all of the right notes and in my opinion is the best marvel movie to date edging out iron man and winter soldier it hit all of the right notes for every character and was just true enough to the source material that many of us loved the russo brothers are the best thing that the mcu have going on right now you know since they have poor villains
May 18 2016,positive,great addition to the marvel universe franchise a definite mustsee
May 18 2016,positive,one of the best comic book movies ever the characters get a good amount of screen time but the movie is mostly about captain america movie which revolves around his friend ship with his ww2 friend bucky barnes and they introduce two new characters black panther and spiderman perfectly and they dont feel shoehorned in there so the movie works perfectly
May 18 2016,positive,this movie was everything i hoped for and more great storyline development really found it hard who to root for stayed fairly close to source material time flew by a grea masterpiece
May 18 2016,positive,itâs definitely a worthy successor to the winter  soldier a great addition to the franchise and universe very highcaliber no surprise  there but it is not the best weâve seen from marvel but itâs up there as a  strong contender
May 18 2016,negative,not the worse movie this year but its pretty close flawed but the greatest sin of all  dull and boring
May 18 2016,positive,another amazing marvel film captain americacivil war a brilliant set up to the third avenger film great performance great cgi excellent story and the action sequence looked real captain america civil war is top ten marvel film
May 18 2016,negative,my god are you kidding me this is not a good movie theres so much wrong with it it would fill two pages easily the marvel fanatics are pushing this movie hard im so angry my money went to the billion plus its going to make im done with superhero movies this sucks and its worse then bvs and that movie wasnt all that good either a 10 out of a 100
May 18 2016,positive,best movie ever loving  captain america team
May 18 2016,positive,the only reason im giving this 3 stars is because spiderman and antman were funny i hated the rest
May 18 2016,negative,first half of move  boring  tries to take itself too seriously  not until the second half when spiderman is brought into the picture does the film really take off
May 18 2016,positive,now this is how you do a superhero throwdown lots of action great sense of humor and it tackles some thoughtprovoking issues spiderman and antman steal the show
May 18 2016,positive,its impossible not to compare civil war to warner bros batman v superman dawn of justice they tackle similar themesof collateral damage and the role of superheroes legitimacyand they both bring a smorgasbord of characters and mythology to the table but where civil war is colorful and fun batman v superman is dour and dark where civil war showcases the able filmmaking of the russo brothers batman v superman reminds us that zack snyder is a stylist who cant tell a story and most importantly where civil war is rooted in character and emotion batman v superman is an excuse for spectacle the heroes fight because thats the movie theyre in not because it makes sense theyre not characters as much as theyre pieces on a 250 million board    thats where the contrast with civil war lies and why civil war is one of the best films to come out of marvel studios despite the huge ensemble cast and the expensive special effects captain america civil war is a humansized affair yes theres a villaindaniel brï 12hl as baron zemobut hes almost beside the point yes theres a final battle but it isnt the cataclysm of previous marvel entries its just two friends tired and angry whose mutual hurt and betrayal have brought them to blowsone of the best marvel have madeproduced
May 18 2016,positive,didnt like them being against each other but still a pretty good movie
May 18 2016,positive,wayyyy too many characters to feel for any of them except cap and ironman what is renner doing in this movie
May 18 2016,positive,captain america civil war 2016  12  d anthony russo joe russo chris evans robert downey jr scarlett johansson sebastian stan anthony mackie don cheadle jeremy renner chadwick boseman paul bettany elizabeth olsen paul rudd emily vancamp tom holland enjoyable followup to other recent superhero movies captain america winter soldier avengers age of alton etc has political interference in avengers activities which causes a battle between the worlds ultimate fighting force is it what destiny has decided or is it all part of someones plan skillfully done but whenever it focuses on a character who isnt terribly essential to the story film lags behind holland is also difficult to believable as spiderman the captions to identify where a scene is taking place is seriously overblown action scenes are often thrilling but this entry may be best described as a mixed bag this should at least please comicbook fansand this is citizen kane compared to batman v superman based on the mark millar comics
May 18 2016,positive,so much awesome 2nd best comic book movie this year right behind deadpool
May 18 2016,positive,terrific special effects
May 18 2016,negative,the biggest hollywood brainfart yet
May 18 2016,negative,disappointed hand held camera fight seems are tired store line was such a divergence from the energies of prior films it just wasnt fun  found myself wanting to leave after 15min kept thinking it would get better  it didnt
May 18 2016,positive,excellent film adding further depth into the marvel cinematic universe
May 18 2016,positive,a wave of super hero movies since 2008 proved that super hero genre is to be taken seriously and this movie is cherry on the top and seal to the new super hero genre however it does not only benefit from being a serious comic book movie it benefits from being a serious movie on its own much like nolans the dark knight furthermore the themes explored in the movie vary on political abuse of state power philosophical free will against determination and control and social loyalty and friendship it also gives clear though obvious message that the super hero genre is not going away for soon
May 18 2016,positive,very pleased with this alternates well between action and storytelling and what enjoyable storytelling this round happy to see steve and buckys friendship restored culminating in a rather symbolic you can have your shield back stark moment  klunk has some excellent comic lines and the supporting characters served the story well but ultimately its caps movie so hopefully well see cap carry a movie by himself again soon
May 18 2016,positive,55 because elizabeth olsenwanda maximoff is perfect and best marvel film thus far theres that too
May 18 2016,positive,an amazing marvel adventure done right when you take two lead characters and put them in a film yet the lesser known characters shine brightly you have a well written and produced film like civil war this film was done right and im seeing it again
May 18 2016,positive,its amazing how a movie with so many distinct characters doesnt feel bloated despite the lengthy running time every scene mattered and built on the structure of the story the giant words displaying the various world settings emphasize the planetary impact the avengers have had and at the same time the movie manages to also make the story grounded in personal stakes each character gets meaningful interaction with others and the conflict doesnt seem forced looking at you batman v superman but earned with a superior second outing in the mcu the russo brothers have earned my trust in helming infinity war this is not only the best mcu movie so far but the funnest movie experience of 2016
May 18 2016,positive,stayed original and funny but you still feel familiar with the characters and story
May 18 2016,positive,funny and entertaining
May 18 2016,positive,amazing fight scenes
May 18 2016,positive,great movie im picky because i read the comic series great performance by most characters
May 18 2016,positive,goodness gracious civil war is fantastic  an awesome ensemble cast interacts wonderfully within the tapestry of the mcu yet again but this new chapter has enough fresh ideas and storytelling to warrant a true new chapter in the long running marvel superhero moviescape      excellent action set pieces with surprisingly good choreography are some of the best here really ramping up the drama and tension  excellent newcomers make their mark specifically boseman as black panther to create some of the best drama ive seen yet in the mcu  its the titular civil war that drives the action throughout though and the resulting battles are fantastically well strung together accentuated by the character dynamics that weve come to know and love or loathe      add in a dash of incredibly high stakes surprisingly great development of key characters and a jam packed but well edited story make this extremely character driven plot both dramatic and gleefully complex  the movie can get a little long winded at times but the payoff is very much worth it      if youre any sort of fan of the current hot streak within the marvel universe theres something guaranteed to excite  and for those deeply entrenched in the universe like myself it even continuously surprises
May 18 2016,positive,an impassioned disagreement breaks earths greatest superteam in half and ultimately drives them to fight with more than just words its basically the avengers 25 but you already knew that and like the preceding two starstudded chapters most of what makes it work is the thrill of seeing all the big names geared up together slinging zingers and blowing dollars through the vfx budget like tshirts from a cannon its a more serious take for the series sober and steely outside of a few great jabs from the new guys antman and spiderman steal the show on this front which is fine it adds a necessary level of gravitas to the subject and it wouldnt seem proper for iron man to be going all tongueincheek while hes trying to punch his buddys eyebrows off that heavyduty weight can make the film feel long and overstuffed though and all told i was feeling a bit weary by the time it got around to wrapping itself up theres a whole lot of action as youd have to expect but this time it feels less grounded than in the past its as comic book as the mcu has ever been really with loads of kool aidcolored lights shining around the room bodies flying through walls and one ridiculous chase scene in which our heroes sprint through traffic at highway speeds and thats the focus no doubt about it action with a side of bucky whose quest for answers and redemption seems far more important than the moral dilemmas and personality clashes that split the avengers personally i was more interested in that lesserexplored gray area but at the end of the day its cap on the marquee so i can understand the emphasis on his pet plot threads its a strong solid entry and a fine continuation of this cornerstone franchise but at times it tries to pull off too much couldve easily been broken into two films and im almost never one to recommend trying something like that
May 18 2016,negative,what an absolute piece of garbage should have seen dead pool again
May 18 2016,positive,best movie of the year thus far
May 18 2016,positive,the best marvel movie yet keep them coming mcu
May 18 2016,positive,i cud tell what was gonna happen but the fighting scenes were really great winter soldier was better
May 18 2016,positive,great movie with even deeper moral undertones the real stars of the movie however are spiderman and black panther
May 18 2016,positive,wow another great action hero movie from the marvel comic series to see all the characters together in this movie was great and to top it off the story was so well put together that i felt a connection with each character in the film bravo
May 18 2016,negative,captain america civil war is a 2016 american superhero film based on the marvel comics character captain america produced by marvel studios the film is directed by anthony and joe russo   this superhero film was neither super nor heroic it consisted of a virtually nonexistent plot with scene after scene of mindless endless action battles i felt like i had seen it all before in countless other films and  found it almost impossible to stay focused in the end i couldnt even stay interested enough to make it to the end of the film the highest grossing film of 2016
May 18 2016,positive,my 2nd favourite marvel movie those fighting scenes were brutal
May 18 2016,positive,basically this movie is for chris evans to show off his muscleswell its all right meh
May 18 2016,positive,this should of been added a long time ago enjoyed it a lot this has definitely done the superheroes justice
May 18 2016,negative,2 hours of boredom too much cgi a plot necessary to portrait some punches and explosions and nothing more
May 18 2016,negative,a war without casualties is not a war at all i felt uninvested in this conflict
May 18 2016,positive,a marvel movie that tackles some very interesting themes but ultimately struggles to integrate its action sequences with a plausible connection to the underlying plot
May 18 2016,positive,disneys new money making model is to cram as many flavors of the month into one movie as they can in the end you might not love any of them but youre sure to like one of them
May 18 2016,neutral,criticised for causing too much death and destruction while they chase the bad guys the avengers fight each other causing death and destruction before kissing and making up  i dont think there is any point to the film at all
May 18 2016,positive,civil war wonderful film spiderman does not disappoint in this movie it pleases where dawn of justice fell short and as a batmanfan thats saying a lot
May 17 2016,positive,loved the movie just was a little too long and i didnt like that they basically restarted spidermans story again i wish it started where the last spiderman ended and i wish the same guy played him
May 17 2016,negative,not as amazing as people  fight scenes were bad and the movie was drawn out  its better than average but not super great
May 17 2016,positive,was worth every cent get action and good story
May 17 2016,positive,expect to be inundated with characters and action sequences and to care about the characters thats why theyre called the careacters especially poor tony who is at an alltime pitiful low and thus to also care about the greater issues addressed as they rough up our heroes  highly recommend this movie but go with a full emotional tank because there will be catharsis
May 17 2016,positive,good solid flick greãt effects
May 17 2016,positive,i give three and half star to scene at the airport the rest of the movie not that great still for me the best captain america movie is winter soldier this movie could have been more better but at list that scene of the airport was great
May 17 2016,positive,fun film the fight scenes made any of the lagging scenes worth it spiderman and black panther stole the show even ant man had some great bits fight scenes are great to watch and the movie doesnt leave you wanting more
May 17 2016,positive,dont know why the 90 it was ok cool special effects
May 17 2016,positive,great story but too much cgi
May 17 2016,positive,great story line very engaging
May 17 2016,positive,more of an avengers movies helps if youve seen all other movies in the franchise
May 17 2016,positive,a good film one of the better marvel ones actually but it is essentially the avengers 25 all these marvel films are leading to the next film in the series which can be a bit of an issue if you havent seen the previous ones or the tv series and in the case of this one how is it a captain america movie and not an avengers one just because thor and hulk are not in it even though they introduce spider man and black panther and bring back another hero too    anyway the story is decent its good that they acknowledge the damage and loss of life that has occurred in the mcu but it is a little silly that the event that brings this up is really small compared to the distraction that has happened in any of the other films but it needed to happen and it given an excuse to save a bit in the budget from doing a giant city destroying scene
May 17 2016,positive,so many good things to say about this film the action is superb and offers great variety each character has just the right amount of screen time dedicated to make it all feel right the plot twists and revelations are brilliantly executed and offer great consequences this is just a really good marvel film that shouldnt be missed
May 17 2016,positive,this movie does the exact opposite of batman v superman civil war does not over use action and cgi with little to no story it is truly incredible how well they were able to balance a plot with great twists to go a long with it you watch the film knowing that your not going to see another transformers or man of steel but a classic superhero movie that will appeal you and be one of your favorite marvel movies ever
May 17 2016,positive,everything it needed to be and more
May 17 2016,positive,i went into civil war with the highest of expectations after reading fivestar  reviews after the intial kickass balls swinging rendevoux of the avengers and their first battle i found my eyes getting heavier and heavier as the kinetic flow that the marvel films are so good for came to a stand still understandably this is the part of the avengers chapter about moral and emotional conflict but all interest for explanation  came to a hault as the two and half hour film plodded along apart from the wide array of great cast members characters and special effects for me the first 20 minutes had the ground breaking action that the final civil war airport scene should have had still a devout captain america and russo brothers fan but i came out of the cinema with a come down and not still flying high
May 17 2016,negative,if i was a comic fan i guess id feel different but as it is it was a boring dull avengers flick
May 17 2016,positive,an amazing wellhandled superhero action film all the characters had great character development the action was increidble with some amazing action scenes specially the airport scene the direction from the russo brothers was great the script was so good that there wasnt a dull moment in this movie the villain on the other hand was useless and cliché but overall is probably one of the best superheroe movie ever made
May 17 2016,positive,team ironman and spiderman is awesome
May 17 2016,positive,best marvel film to date pretty much all the cast and characterisations were great with the exception of wanda maximoffscarlet witch watch it for yourselfand disagree
May 17 2016,negative,some of the worst cgi i have seen literally some of the bad cgi takes you out of some parts of the movie
May 17 2016,negative,i thought this was one of the worst movies i have seen it is boring no decent story line i guess if you want to watch a bunch of people fighting via cgi you will be very happy as it seems so many are i just thought it was unremarkable and i loved captain america ironman and thor just not this writers are lazy and the public accepts it
May 17 2016,positive,i rate captain america civil war   it a 910
May 17 2016,positive,first off the only flaw was i found captain america to be to whiny and by the end of it he just got on my nerves and it did drag on at times now to the great parts the action scenes where great  the acting was great  loved black panther  spiderman  did i mention spiderman  oh and spiderman  the story even ho it dragged on i liked it a lot and it showed more character out of the super heroes overall the best captain america movie and one of the best marvel movies
May 17 2016,positive,the continuing saga of the marvel cinematic universe seems to be able to do no wrong with the latest film captain america civil war improving upon everything set before it it is very good at delving deeper into the conflicting personalities of the avengers and seeing how they interact with each other also it is really interesting to get to know the side characters such as falcon and scarlett witch better than in the previous films altogether quite a thrill ride that had action but didnt overdo it
May 17 2016,positive,i think this was a terrific movie though i am partial the masses with saying that it was titled captain america but should have been titled avengers 3  evans and downey were spectacular as awesome but i was devastated to see that they did not keep the scarlet witch in character which is unfortunate because olsen was fucking hot as hell in that look from age of ultron  im not sure about how i feel about holland yet but i was pleased to see he had a larger role in this move than i anticipated i think the story should have been spread out to 3 hours to fill in some dialogue that i thought was missing but overall a pretty good movie
May 17 2016,positive,smarter than your average comic book movie while it just barely misses the high bar set by the avengers and captain america the winter soldier this is an action packed funny effort
May 17 2016,positive,the action the comedy the everything marvel pulled it off
May 17 2016,positive,captain america civil war has so many characters and so much going on you get lost in the aspect thats its part of the ca trilogy and full in love with the avengers all over again
May 17 2016,positive,this is a good hero movie just like batman vs superman but a bad civil war
May 17 2016,positive,the plot is rather confusing and idea is a little saddening to marvel fans but overall best spiderman
May 17 2016,positive,captain america civil war is a decent movie it mainly focuses on developing the relationship between captain america and the winter soldier this movies action scenes are shot very well  with good perspective this film is clever as it has no outstanding villain but rather a manipulating foe as much as i like this movie  there are also some negative aspects to it as well  first of all  i felt that a majority of characters in one of the main fight scenes were padding if you like  and were simply awkwardly shoved in to extend the running time  in actual fact  i would have preferred it if the film had been half an hour shorter which they could have easily knocked off lets be honest  by about twenty five minutes from the end u was bursting for the toilet another big problem with this movie is that there are a lot of pointless scenes  i wont go in to too much detail in case someone hasnt seen the film  but there was a particular scene the film could have done without  the scene where vision hits war machine  as well as the pacing in this fight being incredibly bad what with the dramatic change in emotion and then tony stark being completely emotionless in the following scene  this whole 5 minute extension has no relevance whatsoever to the story  tony doesnt seek revenge  nor have many feelings towards anyone at all and actually  by the end of the film  we find out war machine is alive and well overall civil war is a decent movie  but like other marvel movies  has several major problems
May 17 2016,positive,amazing movie a lot of talking scenes but one of the best superhero movies this year  so far  amazing cameos
May 17 2016,positive,civil war is the culmination thus far of everything a comic book fan has been waiting for the new characters are excellent the action is mindblowing and the characters are better than ever the russo brothers give us something to look forward to with the addition of black panther and spiderman yet you never feel as though they were forced into the story the writing is magnetic and really allows our frontrunners cap and tony to take centre stage and truly shine if youre a fan of comic book movies or just a great character driven story youll love this film
May 17 2016,positive,this movie has the best super hero action scene of all time
May 17 2016,positive,loved it great movie missed having thor and the hulk but still a great movie
May 17 2016,positive,awesome cant complain i think best marvel movie yet and theyre all pretty damn good
May 17 2016,positive,more of an introduction for all the new characters than what it seemed it should have been
May 17 2016,positive,the greatest thing about this movie will definitely and continue to be the action scenes chris evans performance really shines in this without being overshadowed by robert downey jr the comedy points are excellent the and hit every time the new characters black panther and spiderman were introduced in very organic and memorable way that makes you excited for their solo films the only things i found myself displeased with is the reasons for them to fight each other is not strong enough to drive the story and it relied on the action and comedy to make it great there are a few unanswered questions given character motivation and reasoning but are really minor flaws in a otherwise great marvel film
May 17 2016,positive,a continuing story for captain america and the winter soldier so much so that the entire movie really focuses around the winter soldier enjoyed it overall but felt that spidey was extremely adolescent in this role almost to annoyance again the movie focused more on the winter soldier than anything else i also felt that the avengers were kinda a b team showing without the hulk and thor actors were good in their roles its just hard to draw any real connection to vision hawkeye war machine so much so that if they died it would bear no real impact i dont believe cap vs iron man was shown well and very respectfully to source material a slightly darker tone but with more humour look forward to the next solo cap film with less friends
May 17 2016,neutral,overloaded with the number of motiveless characters that keep smashing each other into walls for no apparent reason through out a 2 hours and a half movie skip this one out dont waste your valuable time
May 17 2016,positive,i think winter soldier was a bit better
May 17 2016,positive,the appetite for watching superheroes beat up bad guys on screen has not waned but it has evolved this latest film in the avengers franchise involves good guys hitting other good guys over philosophical differences is this an improvement not hardly read why i disagree with the fanboy audience in a full post on the next phase blog 
May 17 2016,positive,excellent a load of fun ive read the civil war series and this by far exceeded my expectations despite it being so different from the original story line
May 17 2016,positive,loved this movie the action the story black panther this was one of the best marvel adaptations ever done
May 17 2016,positive,not convinced this movie is confusing in a bad way characters are introduced haphazardly and spideys exit was such a joke audience is not given a chance to invest in the plot and super heroes are not given a chance to hold conversations entirely too much time is taken to make sure each character is given a fair share of ass kicking in combat this is no winter soldier
May 17 2016,positive,capping off an already very impressive run civil war accomplishes everything batman v superman failed at and more by incorporating a roster of very different heroes into a ridiculously entertaining and thoughtprovoking flick that amounts to marvels absolute best yet dramatic but extremely funny comic book reverential but not cartoonish actionpacked but intriguingly political the movies dense story ticks off so many boxes and yet still gets packaged into a very easytofollow thrillride one of the only deficits of the latest layer in marvel studios brilliant worldbuilding scheme is the fact that it asks  not requires  audiences to be up to speed on their back catalogue surely newbies will enjoy the dustups and witty character interplay but those already in for the long haul captain america winter soldier avengers age of ultron and antman play integral backstory roles will reap almost heavenly rewards with the ultimate payoff another deficit is the titlecivil war is more of an avengers movie despite sharing the same moniker as a popular 90s cap minseries as for the only other deficit where one stands  team cap or team iron man  everyone wins however the former holds the most interesting character arc of any marvel studios hero thus far having gone from patriotic shrimp to flagsmashing supersolider to cynical government employee to moraldriven rebel in a time when one presidential nominee sports a dubious slogan of make america great again this movie both echoes the nations uncertainty and provides a compelling reason for musclebound gimmicksporting and powerwielding beautiful people to throw down    in this pg13rated adventure political interference in the avengers activities causes a rift between former allies captain america evans and iron man downey causing heroes to take sides     every player from a guiltridden iron man to the remorseful young scarlet witch to proud new freedom fighter black panther to a surprisingly sympathetic villain in baron zemo gets woven in as an imperative piece of this mosaic its no spoiler to say that spiderman plays a part he appears in the trailers and trade ads but heres a new tidbit he plays a larger part than youd think and his perfect integration hints at a spectacular standalone flick to come none of these are deficits of coursejust talking points regarding a nearly flawless blockbuster as for the promised battle royale the smoking gun of a title it proves as popcornmunchingly glorious as anything your creative brain could have imagined more importantly the buildup and followup acts as a political thriller thats more interested in high stakes than red capes 13 films into an interconnected series marvel finds a number that is anything but unlucky if anything civil war shows the studio at its most powerful and its product line at its most satisfying with doctor strange guardians of the galaxy vol 2 thor ragnarok black panther avengers infinity war  part i antman and the wasp captain marvel and avengers infinity war  part ii set for release over the next three years it behooves audiences to get in line now    bottom line darling you look marvelous
May 17 2016,positive,this movie was good not just fo  r being a great action piece but for being a good movie with thrilling action sequences that make you grab your seat as if you are in it heartbreaking scenes that make you feel a bit sorry for tony stark as well as decent comedy that makes you smile it is the best marvel movie ever made
May 17 2016,positive,anthony and joe russo envisioned a summer superhero blockbuster that included both action and great story telling they did exactly that and in the process  making one of if not the best marvel cinematic experiences the russo brothers do an incredible job at showcasing the plot they make you relate to the characters and they show the stories of the both opposing sides very well to the point where  choosing between team cap and team ironman is a near impossibility casting chris evans probably the best man to wield the iconic vibranium shield always does an amazing performance  film after film familiar faces also never disappoint as well as new faces such as the new black panther chadwick boseman and very anticipated spiderman tom holland truly one of the most entertaining superhero movies out there with some of the best cinematic shots of 2016 i highly recommend this film to all you entertainment junkies out there who love great action sequences a great cast and a big loud score to top it off
May 17 2016,positive,so cool this civil war
May 17 2016,positive,a superhero movie that is undoubtedly worth watching and a definite crowdpleaser cant wait to see it again
May 17 2016,positive,best  captain america yet full of action and introductions of new characters
May 17 2016,positive,really awesome movie want to see the movie once again
May 17 2016,positive,very entertaining and a far tighter production than much of marvels recent output the russos have achieved an uncommon balance of plot and action humor and drama all of it once again deeply grounded in character thank you for canonical spiderman he is awesome
May 17 2016,positive,great movie very enjoyable from beginning to end awesome story very awesome spiderman worth seeing more than once
May 17 2016,positive,definitely better than batman vs superman
May 17 2016,positive,great movie with awesome fight scenes spiderman character was a little bit of a let down it made him look weak and insignificant compared to the avengers the absence of ruffalo the hulk was a let down i guess it would have been hard to work captain america getting his butt kicked and still getting on with the movie i always knew captain america could take iron man though definitely worth seeing
May 16 2016,positive,with a first half that is little more than an overlong political drama and a second half filled with huge action whedonesque quips from a multitude of supercameos capped off with a single masterful revelation sequence the main reason captain america civil war only garners 3  12 stars has to do with a finale wherehow do i say this without spoiling thingscaptain america civil war a movie which contains the epic iron man vs captain america confrontation a confrontation which has been at least four films in the making settles on a resolution that can only be described as civil      read the rest of my review at moviesmarkuscom  follow me moviesmarkus
May 16 2016,positive,another great entry in the captain america series which is far and away the best superhero movies marvel has produced since they obsessively started doing them does enough to make it seem enough like its own captain america movie but also like a miniavengers which somehow works pretty well
May 16 2016,positive,that goliath seen money
May 16 2016,positive,the next big film in the marvel cinematic universe arrives in a slamdunk fashion with a great storyline and unexpected twists and turns    after the events of age of ultron a new team of avengers led by captain america track rumlow down in lagos where they stop him from obtaining a biological weapon only for the fight to cause a group of wakandan humanitarian workers to be killed this results in the united nations to plan on passing the sokovia accords which will allow them to oversee and control the avengers while one group of the avengers led by tony stark favors oversight another group led by captain america does not after a bombing at the united nations which hints that captain americas old friend and brainwashed soldier bucky barns is behind the attack this leads the two factions of the avengers to come at odds in an explosive and at times complicated but fun ride    the cast once again as usual is a standout chris evans still proves that he is captain america distilling in him doubt and a questioning manner while also showing him as a conflicted and true leader evans commands the film and ever scenes that he is in proving that the marvel cinematic universe isnt complete without the character robert downey jr once again proves that he is tony stark and that no other actor can depict the character downey takes a backseat to evans in good fashion and doesnt try to take the film away from him this is more captain america than iron man with stark only arriving into the film when necessary and never hogging the film away from evans downey and evans work well together while successfully showing the different sides of both characters captain america as the leader and tony stark as the billionaire who after the events of age of ultron is guilt ridden his decision to favor oversight comes from a civilian in sokovia being killed during the battle which has a huge impact over the film sebastian stan makes a welcome return to bucky barnes the brainwashed friend of captain america codenamed the winter soldier once again this character proves that the captain america trilogy is about one thing brotherly love stans depiction brings a sense of doubt and confusion since he still trying to piece his entire life together while it also partly ties certain events together scarlett johansson is marvelous as always as black widow delivering great lines and working well opposite both evans and downey anthony mackie is once again amazing as falcon captain americas new ally don cheadle still works well with downey and in the role of james rhodes having replaced terence howard in iron man 2 jeremy renner makes a great small appearance as hawkeye as does paul rudd as antman lending a sense of comedy to the film and giant surprises paul bettany depicts vision as an android attempting to come to grips with the world while elizabeth olsen gets to further explore the character of scarlet witch sharing some really great scenes with bettany william hurt makes a welcome return to the mcu as thunderbolt ross now secretary of state this approach seems to be done as a way to still make clear that the incredible hulk the black sheep of the mcu is still part of the universe hurt shows ross as a complicated politician frank grillo makes a great small appearance as rumlow at the beginning while emily vancamp makes a welcome return as sharon carter and martin freeman is introduced to the mcu in a small role as everett ross who will undoubtedly return for future installments the real standouts in the film are tom holland as spiderman and chadwick boseman as black panther holland steals the scenes that he is in as spiderman working exceptionally well opposite evans and downey as well as marisa tomei who depicts aunt may holland is comedic depicting the character as a nervous geeky unsure character holland seems to be the definitive version of the character delivering a far better performance of the character than tobey maguire and andrew garfield the two of whom are also fine actors while some may say that spiderman is only featured in the film to introduce him into the mcu and also to setup the planned standalone film i believe that spiderman worked out well in the film and lended a real sense of stamina to the film especially the big fight boseman is amazing as black panther delivering the character with menace and true purpose boseman is calm as the character while the introduction is wild and spectacular daniel bruhl makes a great appearance as the villain zemo who has a huge connection to the events of the film while the character is different in the comic books i can defend the change that had to be done since it supports the films plot and layout bruhls approach to the character as a calm and calculating villain as well as the villain itself is spectacular while he has got to be the best villain that the universe has had to see so far the idea of having a normal regular human face off against the avengers is smart and total genius on the part of the filmmakers bruhl is menacing and every scene that he is in you dont know what he has planned to do next while you also see a sense of retribution in the character    anthony and joe russo deliver another slambang film proving that they are once again after captain america the winter soldier the right directors to continue captain americas storyline the great thing about this film is that it is treated like a political war film which i enjoyed christopher markus and stephen mcfeely deliver another tight nit screenplay with a huge political theme and a welldeveloped storyline that is serious and perfectly managed i applaud the filmmakers the russos markus and mcfeely for not having the entire film appear like a battle but instead reserving the battle toward the end with a huge lead up slowly showing the fall out and downfall between steve rogers and tony stark in a welldeveloped and serious plot the connection between captain america iron man and bucky barnes is also well handled slowly setup in a perfect manner the film also does a good way of showing the ramifications and effects of war especially on a superpowered team also for the first time we are shown how the damage that superpowered beings unintentionally cause can be looked at with the filmmakers bringing a sense of political issues to handling the avengers in a smart storytelling move markus and mcfeely also bring a good characterization to spiderman introducing him in a smart decision while also allowing him to deliver a number of genius and funny lines the cinematography by trent opaloch wonderfully supports the film and events as well as the various characters while the cinematography is bleak and dark it isnt on the same level as batman v superman dawn of justice the cinematography still has sprinkles of color though the use of blandness wonderfully supports the events and message that the film holds the lighting of siberia is dreary further adding to the big fight between captain america and bucky and iron man the music by henry jackman is action packed with an operatic feel while also having a strong political undercurrent once again the teaming between jackman and the russos works    the film also has the best fight scene in the mcu the encounter at the airport between the different sides of the avengers the approach is well staged and never feels forced while the inclusion of spiderman black panther antman and vision is used to good effect the fight includes a number of amazing references which i wont spoil while it also ends in a very surprising and unexpected fashion the fight between captain america and bucky and iron man is also wellhandled as is the location while it shows the lengths that one friend will go to protecting another friend both fights are handled in good fashion and with a very good vision the chase through the tunnel which also first introduces black panther is also wellstaged and acts as another amazing chase in the records of film chase scenes    the end result is a film that will leaver the viewer wondering how the universe will continue since captain america the winter soldier acted as a turning point in the mcu leading up to age of ultron this film does the same showing a change in stark while also showing rogers as a new leader the film ends in such a way with us wondering the directions that the characters will go in and also if stark will ever be needed anymore while also showing the lengths that he can go to the film includes a number of good references to other films in the mcu while it also acts as a terrific conclusion to the captain america trilogy proving that this is the best trilogy within the mcu in the case of good third chapters in trilogies toy story 3 the dark knight rises lord of the rings the return of the king this film acts a fantastic third chapter to its own trilogy the film also does the smart move of not revolving around a huge battle showing the slow build up to the battle and the lengths that characters can go to in a way showing a war of opinions in political style discussion the result is a film that is terrific and wellhandled acting as a great comic book film but also so far as this years best comic book film amazing job everyone fantastic
May 16 2016,positive,enjoyed the movie but often times found myself bored in between fight scenes i was very much looking forward to the introduction of spiderman and very much enjoyed the new take however the scene between him and tony brought the movie to a grinding halt to me at least it felt very much like an introduction of a character that the studio got the rights to at the last minute i had also hoped for a more firm ending to this brawl but as is marvels game we must be set up for the next chapter that will inevitably be a set up for the next movie but all that aside i enjoyed the movie overall  marvel continues to put out fun and enjoyable movies
May 16 2016,positive,the key word in describing civil war is balance in regards to tone as well as its vast scope and characters  the russo brothers nail the tone by making what might be the mcus most serious and mature film to date while delivering moments of levity just when things get too serious  they also dare i say channel the godfather in their ability to craft a story that involves several characters all with their own arcs while still tying them all into the central story  but even though civil war features almost every major character from the mcu thus far it still manages to remain a captain america movie both in tone and as an organic continuation of the captain america story  it also shows us what avengerslevel action looks like done by the russo brothers in other words its the best action ive ever seen in a superhero movie  ultimately civil war does what the avengers did four years ago but adjusted for inflation  with twelve movies preceding it and about as many characters featured in this movie alone civil war is perhaps marvels most ambitious and impressive film to date
May 16 2016,negative,hulk was not there  spiderman and antman added to the party  great cgi  story around the thought if it was worthwhile that innocent people were killed for the avengers were trying to stop bad people
May 16 2016,positive,amazing thats all i have to say
May 16 2016,positive,must see movie for all mcu fans
May 16 2016,positive,delivers plenty of fan service with a huge cast and some really fun moments in terms of action it matches the other avenger movies it does touch on some interesting themes and the ending is dramatic but a couple plot holes and cliches weigh it down winter soldier was better
May 16 2016,positive,well that was nothing short of awesome d
May 16 2016,positive,the spiderman and black panther prequel was really good and while a gaggle of movies in im finally understanding that marvel just gets you to spend money so they can throw new flashy heroes at you so you can spend more money later this one remains exciting and actionpacked it features so many characters they forgot to make the actual villain relevant
May 16 2016,negative,tremendously boring and nothing new to see here it just seems so blah to see the copy and paste effect these directors keep doing in avenger movies and transformer these superhero movies are getting too far away of what superheros are for there is no new innovation or creativity here to even jar a nod of saying oh yeah that was good bored to death and the acting is sooooo bad i truly believe the critics are being bought off in some way it just doesnt make any sense to me to see the same thing rehashed over and over again then you just change the title and unfortunately the blind sided fan whites cant even see it because there still chewing on all the horrible fake cgi framed into the movie that the star jolt hasnt run out yet its a damn shame hollywood faketasism is ruining genuine cinema and cinematography
May 16 2016,positive,incredible everything was perfect
May 16 2016,positive,im not a captain america fan at all but this movie was amazing  the storyline was coherent it made sense  it was like a mini avenger movie spiderman is awesome im a spidy fan so thank you marvel for getting the rights to spiderman
May 16 2016,positive,awesome movie that guy killed his mum
May 16 2016,positive,greatest marvel movie ever almost better than the dark knight
May 16 2016,positive,really enjoyed this movie  i want to see it again and own it when it comes out
May 16 2016,positive,the alternate title should be the avengers 25 lol the russo brothers do a great job of not making it feel like a avengers movie with all the different characters in it they still focus on captain america story which they did  did a great job i was a bit annoyed when i heard spiderman would be in but the new kid thats playing him i gotta say he did a pretty good job so overall another great job by marvel two 
May 16 2016,positive,this is without a doubt the best marvel movie ever it is wonderful movie that is well deserving of starting phase three
May 16 2016,positive,after 8 years we have built up to this moment captain america civil war hits all of the great note and thats what a sequel should do with the addition of black panther and spiderman i cant wait to see more
May 16 2016,positive,the hype for this movie was through the roof but did it live up to it ummm hell yeah it did this is in my opinion the best marvel cinematic universe movie that ive seen so what makes it so special the story follows all our beloved heroes captain america  iron man mostly and how they divided all the damage caused by our heroes is starting to bring some devestating consequences and the government wants to contain the avengers and make them act only when its absolutely necessary to lessen the destruction of public spaces and deaths tony stark is all for it unfortunately steve rogers doesnt think so and that divides one team into two what i loved about this movie is that it takes time to show both sides of the story instead of making one side the main one im still torn on the decision on whose side i am the movies characters are so well written that you care for each of them even the villain by the end of the movie speaking of the villain zemo isnt exactly your ordinary marvel villain hes got no superpowers hes got no costume or is an alien hes just a man who lost everything and wants revenge now thats not very original i know but the way he did his revenge is in other news black panther is awesome everything about him is cool his costume fighting scenes his heritage its all so fascinating spiderman is amazing i loved everything about him especially the fact that they actually showed him as a highschooler who doesnt even have enough money to make a decent suit his humour is on point and i couldnt stop smiling when he was onscreen vision and scarlet witch are good but we dont get as much information about them as we do about the other newcomers the action in the movie was breathtaking the second act battle with all the heroes clashing is the most euphoric battle scene ive ever seen there are too many cool things to list here happening it was also very depressing to see iron man and captain america fight and the stark reveal was shocking to say the least i also have to point out how this movie adressed something that i havent seen adressed in movies in the mcu the consequences of the big fights rewatching the past movies will now be very depressing while they thought they were saving the world they were also ruining the lives of many people and that really adds to the realism of the entire situation and makes it very relatable to the world we are living in all in all this is not just an amazing marvel movie this is an amazing movie overall it deals with heavy subjects and is not afraid to be controversial this is a different kind of a superhero movie much like batman v superman was except a lot more cheerful i would highly recommend checking this movie out for its in my opinion the best mcu movie to date yes even better than the winter soldier
May 16 2016,positive,one of the best comic book live adaptations of all time
May 16 2016,positive,it was worth the price for tickets and will be added to our marvel collection when its released  my only take away is spiderman i understand starting over with a new spin comics do it all the time a new universe new choices but we change spiderman more times then 007  pick someone and stick with it for at least 3 movies  i loved the action and the twists n turns and how  link them together with other movies and shows in the marvel universe
May 16 2016,positive,a little confusing hard to tell who is fighting whom or who to root for you kinda like people on both sides so who do you root for
May 16 2016,positive,even better than its last two films captain america civil war is a fun and surprisingly funny movie with great action sequences that might be like most marvel movies
May 16 2016,positive,if anyone had said that the winter soldier was better than the first avenger yet it was going to be surpassed  by the 3rd installment of captain america most people would have said you were crazy somehow marvel have done just that in short there are so many good things about this movie you cant find a favourite part also all of the performances are what you would expect from such a stellar cast some characters arent in it enough for my liking however the introduction of some new faces just shows how marvel will not disappear overnight and the studio will keep churning out the movies until there are no characters left
May 16 2016,positive,this was definetly an amazing movie but not as good as i thought it would be before i saw it al my friends were like this is the best marvel movie yet how havent you seen it yet i noticed it has some similarities to dawn of justice this was certainly a good one dont get me wrong but i give it a 910
May 16 2016,positive,its very hilarious on this movie and it has a lot of cool action i love it very much so i gave this one 5 stars i would give it more than 5 stars if i could
May 16 2016,negative,total waste of money  the supposed villian pisses off all the good guys snd then the good guys do battle  it was a disappointment from all angleseven in 3d
May 16 2016,positive,this might just be my favorite marvel movie so far
May 16 2016,positive,awesome in 3d loved the whole story line
May 16 2016,positive,full review on dcfilmgirlcom
May 16 2016,positive,see dc this is how you do a superherosbattlingsuperheros movie  grade a
May 16 2016,positive,great movie but disney and marvel come back to the cgi sins of avengers movie
May 16 2016,positive,ultron was tony starks innovation that was meant to withstand future onslaughts from the threats of the universe however due to the maligned nature of lokis sceptre the age of ultron wreaked havoc on sokovia while the avengers scrambled to prevent collateral damage as the city was raised to the skies and yet not everyone could be saved  nations become suspicious of the unchecked powers of earths mightiest heroes and those who lost their families due to their actions seek to avenge them thus civil war is partly an aftermath of age of ultron and partly a followup to captain america winter soldier mainly due to buckys presence the russo brothers enter the 3rd phase of mcu and stick to the formula that has worked wonders for disneymarvel in keeping with a brighter entertaining tone    we start in 1991 with bucky barnes sebastian stan being sent on a mission to retrieve a serum from a car the driver of the car isnt revealed quite yet but that proves to be quite a twist at the very end current day in nigeria a group of avengers disrupt brock rumlows frank grillo attempt to steal a bio weapon their encounter leads to rumlow detonating an explosive under his vest and wanda maximoff elizabeth olsen directing its effects away from the busy marketplace unfortunately it leads to the death of several humanitarian workers from wakanda who were in the building nearby   meanwhile tony stark robert downey jr reveals his impressive sample of future technologies to mit students and generously offers to fund all of their research projects there he meets a grieving mother who lost her son in sokovia reminding stark of the failures and uncontrolled powers of the superheroes  too much damage has been done even with their best intentions and efforts accountability was thus proposed by a united nations panel through the sokovia accords that would control their actions us secretary of state ross convinces them of no other way but to sign in its favor tony agrees due to his bad decisions and experiences captain chris evans disagrees because of his suspicion of those who rule with agendas one prefers accountability by external authority while the other prefers the freedom to act as he assumes that the safest hands are still their own     the accords themselves werent much to quarrel over since the scenario was inevitable but its the explosion at the un conference in vienna that really tears them apart the wakandan king who was a strong proponent of the accords perishes in the attack and his son tchalla chadwick boseman is determined to bring the suspect to justice the suspect being the winter soldier automatically cap saves his brofriend bucky on every attack from the government ironman and tchallas mysterious form of black panther this exciting introduction of a powerful warrior expands the might of the avengers in general with his formidable abilities and skills thereafter it was upon stark and cap rogers to recruit new members and convince existing ones to take a moral stance in their favor to make things even we have spiderman on team ironman and antman on team cap their action sequences are immense fun and tom hollands teenage spiderboy is nimble agile although quite talkative like his character in the comics paul rudds antman takes up some surprising form and plays a big role in the airport fight this seemingly half hourish sequence at a german airport is certainly the films highlight and showdown of the two teams that is regarded as civil war   apart from visions accidental shooting down of war machine don cheadle the entire battle was a lowstakes fun display of various powers with nobody packing serious punches against the other almost all of the superheroes leave unscathed and it leaves us wondering whether it all couldve gone down with better results with them in a room with vision dressed in his sweater vest and trousers debating their future with the accords     the plot drags on further as stark investigates the actual events that transpired before caps escape with the winter soldier and his findings reveal a deeper ploy by zemo daniel bruhl to divide them even further his revelation of the 1991 incident involving the winter soldier opens up traumatic wounds for stark and it leads them into a more serious combat that breaks the trust between cap and ironman the heaviness of a divided team of superheroes only bears down on us thereafter and it took the russo brothers over 2 hours 20 minutes to convince us   the motivations for many of the characters remain a bit casual for them to really take sides and stand against their fellow avengers scarlett deserves a black widow movie but shes losing the grip on her audience as natasha doesnt have much influence over others black panthers only reason for joining ironman is to take down bucky and boseman is a brilliant tchalla hawkeye jeremy renner is just inconvenienced with all this while falcon anthony mackie gets adventurous in his second outing with the cap war machine cheadle represents the governments interests and is close enough to stark to influence his decisions vision paul bettany spends the entire airport sequence trying to keep wanda away from harming anyone and without his superhero suit looks quite weird adorning a sweater spiderman is just stoked to be called upon by mr stark and tom holland portrays the excitement to showcase his powers and the fear of aunt may discovering them quite naturally antman is just happy to be among his heroes and paul rudd brings the credibility of a common guy honored to be working with his heroes but again this theme has worked well for marvel and shall continue to do so because the general audience prefers the levity with the action     civil war does less to lead up to the upcoming infinity wars and more to introduce new characters and reboots in the absence of thor who is busy with far greater threats the stakes arent high enough for the avengers right now but they do need to keep themselves in check even if through an international panel and they must resolve their unsettled differences if they want to be the earths mightiest heroes    8588 on a scale of 110
May 16 2016,positive,freakin best marvel movie ever great story great action
May 16 2016,positive,well it was a pretty good movie  acting was great action was pretty good  but like usual the plot of the movie was much darker than the tone gave it credit for  i get it comic relief helps drown out the melancholic feeling  and furthermore its just more popular  but this is the very reason why i have the unpopular opinion that bvs was better than civil war  since both came out so close to each other and are so similar in plot its hard not to compare  even moreso when everyone was bing about bvs but apparently everyone loves cw  i enjoy that dc likes to give their movies dark tones because it makes more sense  if theres people on the streets who hate you because theyre putting thousands of deaths on your head would u think its a good time to make a joke  well marvel does  it serves to satisfy some and leave others wanting at a marvel movie that for once actually lets its characters act like their entire existence is at stake
May 16 2016,negative,boring too long and the characters are becoming very unlikeable
May 16 2016,negative,i just read some of the critics reviews and saw how they took several negatives and spun them into positives its crazy what you can do to serve your desires for what ever reason this irks me to no end cos this is a movie filled with flaws and plot holes but if were going to gloss them over for whatever sake then im giving it a turd and a flush its an outhouse review for me it infuriates me that a dull and boring movie needs media fanboys to elevate it to grandiose level its an okay movie but watching it once is more the enough and truth be told if i knew what i know now about civil war i wouldnt have wasted my money cos its really for marvel fanboys guardians of the galaxy and antman were pretty good but the rest  you can keep them
May 16 2016,positive,civil war was fantastic there was a good story to it it was very entertaining yet also serious in parts tom holland as spiderman was brilliant in my opinion i just wanted to see him on screen more and more it would definitely be in my top five marvel movies but top three im unsure about that id need to see it again to make that decision i would say it was better than deadpool though by quite a bit
May 16 2016,positive,captain america civil war did had a good twist of its  story line by the end of the movie the characters seem  to fight each other when they suppose to fight off the  main villian of the movie this fight scene seems  to play off with humble rubble
May 16 2016,neutral,safe being a hero reaps no consequences even coulsons death was trivialized by the tv series superheroes bap each other around like kittens this formula is getting really boring
May 16 2016,positive,it was somewhat entertaining yes but a pretty disappointing overall  ive come to the conclusion that the more superheros you pack into a movie the worse it tends to be  the antagonist just really didnt cut it for me and bouncing around between a bunch of mediocre superhero characters certainly didnt improve the movie
May 16 2016,positive,thought guardians of the galaxy was the best marvel movie  i was wrong 
May 16 2016,positive,great movie loved the action
May 16 2016,positive,very good movie despite the action and its great this is not a typical marvel movie it is a hard movie in that the storylines are compelling and the choices made by the group are difficult paul rudd as antman and tom holland as spiderman provide the right amount of comedy relief in an otherwise somber movie
May 16 2016,positive,quick review i liked it but did not love it definitely should see and in a 3d theater or imax if possible got a little too long for an action adventure and the characters are getting a little too prolific to maintain a level of care about them not being overly critical on those two items more of a cautionary note to the masters of the marvel universe about too much of a good thing
May 16 2016,negative,was boring and wooden
May 16 2016,negative,first hour was drawn out too much same formula getting dull
May 16 2016,positive,definitely worth seeing in the theatrebest parts ill just say involves a spider and an ant
May 16 2016,positive,the greatest superhero filn ever made bar none its that good
May 16 2016,positive,the best marvel movie yet
May 16 2016,positive,with great actors and charge of action marvel has done again given us an exciting movie with some comedy that doesnt benefits at all but it has it moments
May 16 2016,negative,absolutely not an a movie someone must be manipulating this score it was very slow at times the villain was weak and the arguments for going into the civil war were weak multiple people fell asleep in the theatre save your money and wait until it comes out for streaming
May 16 2016,positive,perfect  not quite best captain america movie  debatable after the triumph of the winter soldier but this was light years ahead of age of ultron and brought the emotional investment back into the franchise  a good movie has you thinking well after the credits have ended and this effort managed that on many levels without risk and the threat of loss by the heroes you have nothing more than mindless entertainment fit for children this was an adult movie with good pacing although slow in the beginning that built up to one of the best choreographed fight scenes ever brought to the big screen and with two heroes each with legitimate concerns laying it all on the line you cant get much better
May 16 2016,positive,if you like nonstop action then this is the one for you it starts off in high gear and never really lets up really amazing stunts and for the most part you cannot detect the cgi here  all the actors do a good enough job but its the action that keeps it going i think the only reason im giving this 4 instead of 5 stars is because the basic premise is a bit odd william hurt plays an overly officious  i guess a government guy and he and a lot of others want to hamper the avengers with oversight because of collateral damage so  it would be better to let alien demons take over the earth not sure i buy that like most marvel movies this has a lot of humor in in and a new spiderman which i questioned as being an avenger seems he was in a different version just not with these guys but a good movie and it will keep you entertained for a couple of hours  stay for the credits as usual as there are additional scenes two of them in fact
May 16 2016,neutral,flashy and full of action a dream for every comic book but the for a story that fits for 90 minutes two and half hours long another mistake is that none of the superheroes dies in making the stakes in this movie low and in the the other hand there is no big twist in this movie
May 16 2016,positive,this captain america movie has great story great debateconflict characters are same as usual except for a few more spoiler
May 16 2016,positive,it was a great movie duh its marvel but seriously it was outstanding perfect no but great yes some of the characters are a bit too little so you its kind of like why bother the whole tony stark vs steve rogers thing isnt as well filled in storywise as id like  it plays out more physically than filling in the details of the why i and i may be alone on this one find it hard to see how most of these characters can work together again at least in the short run theres a huge hole in the whole ongoing story arc at the end
May 16 2016,positive,a good movie with complete plots and tensing conflicts which can be much better if there are more caps scenes than ironmans it is a big pity that i cant see enough cap in the last caps movie there are much more ironmans emotion scenes than caps
May 16 2016,positive,definitely a fun film from start to finish with an ensemble cast that each had a story with some development definitely felt like it was avengers 3 vs a captain america sequel and the middle movie of a bigger story some memorable lines and action sequences but i would not put it better than the first avengers iron man or spiderman movies
May 16 2016,positive,spoiler alert  a thrilling adventure the third in the captain america series boosts the action levels and sets the pace very well  i love the fact that the villain of the series zemo isnt some megalomaniac  hes a person thats driven by vengeance for the death of his family at the hands of who he thinks is responsible the avengers the fact that he lets the heroes destroy themselves and his revelation to stark that bucky murdered his parents sets up one of the most emotional battles ive seen in any action movie brilliant move the main thing i question about zemo is how did he have all the resources to get access to everything    what the writers have done well with this film dc pay attention is that the audience understands the motivations of each character well even though theres a massive amount of people involved in the film theres a true internal struggle between the heroes as they fight for what they believe in while theyre pummeling their onetime friends its one thing to show some great action pieces its another to feel something for the characters involved    the fight sequences are well done and top notch as each hero is given their chance to shine antman and spiderman were great and surprising additions as well as the awesome black panther  even one of my favorite undercard characters scarlet witch had some great sequences but please get rid of her accent     although i hate the fact that theyre rebooting the character once again this spiderman at least is entertaining enough to interest me to rent the movie when it comes out and a great nod for adding the lovely marisa tomei as the new aunt may    pros the quiet villain zemo the action sequences the plot for the most part the characters black panther spiderman my favorite mcu film next to winter soldier    cons scarlet witchs atrocious accent zemos seemingly unlimited access to information tony recruiting a teenager to fight some of the most professional and powerful heroes on earth seems pretty implausible
May 16 2016,positive,an epic spectacle crafted with surgical precision by the russo there is no wasted moments everything and everyone serves a purpose from cap and tony down to sharon carter and everett ross whats truly amazing is that it could have failed in so many ways yet somehow succeeds in a profound way i regret i have only two thumbs to give upward
May 16 2016,positive,a solid contribution to the mcu but not very interesting
May 16 2016,positive,10 out of 10 the best superhero film of the past 8 years batman v superman takes some notes this is how its done to perfection
May 16 2016,neutral,kudos to marvel for the transformation with spiderman but i was not really impressed with iron man and captain americas performance all the same there was nothing new to see well done
May 16 2016,positive,when i saw that this was going to be a clash of superheroes with former friends fighting each other i wondered how they were going to set it up very carefully it turns out with a solid screenplay and strong performances so its not the best marvel movie but does do the best job balancing its obligations while also boasting the series best action sequence
May 16 2016,negative,coming up with story lines that make allies fight each other is a tall task and watching these was a bore for the most part  best part was spiderman and black panther  too many characters too long of a movie
May 16 2016,positive,its been a while since theres been a movie ive wanted to see in theaters a second time  looks like ive recovered from super hero fatigue or maybe its because this isnt really a super hero movie  its about friends wrestling with differing ideologies and unfortunately working it out with their fists
May 16 2016,negative,theres no doubt in my mind that comic book fans in the media and the public at large are bloating the ratings this is a 70 movie at best and a 20 at worse but you would think its an oscar winning movie this is the worse of the avengers movie full of plot holes and flaws like i said not bad but not good these marvel fans are embarrassing comic fanatics because the ratings are misleading and  my lady kept complaining we could have seen jungle book im giving it two angry thumbs down  
May 16 2016,positive,marvels path to comicbook film dominance was made a great deal easier after dcs batman v superman virtually took a shit in the pockets of those that paid for their tickets last march nonetheless after 2015s  bland avengers sequel i was a little apprehensive about the quality that would be presented in civil war these concerns were soon forgotten about  with the russo brothers at the helm as expected civil war is essentially a hybrid of previous films the avengers and winter soldier the action scenes are grounded in a contextual reality that is reminiscent of winter soldier but incorporates the ensemble cast with a fluidity similar to the avengers assemble the finished product is an extremely well balanced action film that keeps your attention from beginning to end and considering this is marvels longest film to date it achieves this with a certain sense of passivity   the film is proficient at preserving the relationships that it has established throughout its predecessors while harmlessly introducing mcu newbies black panther and spiderman the casting of these two characters is impeccable and i eagerly await the solo films that will ensue  any criticisms that arise throughout the film are of the nitpicking variety and  mostly consist of some convenient plot points and the occasional flat scene   civil war justly deserves a seat in the higher echelons of the already oversaturated genre and the russo brothers have set the standard for all future marvel films
May 16 2016,positive,exciting and emotional civil war manages to balance the characters and stories really well somehow giving ample action and screen time to each character  besides a few small complaints villain is weak characters are shoehorned and it still lacks directorial style civil war is still one of marvels best
May 16 2016,positive,its good at what it supposed to be an action superhero movie the motivations for civil war are somewhat questionable but its ok as long as it leads to a big fight
May 16 2016,positive,civil war offered a pretty compelling story on whether power should remain unchecked  however the movie overall felt rushed with the introduction of spiderman and antman for a brief showdown as well as inferior cg effects  even the black panther character just seemed forced in order to set up another franchise
May 16 2016,positive,ok film interesting seeing many different characters interact through various encounters
May 16 2016,positive,pretty good for sequel of a sequel 
May 15 2016,negative,a 2 hour marvel themed wwf match    utterly boring and with not a single visual to make the experience worth remembering  the most disappointing cap america movie to date    complete with token appearance of new franchise star revelations about mummy pivotal to character motivation but with more exposition heavy im talking here scenes oooh watch in amazement as tony stark talks to peter parker in his bedrooms less conflict you didnt sign the accords youre a bad man and need to be beaten up but lets still be friends about it k    beat for beat almost identical to batman v superman but with none of that films redeeming features the stunning visuals and genuine character motivations    seriously 14 people are sadly killed while the avengers prevent hundreds or thousands or even millions of deaths from a biological weapon and nobody  but nobody even raises the question that this might be a tragic but acceptable and unavoidable consequence of the bad guys forcing the avengers to stop them    its not as if stark blew up a burb simply as an accident during some research    yet b v s gets all the hate and this gets nowt but love  go figure
May 15 2016,positive,when dc gives a glimpse of wonder woman in b v s for developing the next solo movie marvel already has 2 characters in pocket yes introducing 1 black panther 2 brand new spider man next year the huge casts and shaky camera in the beginning werent that impressing i personally preferred age of ultron no matter how many super heroes they recruited to the fight of civil war
May 15 2016,positive,almost a good movie i feel like mcu us struggling to write a definitive role for iron man depending on which movie you watch rdj is playing a slightly different version of the same guy with a different set of morals and personal beliefs     civil war fails to deliver on the dark theme it presents by giving a loose plot for the team to fall apart it reminds me very much of iron man 3 where it could have been so much better than it was if you look at the movie as just another movie on its own it was decent however marvels unwillingness to take their dark theme to a level that would match the human mind makes this a solid meh for me     if you want wwf with super heroes this is your movie if you want deep plots fully hashed out themes and creative use of the abilities of the heroes this is not the best attempt i have enjoyed most of the mcu movies there are only 3 i dont own iron man 3 ant man and civil war
May 15 2016,positive,what you will expect from watching the trailer is exactly what you will get when watching the movie
May 15 2016,positive,lots of great action did not care with what they did with spiderman
May 15 2016,positive,great movie but getting tired of these action movies crossing the 2hour mark
May 15 2016,positive,loved this movie action packed and great story
May 15 2016,positive,amazing movie the storytelling and the entertainment and the action was nonstop throughout the movie
May 15 2016,negative,the plot of this movie progresses so slowly as most of the film is spent with conversations between the characters and much less of the action that the trailers where advertising the conversations are so colorless that they eventually gets boring and your left begging for there to be some action and there is also a lack of humor in this film when there is humor you probably wont find it funny because of how bored youve got beforehand not to mention some scenes in the movie feel somewhat pointless making you beg for them to move on and get on to some action scenes not to mention spiderman has nothing to do with the film hes just there for fan service
May 15 2016,positive,very good movie im more ironman than captain america but this is a captain america movie so it skews that way black panther and spidey made the movie for me though still dont know why we needed yet another spiderman garfields spidey was awesome
May 15 2016,positive,the first half was slow and lacked the witty humor common with marvel movies i felt disappointed overall with the movie
May 15 2016,positive,overall very good movie
May 15 2016,positive,grade  a    rating  pg13 2 hours 26 minutes    in a nutshell  congratulations marvel  you successfully created another superhero film that includes humor tons of amazing action sequences impressive cgi thoughtful themes and intelligent questions all while staying true to the comic book heroes so many love and giving them heart    this may be declared the first summer blockbuster movie of 2016 as well as one of marvels best movies  the russo brothers seem to have rescued the marvel cinematic universe  each of the captain america movies has been outstanding and gets better and better  you can see my movie review for the winter soldier here     combine the popularity of comic con and other knockoff cons with the flood of superhero movies in the last decade and what a glorious time in history it is to be a comic book nerd      uplifting theme   when to compromise and when to stand firm  the right to choose for yourself  vengeance vs justice vs mercy  friendship  choices and consequences    things i liked  the choreography of the fight scenes was truly amazing critics and future filmmakers will probably use this movie as a primer for how to make great fight scenes  i love that stan lee is carefully placed in each marvel movie with a funny line  in this film he plays a fedex employee who asks are you tony stank  its a cute moment  i love captain america   hes so good brave kind loyal and patriotic  what a great role model  i love that grown men in the audience were wearing captain america tshirts  suit up theres a scene that will make girl fans swoon all over chris evans when his big muscles bulge even bigger while he holds a helicopter to the ground  sigh  i love small details in movies  for example there is a bomb blast and you see little pebbles and dust in black widows hair  there are a lot of jawdropping stunts  that stunt team deserves an oscar  i didnt know anything about black panther  his solo movie shouldcould be really good  great job chadwick boseman  spiderman was really great and provided perfect comic relief  tom holland nails peter parker as a young kid and tony starks connection to spiderman whom he calls underoos adds tasty substance to the back story  when tony first meets him he asks what are you spider boy  when peter declares im spider man tony smirks not in that onesie youre not  hilarious  the cgi is extremely impressive  there is a really cool scene where you get to see tony stark as a teenager  lots of cool gizmos and gadgets  ant man  awesome  the audience cheered the minute paul rudd first appeared on the screen   i dont know vision at all but i have always adored the talented paul bettany ever since i first saw him in a knights tale   shoutouts to don cheadle james rhodes who is excellent in everything sebastian stan as bucky barnes the lovable martin freeman everett ross  and elizabeth olsen wanda maximoff who has gorgeous legs  robert downey jr gives a solid performance and provides some depth to the story line  im going to have to see it again just to catch all of the clever lines that are hurled at the audience so fast for example tony stark says to captain america why are you so defensive which is hilarious because captain americas weapon is a shield  ha ha    things i didnt like  it seems like a good conversation could have prevented a lot of fighting right  there are some scenes that utilize subtitles that young kids wont be able to understand  theres a moment where you actually see scarlett johanssons stunt doubles face  otherwise that stunt double kicks some serious butt and is amazing  jeremy renner is good but hawkeys character didnt grab me in this film  you dont have to be a marvel fan to enjoy this movie but it definitely helps         funny lines  sometimes i just want to punch you in your perfect teeth  iron man  i dont know if youve been in a fight before but theres usually not this much talking  sam wilsonfalcon anthony mackie  can you move your seat up  bucky barneswinter soldier  no  sam wilsonfalcon   hilarious scene  are we still friends  natasha romanoffblack widow  that depends on how hard you punch me  clint bartonhawkeye  congratulations captain  youre a criminal  sam wilsonfalcon  so you like cats  falcon  what  captain america  the dude shows up dressed like a cat and you dont have questions  falcon  ok tiny dude is big now  hes big now  sam wilsonfalcon       interesting lines  victory at the expense of the innocents is no victory at all  president of wakanda  in our job you save people but sometimes that doesnt mean everyonebut you dont give up  captain america    i was wrong about you  the whole world was wrong about you  iron man to captain america  it made me so sad to see those two fighting    stay down  final warning  iron man    i could do this all day  captain america  hes my friend  captain america  so was i  iron man  i should be the one to bring him in  captain america  why  black widow  because im the one least likely to die trying  captain america  steve you know whats about to happen  do you really want to punch your way out of this  natasha romanoffblack widow    tips for parents       there is a lot of fighting violence and torture  there is a bad guy with a burned face that might scare young children  some profanity
May 15 2016,positive,okay this is actually an avengers movie yes thor is off in a different dimension and bruce bannerhulk is in hiding but pretty well everyone else is along for the ride as they did in the last captain america movie winter soldier directors anthony and joe russo achieve an uncommon balance of plot and action along with humor and drama the big problem with this movie is the equal emphasis on character as their are too many characters chris evans steve rogerscaptain america is the star but as good as evans was in holding our attention in winter soldier its hard for him to compete with robert downey jr as tony starkiron man anyhow the plot has cap and several members of the avengers chasing brock rumlow frank grillo the turncoat shield agent from winter soldier the character is referred to as crossbones in the comics to nigeria where things go horribly wrong and their is a lot of collateral damage civilian casualties in superhero movies are glossed over but in this one the consequences of their battles come back to haunt the avengers tony stark confronted by the mother of one of these innocent bystanders and feeling depressed over a breakup with pepper potts so they dont have to explain where gwyneth paltrow is decided to support an international effort to bring the avengers under united nations control being spearheaded by us secretary of state and former us army general thunderbolt ross william hurt reprising his role from 2008s hulk movie cap is opposed to this oversight having seen shield and the world security council undermined by hydra in winter soldier and being afraid that the powers that be will ask the avengers to intervene when they are not needed and to stand down when they are needed then a terrorist attack is carried out in vienna supposedly by caps old buddy from brooklyn james bucky barnes sebastian stan pretty straight forward stuff and of course the mysterious zemo daniel bruhl seems to be manipulating events for his own sinister reasons that have something to do with an event in 1991 in a soviet base in siberia that has effectively been taken over by hydra and a mission that the winter soldier carried out in the united states at the behest of his russian hydra taskmaster along for the ride are scarlett johansson as natasha romanovblack widow anthony mackie as sam wilsonfalcon don cheadle as james rhodeswar machine jeremy renner as clint bartonhawkeye paul bettany as the vision elizabeth olsen as wanda maximoffscarlet witch and paul rudd as scott langantman all from previous mcu movies you can see my quibble about their being too many characters and they add two more chadwick boseman as tchallablack panther and tom holland as peter parkerspiderman cap still manages to continue his relationship with agent 13 of shield now cia agent sharon carter emily vancamp who turns out to be the greatniece of caps wwii love interest peggy carter isnt that kind of creepy with martin freeman as carters boss in the cia everett ross any relationship to secretary ross and marisa tomei as the surprisingly hot aunt may parker there is a cameo by stan lee but no appearance by  sam jackson as colonel nick fury he would have put cap and stark in their places and their would have been no movie
May 15 2016,positive,best film in the avengers saga so far   action packed from start to end just perfect
May 15 2016,positive,funny and surprisingly involving  the best so far in the marvel franchise
May 15 2016,positive,such a fantastic action packed fun movie 
May 15 2016,positive,an excellent entry into the marvel cinematic universe  love the political aspects of the captain america movies  cool action and spiderman is excellently played  fans of the avenger movies will enjoy this one
May 15 2016,positive,anthony and joe russo deliver another rare occurrence where the sequel is better than the original not only does this pick up where the winter soldier left off but where we last saw captain america in avengers 2 tom holland chadwick boseman and paul rudd completely steal the show holland gives a great performance as peter parkerspiderman
May 15 2016,positive,excellent  best of the capt america series
May 15 2016,positive,i loved it i was so amazed about the spiderman part
May 15 2016,neutral,lasted too long slow start
May 15 2016,positive,marvel regains its footing after the lackluster age of ultron and delivers the best superhero movie since nolans dark knight
May 15 2016,positive,once again marvel and the russo brothers flawlessly and effortlessly meshes the two genres of a dark political drama and the fun lighthearted fight scenes of our heroes serious when it needs to be fun when it needs to be and punctuates with a great overall meaning absolutely incredible use of cinematography and camera techniques that elevates this film to so much for than just another superhero movie marvel continues to deliver and beat previous expectations
May 15 2016,negative,the best movie ive seen this year is jungle book which i took my family to see last week the worse movie so far that ive taken my children to see this year is civil war too long and boring and its really an avengers movie they really didnt seem to care for spiderman  or  black panther and for some reason they disliked black widow i cant recommend this movie to any of the moms out there take your kids to see zootopia or jungle book those are great movies not civil war which is really not very good
May 15 2016,positive,one word wow great movie
May 15 2016,negative,four score and twenty years long  my review of captain america civil war 2 stars    by this point its just silly of me to even review a superhero movie knowing full well that i simply hate the genre  as a child i never much cared for those comic books preferring the archies and richie rich to what i called the no grey area zone where everything existed in the black and white world of good vs evil  as cinematic creations i well understand the level of sophistication it takes to pull off a whirlwind of mindblowing stunts and cgi mayhem  the camera swoops around like never before making the original superman movie from 1978 technically look like a bad snl skit  still that film had way more heart than almost anything since      regardless even if a beating heart existed in these overbearing studio creations i consistently refer to as the death of cinema i just wouldnt enjoy it  deadpan and guardians of the galaxy at least provided a sharp satirical edge but the formers opening credits sequence will be the only thing i ever remember from it  and thats the problem  there hasnt been a moment in these movies that seems indelible to me no amazing speeches like that of the younger sister in election  no drug addicts charging through the streets of edinburgh to the beat of iggy pop as in trainspotting  no busload of 70s rockers singing along to tiny dancer to cement their bond like in almost famous  ill always remember how the great movies made me feel be it a belly laugh a rush of excitement or tearinducing sentimentality      none of that pokes through in this marvel or dc universe were subjected to week in and week out  its just crash  boom  pow  as stan lee and the studio heads endlessly churn out this swill  its funny because i had the pleasure of meeting stan lee in a hotel in savannah georgia a few years ago  he had just been given a lifetime achievement award from the towns film festival and his speech was sardonic wry and edgy  i told him so saying that his speech reminded me of kurt vonnegut  he touched his heart and said that i had given him the highest of compliments as vonnegut was his idol  i felt a glimmer of hope that the king of all things that i felt was ruining the film industry had such great personal taste but commerce is as commerce does so far be it for me to scoff at the juggernaut were experiencing      having said that if youre a fan of these films you could do much worse than captain america civil war  first of all it has a clean premise  the avengers are called on the carpet when collateral damage stains their latest victory  the united nations wants to control them with half of our heroes willing to give up their vigilante powers while the other half not so much  thus the civil war of the title ensues  not bad as a subject matter and its highly relevant to the world we live in right now  anthony and joe russo do a great job directing the action which feels more propulsive than other films of its ilk   christopher markus and stephen mcfeelys screenplay juggles a ton of characters extremely well even managing to keep the disinterested like me confident as to whats happening at any given moment  the stakes however seemed tamped down a bit when expected deaths just didnt or wouldnt transpire  i guess every actor needs their tentpole film and theyre gonna cling to it for dear life  theres a very cool cgi effect of a young robert downey jr the introduction of a very young spiderman tom holland from the impossible who feels just right and a decent setup for chadwick bosemans upcoming solo turn as the black panther  elizabeth olsen and scarlett johansson prove that the female superheroes deserve their own film as they both have firm jaws and kickass bravado      stillstillstilli just cant even give any more fucks about these films  theyre overlong too selfserious loud the opposite of subtle and devoid of one indelible memory  wont you join me for a screening of a bigger splash or the lobster instead
May 15 2016,negative,holes in the story line too long boring plot
May 15 2016,positive,awesome my favorite superhero action show ever
May 15 2016,positive,pretty good still think guardians is the best marvel movie but i enjoyed cap teamcap
May 15 2016,negative,walked out  i know this movie cost a lot but it looked like a 14 year old shot it with a camera he just got for xmas shaky absolutely no smooth motion in the tired fight scenes i know the intention was to add action and movement but they were doing this before they created smooth motion and we hated it then too saw sing street and it was awesome
May 15 2016,neutral,civil war shouldve been a avengers movie it was more about iron man and bucky than it was about captain america the story did take some unexpected turns that i did not foresee and for that i give the director and writer credit but over all the marvel favorites continue to feel like childrens books other than the true pain difficulty depicted in the comics something i appreciated about dawn of justice it really feels like the world is coming apart and there is no hope with this story no one dies no one is in real danger you know that its all gonna work out the best part of it was seeing the beginnings of black panther which i know i will love more than this over all a great watch in the theater but im beginning to believe these stories will always end the same boring
May 15 2016,positive,eh seems a half hour too long
May 15 2016,positive,very good movie must watch
May 15 2016,positive,35 stars  here we go another marvel cinema moneygrabber where heroes save the day from an extraterrestrial villain who is attempting to destroy earth what it is not the heroes fight each other yes sweet kentucky fried chicken you have answered my prayers never have we seen this happen beforeokay we have and it didnt yield great results but the difference with captain americacivil war is it maintains the captain america v iron man premise throughout this contrasts to its dc counterpart which was batman v superman until they smooch and makeup over a flimsy coincidence before becoming batman and superman v extraterrestrial villain who is attempting to destroy earth     marvel again one up dc and offers us a better version of what is essentially the same storyline obviously it shares the conflict within the hero camp but it also borrows other elements such as the public concern for the destruction caused by superhero intervention bvs perhaps explores these elements better considering civil war simplifies the deeper plot points in favour of more actionpacked scenes though the story is different there are still suggestions of a marvel formula in place the dialogue and overall film structure is quite generic while the lighthearted humour seems to be becoming less creative with each marvel movie where civil war clearly conquers bvs is in action it is relatively high quality and there is lots of it everybodys standout moment will presumably be the battle between team captain america and team iron man there is something special about seeing most of the avengers pit their unique powers against each other furthermore this is where we are treated to spiderman whose adaptation to a more adolescent version of peter parker works incredibly well he arguably delivers the best humour and combat displays in the movie and including him in this supporting role was certainly an effective way of introducing the character into the marvel universe    so civil war deserves credit for diverting from the good v evil cliché and for giving our heroes complex human issues to deal with acts as a bit of a disguise since the marvel formula has not completely vanished ultimately proving to be another example as to why marvel will probably never replicate the originality of the dark knight still they remain consistent in producing comic book movies of a good standard and through its similarities noticeably helped shine a light on just how disappointing batman v superman was
May 15 2016,positive,while some of its cinematography is a bit jumpy and not all of its characters are developed as well as they could have been but this movie still does the hero vs hero aspect very well  it provides a conflict that arises from a genuine two sided issue and leans toward a refreshingly libertarian message which feels smarter than most marvel movies  what works is the personal drama of these characters that makes it more than just a villain of the week story we get too often from marvel
May 15 2016,positive,excellent superhero movie it had heart intrigue action  some great laughs black panther  spiderman steal the show but the tension between tony bucky  steve was palpable showing how great those actors are worth a second watch
May 15 2016,positive,minor quibbles with the speed of the fight editing in the early part of the film and the fact that the plan depends on one thing that the villain has no control over it is an excellent movie and more fairly should be called avengers civil war
May 15 2016,positive,if you like  comic book heroes  see this movie
May 15 2016,positive,great movie to kick off the summer season  black panther
May 15 2016,positive,lots of action and some great one liners
May 15 2016,negative,not close enough to comics and takes too many liberties with the characters the conflict between captain and iron man is rather petty and unbelievable
May 15 2016,positive,marvel always does justice to captain america as usual there is plenty of action and the new heroes were pretty good like with most movies the villain really makes the difference and this movie is no different he has no powers has a story that makes him some what sympathetic and proceeds to get the heroes to do exactly what he wants by being smart planning well and knowing exactly what his end fame is a definite recommend
May 15 2016,negative,one of the most boring movies i ever saugh
May 15 2016,positive,as expected off the chain
May 15 2016,positive,the worlds government have become concerned about collateral damage caused by the actions of the avengers  they decide that they must come under un control  tony stark ironman wracked by guilt over his creation of ultron agrees captain america who has had bad experiences of government control disagrees the superheroes line up on two opposing sides behind stark and rogers a disagreement spills over into conflict after a bomb attack on the un    this is an above average superhero movie its central theme of freedom to act vs accountability is an interesting one intelligently explored it is a film which passes my test of whether im prepared to suspend disbelief and go with it  in a fantastical situation do the characters react in plausible ways  and the answer is yes they do this is particularly poignant in the portrayal of characters conflicted in their loyalties to friends  however this is not a pofaced film in common with most marvel movies it is a film which enjoys itself and brings the audience along for the ride there are plenty of laughs along the way    that said it is too long there is at least one fight too many involving invulnerable superheroes bashing away at each other although the main set piece smack down which includes the trashing of airliners at an airport is pretty entertaining the main problem is the plot which like a galaxy has a huge black hole at its centre the main villain spends the movie looking for a piece of information but until he finds it there is no way he can know it is worth looking for or even that it exists    one final point the introduction of spiderman is a definite high point
May 15 2016,positive,i felt the storyline was developing smoothly up until the person behind the scenes revealed himself the avengers are suppose to be super detectives super heroes then a man whos mourning the death of his wife and child blaming the super heroes who still managed to save him springs an elaborate plot that pins the avengers against one another     character development was 5 stars special effects 5 stars spiderman steals the show kid is going to awesome but one big hole in the storyline overall 4 stars
May 15 2016,positive,great chapter in the avengers at least 30 to 40 minutes cut have been cut out and told just as an exiting story it felt excessively long for no apparent reason the story was still solid providing a good introduction for black panther but spidermans was sla little lacking overall still a good movie
May 15 2016,positive,really good a very interesting take on the civil war storyline and im curious to how it will play it out in future movies i encourage anyone who is a fan of comics and the mcu to see this
May 15 2016,positive,saw this amazing superhero flick a while back and was very impressed of how the russo brothers managed this large amount of characters extremely well i did not walk out of the screening without a childish grin on my face of excitement for the upcoming black panther movie and spiderman homecoming captain america civil war  455 stars
May 15 2016,positive,have to see right know
May 15 2016,positive,visually stunning film good flow great action fun to see in 3d the debuts of black panther and spiderman were great and were easily the best parts of the movie    despite that the plot wasnt super strong despite the neat twist at the end perhaps i shouldnt have binge watched daredevil in the same week i saw this because the quality of that show eclipses this film in a big way     regardless i would recommend seeing this while its still in theaters
May 15 2016,negative,good fighting scenes but movie as a whole was very hard to watch felt like a bridge movie that was made to fill in the time between the avengers 2 and 3
May 15 2016,positive,this movie like what critics have been calling this movie the best marvel film they are not joking this is one of the best movies ive seen so far in 2016 the story was great the actors are fantastic the cgi is amazing the music is top notch and the fight scenes are just incredible my favourite part about the movie was finally seeing spiderman in marvel cinematic universe his actor is awesome i love him and his suit i even love the moving eyes its all just great and im happy that ive watched this movie i give it a 10 out of 10
May 15 2016,positive,425 weaves all the characters together well and functions as both an avengers film and a captain america film
May 15 2016,positive,the panthervision blackwell widow is sure naff dope
May 15 2016,positive,absolutely incredible everything that you think would go wrong in this movie the large cast not getting proper screen time the new characters the villain the plotit all works and is all fantastic rdj acted the hell out of this movie but every actor did a great job its just if rdj ever deserved an oscar it would be for this movie i look forward to the black panther and new spiderman movie given how they were introduced here well done
May 15 2016,positive,another overrated but still fun to watch superhero movie
May 15 2016,positive,crisp cinematography punchy rhetoric mixed with humble and humorousvery humancivil moments heres wishing future films are as dynamic
May 15 2016,positive,very good movie awesome action sequences and story marvel has definitely redeemed itself from the horror known as aou also slightly better than batman v superman recommend it highly if you are into this type of stuffgenre
May 15 2016,negative,at some point countless death and injury defying falls punches collisions explosions and crushings just gets to be a distraction from what could be a good movie this is bad enough and something civil war is guilty of but when the movie is also too long short on an interesting or coherent plot and nearly devoid of the witty banter and clever character interactions the fan hopes for the cartoonishness surfs on through the wave into the beach of boring  sure there are a few fun and funny moments  iron mans first interaction with spiderteen is endearing and hilarious the cameo of stan lee  package for mr stank is priceless and garnered much deserved spontaneous laughter and applause from the audience which was pining for something to be clap about but overall its a dull even annoying bumpy ride along what seems like a pointless and contrived side road for this usually entertaining franchise save your money and stay home
May 15 2016,positive,toooooo loooong omg my son and i fell asleep 3xs on this flick and i love captn chris america hes actually better looking in person stumbled into him at a lounge in atlanta by himself last year  what a humble guythis was when the avengers was out if we could get this movie down to two hours it wouldve been 5 stars for sure 
May 15 2016,positive,first of all im a dc  marvel fan but i do prefer dc in everything except for the movies marvel is way better in movies to be honest but i dont know what to say this movie is sooo overrated why is it being called the best marvel movie i mean yeah its a strong addition to the mcu but there are much more enjoyable movies than this one i thought ca2 was much better than this one however this one is a stepup from age of ultron there are things that cannot be excused for in this movie however characters like hawkeye antman  even spiderman are shoehorned into the story with no clear motivation there is also a major plot hole in this movie that didnt make any sense i wont say it because i dont like spoiling and it makes the movie ridiculous     that being said i enjoyed it for most of the part the only thing that bothered me was the villain he is the worst villain this year dont get me wrong daniel brühl acted great and was better than jesse eisenberg but the script for the character is unconvincing lex luthor was a better villain because he was adapted well from the comics although zemo is a big flaw that ruins the movie every time he shows up his master plan is very inaccurate and is filled with plot holes that dont have an explanation dont get why everyone is calling him smart     other than that civil war is a strong addition to the mcu and its a great movie but shouldnt be praised sooo much its not as flawless as everyones been saying but it does have a lot of fun the action was good there was justice between characters and spidey along with black panther just steal the show perfect debuts for them and im excited for their standalone movies the story wasnt convoluted like in bvs but it still tackled a lot of stuff in addition civil war is a movie with a heart and it could be serious at times but also humorous at times which was balanced in a good way    acting was great from everyone cinematography was same old same old  its an enjoyable movie and if i were to compare it with bvs i would say civil war is slightly a better movie because it had a focused storyline however i liked both bvs  civil war and just thought that if i compared them wellit wont make any sense because each film feels different and they all have unique styles    in the end civil war is a great summer movie which left a smile on my face however like i said its not flawless and there are better films than this    overall score 8610 great  as a fan of superhero movies id probably rate this a 9310  but from a filmmaking  casual movie goers perspective meaning realistic ill stick with an 8610 marvel fanboys will love it thats for sure its also a solid action movie for the casual moviegoers recommended
May 15 2016,negative,this movie was so goofy compared to the other avengeriron mancapt america movies the story line was even more predictable than the others and very shallow im not sure why the ratings were so high i would give no stars if i could
May 15 2016,positive,the best captain america installment yet although it felt more like an avengers film there were so many of them i cant even name them all antman and the new spiderman were surprisingly highlights it felt more like an iron man film as captain america was just downright wrong and acted stupidly the panther storyline looks interesting a good setup for no doubt a lot more marvel films
May 15 2016,positive,phenomenal and contained great action sequences
May 15 2016,positive,best movie of 2016 so far
May 15 2016,positive,i think this is the best marvel movie to date spider man is amazing very excited for homecoming black panther and wakanda were awesome antman was good black widow kicked ass though this was a captain america movie it didnt feel like it with everything falling down and i was glad that it didnt end with a death just the fracture of the avengers p but we know they are going to get back together in infinity wars so not big of a deal i think the death of agent carter and the fall of the tv show was   ill give it a 8510
May 15 2016,positive,4 out of 5 really really good im tired of high school spider manand he was kind of cheesy how bout college or old man spiderman ugh  everything else awesome cept again no real villain they should have seen what he was trying to do ant man is hilarious as always though and marissa tomei wow is still an 11 out of 10
May 15 2016,positive,hell yeah but dammit i need sum hulk in thisâº
May 15 2016,positive,a great movie that seems to do all aspects seemingly perfect the action and story is balanced perfectly the story is well written as both sides of the fight seem to be strong it left me undecided on which side to be on this makes the movie even better as you dont know who to root for they pick some of the best heroes and even have a good twist near the end
May 15 2016,positive,awesome movie  the whole story and spiderman were greatly done
May 15 2016,positive,a perfect version of what a comic book movie it perfectly balances action and story and gives a situation in which both sides are well structured and very strong leaving you wondering which side to choose
May 15 2016,positive,civil war is essentially the avengers 3 so dont expect a film that really progresses the character of steve rodgers in fact dont expect much in terms of characterization in this film black panther has a nice arc and so does black widow but nothing too altering the russos again are able to direct their marvel film with flash poise and high overarching narratives perhaps what this film fails at though isnt its grand questions about the cost of policing or the destruction of empires as our villain says what it lacks is the same level of questioning and selfreflection in our characters they sort of have their motivations and are set in them there isnt this retrospective and emotionally weighted dialogue between our heroes that really is what made the comic arc standout also the destruction of the heroes fighting themselves is rather controlled while it is an interesting contrast to what we see in the previous films and the beginning of this one it isnt the ironichypocritical mutually assured destruction that it needs to be the point was that they fight each other to the declthe film is fast entertaining wellacted and one of the stronger marvel entries but it isnt the grand superhero operatic tragedy it could be and thats what ill remember about this film
May 15 2016,positive,going into this i had high expectations and im happy to say that it exceeded my expectations  now i just want to talk about 6 characters in particular for this review so lets get into it  first off weve obviously got chris evans as captain america chris evans gives what is probably his best performance as steve rodgerscaptain america you really feel the weight of whats happening to him and what he has to do to protect his friend bucky barns and you can also really see why he thinks government control over the avengers is a terrible idea  speaking of bucky barns sabastian stan is brilliant in this film every scene this guy was in he just blew me away and to be honest i can really see this guy becoming a huge part of future films like infinity war or beyond  so next up is robert downey jr as iron man who is all for government control over the avengers what makes his character so strong in this movie is not his brilliant performance as iron though that does add to it the real reason is that you understand why tony stark thinks this is a good idea and why he would want to do this  so next up is black panther oh my god i love this guy chadwick boseman plays the part perfectly he such dark and brooding character in the film and id quite rightfully say that he was the strongest character in the film because of this and i must say the black panther suit looks fantastic they went unbelievably comic book accurate with the suit i mean when i first saw him on screen i was just amazed  so now for the one weve all been waiting for spiderman im only going to say this once and ill say it again tom holland is the best peter parker spiderman on screen period this jokey lovable kind of spider man we had in the spectacular spiderman animated series is the kind of spider man ive been waiting see for years and i have a very strong feeling that his entrance into this movie will become iconic in the furture  so finally we have our main villain barron zemo played by daniel bruhl our main villain now i wouldnt call him the best marvel villain in the universe but unlike most of the villains in this universe he is properly developed and i liked him overall as villain  so the story itself is in my opinion the strongest weve had so far mainly because of the very difficult decision our heroes are faced with i absolutely loved how we had this movie had at least 12 superheroes in the film and still managed to keep a balanced and well written story every hero got there chance to shine and show us what theyve got in this movie making it that aspect of the film even better  i will aslo point out there are 2 things about this film that is worth mentioning the captain america part of the film is a sequel to the winter soldier while the civil war part of the story is the sequel to age of ultron so its kind of like a 2 way thing here but even then it still managed to keep a balanced story which is something this years batman vs superman failed to do and while youve obviously picked whose side your one youre still going to feel bad for the other team no matter 2which team you go for because you can see the goods and bads of both sides of the argument and like i mentioned before you can see why cap is doing what hes doing and you can see why iron man is doing what hes doing   so now for the action and i would just like to say that the action sequence set in an airport thats been teased in all the trailers is one of the best action sequences i have ever seen not just in comic book movies but movies in general not to mention the russo brothers decision to go with a more hand to hand combat approach with the action is a brilliant decision as the hand to hand combat scenes make for some of the best action youll ever see in a movie and the cgi still looks amazing and i would even say that the cgi looks better in the movie than it does in the trailers  and finally the actual fight between iron man and captain america was mind blowing the fight itself is the best superhero fight period from the way it shot to the way its choreographed to the shear emotion of the whole fight not to mention it brings out a side of iron man we have never seen before and really shows that tony stark is not the man we all thought he was  captain america civil war is a brilliant action packed emotional and thrilling thrill ride that takes the mcu to the next level and i must say that its definitely been worth the wait this is the best film ive seen all year round and by far the best superhero film  1010
May 15 2016,positive,this newest installment of captain america was by far the best one yet  i will say that this franchise is becoming more like  avengers sequels then anything else  besides that this movie was flawless with the perfect mixture of comedy and action  a must see for comic book fans
May 15 2016,positive,probably my favorite marvel movie thus far spooderman was a scene stealer
May 15 2016,positive,great but to much was given away in the trailer
May 15 2016,positive,i dont usually like action hero movie but this one was pretty good def one of my favorite marvel ones it was basically what batman vs superman shouldve been it built up the tension btw the two teams over time with some humor and great choreographed fight scenes good performances and easy plot to follow even with all the superhero cameos that melded in seamlessly with storyline personally i took capt americas side bc i think he was right but its easy to see both sides of this politicalmoral dilemma even the villian was thoughtfully planned out well done yet again marvel
May 15 2016,positive,the second best superhero movie of all time second on to the avengers
May 15 2016,positive,excellent very well done adaptation from the original storyline
May 15 2016,neutral,lacks a compelling story  a few funny oneliners but this isnt enough to justify all the positive reviews for this movie  by the end after watching nonstop superhero battles we found ourselves not caring about the final outcome
May 15 2016,positive,the greatest film of the genre and perhaps marvel studios magnum opus i just couldnt give it more stars
May 15 2016,positive,the best marvel movie yet a great plot awesome action scenes and unforeseen ending twist two thumbs up
May 15 2016,positive,captain america civil war  avengers  thorhulk  black panther  ant man  spiderman    mathematical equations apart the anticipation for the end to the captain america trilogy had all of the fanboys drooling for an exciting spectacle with all the infighting between team cap and team iron man raising our expectations to hopefully pan out better than the bvs mess which dropped dead on us in march 2016  the director duo of russo brothers who charmed their way into our mind space with the tv series community and captain america winter soldier had a massive canvas to paint and hold all these superheroes within that wrestling mat in a coherent storyline over 147 minutes   and deliver they did for sure and presented us two new entrants in the mcu marvel cinematic universe who both hold jawdropping potential in their own franchise movies in the near future  first was spiderman in a teenage avatar played by tom holland who made me substitute andrew garfield as the best screen depiction of the spidey period this kid has the acting chops juvenile charm smooth talker like a teen iron man and the spideysuit suits him like we have never seen before  second was black panther played by chadwick boseman who exudes royal charisma coupled with slithery moves and that line at the end let them try to captain america gave me goosebumps lasting beyond my exit from the theatre  the airport altercation between the two teams is for me the best action set piece of all time and once it ends you have your jaw to pick up from the floor wipe the pepsi from your t shirt and console your kiddo for dropping the popcorn  scarlet johansson as the black widow alone could have been the reason for me to buy the tickets and if someone can please share with me the email id of kevin feige the marvel boss so i can send my phd thesis why the world needs a solo film of black widow  this friendship between cap and bucky shown in the first captain america movie formed the bone of contention in the second one and continues to drive cap on the tough path of conflict against his avengers mates  many would say it a bit overdrawn but when there is so much happening in terms of plot and action humour and drama then who is complaining meeeee laaard  when one of them falls to the ground from the sky with a thud for a second or maybe two your heart skips a beat with the fear that maybe we lost one but did we actually did so i shall not play spoiler sport and leave it for you to find out in your own time  falcon gets the coolest toy of them all in the form of the redwing drone while scarlet witch is definitely the most powerful of them all but then she got respite with the hulk and thor missing the game being out of town and planet respectively  we have been hearing rumours of jon favreau the director of the first two iron man flicks and robert downey jr hinting at the fourth foray in the iron man solo universe and after having seen another movie with iron man in it you can be more assured than ever iron man cant be played by anyone else but him he brings the cool in icecool and exudes spunk from his every pore like ali used to personify inside and outside the ring  smart one liners mindblowing set pieces a character curve which is usually left at the door in such action flicks and sets up the playing field so well for the two part avengers infinity war which luckily for us shall be directed by the russo brothers  scarlet witch and vision build their personas further in this instalment and you can sense that they shall have a critical role for the future while the next spiderman solo entry spiderman the homecoming is the next save the date film as we are told from the filmsites that iron man also plays a role in that one  warner bros take note please as this is how you make a superhero shootdown without shooting yourself in the foot
May 15 2016,positive,other than the strange peter parker character and weird hot aunt mae it was a excellent movie very entertaining
May 15 2016,positive,the movie finds the right balance between seriousgrim and comedy civil war is probably my favorite mcu movie to date it may not be perfect but it managed to make me forget about everything else completely for 25 hours and only very few movies are capable of doing that also kudos to the cast  they did an amazing job with each of their characters
May 15 2016,positive,watch online full hd at  
May 15 2016,positive,great flick the marvel formula is still alive and well
May 15 2016,negative,it pains me to write that one of the most anticipated films of the year turned into one of the most disappointing movies ive seen so far in 2016  despite some amazing action sequences the weak plot made weaker by the introduction of one of the blandest villains in recent superhero history prevents this film from living up to its earlier predecessors spidey was a pleasant surprise and paul rudd as ant man was equally entertaining during their 5 minute cameo the rest is simply forgettable
May 15 2016,positive,best superhero movie i have seen so far perfect mixture when it has to get serious it gets to it and when we need some fun it delivers
May 15 2016,positive,fantastic says it all
May 15 2016,negative,too much fighting where no one died its like a kid playing with his gi joes
May 15 2016,positive,one of the best movie i ever saw
May 15 2016,positive,standout preformances from the people who shouldve had it best comic book movie to date
May 15 2016,neutral,yaaaawwn all action no substance found myself tuning out a lot
May 15 2016,positive,fine movie fun not great felt like a vehicle that got me safely from one place to the next i liked black panther and spiderman
May 15 2016,positive,it was good but i cant help but think of how much better cap 3 would have been if they had kept with the serpent society story im not a comic reader but i say this because of how much more focused i think it would have been had it been following up on the shield story and a more fleshed out version of the bucky arc civil war was still good though with some great action and a slightly more in depth story behind it all when compared to the likes of the avengers movies  all in all it was a very fun enjoyable romp which could have been improved with a little more time but otherwise worked well on its own a decent final chapter in the captain america story i could go on but this was just a brief review
May 15 2016,positive,that airport sequence thou
May 15 2016,positive,amazing film  packed with characters and action never dragged even with the long running time  a departure from the actual civil war storyline in the comics but they dumbed it down for the general public i get that  this was the movie that avengers age of ultron should have been it basically took winter soldier which was also excellent and upped the ante  i give it the highest possible rating
May 15 2016,positive,clearly black panther and spiderman made their statements here great way to introduce the former great way to reintroduce the latter ms tomei as aunt may still looks hot in her 50s d
May 15 2016,positive,very good movie good action sequences nice little twist 5 stars
May 14 2016,positive,it was cool for what it was the tones were all over the place but it was nothing like the comics i guess i just had way higher expectations knowing how the comic played out ill give it to marvel though they know how to please the masses and critics
May 14 2016,positive,this movie is a bad ass
May 14 2016,positive,awesome awesome awesome has a bit choppy cgi in the beginning but otherwise awesome
May 14 2016,negative,3d not worth it plot line was wack and about everyones parents best part was spider mans 5 minutes of fame save your money
May 14 2016,negative,too long and boring the shaky camera work in the action scenes made me feel nauseous
May 14 2016,positive,why do i keep letting myself get talked into watching these overblown overthetop indestructible cartoons played by live actors   there is no real sense of suspense or interest when everybody has superduper magic powers and you know no one is going to die  comic books come to life are just not very interesting to me anymore  they are getting as boring to me as zombies and vampires  blah 
May 14 2016,positive,captain america civil war happens to lack the war thing becoming a tedious series of unnecessary subplots too big for its own premise and a journey that led nowhere and wont have a major impact on future marvel films basically a skippable story
May 14 2016,positive,so i can say with a happy smile on my face that this was just as good as i thought it was going to be maybe even better and im so happy about that    i loved how they did the new characters like spiderman and black panther i would even say that this is my favorite version of spiderman yet black panther i thought was done perfectly and this gets me really pumped for his solo movie along with spidermans even antman had his moments in this    the only really thing i think was pointless until the end was baron zemo but other then that i would say that this is near perfect    oh and did i mention spiderman yet hes soo good and im so ready for his solo movie even antman had his moments in this    so overall i would rate 910 just what i wanted and even more    after 2nd viewing    still just as good as the first time i saw it black panther still might be my favorite character in the mcu besides spiderman
May 14 2016,positive,this is what a superhero movie should be like without a shadow of a doubt the best superhero movie ive seen
May 14 2016,positive,awesome black panther stole the show cant wait to see that movie
May 14 2016,positive,the spiderman scenes are a little out of place as they are forced to spend time introducing him into the mcu and thereby distracting from the primary story  otherwise civil war is an allaround entertaining film on par with the winters soldier or first avengers at two and a half hours the movie moves along quickly enough to not seem to run too long  20 more minutes of superhero on superhero action and one might get a little bored with it but the film manages to cut it off at just the right point
May 14 2016,negative,i am not a comic book reader nor am i completely familiar with these super hero characters but i am able to follow good solid stories and this one just didnt have any i thought the marvel folks were going to end up fighting the frozen soviet super soldiers but instead they ended up fighting each other while the camera was moving up and down and cutting back and forth between the action i almost fell asleep before the highlight of this movie iron man 3 was a good and solid super hero movie but these crowded marvel films are only good for comic book and super hero fans theyre not for the general audience
May 14 2016,negative,worst movie i saw this year
May 14 2016,positive,amazing movie this movie was a treat for all people looking for a spectacular action filled master piece the story carries on from captain america the first avenger and gives a meaningful unexplainable bond and friend ship between cap and bucky the two century old friends must face a battle of their own allies in order to prove the truth that bucky was not the villain that he seemed to be another plot in this film was the disagreement between caps team and the red iron golem tony stark about signing a contract with the government which basically made the united nations have full control and responsibility over the avengers this caught the attention of iron man as he was faced the conscience and heavy guilt after he realizes that the team unintentionally destroys the lives of many innocent bystanders in their butt kicking process the cap doesnt want to give up the power to help who ever they need to help with or without the permission approval of the government this blockbuster is definitely a need to see check it out gabe
May 14 2016,positive,haha some funnier than expected bits reminiscent of deadpool could be shorter for first half
May 14 2016,positive,very well written timely comedy and action packed entertainment i highly recommend
May 14 2016,positive,the avengers sequel you always wanted if not necessarily the winter soldier follow up you were hoping for civil war deftly handles the biggest cast in a marvel movie to date and some of the series best action and humor however reduced stakes and yet another forgettable marvel villain make caps third standalone outing just another solid if not quite great entry in the franchise
May 14 2016,positive,worth all the hype surrounding this marvel clash of the titans this movie has a actionpacked emotional core along with some witty humor mixed in great to see the black panther finally make his debut and its refreshing to see some development between scarlet witch and vision well done marvel
May 14 2016,positive,it was awesome while it left out some of the story arch that i was expecting it did not disappoint in action or heart
May 14 2016,positive,great movie i think this is the best of the avengers movies yet
May 14 2016,negative,this dang diddly dog bird shit was the movie the fans did not want speaking as the bigges marvel fan on earth 1 worst black panther on screen i preferred the ones before him and what a terrible spiderboy what is he like 12 an incredible waste of potential just like the winter soldier does not redeem the great capt murica franchise from the great days of the first avenger movie characters were very under developed and this movie was a big fall from the once great marvel cinematic universe      i liked black widow and visions hair ant man played too small a role in this movie
May 14 2016,positive,best marvel film yet in my opinion  i enjoyed every second of it and the way they use every character on the film was really well done definitely must watch even if your not a marvel fan the action here is insane
May 14 2016,positive,totally awesome movie would definitely see it again and probably again after that you should go see this movie if you hadnt already
May 14 2016,positive,good but i thought it was too longtwo hours would have been sufficient
May 14 2016,negative,horrible movie it had nothing to do with the original comic arc dont watch it
May 14 2016,positive,awesome movie cant wait for black panther
May 14 2016,positive,definitely emotional borderline disturbing to see your favorite superheroes fighting each other 
May 14 2016,positive,are you paying attention zack snyder this is how its done
May 14 2016,positive,three years ago i went to a movie called man of steel where i watched superman tear apart metropolis for at least 25 minutes straight at the end of that movie i remember wondering how long audiences would tolerate wanton destruction of property and suspend disbelief that people get caught in the crossfire  avengers transformers guardians theyre all guilty of this  tonight i watched civil war and finally the superhero movie has grown up they take on the collateral damage question directly while still causing plenty of it  best of both worlds  its a character driven story focusing on flaws questioning the difference between good guys and bad guys and a particular scene at the end which made this my favorite marvelavengers film of the modern disney era  i dont want to spoil it so you can ask me later  this movie is simply excellent its nice to see a franchise mature set standards for the rest of the genre and still have fun doing it  grade a
May 14 2016,positive,great movie amazing action sequences story moves along well and characters have great chemistry with each other it does drag a little bit in parts meaning it couldve been a few minutes shorter but honestlyafter suffering through batman v supermani can live with the extra minutes
May 14 2016,positive,as always a very good movie from marvel i just did not like that the story reset for spider man
May 14 2016,positive,the russo brothers learned how to balance plot and a large number of characters thanks to their days working television comedies they succeed in making a marvel film feel as fresh as they possibly can
May 14 2016,positive,captain america civil war was neither here nor there in terms of another one of marvels formulated movies         after many installments in this cinematic franchise it feels like youre watching the same type of movie on repeat and while the actions scenes were good it felt a little too much choriographed and the plot was lacking substance but the real question is why is this film critically praised while batman v superman was panned         some critics for batman v superman viewed it negative for the length of the movie yet civil war is roughly the same amount of time in fact these two movie have many similarities that one character can easily replace another from the other franchise and you would essentially have the same story iron man and captain america is batman and superman zemo is lex and spider man and black panther is wonder woman other critics said that it was too dark there was too much death and gloom yet civil war gets praised for doing the same thing is the lighting and time of day a movie takes in really the difference between critical praise and critically panned         some would criticize me for saying that if both are the same movie then why give the other a higher rating the difference between them is that ones true purpose was meant to establish the building blocks to an entire universe in a different and edgy way while the other was meant to follow a formula with little room for creativity         regardless of what i think it is the movie goers who have the final say so continue to watch movies and formulate your own opinions and not those of criticsunless youre  bribed by disneyallegedly
May 14 2016,neutral,i watch this movieits averagewho have caption
May 14 2016,positive,totally awesome  id pay to see it again spiderman stole the show in the fight scene
May 14 2016,positive,captain america civil war is a great movie especially next to age of ultron but it feels like its missing some of the charm and spice that made captain america the winter soldier such an intriguing story
May 14 2016,positive,the marvel cinematic universe is nailing it this year keep it up
May 14 2016,positive,best one yet  dc needs to take notes
May 14 2016,positive,a lively film with more substance and style than some more recent marvel offerings though there are several plotting issues that one must practise blissful ignorance so as not to spoil the thematic ambition and technical ingenuity displayed before them at times powerful often thoughtful frequently enjoyable too often misguided
May 14 2016,negative,so much action so little meaning
May 14 2016,positive,better than ultron about on par with bvs a little better but just not the same impact as the original avengers
May 14 2016,positive,sweet movie really long but if you love marvel superheroes youll love this
May 14 2016,positive,great movie very funny cool fight scenes and decent enough plot line we had a great time
May 14 2016,positive,spoilers    captain america civil war is one of the best marvel movies and superhero movies to date its not particularly groundbreaking storywise and at times falls prey to formulaic nature of the previous films in the mcu if youre not a fan of the marvel universe this film wont change youre mind however if you are a fan i dont see any flaw strong enough to incite dislike of the film as a whole it boasts every element that fans love about these movies the action the humor the interesting and entertaining character interactions etc despite the title marketing civil war as another captain america movie its much more reminiscent of the avengers films the focus is spread evenly among both cap and iron man both sides of the ideological warfare are shown with no clearcut these are the goodguys and these are the bad guys element both sides are attempting to do what they believe is right even the character of zemo who is more or less the villain has a clear and understandable motivation for tearing the avengers apart each character is given just enough time to shine and more importantly each character is feels relevant to the main story the action is entertaining and filled to the brim with wit and creativity the airport scene is easily the best superhero brawl ever onscreen i loved the dramatic tonal shift during the third act the battle at the airport was largely a big comedic skit with each character seeming to have a fun time fighting each other for the most part  however a series of events including rody being injured and iron man finding out that bucky was responsible for his parents death lead to the final fight between cap bucky and tony to be an epic intense and almost deadserious climactic clash despite all these great aspects of civil war the movie has its downsides too i have two major gripes    1 the lack of character death takes away from any palpable tension and feeling of possible consequences this isnt so much a problem specifically with civil war but for entire superhero genre major characters dont die and if they do they wont stay dead i ranted about this in detail in my batman v superman review so ill keep it brief here for a movie that is supposed to be a game changer for the franchise i would think that at least one major character would die just one is that really too much to ask on the bright side they didnt pull a batman v superman by pretending to kill off a character only to bring them back in the cheapest way possible characters simply dont die war machine who i think we can all agree isnt super important in the franchise is wounded but of course doesnt die dont worry he will be back in the next movie even though i am strictly against judging movies based on loyalty to source material i cant help wondering why they decided not to kill of captain america like in the comic books as awesome as the final fight scene was there was very little palpable tension for me as i know that neither iron man nor cap would bite the dust in the end even if rodywar machine had actually died that would have at least created some sense that there are actually stakes nope everybody survives and everybody is friends again in the end yay     2 the cinematography is for the most part bland and unmemorable both avengers movies had the one long shot amidst the action that stood out showing all of the avengers kicking ass together civil war doesnt have this they missed a golden opportunity to have a long shot of all the heroes fighting at once as the fight is about to begin we get a nice long shot of all everybody running at each other but just as they are about to clash the camera cuts away and begins showing brief tidbits of two individuals fighting followed by another shot of another two fighting and so on there is never that one shot that stands out dont get me wrong that entire sequence was great i just wish there was more to cinematography     obviously there are plenty more marvel films to come heck phase 3 is only just beginning however thus far civil war is the best of the bunch in my opinion its the best marvel film weve had yet and the best superhero film since the dark knight
May 14 2016,positive,amazing best comic book movie made up to this point this made bvs look like garbage dc movies you just dont have it watch your tv versions for sucess marvel rules
May 14 2016,neutral,i thought it was okim not a fan of this marvel movieit was too long the story line was good and the effects were good but honestly i wasnt really impressed
May 14 2016,positive,captain america civil war is absolutely a big success everything works from the humor to the action its flow perfectly also the airport scene is amazing
May 14 2016,positive,what movies aspire to be but rarely are this movie was a love letter to all filmgoers in particular marvel fans we werent worthy but thankfully watched in giddy enjoyment thank you
May 14 2016,positive,not enough iron man snarkiness spidermanpeter parker goofiness was fun but a good addition to the marvel universe movies
May 14 2016,negative,marvel needs to stop with these stupid mass movies
May 14 2016,positive,a little long in parts but just about perfect followup to age of ultron
May 14 2016,neutral,captain americas third outing on the big screen is just more of what weve come to expect from marvel studios a two and a half hour popcorn flick with a shoehorned conflict sokovia accords and villain zemo that if you stop to think about it for more than two seconds doesnt really make sense its certainly fun although its probably more fun than a civil war should be but theres more to a great comic book movie than just being fun or funny thats not to say that comic book movies cant be fun but that clearly wasnt or at least shouldnt have been the intention in a movie called civil war the few moments that they did slow down for to try and pose a few deeper thoughts and questions were either ridiculously simple problems to solve or not even real problems in the first place all in all it was still a well put together film with fun and memorable characters but at the end of the day it fails to deliver on the promise of the title and it fails to live up to the comic book series it was adapted from
May 14 2016,positive,i dont know why but everything marvel puts its hands on succeeds somehow captain america civil war is the third captain america standalone movie and the first of marvels phase 3 ive never been a comicreader nor am i a big marvelgeek but the mcu has in the meantime become a part of my annual movie visits and im not yet tired of them especially not after marvels supposedly best adaptation to date    with civil war marvel reaches new depths and significance apart from the typical marvel humor we are offered a side that proves high demands as well as some seriousness as we have seen in winter soldier the russo brothers here too prove their skills and show us a new more grown up side of the mcu first and foremost ascribable to the grounded story that does not only put the avengers to test but will also get every marvel enthusiast into a conflict the discord between our otherwise well attuned superheroes is the core of the story and the reason for the imminent war but we arent pushed in an alleged right direction both sides are justified in their individual views and comprehensible in their motivations the conflict which is the incentive of the entire movie is inarguably clearly to be felt and appears most of all plausible every fan that chose a side will find himself questioning his decision if he allows himself to  but not only do the motivation of the torn avengers seem reasonable but also those of the antagonist zeemo though they are maybe held a little too simple    besides all the old characters civil war also introduces two new characters black panther and spiderman who finally returned to the mcu last year i cant even put into words how incredibly awesome both are portrayed and how much im looking forward to seeing both their standalone movies i dont even want to say much more about them you simply have to see and enjoy them on the big screen yourselves all the characters appearing in this movie fit into the storyline and are in no way incoherently presented to us not for one minute does the movie feel crowded or simply disorganized even though not all of the characters have the same amount of screentime everyone has their shining moment and reason to be in the movie the interactions throughout the movie are especially great to watch partly pretty hilarious and entertaining but also severe and emotionally touching in general this movie has throughout alongside the unique humor much more grown up and serious parts not only palpable through the stunningly written script but also to be seen in the nerveracking fight sequence of the last act that will thrill but also shock everyone watching the tension that is build up in those few minutes is incredible needless to say that the action scenes are well choreographed and beautifully filmed just like they were in its predecessor civil war probably delivers one of the best on screen action in the history of marvel    conclusion civil war is marvels most mature movie and in addition has a big emotional impact that i havent seen in any marvel movie before in combination with the for marvel typical humor the movie seems to be well balanced and atmospherically harmonious civil war is without doubt marvels most grown up movie to date whether it is the best thats up to you to decide its definitely far up on my list because just thinking or writing about it makes me want to go back to the movies
May 14 2016,positive,a good superhero film but dulls on repeated watchings
May 14 2016,positive,our favorites are the best of them all
May 14 2016,positive,practically flawless and this is the spiderman we were waiting for mature and entertaining truly awesome
May 14 2016,positive,cant explain how amazing this movie is
May 14 2016,negative,i enjoyed this but heck who doesnt marvel loves to play it safe make it colorful obvious and much to nice they dont take any risks nor even make any part of this dark its a classical take to a superhero genre film i dont understand how they end up just making movies like this and so damn repetitive imagine punching someone who threatens to end you imprison you stop you from being someone and then you just apologize right after punching them and give a hug and smilesthats what this whole film is based off of smh personally bvs is much better
May 14 2016,positive,great fight scenes not a ton of jokes though the beginning is great to generally its a great movie 4 and a half out of 5 stars
May 14 2016,positive,i thought it was very well it was the very best marvel movie yet out of all the characters i thought it still centered around captain america and bucky spiderman is now in the right hands and was portrayed very well black panther was portrayed very well and awesome the only thing i did not like or i feel like that was skipped over was just a little bit of my personal own nitpicking like what did bring hawkeye out of retirement it was asked but never answered or like i did not understand the letter steve wrote to tony at the end or i just wanted to see baron zemo in his uniform but anyways i would definitely recommend this movie
May 14 2016,positive,entertaining this and winter solider exc gotg are the best marvel have done
May 14 2016,positive,almost as good as winter soldier awesome film
May 14 2016,negative,if you enjoy fight scenes this movie is for you  there are tons of special effects in this movie  the one thing missing is an actual storyline
May 14 2016,positive,this is what a summer blockbuster should be  the captain america movies are so much better than the avengers
May 14 2016,positive,captain america civil war is the longawaited adaptation of the highly popular civil war storyline from marvel comics that features our favourite superheroes going to blows with one another after a massive disagreement tears them apart and it has already cemented itself as one of the most important chapters in the mcu first and foremost this is a captain america sequel with his story taking center stage however one could argue that it is essentially the avengers 25 considering how heavily the film focuses on the fallout from the destruction caused in the winter soldier and age of ultron the governments from around the globe have decided that the avengers require stricter supervision which divides the team in half with iron man war machine vision black widow spiderman and black panther voting yay and captain america bucky falcon scarlett witch antman and hawkeye rebelling against the decision thus we have our civil war between the two teams the russo brothers return to the mcu after directing the flawless winter soldier and havent skipped a beat in crafting eyegasmic action sequences while consistently juggling the evergrowing list of heroes with enough room in the runtime to give each character their moment pretty much every actor returns from the previous avengers film save for chris hemsworth and mark ruffalo and effortlessly step back into the shoes theyve worn so frequently with chris evans and in particular robert downey jr delivering some of their best work as their characters the new additions to the cast are also great having daniel brühl as the villain baron zemo more on him later chadwick boseman as black panther and the glorious return of the wallcrawling spiderman back in the marvel universe portrayed flawlessly by tom holland in a breakout role this is the first bigscreen representation of black panther who worked exceptionally well as a sortof wildcard in the conflict but the brief appearance from spiderman in his best portrayal yet easily stole the movie and is one of the many highlights speaking of highlights holy mother of god the nearly 20 minute airport battle royale between the two factions is handsdown the greatest superhero action scene to date and with all of these largerthanlife characters going at it its pretty impressive that each character shines antman was used better here than in his entire solo movie now this is not a flawless film some of the camerawork in the early fight scenes most notably with black widow is far too quickcut and shaky compared to the rest of the film the avengers are berated by the government for destruction they caused protecting earth and no one seems to mention this and the overall convenience of zemos plan is a bit too perfect considering how many dominoes had to fall into place for it to work marvel has always struggled with their villains but in this case zemo works as a puppetmaster where the real conflictvillain is the strife between the two teams that said this is still one of the most entertaining times ive ever had in a theater and i have much love for what marvel has accomplished with their nearperfect 13 film winstreak and i eagerly await whats instore from them next
May 14 2016,negative,i t was ok the end really sucked  the ensemble of superheroes in the one scene was the best part of the movie
May 14 2016,positive,great movie spider man was amazing
May 14 2016,negative,boring while its fantasy i just cant fathom people with such incredible power can be so stupid  a 5 minute conversation with reasonable people would have solved the dilemma
May 14 2016,negative,overlong overstuffed all around just not as good as the first avengers movie about on par with the second one i guess captain americas motivations are all out of character same with iron man scarlet witch is grating the dialogue all around is cheesy and fakey and strained the whole civil war between avengers has no stakes because most of the opposing characters are still friends with each other and appear to be just play fighting for no reason everyone looks old you know its bad when hawkeye is the most charismatic one in particular vision is awkward because hes some kind of celestial being who presumably could wipe everyone out in an instant but he lollygags around pretending to fight for some reason     new spiderman is good ant man was pretty good     all in all this is maybe something you rent when its in the 1 bin but its not worth seeing in theaters
May 14 2016,positive,amazing movie best one yet
May 14 2016,positive,i love this movie it was and always will be amazing
May 14 2016,positive,the action is pretty constant which is fine  my head hurts a little bit but it was kind of worth it  it makes me excited for this next phase of the mcu
May 14 2016,neutral,its okay  i dont know i never felt like conflict was truly afoot
May 14 2016,positive,civil war really is something to marvel over pun intended beautiful visual eyecandy fantastic script and some of the best acting a marvel film has seen in a while tom holland most definitely steals the show as a revamped version of the web slinging spidey the film really breathes life into the seemingly never ending superhero fad of the 21st century spunky charismatic intense and sometimes quite somber captain america civil war is a very worthy entry in marvels repertoire
May 14 2016,positive,absolutely amazing movie one of the best marvel movies so far loved it
May 14 2016,positive,amazing got right to the point and not to long
May 14 2016,positive,there were some really great scenes but there was a great deal more movie than there was story
May 14 2016,positive,this is largely the movie i wished avengers 2 could have been and i honestly felt the writers of this movie completely schooled wheedon on how it should be done  forget armies of faceless mooks its the first time we really see a largescale fight between multiple unique individuals and while quite fun and very well handled even that paled to the final reveal and encounter which was both poignant and cognitively disconcerting  probably the best part of the film is that unlike the actual comics you can see where both characters are coming from and they arent presented as unreasonable  caps troubles in winter soldier instilled a massive distrust with governing agencies in general and he is of course very invested in his former friend whereas tonys decisions are quite sympathetic given the emotional relief from handing the moral responsibilities associated with recent avengers outing onto a world government structure  collateral damage is a hard thing to live with and even if not the fault of the defenders its the villains who initiate one must blame one is always left wondering if things could have been different  and then of course you have the winter soldier issue itself and how accountable you feel he should be held for past deeds which arguably becomes one of the main issues of the film  would you hold the mentally afflicted accountable for actions performed when not cognizant  what if the issue was deeply personal  neither issue is hardlineaddressed as morality is not blackandwhite so all uncertainties are left as is as each character pursues what they feel is the right option whether it is or isnt and it all flows quite well    i was also notably surprised with how well black panther was integrated into the movie as i really expected him to be a shoehorned cameo but instead found a fairly decent origin story tied into the films flesh  and spiderman was probably one of the most comiclike portrayals in every instance he appeared in suit even if im a little infringed by iron mans rather deep involvement with the character hes also really young which i think i may just have to get used to  i even liked zimo as i feel that its rare that a marvel movie presents a villain that can actually catch me offguard but i didnt really expect zimos plan at all and its resolution resounded very well in the moment of first viewing     if i had to fault the movie it would probably be the sheer ridiculous overthetop action that breaks even what flexible suspension of disbelief i still have in this franchise  when i see people jumping down five stories and then breaking into a sprint like nothings wrong im left rolling my eyes but when war machine falls from the sky and impacts the ground in a crater  no he doesnt get back up from that that was worse than when tony did it in iron man 1 in the cavesuit which was also completely ludicrous   sometimes these movies ask us to swallow an awful lot i think and thats saying something in any movie where a guy can shrink to the size of a bug and still communicate with others like nothings different the better left unsaid in that regard the better
May 14 2016,positive,solid marvel outing definitely better than that piece of garbage age of ultron i would say this is my third favorite marvel movie behind gaurdian and cap 2 im still back and forth on zemo being the villain here but there was a lot to like in this movie the fight scenes were good spiderman was also added into the movie tactically but he was so charming you didnt mind it black panther was also bad ass a lot of fun stuff from antman overall fun experience russo brothers are probably the best thing to happen to the marvel universe since robert downey jr good concept good execution
May 14 2016,positive,really good movie compelling and thought provoking since its dealing with a more shades of grey area realization awesome movie my second favorite marvel movie behind captain americas the winter soldier a must see
May 14 2016,negative,i went into it with high expectations its had some great reviews and i think i know why instant gratification     it is a standard marvel movie some good comedy spiderman is true to the comics but apart from that it falls pretty badly i cant see how people dont mention it moves from place to place just like batman v superman but for even less of a reason the storyline is so bad i mean the reason that it all happens down to the final battle at the end is so stupid especially as the villain is all angry about one thing and doesnt care how many people he kills to achieve his goal which must be the reason he is acting like the villain    the fight scenes are good as expected but its the same old story because it has so many plot holes its hard to see beyond these i think its done well because we are a society that in general wants everything 10 minutes ago we dont wait for stories to be developed until that changes this wagon will continue
May 14 2016,positive,while watching civil war i couldnt help but think of dc  warner bross desperate failures to catch up with marvels unstoppable success specifically the recent disaster batman v superman both films are about allies finding themselves on opposing sides only marvel actually succeeds on every level dc fails where bvs botched everything from the basic setup why are these guys so angry with each other to nearly everything else that followed civil war soars with nuanced clarity allegiances will fall  form friendships will break  build and summer entertainment will be had  civil war finds tentpoleheroes captain america and iron man at odds each coming to grips with their power and position on the global scale on starkly different sides neither side is clearly rightorwrong instead we are presented with a familiar world in which goodandevil are not blackandwhite but largely grey even the de facto villain one of the better in the mcu finds sympathy through his heartbreaking and understandable motivations  these disparate sides are each so nuanced and logical i found my loyalty swinging backandforth like peter parker at an air show speaking of which hollands turn as the webbedcrusader is easily the greatest in cinema young witty wiry and wideeyed our first view of him is a standout even while placed within the larger context of the marquee airport battle maybe the greatest superhero melee ever  the russos who have taken whedons place as goto directors for marvel have such a strong control of humor story character and action theyve even managed to better their fantastic winter soldier here with them at the helm any assemblage of avengers is one to anticipate
May 14 2016,negative,it had no real plot  the villian in this movie was some normal guy who caused a split in the avengers who should have had his tail whooped and the movie would have been over   waste of time
May 14 2016,positive,another knock out of the park from team marvel taking one of the most polarizing story lines from the comics and not only making it work but making you actually care unlike the comic version this civil war fits perfectly into the already established mcu and also carries enough emotional weight that no matter which side you are rooting for you understand where they are coming from see dc you can have heroes fighting and have it make sense be fun and make money    but in all seriousness a great follow up to both winter soldier and age of ultron and makes me look forward even more to whats coming next especially black panther
May 14 2016,positive,action humor plot twists well written story or whatever you expect marvel pays you the complete package on this one
May 14 2016,positive,it does what it says on the tin and well  i think if you particularly follow this genre as opposed to being a parent accompanying someone who really is into it you would probably give it four or five stars
May 14 2016,neutral,who was the arch evil villain worthy of our loathing and spurning all the action  most of the fighting was the good guys duking it out  did not buy tony stark getting all moist about his parents and that driving his anger  if not for some fresh air breathed into the action from ant man and spidey this would have been a most stale experience    most memorable moment was the cameowhat does that say    marvel flicks all blending together
May 14 2016,positive,it was decent but that was to be expected looking forward to future marvel movies
May 14 2016,positive,910 easily the best nonxmen marvel film controversial statement  i liked batman v superman just as much d
May 14 2016,positive,great story w action so outrageous i caught myself laughing out loud
May 14 2016,positive,a remarkable achievement in transcending the super hero genre with a sublayer of big and current themes in diplomacy psychology and concequences of war well written good character development and amazing action sequences the perfect summer movie
May 14 2016,neutral,first off happy astronomy day   second i saw captain america civil war last night  i was actually more impressed with batman vs superman it was almost the same plot actually  it wasnt bad  dont mistake my posting   there were some interesting choices made in this film  i love how captain america has stepped up his game as far as displaying his strength durability and i would have sided with him  the spider man injection was en par with what i would have expected and gotta love seeing marissa tormei  and i still think vision is way too human too quickly  overall i just was not blown away  at first i would think its because im more mature now older but star wars blew me away so    captain america civil war is definitely worth a trip to the movies but i can not consider this a high wow factor
May 14 2016,positive,its the first time i am writing a review for a movie  cant be a better pick to start off with  captain america  civil war  is definitely one of the hardest scripts to tackle and pull it off with such grace and impeccable narration the pace of the movie evolves and spreads out at a very positive rate  you dont see it being sluggish at any point nor does it blow out of the roof without reason of course the movie has those insane moments that live up to the hype and of course the effort put into making them my only little concern with the movie was the initial screen time of vision  it just felt the script or his character was out of place on his initial scenes and they did not really bring it up how the rest of the characters were played or moreover put into the movie plot apart from that that the script  direction character personalities and of course the action sequences do make it a worthy phase 3 kick off for mcu doesnt matter if you are a marvel fan or not there is something in it for everyone to enjoy    cheers
May 14 2016,positive,marvel has done it again
May 14 2016,negative,went to the shows last night and though i had seen some negative reviews a lot were positive 5 star ratings i figured its an action superhero movie with captain america so i went with my family well its an avengers feature and its 2 12 hours long and its anything but a masterpiece i saw bvs and i enjoyed batman he was a badass there were no expectations when i went to the cheap showings but for avengers it was an avengers movie there was high expectations the kids were so so about it and the wife and i hated it we were soooo disappointed maybe i should of read more reviews cos i agree with a lot of the negative reviews definitely not a great movie two thumbs down
May 14 2016,positive,good flick and black panther was done well  hulks absence was a bummer  fight scenes were well done as usual  not feeling vision at all  dude is weird
May 14 2016,positive,the only flaw i found was how the handled baron zemo everything else was diamond perfect
May 14 2016,negative,this movie is way too long  the story was horrible and not clear  vision trying to be funny was a desaster the fake love story between scarlet witch and him was horrible the explication of zemo arrive too far in the movie  aunt may was sexy wtf  spidey lose vs falcon wtf x2  agent carter die and poof 2 second later captain love another one  i can do this all day     the only good point of the movie was iron man who seems more mature and the last fight scene
May 14 2016,positive,marvel universe expands with this latest outing a moral tale of who decides who when and where our heroes should act echoing the real world actions of super powers rather than super heroes who do you choose cap who believes in freedom to act or stark who believes in a controlling body to make those choices 
May 14 2016,positive,everything about this movie was great great character development acting fight scenes plotline really enjoyed it way better than that other civil warish movie
May 14 2016,positive,love this movie cool movie
May 14 2016,positive,must say even as a dc mega fan marvels civil war was freaking off the chain the script was actually better written than the comic series that i was a huge fan of so that was great to see the only small nitpicking criticism i can give it is that it seems to have absolutely no consequences for all of the events that happen during it nobody gets killed or even life threateningly injured and even the relationships that are damaged are easily fixed and forgiven before the end of the movie still this doesnt really seem to bring down the spirit of the movie but does take away any real seriousness to it
May 14 2016,positive,great movie and portrayed the comics perfectly best superhero movie ever
May 14 2016,negative,not my favorite genre wife and son would probably give it 4 stars
May 14 2016,positive,captain america civil war is the thirteenth film of the marvel cinematic universe it is directed by anthony and joe russo with a screenplay by christopher markus  stephen mcfeely   in captain america civil war disagreement over international oversight of the avengers fractures them into opposing factions  one led by steve rogers and the other by tony stark  civil war is definitely one of the best marvel movies to date and absolutely on par with the winter soldier which was also great they are both on top in the marvel cinematic movies ranking of mine so far the conflict between these well beloved characters is done in a brilliant and fantastic way by the amazing russo brothers who took the cheese out of the first captain america movie  made one serious and great second movie and build upon them both with the third outing   everyone does a great job here chris evans has made captain america his own same as robert downey jr for iron man it features a very big ensemble cast and not one of them is anything less than great on the role the fight scenes are also some of the best ever made in a comic book movie even better than in the winter soldier especially the airport scene is just mesmerizing and totally stands out from everything else thats going on spiderman is also unbelievably well done and tom holland is just fantastic i am one of the few people who actually loved the amazing spider man movies and really got mad to hear that they are going to reboot the character again but i can see now that it was worth it the visuals are great from beginning to end the music is also good as usual the villain is something that most people though it was the weakest point but i strongly disagree with that he had reasoning as to why he is doing those things and he pushes the other characters in new directions which is also necessary   i generally adored this movie and even though i am a dc fan theres just no denying that marvel knows what theyre doing and that is why they are much more successful right now
May 14 2016,positive,actionadventure from the gate you will not doze off in this one for sure as there is plenty of visuals to engage you i liked the special effects did not care for the story line so much as it was based on the world rejecting the avengers protection based on the collateral damage they cause i was not exactly buying the premise of the good guys battling each other because of a disagreement seems like a shallow argument for such a rift more like family squabbles among super heroes instead of civil war also the introduction of spiderman was a bit contrived worth the watch if you are a marvel fan but still yearning for the next
May 14 2016,positive,captain america is very marvelous and wonderfully crafted it is executed very well
May 14 2016,positive,awesome from beginning to end only wished hulk made an appearance
May 14 2016,positive,i was a big fan of the first avengers but a little less so when it came to the second the big reason why i note this in a discussion of civil war is that if i am being honest civil war might as well have been categorized as a third avengers now for me this brings up a few interesting notes when it comes to my feelings about this film the first being that civil war is not just an amazing movie it is likely everything that the second avengers wanted to be or should have been      the other side of this discussion then is how it fits with my feelings of captain america winter soldier which happens to be one of my favourite super hero films what i loved about winter soldier is how it married the political thriller with the super hero motif it was serious and complex but oh so fun and thrilling given its avengers type ensemblecast civil war is less complex but not necessarily in a bad way it is a super hero film first with some interesting politicalsocialpersonal dynamics layered in in this sense it moves away from the feel of winter soldier which is not so much a negative as it is a reality but at the same time it     dont get me wrong i understand why they fit this film under the captain america line of films as it does purpose to push the captain america story forward it simply has a larger goal as well which is to position itself as a jumping off point for marveldisney to move in some different directions probably the greatest compliment i could pay the film is that for as much as the film is intentionally positioned i dont think there was any point in the 2 and a half hour running time that i felt like anything was forced even the appearance of spiderman which has little to nothing to do with the story itself was so well done that it feels like it belongs     thematically the film makes for some really interesting discussion while there are some grand fight sequences that pit a ton of characters against each other the emotional core sits in the relationship between iron man and captain america what the whole concept of the civil war does so well is ensure that both sides feel like they have equally valid points not to give anything away but the film does a super job at setting up the viewer to really empathize with both sides which is an emotional investment that comes to fruition in the final third of the film when the film begins to bring us in on what is really going on underneath the emotions it makes the rest of the film that much more meaningful     with all of that said i think spiderman deserves another note here i knew nothing about the casting going in to the film but suffice to say that the big change here is the casting of a younger spiderman i am a toby mcguire guy and have nothing but great things to say about raimis spiderman but i have to admit there is something in this kid that just feels inspired and thankfully removed from garfields far more serious take on the webbed crusader it just works and i think a big part of why it feels fresh is their decision to go younger while also bypassing the origin story and far more innocent i think his presence in the film helps to bring balance to what is actually a very serious discussion and the way they position him with tony stark as the older wiser father figure was a smart decision that is rewarding in the end     a note on the new addition as well chadwick boseman i found this character really interesting we get just enough of him to want to know more which is fitting in that his story will be getting the stand alone treatment in a coming film there is a certain urgency to his story that begs to be fleshed out a bit more as everything that motivates him to become the black panther remains somewhat conflicted and untended it will be interesting to see how he develops down the road     again civil war is a really good film if one sees it as another avengers instalment it is different and unique enough to set itself apart from the fun romp of the first it is focused and disciplined enough to set itself apart from the over achieving second if one sees it as a captain america film it travels a different path and a different tone than winter soldier but carries enough of its emotional and political complexity in to the ensemble cast to make it all work together in a meaningful way the films two and a half hours dont feel long or stretched out and the big fight scenes are just fun hello paul rudd entertaining humorous and important enough to be memorable and lastly for as much as the film is intended to prepare us for the multiple different streams of stand alone films to follow civil war is far more than just filler it manages to fit nicely along side any of the previous films that have before it and that is a testament to the strength of the marvel onscreen universe
May 14 2016,positive,this was the perfect set up for the black panther
May 14 2016,positive,awesome all the right mixes of comedy action and drama loved every minute
May 14 2016,positive,a bit on the trump side of political theater  a sort of mightmakesright
May 14 2016,positive,surprisingly amazing less captain america phew more avengers good thing great to see antman again and the the new addition of black panther is very strong
May 14 2016,positive,good solid movie as expected of marvel but it was underwhelming considering all the hype good action scenes and decent plot but poor cgi and a very undeveloped and trashy villain pretty much faceless and useless lost its novelty halfway through the movie as things got a bit too predictable and this is something marvel has to fix scared of killing off major characters or even recurring ones and the happpy ending where cap goes off with his merry band is silly and feels unsatisfying and unresolved
May 14 2016,positive,action packed throughout although i missed thor and hulks bantering
May 14 2016,positive,great movie nonstop action very intense lots of violence
May 14 2016,positive,had to be one of the best marvel movies ever thats why i only gave it four and a half stars because im sure the third avengers movie will probably be the best ever so im waiting to give it five stars
May 14 2016,positive,this movie is probably marvels best movie to date the movie is faithful to the comics to a good enough degree the plot is relatable to modern times issue of security versus freedom as well as how easy it is to destroy friendships over disagreements almost to the point of murder this movie also showcases an impressive revision of spiderman and a new addition to the marvel cinematic universe the black panther 20 century fox can learn a lot from this movie
May 14 2016,positive,i am a big fan of marvel thats why i hate to say civil war is not satisfying enough first the idea of civil war itself is not what i expected before second the story did not develop very prettily i still do not understand why they exactly need to be in the civil war and third unexpectedly is the cgi come on marvel studio still has bad and rough cgi scenes for example the spidermans suit and the storm iron man flew into    overall this movie is very entertaining and its a huge step for another superheroes to get into the franchise cant wait to see black widow solo movie though 
May 14 2016,positive,4    this almost makes up for avengers age of ultron almost    unlike joss whedon the russos seem to understand these characters and make them more relatable
May 14 2016,neutral,apart from 1 or 2 fight scenes all fight scenes were unrealistic and impossible i didnt liked it at all waste of money
May 14 2016,positive,many mistake the fact that marvel studios makes this look easy to underappreciate the the mammoth task of balancing so many characters throughout a two and a half hour affair and managing to be true to every last one character motivations and interactions are handled deftly and with an intimacy that speaks to a true understanding of the source material    the writing is superb and aware and the execution by those in front of and behind the cameras is on point marvel is killing it
May 14 2016,positive,one of the best superhero films out this year wildly entertaining fights scenes and interesting plot
May 14 2016,positive,this is easily one of the most wellexecuted films that successfully balances an incredibly large cast of characters while still giving them each their time to shine and each have their motivation fleshed out
May 14 2016,positive,i would give it 10 stars if i could
May 14 2016,positive,great movie with awesome acting action comedy and heart
May 14 2016,positive,an action packed battle but was it worth it i think not
May 13 2016,positive,such a good movie thank you disneymarvel
May 13 2016,positive,the perfect comic book movie 55
May 13 2016,negative,i did not care for the plot at all also the fighting was not realistic i understand these guys are super heroes but no one could survive what happened to some of them during the fight sequences  all in all very disappointing movie i felt like this was thrown together with some a list actors to make money but not much thought given to the plot you can only have so many fight scenes before it gets really boring
May 13 2016,positive,the first time i saw captain america civil war i can honestly admit i wasnt head over heals about it i found it quite long and not compelling the plot seemed to try to be dark and intense however it didnt seem to work for me the first time however the second time i watched it i changed my mind i found the movie more entertaining and the story more compelling the end took a dark twist which was very startling there was a great setup of why there is an internal choral between characters i saw both views and they were both displayed well i really like the new spiderman and there were a lot of great scenes all in all the movie was very entertaining however it wasnt mind blowing awesome like most say it was fun to watch however it still had the marvel formula i would give it a 69
May 13 2016,positive,omg thee best movie out 
May 13 2016,positive,overall and excellent movie  for anyone that doesnt know anything about the real plot line  if you know the real plot its a fairly big disappointment  i thoroughly enjoyed the movie had my damn bladder had not cooperated with me tonight
May 13 2016,positive,1010 bring on phase three
May 13 2016,positive,amazing in ever way possible
May 13 2016,positive,super fun generally creative fighting plot holes you know but i kinda just enjoy this aesthetic themes touched upon though i thought the iron man side of the argument was underdeveloped would have loved to see his point of view in action love the characters great performances overall dont love it but i want to watch again for the ride
May 13 2016,positive,what raises captain america civilian to war above other action movies are the real emotions involved   bravo especially to chris evans sebastian stan and robert downey jr as well as the writers and directors for taking marvel to a next level  heroes versus villains has been done a million times  this is heroes verses heroes and it is heartbreaking
May 13 2016,positive,captain america civil war was an amazing film really an outstanding movie   enjoyed every second and minute of it
May 13 2016,positive,to be exact i probably say this is a 455    this movie works on so many levels it is so amazing and is a great follow up from captain america the winter solder there are so many great and amazing moments in this film and they all work and it doesnt fill to crammed in the russo brothers have done what joss whedon was unable to do in age of ultron which is find a way to connect all these mcu movies in a way that makes sense    the movie starts off with all of this political drama that is going on in what are some of the most emotional scenes i have ever seen in my life there all so interesting and they work on so many levels the film makes you almost want to well up in tears at times with just how good it is    i will admit it does going on a little too long but it still keeps you invested and makes you want to no more and learn about these characters and how they are feeling    this movie also makes iron man 3 relevant again something i thought ultron would do but didnt in the film we get this broken down tony stark who is wounded and hurt so much by what had happened previously he has lost pepper now and finds himself alone without anyone else he is more angry now and more unhinged because he created ultron who almost destroyed the world    this movie makes you understand why iron man has chosen to take the side of the people and protect them by locking the avengers up    however it also lets you see captain americas side who is against the government because he seen the corruption within them after hydra had taken over you also see that he desires to protect bucky who he loves dearly    both have there reasons and you get that and you really dont want them to fight and it makes you feel so sad when they do    the standout stars were great    black panther had a full arc here he started on one path and ends on another it is amazing and makes a full circle that is interesting and compelling chadwick boseman also gives off a great performance and accent as well that makes it even better i really liked that black panther didnt tell any jokes or quips he didnt care he was all business    spider man was also great too this is the spider man i wanted since i watched spectacular spider man in the 90s as a kid he is young a kid and not so overly hot make actor he is just the nerdy peter parker and i like that    scarlet witch and visons relationship was also great i liked the humor there    i also liked black widow who gave her all    really just all the avengers did well in this film    this film does a good job mixing its humor with its serious moments one never over takes the other it all works in many ways there is a really good mix of everything her that i really had enjoyed    the film does have some bad    baron zemo i didnt mind him i liked him more than lex luthor in bvs but he wasnt needed when i went into this film i was going in ready to hate baron zemo why do these films need a villain you already have heroes v heroes why do you need some really bad villain to be in it that being said for the plot of the movie it worked and it worked it spades the film manages to use the destruction caused by the avengers to be the crux of why this guy is here and is willing to tear up the avengers    i also really didnt like the big giant title cards when they changed locations i thought it was really strange just have little words geez    anyway that is my review of this film i really enjoyed it i thought it worked in all cylinders
May 13 2016,negative,civil war was just baffling in its incompetence both as a film and as a service to comic book fans
May 13 2016,positive,captain america civil war has blowed me away action in the beginning to the end and with some humor one of best superhero movie so far marvel has once again done it again
May 13 2016,positive,and the best part of it all was thanos was nowhere in my after credit scenes
May 13 2016,positive,marvel does it again with another fun action movie thats not quite as good as the winter soldier but still a blast
May 13 2016,positive,much better than the last avengers movie
May 13 2016,positive,absolutely amazing the scarlet witch is officially my favorite character after watching best superhero movie ever made in my opinion
May 13 2016,negative,if it wasnt for the case my tickets were free i would feel i also wasted money it was excessive in length boring excessive use of shaky cam to the point of almost nausea inducing i would probably say it was acceptable for an at home movie but nothing more
May 13 2016,positive,superheroes movie how good can it be oh wait a minute this is the most awesome multi super heroes movie ever and easily among the best movies in my collection
May 13 2016,positive,awesome thought it wasnt gob to be good but end up being great movie  i loved it 
May 13 2016,neutral,most of the movie was good it dragged a bit and left some people confused until the end if they were really paying attention black panther was great i personally would have liked to see ironman whoop up on cap a little more he was holding back i suppose all in all a good movie
May 13 2016,positive,92  watched this on 13516  after a slow and long first half civil war gets into an actionpacked entertaining second half with a terrific finale the twists in the finale are good and much unlike most of the recent films in the series the action scenes are spectacular especially in the second half still the film cant boast the much necessary character development for all cast members as in age of ultron
May 13 2016,positive,captain america civil war is one of the best superhero films of all time the action sequences back story of the new characters and spiderman i mean man did they nail that character finally i also thought they made everyones motivations make sense as well which was something i thought batman v superman struggled with do not go see this on 3d though i think some of the sequences are too fast and 3d would just leave you lost
May 13 2016,negative,well well you crazy lovebirds all that nauseating nt hugging kissy kissy crap for an average flick no a below average flick i was so upset i walked out after an hour and a half of one of the worse movies ive seen in ten years probably it was the super high expectations i had but either way im done with the avengers wheres deadpool when you need him skip this ho hum movie highly unrecommended for this not one of the greatest movies of all time sic
May 13 2016,positive,amazing not dissapointed at all in anything great actors great plot just amazing
May 13 2016,positive,enjoyable popcorn flick but it was strange that with all the world ending drama of the last few flicks this one seemed smaller in scope still fun though
May 13 2016,negative,captain america is a selfish asshole who seems to get his way no matter how wrong and selfish his actions are for a superhero someone who is supposed to be a role model for those of impressionable minds all he has taught is turn against friends act recklessly and stubbornly refuse to compromise his supposed friendship with tony is shot to shit and he still gets the team despite how much he has already taken away from tony you know what started his unreasonable behavior a belief of his dead exgirlfriend whose niece he now occasionally hooks up with i personally hope to see captain america rot in hell and tony not fall into a depression due the lose of pepper his team and his guilt over roadys injury overall my love of captain america has gone from fan girl to non existent if i knew how to give no stars on this app i would words cannot describe my loathing at captain america right now i personally never want to see one ever again the only thing i liked about this movie was the inclusion of spiderman and ant man
May 13 2016,positive,a world traveling flick laced with a manipulative scheme to take down the avengers from within  the united nations is finally holding the superheroes accountable for all the collateral damage in their previous battles  they want to force the avengers to agree to the recommendations of the council in future endeavors  some heroes agree and others disagree  the story is augmented with a winter soldier friend of captain america who has done some bad deeds but is seeking help to overthrow the internal un manipulator  the lines get blurred as to who is right as both sides in the civil war make some valid point  my slight problem with this plot style is that the authors feel compelled to give each character their moment of sunshine making one character look strong and another weak at various times   somehow that just turns me off as i prefer the cohesive team unit it is also a bit cliche to me in that each side has an even number of players 6 and the surprise fighter in the form of spiderman and antman  that stated it is a nicely weaved tale with plenty of action giving the manipulator the chance to inject his will of vengeance by enraging one superhero to a point wanting revenge  and it is in allowing that anger to surface that shows perhaps the need to belong to un council after all
May 13 2016,positive,some parts had me sad and upset because i was emotionally invested but i love all things marvel cacivilwar marvelcomics superheros ahhh
May 13 2016,negative,heres what irritates me about this film  on the surface it seems to be a allegory for the conflict between forces of militarism and forces of diplomacy  in reality though the wars we fight arent fueled by a need to protect but rather by a need to control  this makes the film seem so out of touch with reality i mean it might as well be pure fantasy  there is no science to this fiction and the provoking themes  i have yet to encounter them      fortunately for the sensibilities of its viewers both sides are american and both sides are the good guys  when the trumpets sound we know were in store for a happy ending and we cant wait for the next war as long as the moral boundaries are clear we march on    nothing new here
May 13 2016,positive,a film that at its core speaks of what one is willing to keep and sacrifice to save his best friend even if it means hurting another friends feelings
May 13 2016,negative,another marvel rom com
May 13 2016,negative,weak story and script generic action big disappointment
May 13 2016,negative,the reviewer who called it a 90 minute plot stretched into 25 hours is dead on  and trying to tackle the complexities of global conflict with cartoon heroes man please
May 13 2016,positive,great action good story
May 13 2016,positive,good movie yes great movie no typical marvel movie not great but not bad at all
May 13 2016,positive,may 6 2016    captain america civil war could be the most balanced superhero movie to come along since spiderman 2 and thats saying a lot the film presents a strong mix of action humor drama and a surprisingly complex plot watching it we feel an extra sense of assurance because its clear the filmmakers have taken the material seriously and dont simply write it off as mindless superhero fodder not that any entry from the reigning marvel cinematic universe has ever succumbed to this notioneach has always been made with a certain level of care and quality even the silly ones like thor and antmanbut with civil war the efforts are at their highest    as good as the movie is titling it captain america civil war may be misleading while steve rogers aka captain america chris evans does play a big part in it christopher markus and stephen mcfeelys screenplay based on mark millars comics lends fairly equal measure to several key players including tony stark aka iron man robert downey jr natasha romanoff aka black widow scarlett johansson bucky barnes aka winter soldier sebastian stan wanda maximoff elizabeth olsen and newcomer tchalla aka black panther chadwick boseman there are also avengers regulars falcon anthony mackie war machine don cheadle hawkeye jeremy renner vision paul bettany and antman paul rudd plus we get a visit from our friendly neighborhood spiderman tom holland    there are a lot of characters here but somehow the directing team of anthony and joe russo manages to give each of them presence when theyre onscreen granted this is the twelfth marvel movie in eight years to feature at least some of these individuals so we already know them fairly well and are aware of their powers and histories but the film doesnt assume it shouldnt keep developing them beyond what we already know the avengers did this too but heres its even more effective probably because the drama and stakes of the plot have been raised     two main conflicts ensue in civil war with the first one focusing on whether an organization like the avengers should have the liberty to operate at will and whether the group is doing more harm than good following the devastation that took place in new york in the avengers washington dc in captain america the winter soldier sokovia in age of ultron and now the opening scene of civil war secretary of state thaddeus ross william hurt informs our heroes the united nations has prepared the sokovia accords to keep them in check rogers is against the idea and believes it would inhibit the avengers mission to effectively rid the world of evildoers but stark thinks its imperative in order to avoid any more catastrophes    it was refreshing to watch a superhero movie that actually considers the implications of the violence caused by the characters batman v superman did this to a degree but civil war is more creditable because the dialogue sounds like it might actually be spoken in a situation like this we get the sense civil war truly wants to raise the pros and cons and give the audience something to think about the reason i say this is because its not clear with whom we should side both rogers and stark make good points     at the conference where the accords are to be signed a bomb goes off that kills an african king and the suspect is barnes whos presently in hiding this ties in with the films second conflict with helmut zemo daniel brühl an exmilitary colonel from zokovia tracking down barnes old hydra master in order to learn the key words that trigger the winter soldiers brainwashing we suspect zemo wants to manipulate barnes and turn him into his own personal weapon as well as awaken the other winter soldiers who are currently in a cryogenic sleep    it would be easy to say zemo simply wants to use his new army to take over the world but that would be oversimplifying the plot theres a lot more to it than ive led on and one of the most appealing qualities of civil war or any good movie is the way it grows richer in character drama and complexity as it goes along despite it being a bigbudget summer blockbuster its not all about visual and aural sensation these are omnipresent as usual which is standard for the genre but they seem to take a backseat to the moral and political issues the film brings up its these dilemmas and the motivations of the characters that keep us on our toes and graduate the film beyond its typical category    all this isnt to say the movie isnt also a ton of fun and one we cant also enjoy as mindless summer escapism most of this comes courtesy of the movies stupendous action sequences including one that ends with captain america grabbing the end of a helicopter with one hand and holding onto the side of a building with the other however the most memorable is the battle between the opposing avengers factions on an airport tarmac iron man black widow war machine vision black panther and spiderman duke it out with captain america falcon wanda winter soldier and hawkeye and the fight becomes sort of a whos who among superheroes which each flaunt their powers and abilities while this scene and the rest of the movie probably goes on for too long its better to have too much of a good thing than anything lackluster    and captain america civil war certainly isnt lackluster its ambitious inventive and exciting it makes us think this franchise can go in all sorts of new and interesting directions a friend of mine texted me saying he had seen the movie a second time in as little as two days and let me know it held up and delivered even more during the latter viewing i can believe that too which is saying a lot about a superhero movie which tends to lose its flavor fairly quickly this could mean that civil war is destined to join superman the movie spiderman 2 and batman begins as one of the greats a genre picture that raises the bar and reminds us why so many of us adore the genre in the first place
May 13 2016,positive,absolutely brilliant film  loved it each character is there with a purpose and has a meaningful role zemo is a great villain and is up there with loki i do wish marvel bring him back for more in phase 4 this movie is probably the best script theyve done for tony starks character     definately a repeat viewing is in order for this
May 13 2016,positive,by far the best marvel movie yet for as good as winter soldier was this is even bigger and better
May 13 2016,positive,while it is optional to watch the previous marvel movies to understand what is going on civil war can easily be an entry point for those who do not care for superhero origin stories and are looking to be entertained but challenged about what is right and wrong from the action scenes to the character interactions civil war will keep you on your toes with every scene keeping you invested in these characters black panther and spiderman are highlights and zemo makes for a perfect villain
May 13 2016,positive,i feel this is the best avengers movie i liked winter soldier better but overall like this one better than all the avengers movies
May 13 2016,positive,spiderman stole the show with what little screen time he had as far as comic book movies go this movie ranks second only to guardians of the galaxy it was awesome
May 13 2016,positive,a fresh and unique direction to the often exhausting superhero genre that provides new depths and conflicts to its existing characters while introducing new ones with exciting potential the end result while occasionally imbalanced is a more mature and satisfying experience
May 13 2016,positive,great  i want to see it again
May 13 2016,positive,this is simply the greatest superhero film of all time this film is not only a superhero triumph but a film triumph in general led by an outstanding and enormous main cast this film is able to capture each hero at their best even if some dont receive much screen time the plot is gripping drifting away from previous cartoonish plots and becoming both mature and actionpacked the action sequences are some of the greatest i have ever seen the climactic airport battle possible being one of the best action sequences of all time the villain is incredible instead of utilizing a villain that only wants to rule the world they picked a psychological villain instead of one that used his staff or army of robots i cant say enough good things about this movie keep up the good work russo brothers youre work with marvel has been complete perfection so far
May 13 2016,positive,marvel churns out another great movie directors show why they were chosen to lead this franchise with infinity war great action with help from the team of john wick of course great acting from evans downey johansson and many others newcomers holland and boseman shine when you leave this movie you will want to see their solo movies now negatives include marvels continued mistreatment of their villains and some minor plot holes
May 13 2016,neutral,this movie is so formulaic  after watching it i am left wondering how could the critics have been so hard on batman vs superman and been so generous to this boring formulaic forgetful peace of nothing new
May 13 2016,positive,this movie is amazing from start to finish and i believe it is one of marvels best
May 13 2016,positive,surprised how much i enjoyed this good comedy and action wont spoil but the few cameos helped
May 13 2016,positive,went to see it was a great movie can hardly wait to see the next one
May 13 2016,positive,really good movie just not extremely fond of the ending
May 13 2016,positive,not bad but definitely the worst of the 3 captain america movies
May 13 2016,positive,great premise well executed good action the set up for the final fight was effectively done  spiderman was amazing in this movie best live action version of the character the most unique superhero in the marvel universe excited for spiderman homecoming next year  however the camera especially at the beginning action scenes would constantly jump cut  i get that it was to hide any errors of the fighting but seriously it was too much it was giving my dad a headache which is why i was glad that they used single shots near the end of the iron man v winter soldier and captain america fight  bucky seemed to be more prominent than the civil war based stuff  other than that it was a great movie and definitely a blockbuster that did more than just appeal to popcorn joes  excited for what marvel has planned for infinity war especially since the winter soldier and civil war directors the russo brothers are doing it
May 13 2016,positive,endless and meaningless show of fights i lost sight of the plot or any coherent purpose of why they are fighting   too long to leave an impression
May 13 2016,negative,not a good movie dont waste time or money
May 13 2016,positive,probably the best and most wellwritten marvel movie to date handles the introduction of two new heroes into the mcu well and is a billion times better than the source material
May 13 2016,positive,one of the slower yet better marvel movies
May 13 2016,positive,this movie was phenomenala must see if you are a marvel fan brought my daughter  we both really enjoyed it wasnt sure if they would be able to pull off using all the characters but they pulled it off without even a hiccup would give it 6 stars if i could go see the movie  enjoy
May 13 2016,positive,the greatest juggling act in the history of super hero films
May 13 2016,neutral,tony starks unyielding position on not breaking rules goes against his personality as the rule breaker and to be so adamant to want to fight his comrades was not believable fight scenes were good but that was about it the discord among the group seemed like a distraction and while they were all fighting each other you were waiting for it to be over and to get to the main point of the story which ended in more fighting each other to a pulp it was a big let down
May 13 2016,positive,darker than previous marvel movies but still awesome only drawback missed any of the previous marvel related movieyou will end up missing a huge chunk of the storylineso catch up before you head out to see it
May 13 2016,positive,bit of a slog far too long spiderman just checked in for the heck of it enjoyed cap  antman and black panther didnt find the villiain very interesting at all step down from winter soldier
May 13 2016,positive,aka avengers 25 aka iron man 4 either way i regard this as one of the top marvel movies behind winter soldier and guardians of the galaxy it gets its characters motivations and theme correct some action scenes can be a bit cheesy but in a fun way go see this
May 13 2016,negative,dissatisfied on movie to many
May 13 2016,positive,vengeance thats it its the whole story but its still a great movie
May 13 2016,positive,check out my review on my website 
May 13 2016,positive,better than the average marvel movie but quite frankly its the same recipe the ingredients are just mixed in a different order
May 13 2016,negative,i hated it preferred the two previous avengers movies though they didnt compare with guardians dark knight or deadpool  cant recommend it
May 13 2016,positive,the avengers 3 uh i mean captain america 3 was pretty good
May 13 2016,positive,captain america is a thrilling action movie with a surprisingly complex and interesting story we see all the avengers and a couple of newcomers having to choose between free but illegal super hero or supervised but legal super hero this creates a rift between them and results in some amazingly spectacular fights slowly it becomes clear a plot twist is in the making and at the end it delivers the action and cgi are great but not really that special anymore because we have all seen countless marvel universe movies so it begins to wear out a little but nonetheless a great movie definitely worth watching but all credit goes out to the surprising story that is for once not about saving the world lets hope the next marvel movies can keep this good thing going cause there will probably be a lot of them
May 13 2016,positive,simply the film that dawn of justice should have been
May 13 2016,positive,excellent movie awesome action scenes and acting the airport battle was probably the best battle scene ive seen spiderman and antman really stole the show awesome
May 13 2016,positive,nobody wanted to love this movie more than me and its an unenviable position being a huge marvel fan and having to admit that i didnt really care for this movie  my list of grievances is long but the main takeaway is that while this was a fine movie in its own right it isnt civil war  there are barely any similarities to the comic event which can be considered either devastating or fantastic depending how you felt about it  i feel most people watching this wont have read the comics and thus wont care about how it stacks up against them and for those people this will be a great movie because they had no real expectations about the movies content in relation to the source material  those of us who did read the comics and liked them i suspect will be pretty disappointed across the board  now for my specific gripes spoilers will most likely result  i realize this is captain americas movie and a winter soldier sequel in specific i loved winter soldier but it felt like most of the other characters didnt really need to be there or didnt do enough to justify showing up  it felt a lot like expendables for me in this regard  big hype with a dream lineup of heavy hitters on board then half of them dont end up doing anything  my beloved vision spent half of his screen time rocking a sweater vest trying to keep scarlet witch under house arrest then when he finally got some action screen time all he accomplished was tking a teammate  agent 13 and crossbones didnt need to be in this movie at all since they did nothing of value  and were actually detrimental in a couple ways  crossbones was completely wasted since he was only in 1 unnecessary scene see my gripe on the catalyst event later and theyve apparently killed him off  agent 13 did nothing but steal one of caps most famous speeches and wasted it in another screen time hogging scene that didnt need to be including and added nothing  crossbones and agent 13 didnt need to be in the movie to begin with aside from potentially deliberate misdirection since the assassination of cap plot and the confession werent included  the catalyst event for registration was stupid 10 dignitaries getting blown up  that sort of thing happens all the time irl  in the comics it was 600 children getting vaporized which was way better justification  why not use hulkiron man in aou trashing half of a city would have made way more sense and eaten up a lot less time getting to the good stuff  baron zemo was super lame as the big bad puppeteer though i suppose theyre building him up for future use  the scene with iron man analyzing caps fighting style was botched and defeated its own purpose  both post credit scenes were dumb i was especially disappointed by the stan lee cameo in this one  the list of gripes goes on and on  all that being said the action scenes were great if too few and far between  ant man and spiderman stole the show in my opinion for what little time they were around  in conclusion id give it 3 stars which i consider generous for how little i enjoyed it overall  great movie in its own right but they should have called it something else and dropped the pretension to it being civil war  unavoidable comparisons to the supposed source material ruined this one for me
May 13 2016,negative,sucks boring dumb disney wack
May 13 2016,positive,the latest mission by the superheroes on the avengers results in the deaths of numerous civilians and a diplomatic nightmare with the african nation of wakanda a new set of regulations ratified by 118 countries seeks to put superheroes under tighter review and scrutiny but only half of the avengers want to comply captain america chris evans opposes the measure and finds himself an outlaw once a bitter terrorist uses this controversy to frame caps brainwashed friend sebastian stan for the assassination of wakandas king captain america civil war has the sly banter and the impressive set pieces that are now expected of marvel movies but it also has some strong character moments that the cast sells with utter conviction popcorn blockbusters dont usually have this much depth in them
May 13 2016,positive,everyone loved it it was pretty cool a lot of filler between action scenes
May 13 2016,positive,amazing as usually marvel did it again this movie is long but you cant even tell you been sitting for almost three hours because its so good
May 13 2016,positive,captain america civil war is not only the best captain america movie ever but it is also the best in the marvel cinematic universe the performances of the cast were incredible they understand whats currently going on with their characters and they know its a pretty dark time for them the action scenes were spectacular it kept my eyes glued to the screen everyone was beating the crap out of each other my favorite action scene of the movie was the airport battle thats where the war truly begins the way they handled the tone of the movie was so amazing i also loved the new characters that we are introduced to like spiderman and black panther speaking of spiderman he stole the show  he was so funny and i couldnt get enough of him tom holland truly knows who our favorite web crawler is like i thought that black panther was a badass and his action scenes were freakin amazing spiderman and black panther overall were the best characters in the movie its the superhero movie that we needed i look forward to seeing this movie again so what are you waiting for go see captain america civil war you will have a fun time at the theaters    score1010
May 13 2016,positive,it was everything bvs wasnt bravo
May 13 2016,positive,sensational movie definitely a must see
May 13 2016,positive,one of the best movies of the year  it made my day
May 13 2016,positive,amazing great pacing plot driven by characters and action to knock your socks off cant wait to watch it again tier 1 movie all the way dows
May 13 2016,positive,best superhero movie so far
May 13 2016,positive,nerdgasmmmmmmmmm and marisa tomei on the sidelines
May 13 2016,negative,as much i loved the first comic book adaptations from marvel as gets the latest movies the most mediocre ones ok the original stories are interesting but when there are as many characters as in civil war its getting really crowded black panther is really cool but we dont know anything about him how can he run fast like that where he keep his suit as he transformed into an avenger in berlin and there are many more characters they not doing anything only appears in the movie its sometimes like a tv show with avengers sometimes there are too many happening and there is no focus on anything the action sequences look good but there are too many of it and there is no real highlight of the movie ok maybe the airport scene but you know that nobody will hurt anybody because they are not true enemies thatswhy civil war is lacking suspense and tension there is no real plot twist or it served poorly the reason the avengers split to two opponent is a bit strange and they dont do anything with this political issue they tried to build up for an hour civil war is for 12 years old who dont need plot only pointless fights with each other because thats cool for me as a 31 year old male its not if there is no real tension or real drama no matter how awesome a fight is but the cgi is not perfect either
May 13 2016,positive,by and large everything a big superhero movie should be a smart mature characterdriven action blockbuster thats willing to go dark and serious with an understanding that there is very much still a place of enjoyment to be found in a cinematic universe where anything is possible
May 13 2016,positive,the marvel cinematic universe ramps up another mega hit with the best of their captain america solo outings its very sharp versatile fast paced action packed and incredibly thoughtfully realized film yet though its scope and spectacle doesnt stand out as much as both avengers movies made up til date what really makes the film is the well written and performed by a colourful cast of characters both old and new particularly black panther and spiderman being the big new standouts apart from the other well established characters the scripting is also fantastic incredibly well plotted and polished to a brim viewers really do get inside the minds of these characters and understand their motivations and ideologies when dealing with the consequential nature of their actions throughout all the films theres also some sense of maturity coming along to the franchise at this point as the thoughtful nature of this film feels more like a crime flick that involves superheroes rather than your overzealous used superhero trope associated with hollywood comic book tent pole films nonetheless civil war is a one of a kind film and must be experienced on the big screen
May 13 2016,positive,love it great action movie a must see movie highly recommended
May 13 2016,positive,continues with the intelligence and maturity that set captain america 2 apart from the rest of marvel studios fare and improves on its choreography as well the problems suffered by avengers 2 are all but nonexistent here and new characters are introduced with ease and in a way that feels natural to plot development regardless of which direction marvel takes in the future this film will be remembered as one of their best
May 13 2016,positive,this is the best action movie of 2010s it was greats
May 12 2016,positive,i just came back from watching civil war just to say i was blown away by the plot progression and character buildup even though i was a supporter of team cap the movie showed two sides of the avengers once that was supporting the accords and the other wanting their own free will the only downside to this installment in the marvel cinematic universe is the introduction of to many characters in the movie it was alright to introduce black panther and spiderman into civil war because it sets them up for their standalone movies but i felt that hawkeye appearing in civil war was only a way to give him more screen time overall not bad for a superhero film exceeds my expectations i give it a
May 12 2016,positive,this film felt too lacking even with how long it is i left the theater wanting more more death more side marvel hero attention and above all more of everyone fighting but the movie still was good which is saying a lot because the captain america movies suck i wouldnt go to see it twice though just because its too much of a setup movie much like batman v superman only a million times better
May 12 2016,positive,best captain america movie
May 12 2016,positive,when i see a film like this one i dont expect to experience the next citizen kane i just wanted to have a blast at the movie and enjoy an entertaining film  captain america civil war did something rarely any comic book movies do  it took our expectations and transcended them with a pristinely directed and crafted wonderfully acted and dramatically toned film with some incredible action sequences and awesome character introductions it was everything the audience wanted it to be and more and for that i give major props to this flick
May 12 2016,positive,the best of any of the marvel movies great twists to keep you guessing im going to see it again
May 12 2016,positive,to be honest i am rounding up significantly because i really did not want to see this movie i was taken by a family member who wanted to see the movie  and ended up being the one who paid  for imax  i am not in this movies wheelhouse  i am not a marvelacolyte looking to squee over unneeded characters squeezed into the movie for a bloated fight scene whose bright jokefilled tone seemed in jarring contrast to the more somber tone the rest of the movie seemed to be going for  hey parker i know youre technically a minor and since you didnt sign the accords either youre not technically supposed to be here but wanna go put your life on the line against trained killers  you can fight hawkeye who has a wife kids a pair of unused waterskis and no reason whatsoever to back cap over iron man  and antman youre here too apparently for some reason  i found the cgi cartoonish  the contrivance of tony stark putting together a giant multimedia floorshow school play about one of the most painful experiences in his life for a roomful of strangers hung my suspension of disbelief out to dry although the likeness of young downey was rather spectacular  when it all came echoing back because his beloved parents were actually killed  transporting superwintersoldierserum in their trunk which everybody seemed to have known about it in advance of the reveal except those directly impacted by the event i think i sprained a muscle rolling my eyes  the black panthers suit looked ridiculous especially when he popped out his little kitten claws  in the end we again had another completely lame duck villain this time who seemed to want to avenge his family by instigating a slap fight between those he blamed for their deaths despite claiming the country in which they lived and died had been doomed long before the avengers came to town and he needed to go to that bunker and shoot the winter solder squadron because reasons  would have been too interesting to see them actually fight at some point in the future maybe  there is no true loss or consequences in the end rhodey suffered an unbroken freefall from the sky and is probably dead well paralyzed okay he fell once because he wasnt paying attention and then walked away making jokes about a courier mispronouncing tonys last name  meanwhile bucky is frozen again and the avengers are split up again  only this time theyre shuffled differently so we have the secret avengers instead of the new avengers  vision wears a cape that looks like greataunt irmas thrift store brocade curtains  wanda is sorry for hurting him because the comics say they must be in love but makes no mention of missing her dead brother  cap is now in love with a different blonder agent carter since the other one died and the comics say that they are  and scene  the end cut  print same old same old disneymarvel movie
May 12 2016,positive,ill start out by saying the story is great dealing with the backlash of saving millions but killing many in the process as well divides the team up on what they should do regarding the sakovia accords everyone did an amazing from chris evans to the most miniscule characters awesome for me black panther antman and spiderman stole the show 2 scenes particularly with antman that are iconic in comics tom holland is just the perfect peter parker the perfect blend of kid genius and witty comeback kid chadwick boseman as tchalla was just lights out amazing what is holding me back from giving it a perfect score is their usage of one of my favorite cap america villains crossbones they could have done so much more with him and they didnt that left me pretty disappointed otherwise stellar
May 12 2016,positive,yup this is as good as a superhero movie can be not only is there terrific action but theres also a great storyline and good character development i thought the graphic novels story was terrible so i was a little apprehensive about this but marvel came through
May 12 2016,positive,the plot was a little silly and seemed like something conjured up by a saturday morning cartoon villain still chop off 30 minutes of nonsense and it would have been a much better film
May 12 2016,positive,well made superhero movie but ending as always fairly predictable the movie settled for happy ending rather than darker ending similar to the well written original books its obvious producers are thinking of sequels down the road and not artistic achievement  i myself am getting tire of these predictable and formula  movies
May 12 2016,positive,a must see funny action pact movie of the month
May 12 2016,positive,probably the best superhero film to date
May 12 2016,positive,what i expected but nothing morefelt alittle long tho
May 12 2016,positive,what an entertaining movie although not technically an avengers film this is a film that is several marvel movies in the making while not a direct adaptation of its comic book counterpart ca civil war provides one hell of a ride the movie is filled with not only fantastic action but also great character moments including the introduction of two new characters spiderman and black panther although new characters are introduced and the film does have a few different storylines the incredible directing of the russo brothers manages to keep it all in check never once did i feel that one storyline overshadowed another or that a character felt shoehorned into the movie in the end the movie could have done a little better with adding more consequences but ultimately it never takes away from the film or the enjoyment i had watching it was a thrilling way to cap off pun intended the captain america franchise see the film immediately hell see it twice
May 12 2016,positive,fantastic action packed entertaining
May 12 2016,positive,marvel knocks it out of the park once again in this third captain america film that feels more like an avengers film minus a few key members thor and hulk the stakes arent as high as you may like and some of the fights feel more like a scrimmage but the final 2530 minutes alone are masterful robert downey jr may be the showstealer here even though this is technically caps movie the new additions in black panther chadwick boseman and the best spiderman weve had yet tom holland work really well with the guys weve seen in previous films they do a good job in walking the line between iron man and captain americas opinion in the way that you dont really know who is in the right here its not until the end that you realize who was right this really isnt a setup movie for more to come but instead it leaves you wanting more in a good way anticipating the next movie
May 12 2016,positive,captain america civil war review superhero perfection    captain fucking america      they managed to take a captain america movie and not only make it the best marvel movie ever but hands down the most perfect emotional and visually stunning superhero movie to date    before i go in to the nitty gritty shit i will be avoiding any correlation to batman v superman because in all honesty marvel in general are on a completely different level than bvs    lets start with no spoilers    this movie not only did justice to captain america himself but was able to give every single character an arc and service each and everyone of their stories and character moments    the movies writing was top notch well balanced and deeply moving but also had heart  i think writers christopher markus and stephen mcfeely deserve so much credit for taking all of these moving parts characters story beats humour seriousness and telling a thought provoking and engaging next chapter in the mcu they bloody killed it on the writers floor    joe and anthony russo directors of winter soldier and the future infinity war twoparter absolutely nailed this one too they brought everything that worked in winter soldier and took it to the next fucking level these two beautiful men were able to capture the essence of this politcal struggle on such a personal level that no other superhero director has been able to do before no not even chris nolans batman trilogy there are literally a ton of moments in the theatre where im like holy fuck these guys seriously need to be put in check they nailed such a distinct tone and self awareness that i dont think any superhero film or even action film in general has ever been able to do this makes me that more pumped to see them take on a space epic like avengers infinity war    with that said this story couldnt have done it with the amazing cast it is so hard to choose a leading contender i would say the highlight goes to robert downey jr chris evans chadwick boseman and tom holland any scene they were in had me deeply captivated by their sheer emotion and vigour rdj  boseman as well as heart and humour evans  holland respectively i found myself on team iron man when the movie started but ended up on team no one because of how well each actor delivered the weight and depth of their character i found myself deeply moved by tony stark in this movie usually i found his ego funny and bothersome at times but in this movie there were times i literally wanted to fucking bawl my eyes out for what this man was going through he is seriously a fucking mess and robert downey jr absolutely slays tony stark in this state    the action is beyond bloody perfect no doubt the best action i have ever seen in cinema history i would go as far as saying some of the coolest fucking shit i have ever seen in my entire life    so that is my extreme spoiler free section now ill go point form as to all the details that really stood out to me and made this such a fucking beautiful piece of superhero cinema if you havent seen the movie close this page and comeback when you have    spoilers alert   the opening fight scene with the new avengers is so dope it has that exciting action energy we got in the opening of cap 2 this opening sequence however was a lot more badass and definitely set the bar for the rest of the movie    i love how the scarlet witch was centre stage in this movie she causes a massive fatality in lagos by throwing a bomb holding crossbones that was about to kill cap into a building she is such an integral part in the spark of the civil war    seeing what tony has been up to since the end of aou was neat that simulation of him when he was in his 20s was so cool    tony had so many good emotional beats anytime he got emotional i got misty eyed man you could tell he felt so guilty about all of the collateral damage and that the sokovia accords were the only way he felt he could atone    i fucking ate up all of the scenes where the avengers were sitting around a discussing the accords i think this cast plays well off each other it is such a treat to watch the accords intervene in their relationship and cause some tension    vision dressed like a boss    vision and wanda kitchen scene was an awesome fucking treat i love their dynamic and think it is such an interesting relationship that is tested once the fighting starts    black fucking panther not just that but tchalla is such an amazing character to watch on screen anytime chadwick boseman is on screen i get more captivated and enticed by stellar genuine and emotional acting as for black panther damn is he tearing shit up like a total g that chase scene literally had me holding my breath    i was so interested in the scenes with zemo and the winter soldier flashbacks it felt like a mystery was brewing and i just wanted to know how this all tied in it was perfectly paced and sprinkled into the movie    watching cap decide to not sign the accords was so hard to watch in the best way possible i was sitting in my seat wanting all the avengers to sign and get a long but i knew that wouldnt happen its civil fucking war man to see tony want cap to sign so badly and to see steve just on the total opposite side looking out for bucky and wandas interest made such an organic rift between them    talking about being organic i thought each character was truly organic when it came to their development no character said something they would never say and each of them reacted to the sokovia accords the way they should it was so awesome to see such a realistic approach to this storyline and that each character was serviced with such love and care    peggy carter funeral was emotional as fuck    sharon carter and caps kissfinally    the typical bro nods from bucky and sam was priceless    the humour in general in this movie was fucking top notch i felt like it was not forced and too in your face like age of ultron the russos and the writers did such a good job of making sure the humour never overshadowed the seriousness of the situation characters made jokes as the situation allowed them    the minute scott lang came on screen and fanboyed over everyone was amazing i love paul rudd in this role and he adds such an awesome humour to the team    i absolutely loved when vision had wanda imprisoned and hawkeye came to save her when wanda used her powers to force vision into the ground damn was that such a powerful scene    peter parker spiderman queens tony stark visiting sexy aunt may peter and tony talk spidersuit webs no backstory tom holland killing it with the awkwardness he is being recruited spiderman ties up cap spiderman interacts with everyone kicks falcon  winter soldiers ass battles giantman empire strikes back reference cap and spiderman fight spiderman quipps spiderman is fucking everything    honestly spiderman needs another point they absolutely created the definitive onscreen spiderman holland is perfect the tone is perfect his involvement in the big fight scene is fucking creamy as shit i love everything about him kevin feige is a god for making this happen im super stoked for spiderman homecoming    this brings us to the big airport scene that scene was probably the greatest thing i have ever put my eyes onto best action scene ever it was so perfect the music was on point every character got their moment to shine i literally cant believe a scene like that was put on screen the best part about it is that this action scene is not just a static fight placed in the movie it is a scene that drives the plot forward everything the russo brothers do in this movie is never meaningless it is all for the storys sake i also loved that after 12 movies of development this amazing scene was so well earned every single character had a reason and burning motivation to be in this fight they werent fighting for the sake of it i have never seen any writer or director craft such a beautiful sequence that was so badass to watch yet had so much heart    giantmanholy fuck giantman    rhodes emotional crash to the ground i thought is more emotional that he was paralyzed then actually died    i like how it was visions fault vision had such powerful development in this movie he is struggling with his feelings he never knew he could have    i like how black widow let cap and bucky escape by fending off black panther usually im not a huge fan of black widow but she killed it in this movie i liked her dynamic with the black panther     cap  bucky scout out zemo    tony decides to go rogue and help cap  bucky when he realizes bucky was set up the whole time    seeing team cap in jail was hard i loved when clint told off tony that was definitely hawkeyes crowning moment in the entire mcu    it was so relieving to see tony and cap get a long for such a short period of time     it finally pays off to see zemos scheme the whole time and his motivation it was refreshing that he had some major development as a villain    the winter soldier killing tonys parents reveal was fucking stellar just when you think this movie cant pull out any more tricks they throw in this twist    the reveal was apart of zemos entire plan to get the two avengers leaders to rip each other apart this fight was so fucking emotional you could see iron man who just didnt even care anymore cap was trying his hardest to defend bucky because he knew tony would kill him this kind of emotion mixed in with an epic fight scene made for such an awesome climax it was perfect right until the moment cap puts his shield into tonys chest reactor    when tony tells him the shield does not belong to himdamn that was some emotional stuff robert downey jr got some really gut wrenching lines my stomach dropped when he said i dont care he killed my mom fuck    black panther preventing zemo from killing himself was such a poetic moment its so epic that tchalla would rather him stay alive and suffer then be dead and freed good writing    stan lee cameo awesome as always    cap trying to make amends with tony through a letter and giving him the option to reach out to his team was cool you can tell that tony is still unsure and that the events that transpired in this movie really impacted the avengers and their relationships with each other    the two after credits scene were great seeing black panther and spidermans story being teased even more was such a great way to end off this amazing motion picture    as a side note i thought the style in the movie was so awesome the full screen typography when introducing a location just added such a stylistic touch the cinematography was unparallel to any marvel movie ive ever seen    verdict    captain america civil war really hit home the action the humour the story the characters the stakes and the emotion was pitch perfect the additions of spiderman and black panther made this movie even more stellar not only does this work as an entry to the larger mcu but as a movie in general this is easily the best mcu movie to date and arguably the best superhero movie there is    1010
May 12 2016,positive,with effective depth and entertaining action sequences captain america civil war is another exciting chapter into both the captain america franchise and the entire marvel cinematic universe    b
May 12 2016,positive,this one of those films that youre sitting after it finishes and wondering this doesnt have wall to wall actiontheres too much talkingshouldnt i hate it  then i remember this is captain america and the russo brothers and wish we could clone them so they could do almost every marvel film     like winter soldier they have the right mix of action humor and drama i should be disappointed on how they portray zemohes not flashy hes not a raging egomaniac i kept expecting this til the very end of the film yet i wasnt angry when it didnt happen much like redfords character in winter soldier hes alot more cerebral than your typical comic book villain     now that feige has full control on the direction of the marvel cinematic universe im really curious on the new directors for thor dr strange and black panther and i have no doubt that the russo brothers will handle the infinity war just fine
May 12 2016,negative,same formula from all the marvel movies do something different marvel
May 12 2016,positive,it was a 3 hour trailer for the next 10 marvel movies
May 12 2016,positive,had the potential to say so much more
May 12 2016,positive,like all movies civil war has its flaws however the editing and flow of the film were both very strong  the standouts of the film were antman black panther and yes   even spidey was an added bonus to the third installment into the captain america franchise  i look forward to seeing where the mcu goes after this wild and exciting roller coaster of a film
May 12 2016,positive,the russo brothers have once again proven to be capable of making an incredibly entertaining comic book film despite not having the rights to certain important characters the fantastic four in particular
May 12 2016,positive,wonderful and exciting
May 12 2016,positive,it turned out to be more than watching marvel mastur well lets call it self gratify after all this is a public site onscreen more on urbanrhetoricblog by far the highlight of this movie is the newly anticipated stand alone black panther film chadwick boseman who has played jackie robinson in 42 james brown in get on up and thurgood marshall in the upcoming biopic marshall was excellent as black panther from what i remember about the black panther character he was a real bad ass  he had toys like tony stark and the finances to match he had skills like captain america but he wasnt genetically enhanced hes just naturally superior more on urbanrhetoricblog
May 12 2016,neutral,honestly not as boring as the 2 avengers but an out of time spider man is not enough to build up a sensational movie
May 12 2016,positive,best yet in the captain america franchise
May 12 2016,positive,great movie with lots of action used all the characters in it very well
May 12 2016,negative,this is not a horrible flick but it is at times a snooze fest dont take your kids to see civil war theyll drive you crazy with their whining and when is it over mom
May 12 2016,positive,simply amazing just when you thought marvel couldnt do better they raise the bar yet again
May 12 2016,positive,amazing film disney does it again and blows out the dcucks someone put warner bros on suicide watch
May 12 2016,positive,well first of all the movie wasnt called cw the name is bucky war personally i liked the movie but not enough like the winter soldier it was like playground and hiding the reason for the war was nothing only bucky a bromance war  about captain america clearing the name of his bestfriend just boring anyway the things that i loved was spidey black panther black widow scarlet witch they was amazing the end lso was very good  i see for a first time an angry emotional tny stark i really wanted to kick ass of captain america or bucky they were assholes also tony stark was asshole but that men both was much assholes so the conclusion from myreview about cw is that cw is very overrated film not  great film i hope on infinite wars to not bethanos like ultron or zemo
May 12 2016,positive,so much fun i love the acting action story charactersjust top notch film making here
May 12 2016,negative,i understand fans going gaga googoo over this latest avengers movie because they love the characters but i believe its worse then the last one it was lacking something maybe it was just some of the same old stuff  the oneliners kept taking me out of the moment and the fighting style was the same with all of the characters and the cgi was pretty bad it was kinda disappointing its doing great at the box office so i guess its all good i cant recommend civil war though so its a no for me
May 12 2016,positive,some of the fight scenes are awesome and one is the best ever in a marvel film but there is a very long boring build up before you even get to a fight and the parts in between fights are for the most part lacking any tension or drama weak convoluted plot that doesnt pay off the direction is very drab like most marvel films seem to be these days
May 12 2016,positive,great movie i would watch it again
May 12 2016,positive,i loved captain america cvil war because its a movie that complety obliterates the opinion i had about this movies that sequels in thse movie are totally bad in all marvel movies i only liked  the singular one like antman and guardians of ggalaxy and the new spider man ones and the last of x men this movie proves that we can still enjoy a good blockbuster with a serious tone besides the ridiculous title captain america civil war has great action including the best action scene i saw in hero movies a good plot good humor a good smart vilian and opens the door to more movies like these looking forward for the next chapter civil war his by far the best movie with thse two charaters  the cap and iron man recoommended indeed  forget the 3d doesnt gives nothig new
May 12 2016,positive,this is the latest installment of the marveldisney franchise the script is well written and allows the movie to keep the audience engaged as it twists and turns and you slowly see all the dots connect this is all done while you experience yet further character development that builds off the last couple movies as usual youll see further marvel characters introduced into the plot and of course there are the spectacular action scenes spoiler alert it doesnt have the same level of action of previous movies but youre not likely to care
May 12 2016,positive,just simply awesome
May 12 2016,positive,a very good third movie for the captain america series
May 12 2016,positive,amazing its full of action has great characters and can be funny at the same time have a good dramatic weight
May 12 2016,positive,the best marvel movie i have seen yet
May 12 2016,positive,spoilers ahoy i did not have a lot of hope for this movie im beginning to get a bit jaded by super hero films well not just beginning but this film was quite a bit better than the usual fare frankly im getting bored of hearing about some really powerful thing that some really buy guy always guy wants and how the good guys are going to stop him and if not the world will essentially die so it was great in this movie that the fate of the world didnt hang at all in the balance it was also nice to see a superhero movie with a fight between people who didnt have the exact same powers worst offenders for this were antman and deadpool    i have a few gripes but nothing major my main gripe is that the conflict seems a little forced i mean okay iron man meets a woman pissed off at the events in sokovia but does that mean you end up firing lethal weaponry at your friends even if you know your friends might be a bit less vulnerable to them seems unlikely the avengers would actually go to war over this     but overall i enjoyed it and was genuinely surprised when we saw the other winter soldiers and what had happened generally good stuff
May 12 2016,negative,too too too much love
May 12 2016,positive,top notch and gonna be hard to beat
May 12 2016,positive,cant wait to see this one  superhero movies are the best test review for fb
May 12 2016,positive,incredible movie with a compelling storyline
May 12 2016,positive,so when they promised us superheroes fighting one another over some differencesi was ecstatic i am not really a huge fan of superhero movies i tend to watch only for the villains however this movie had me rooting for the heroes well the less annoying ones i found the film very entertaining the action sequences were there even though i dont care for the whole shaky camera work especially in 3d dizzy party i was still in awe of the stunt work i loved the infamous airport scene and every character every hero fit perfectly into place there the humor is there the action the story slight flaws but i was invested it was the onecan i say avengers film the one movie where it had a serious tone it didnt feel cartoonish or animated and it felt like the real deal with how things were settled and how actions have dire circumstances yes i did find the whole bromance annoying maybe captain america has a secret love interest in bucky cause no way was all this worth it right i think for him it was more than just the government taking over it was his love for a friend and at that point it had me back and forth between the annoying team of ironman and the stubborn team of cap now for the main villain i am soo glad they didnt give him a gimmick or some lame costume he did what most villains have failed to do and i hope they continue with his character i needed a little better backstory but still just nitpicking here with the villain well im sure yall seen it already and have read 100s of reviews already so this was just me dipping into the pool
May 12 2016,positive,captain america civil war  initial reaction who is north and who is south    main characters  captain americasteve rogers iron mantony stark two of the heroes of the marvel universe  they are played by chris evans and robert downey jr    plot summary  when an attack on foreign soil goes wrong its just another example of how destructive super hero fights can become  along with massive destruction in new york city as in the first avengers film washington dc captain america winter soldier and a foreign land avengers age of ultron its clear citizens are scared of superheroes because theres nobody to hold them accountable for their actions  so when a new law is brought up the avengers are split on if they want to sign up  leading the pro group is iron man and leading the other side is captain america  however the rift between the two sides grows as more violent acts occur all over the world  and the questions arise about a bombing at a un building  just who is responsible for that    scoring  main characters  these two a great as the two leaders who butt heads against one another  they maybe friends but that friendship may not last very long  score 10    supporting cast  the other heroes of the film are great because each one brings about something new and different  a new viewpoint of the world or just some levity something batman vs superman needed in the worst way  score 9    plot  the film sometimes drags on because new law has to be explained in great detail  but the action sequences more than make up for this  theres one fifteen to twenty minute sequence at an airport thats the best ive seen in a long time  if ever  score 9    originality  sure this film feels like another avengers film but this one deals with more divisive issues  and it makes the heroes more well rounded and human than most other nonmarvel superhero films  score 8    violence factor  this film has great fights between the heroes but it does take the time to show what could go wrong when theres massive amount of destruction due to those superhero fights something thats rarely addressed in these types of films  score 9    other moral issues  this film does a great job of bringing forth a controversial subject  and providing both sides of the issue  theres no easy fix  or easy way out of this mess  score 9    final score out of 60 54 score 90  marvel the pixar of action flicks  by that i mean they almost always make great action movies im intentionally ignoring the last fantastic four film
May 12 2016,negative,to long and over rated kiddie crap  ant man and spiderman  really  bat v sup  dawn of justice better and more for adults
May 12 2016,positive,probably the best marvel movie to date
May 12 2016,positive,a little long but nonetheless an amazing movie with enough action and a great storyline and also scarlett johansson 
May 12 2016,positive,obviously the films a lot of fun  its a nice cap pun intended to the trilogy in that it combines some of the heart of the first in this case the pain of a rift between friends with the brains of the second here the moral quandary of power and governance  downey delivers as usual and the members of the supporting cast shine unexpectedly especially the new spiderman that i wanted to keep at arms length yet won me over in capturing the childlike wonder and awkwardness that has made peter parker so enduring but i found evans rodgers who is supposed to be the principle character unconvincing and emotionally onedimensional
May 12 2016,positive,marvels apology for whedons atrocious age of ultron and their best movie to date
May 12 2016,positive,looking forward to the next one
May 12 2016,positive,intrigue like no other marvel film  some of the best 3d ever storyline is twisting like a tornado together these make the film a must see
May 12 2016,positive,loved the set up and pay offs from the beginning scenes or previous movies the jokes made me laugh it was a fun movie but also hit the mark on the emotional parts i like that this villain wasnt just crazy there was a reason for what he did
May 12 2016,positive,fast paced and entertaining comicbook action a perfect entry in the mcu
May 12 2016,negative,i am a big tom hanks fan but found this movie to be very disappointing the movie seemed to drag on and then they did a hurryup ending which left you wonderingwhat was the point
May 12 2016,positive,great movie action meets great writing
May 12 2016,positive,decent dialogue with overthetop action makes for a good super hero movie elements of the story were questionable and the inclusion of spiderman seemed out of place
May 12 2016,negative,same ole same ole weak story i guess if you like the same old tired fight scenes then this movie is for you i was bored out of my mind
May 12 2016,positive,way better than batman v superman not as good as winter soldier imo but still a decent marvel movie that im looking fward to owning
May 12 2016,positive,ambitious but rewarding and entertaining as well as smart and engaging captain america civil war is an unforgettably spectacular cinematic bonanza that is as epic as it is emotionally and narratively sublime
May 12 2016,negative,bad guys win government oversight is good cap ends up a criminal on the run very disappointing movie to me i am a loyal comic book geek and love all super hero movies but with all the unlikely plot lines i would not rate this one highly
May 12 2016,negative,i guess im the only one that was somewhat bored with this movie we kept jumping cities and they made spiderman a child genius into an idiot kid only two scenes jump out in y mind the airport and the final fight otherwise i will forget the whole thing in another hour
May 12 2016,positive,like all marvel movies they hit it spot on again its funny with a lot of action and good story 
May 12 2016,positive,the captain america marvel movies just seem to get better and better this installment has almost every one of the avengers except for thor and the hulk all the actors give marvelous performances reprising their superhero roles but its chris evansamerica and robert downey jriron man who hold the film together as they argue and fight over who is right and who is wrong even though its team captain america vs team iron man this film has one of the most entertaining fight scenes in movies ive ever seen particularly scenes with tom hollandspiderman and paul ruddantman these two give hilarious performances during their fight scenes that just cracks you up the film story line is well written but its also very dark it hurts when you see best friends fight each other but theyll get through it overall i believe  this one of the best marvel movies ever made be sure to sit through the credits cause theres two endings to the film you should watch this is the summer blockbuster movie of 2016 my grade93a
May 12 2016,positive,it was ok but probably my least favorite avengers movie slow start lots going on hard to follow some humor
May 12 2016,negative,yes i did it i actually laughed twice i was also amazed by the motorcycle chase trick and the iron man movie magic when you have iron man robert downey jr captain america chris evans black widow scarlett johansson war machine don cheadle falcon anthony mackie bucky barnes sebastian stan black panther chadwick boseman antman paul rudd spiderman tom holland vision paul bettany hawkeye jeremy renner scarlet witch elizabeth olsen each with a super power you know there will be a lot of battles and there are each given a chance to show off their specialty    there are so many superheroes that mere human beings like maria tomei has nothing more than a cameo while john slattery alfre woodard and hope davis get a few minutes more and emily vancamp might even have 10 minutes on screen total with oscar winner william hurt actually seems to be a major character in the movie bit that may only be because he is part of the reason there is a civil war with the superheroes divided into opposing camps    between the heroes and oh yes a few villains plus the huge cast the fights chases buildings tumbling glass shattering special effects it is no wonder the film takes 2 hours and 30 minutes    to me the standouts were robert downey jr who can do no wrong on film chadwick boseman making a great impression and anthony mackie who may have done a lot of work in front of a green screen but is flawless i am a fan of emily vancamp and paul rudd as antman always gets a smile out of me    i feel i have given marvel comic book characters and that ilk a fair chance but aside from antmanand deadpool i can do without them liking even laughing maybe about 20 minutes out of a 150 minutes of a film really isnt a recommendation
May 12 2016,negative,only good part was spiderman i was constantly bored until the last half hour of the movie tried to pack in too many superheros into one movie
May 12 2016,positive,captain america civil war is a solid addition to the mcu there is a good mix of entertaining action and complex political issues that creates a good atmosphere
May 12 2016,positive,ive always felt don cheadle was a terrible casting mistake but this time around hes less annoying  the new additions are well worth their screen time  overall a great film
May 12 2016,positive,flawless movie if i had one complaint i it could have been 3 and 12 hours long i left wanting more and cant wait until the next big marvel movie
May 12 2016,negative,im puzzled at the high praise it doesnt compare to guardians deadpool antman or the dark knight trilogy what gives if youre a fan go watch it  if youre not a fan forget it its a below average movie sorry guys the truth is the truth
May 12 2016,positive,they shouldve called it captain america v iron man    it was hardly a civil war just saying
May 12 2016,negative,it sucked heroes had no motivation at all
May 12 2016,positive,after watching avengers age of ultron i thought no other marvel movie was ever going to top what i felt when i watch avengers for the first time and this movie did it this movie is amazingly spectacularly awesome
May 12 2016,positive,the moral core of this film makes it for me the best of the marvel films to date
May 12 2016,positive,if it looks like the avengers movie smells like the avengers movie quacks like the avengers movieits probably the avengers movie marvels latest installment in their shared cinematic universe shares an awful lot cinematically with their previous movies but now with new dlc how many times can you watch the same obviously scripted dialogue and cgi demolition smash fest before you start wanting more was it a fun movie of course it was it was also fun when i saw it on screen for the first time in 2012 and again in 2015   daniel brühl steals the spotlight though as the best marvel villain since tom hiddlestons loki excited for more of him spiderman and black panther too of course
May 12 2016,negative,brief review of the movie    the ups spiderman good choice and aunt may is hot black panther kick ass and black widow just because is scarlett johansson    the downs the bromance between the capt and ws is just way too much tony stark looks old and jealousy takes over him main fighting scene is good but its not like they are really trying to hurt each other so it just meaningless then there is the end i believe in the comic book after is over the avengers dont get together for some time in the movie well it only takes a letter with some sweet words and a phone to forget what just happened    so with this said it a rentitwatchitinyourcouch kinda movie
May 12 2016,negative,a billion and a half dollar blockbuster yeah marvel include my 10000 plus i spent with my family attending last nights civil war an average movie that no one particularly enjoyed not that it was horrible but the hype and love dished out for this movie is not warranted i feel bamboozled because of that  half a star two thumbs down
May 12 2016,neutral,entertaining and with a very strong third act but some characters are poorly rendered and the ideological conflict is almost nonexistent is more a sequel of the winter soldier storyline than an adaptation of civil war in any capacity not bad but smoewhat a missed chance zemos plot is tremendously incoherent
May 12 2016,positive,captain america civil wars emotional level matches with its intense action scenes excellent writing and great sense of humor
May 12 2016,positive,action was incredible and easy to follow unlike other shakey action films hilarious and fantastic storyline must see
May 12 2016,positive,absolutely amazing so many marvel characters one of marvels best movies ever
May 12 2016,positive,i have watched all of the marvel movies now up to civil war  saw this movie the other night and loved it i also read the comic book and its interesting to see the differences and similarities between the books and the hollywood storyline
May 12 2016,positive,airport scene is just for fan appeal the other parts of the movie is moving human drama and character interaction there are major spoilers here and they are so effective that it pushes civil war into cinematic depth no other mcu film manages to achieve it made iron man vs cap fight because of true reason unlike bvs and at the end the audience will root for both sides instead of one guaranteed it proves that a good villain doesnt need superpowers it proves that epic action scenes dont need to cost citizens lifes spiderman shines so brightly it made other characters inferior and the action sequences fastpaced and excellently shot i know ppl love to see multiple heroes fight each other and thats probably what hinders the movie technical quality since thats what makes it popular but nevertheless civil war is marvels best effort to date
May 12 2016,positive,marvel doesnt disappoint really really good
May 12 2016,positive,this was a very good movie the sequels are dead on from the previous movies and the addition of the new characters was just phenomenal also who ever diddoes the casting is a true visionary
May 12 2016,positive,best film i have soon in a long time yes
May 12 2016,positive,this is the best superhero movie to date with all these heroes this films just has enough screen time for each character and the story is amazing  grade a   percentage 97
May 11 2016,positive,i didnt see the other captain merica films but it was still easy to get into this the fight scenes were fantastic except for the fact that its a given that these main characters cant get killed i found myself wishing for a potential gotplot twist    there are so many frickin potential ships  in the universe its insane i dont know who to root for but here are a few black pantherblack widow captain americablack widow captain americascarlet witch captain americasharon carter ultronscarlet witch basically if they had one conversation with eye contact the thought could they crossed my mind     also i think i finally have come to appreciate chris evans biceps wowza
May 11 2016,positive,after watching it i realize it is actually not that bad more entertaining than i expected
May 11 2016,negative,i seriously do not understand how this got such high rating this movie is piece of crap same batman vs superman that seriously wrong behaviour among avenger team and how they came to splitting is so bad and unrealistic its insane hey dude is brainwashed he didnt know no we still attack him put everyone on ignore it just pisses me off movie makes 0 sense same as b vs s
May 11 2016,negative,there comes a point when you sit in these superhero movies and wonder not only what franchise youre currently watching but could it be possible that i have already seen this spiderboy was cute tho
May 11 2016,positive,funny moments good plot great action sequences and effects  another win for marvel
May 11 2016,positive,best marvel movie everand i never ever take an extra effort to go on the web to rate any movie but this was worth the effort to give it super high ratings
May 11 2016,positive,the russo brothers achieve another win civil war is fastpaced and actionpacked all while being thoughtprovoking and fun
May 11 2016,positive,a great balance of so many heroes with an interesting plot a solid blockbuster
May 11 2016,negative,my least favorite of the marvel universe very little story and great cg except with spiderman
May 11 2016,positive,the greatest comic book movie ever made period
May 11 2016,positive,utterly speechless civil war pushed the boundaries and potential for all future hero movies with its extremely human narrative political themes and real performances from a cast that understands that their characters are more than the suits that they wear one of marvels best installments
May 11 2016,positive,amazing spectacular and brilliant civil war provides the action with some great sequences and packed full of emotional moments into the exploration of freedom politics oversight morality and most important of all friendship
May 11 2016,positive,great story great acting great movie waited my entire life to see this spider man in a movie
May 11 2016,positive,have to rewatched it real pleasure chis evans and robert downey jr were at their best
May 11 2016,positive,absolutely loved this movie
May 11 2016,positive,it was ok lots of action considered the fallout from the destructive battles waged by the avengers overall i left feelingmeh
May 11 2016,positive,one of the best superhero movies ive ever seen cant wait to see it in imax
May 11 2016,positive,good fun movie to see
May 11 2016,positive,black panther is amazing  this movie deserves all star rating
May 11 2016,positive,best movie of this summer so far just the right blend of action and humor with our heroes in top form i liked the new spiderman and loved black panther if you havent seen it yet what are you waiting for
May 11 2016,positive,action scenes were choppy and hard to follow  villain was boring at best
May 11 2016,positive,this movie could not be more perfect every frame feels like years of work was put into it every punch felt real and hardhittingevery character was a real human with emotions and motivations
May 11 2016,positive,black widow and hawkeye almost ruined this movie for me like every other marvel movie theyre in  they are the definition of cheese
May 11 2016,positive,anthony and joe russo take sides in captain america civil war    for nearly 2 and a half hours there is a solid balance between story and action  plus with a lot of characters coming together it never feels like the film is trying to do too much  the plot paces itself revealing details as needed leading to a second half that lives up to its name    the action is pure enjoyment with the team clash easily spearheading it all  each character finds the time to have their moment    there is nothing new in the acting department  chris evans and robert downey jr carry this picture all the way from start to finish with everyone else hopping on for the ride    captain america civil war unleashes everything as expected  superhero fun all around
May 11 2016,positive,one of the best superhero movie i have ever seen with one of the best action sequences in the genre including an emotional impact in its climax
May 11 2016,negative,an underwhelming sequence of fist fights between too many super heroes the plot reminded me a bit of a real housewives episode during which a weak andor false squabble is followed by an outofproportion physical fight created purely for entertainment     im also weary of superheroes motivated to physically fight at any provocation and for the primary goal of vengeance enough already how about some heroes that actually exhibit dignity selfcontrol and intelligent solutions     special effectsgood but at this point in the evolution of comic book movies with weak plots too many underdeveloped characters and too much battling it doesnt much matter
May 11 2016,neutral,this movie should be called captain america gentlemens disagreement seriously when i think civil war i think ruthless savagery but everyone was just kinda like eh i know we disagree and have to fight about it but lets try to stay friends too  okay  just kinda seems like marvel is becoming more disney than marvel
May 11 2016,positive,the russo brothers prove there prowess again in their second outing with marvel captain america civil war the film has one word to describe it fun it will entertain people of all ages which we have come to love from marvel and we hope that this tradition will carry on in the saga in the civil war vs bvs this one is a clear winner and proves simply how much catching up to do dc really has in the movie world along with great fighting fascinating new and old characters and a compelling engaging story to go along with it this movie is a top three outing from marvel studios
May 11 2016,negative,i like all the avengers a little less now
May 11 2016,positive,justmind blowing  best super hero film period
May 11 2016,negative,i just got back from civil war and unless youre a marvel fan dont go my friends that are marvel fans were ecstatic when their favorite heroes appeared on screen even if it was for 10 minutes they said it was worth it as for me and my other friends who are fans of good movies it was rather boring i watched the other two avengers movies and this was just more of the same im done with the avengers and captain america i find him boorish but i am looking forward to the guardians of the galaxy and the suicide squad if these fail me im done
May 11 2016,positive,my only problem was the camera during the first few fight scenes the odd style made it so you kind of wished the scene would just end
May 11 2016,positive,one of the best marvelcomic book movies ever only second to my all time favorites dark knight and winter soldier must see cant wait for spiderman  black panther solos films
May 11 2016,positive,wow this movie was amazing im having a tough time trying to decide whether the winter soldier or civil war was better and im leaning more towards civil war it was a serious movie but also fun coughcoughbvs it was also pretty funny at times where it should be while holding its serious tone the twist no spoilers was also very nice because while many people may have seen it coming i did not and i was very pleased while it probably sounds cliché at this point the airport scene was freaking phenomenal the action was nonstop and i enjoyed everything from the amazing choreography to witnessing everyones shining moment and of course spiderman was awsome welcome home dude
May 11 2016,positive,captain america civil war opts for a more serious political tone all the while still maintaining the humorous charm most mcu movies are known for the result is handled beautifully
May 11 2016,positive,this film was everything i had hoped for and more great acting great directing great story great dialogue 
May 11 2016,positive,the movie is worth watching in a theater if youre enjoy action movies like winter soldier this movie is a great take outta 10 id rate it a 7
May 11 2016,positive,this is pretty much everything a superhero movie should be one of the best experiences in a movie theater great acting amazing action laughs and fun
May 11 2016,positive,fantastic movie that exceeded my expectations great story fantastic character development and each character shined 55
May 11 2016,positive,the captain america movies except for first avenger are turning out to be the best marvel cinematic universe movies captain america civil war is an action pack movie that once again contributes to universe storyline      there is not much that is wrong with this movie except the whole premise of the story  the premise of the story was that the government wanted control and oversight over the avengers  the problem with that premise is that that is what shield and the world security council was for and did      other than that minor problem you will enjoy every aspect of the movie  there are many avengers in the movie and is the next closes thing to an avengers movie  it introduces a couple of new characters especially spider man who is an excellent addition  so this is a must see and so far the best action movie and superhero movie of the year
May 11 2016,positive,awesome and great movie to watch love it nice and outstanding movie everything was at point
May 11 2016,positive,what a movie this was i was in my edge of my seat lot of great action sequences the russo brothers did great giving all the characters lot of screen time and didnt feel bloated they as did great job introducing spiderman and black panther i dont like the villain zemo he does not do anything except having the heroes battle with each other the airplort fight was the best fight in a superhero movie best action film i seen in a long time
May 11 2016,positive,well paced witty a layered plot action packed just flat out right entertaining
May 11 2016,positive,a really good addition to the marvel universe i have liked the marvel movies for the most part but im not the uber fan like everyone else this one however is wonderfully directed by the russo brothers and it not only has amazing set pieces great stunt work and action but the political aspect is not shoe horned in and it wonderfully told the standout acting in the film comes from chadwick boseman as black panther and elizabeth olsen as scarlet witch they bring a lot of depth to their characters also the spiderman addition is awesome and i cant wait to see his movie i would say after the first avengers this is the 2nd best in the marvel franchise
May 11 2016,negative,endind was extremely unsatisfying and the big fight scene in the middle was pathetic
May 11 2016,positive,absolutely incredible movie
May 11 2016,negative,i guess im the minority here but i dont get all the rave reviews about this movie 2 hours of watching the avengers fight each other in a weak plot  im a fan of the captain america franchise but this movie was just ridiculous
May 11 2016,positive,this movie has done everything right compelling emotional epic funny its the best marvel movie with guardians of the galaxy which is the most entertaining in my opinion its not perfect but its very close to it
May 11 2016,positive,the civil war of course cant avoid comparisons with the recent batman v superman film in both films their authors decided to create confrontation between good heroes thus adding philosophical depth and psychological authenticity to the heroes also both films have raised up a problem of the socalled collateral damage and responsibility for consequences of superheroes actions    while not referring to the question which movie is better ill try to ask myself a question why the theme of confrontation between the forces of good appeared in the film adaptations now i think the answer lies in the domestic us problems criticism of bushs foreign policy and national security measure i think were essential in raising collateral damage problem and control of power in original comic book series coming to power of the leftist dove of peace obama that has transformed now into a crisis of the us political establishment manifested in the appearance of presidential candidates like socialist sanders and populist trump tells about upcoming serious reformatting of traditional american values what twenty five years ago has seemed unshakeable foundation of the us  individual freedom liberalism individualism christianity reliance on the middle class the belief in the american mission the constitutional rights the right to freely carry weapons the belief in the intransigence of good and evil so called freedom values  is increasingly shifting now to the so called safety values  strengthening of state control and regulation taxation reliance on large corporations on the one hand and people with low incomes on the other with the simultaneous impoverishment of the middle class atheism restriction of the right to carry weapons moral relativism noninterference in the affairs of third countries this us offset of values with the polarization of the supporters of freedom values and supporters of safety values i think is reflected by the both blockbusters    in the previous russos work with captains story we already saw clash of these values when heroes revealed that evil has grown up inside of shield and its operatives and head were converted to the hydras side arguing that security and control will finish the worlds chaos in this captains story the same message was hidden by ross brothers more subtly when right and wrong sides are not so clear as in life it is difficult to see the evil in someone everyone accustomed to consider to be a hero and who considers himself to be good as well as all villains    on the one hand there is captain  the embodiment of the freedom values  who believes that you can not shift the responsibility for your actions on others including the state like for example the nazis did or a coalition of states knows that there at the top just ordinary people with their ambitions and desires and that he wont become a puppet in the hands of cynical politicians only in order to get rid of guilt and absolve himself of responsibility he is the embodiment of belief in uncompromising absolute good and evil inviolability of principles justice even if they are not supported by the majority which out of fear is ready to give up freedom in exchange for security to exchange risktaking birthright for a guaranteed onion soup on the other hand there is the iron man oddly enough the epitome of the security values  he comes from large corporations he wishes to subdue the groups activities to external control to absolve himself of responsibility and thus in some way how to protect others from collateral damage    if motivation of captain america is transparent  responsibility adherence to the principles and concepts of good and evil even if they are contrary to written laws as well as loyalty to friendship the starks motivation is questionable does he made his decision due to the conscious or unconscious desire to split the group and take the leadership from captain america isnt there monstrous selfishness hidden behind the rantings about the need to control again it is not clear how such controls could prevent collateral damage maybe it is thirst for power and at the same time desire to absolve himself of any responsibility for the collateral damage look at the motivation of the real villains commies nazis  they wanted to create a perfect system with total control for the security of common fellows who they sought were unable to bear the burden of freedom altron was alike but he grabbed his delusion ideas from stark for me stark is the main villain of the film he begins to pursue those who disagree with him  put a pressure on them put them wanda under arrest it is similar to most of the tyrants a typical villain who wants to trample his opinion as one and only and to eliminate all who disagree    behaviour of black widow seems illogical  she is a clear candidate for captains team unless she has stayed with stark for sabotage like in the hangar scene but suffering from guilt wanda would rather choose starks side that allows her to shift responsibility to someone else but she has chosen the right path of growing up  accepting responsibility in the age of ultron she had read starks mind and warned cap that stark is capable of anything    distracting from the current political and philosophical background of the film it may be noted that in terms of action this marvels cinemacomics keeps the style and the brand  despite the seriousness of the plot marvels ease and jokes are still there even during fierce battles the flick is dynamic and quite fun though perhaps not as deep as the batman v superman but more fully revealing of the motivation of the main characters
May 11 2016,positive,civil war couldnt be any better than it turned out to be this breathless movie combines the amazing hardhitting action  coherent plotting of winter soldier with the lightness  fun spirit of the avengers movies every character involved is so well developed and brilliantly motivated each with enough screentime in this critical storyline without compromising the focus on captain america and tony stark this is possibly marvels richest installment to date and in turn one of the very best
May 11 2016,negative,12 paid to see the same story same fights same action bit parts played by alfie woodard and marisa tomei are a spectacular waste of extraordinary talent the film presents nothing new or exciting with the exception of spiderman entering the fray     the overall plot is parallel to batman vs superman badguy plays heroes against each other in long boring and unoriginal fight scenes until the ultimate and predictable end where no heroes are dead and the villain is vanquished when will hollywood surprise the moviegoers
May 11 2016,positive,which comic book do i want dad why the one with the most heroes of course
May 11 2016,positive,in fact the movie was and surpassed what i expected in spite of not being a faithful adaptation of the comic that does not make the movie is bad but otherwise this gives you your own personal to the movie touch it is certainly the best marvel studios hata work time
May 11 2016,positive,i wanted to give this movie more stars it had so many good things in it unfortunately it is a case of the whole being less than the parts  the movie is in many ways the peak experience of the super hero genre but liked it less than deadpool and even antman which were smaller more personal films too many characters to care about is the biggest problem there is also a great philosophical point here about freedom versus state control that the movie refuses to meet directly beause life is dangerous should the state be given control of individual choices so individuals dont make errors only the state the movie itself makes it clear that this is nothing but foolishness anyway still a lot to like here characters are all strong too strong to have them all lumped together like this love new spiderman love writing of interaction between characters lots of sharp clever stuff
May 11 2016,negative,cgi was bad the quips distracting and the interactions unbelievable there have been worse superhero movies but at the moment i cant think of one two thumbs way way way down
May 11 2016,positive,it was really good surprisingly it wasnt on point as the comic but still good it blew me away with spiderman and antman dont want to give much out since there some people that havent seen itbut so much is going i cant for the next avengers movie and spiderman and many other hopefully dc can catch up to this train
May 11 2016,positive,way too much fun as always this franchise doesnt disappoint
May 11 2016,positive,3 12 stars if you are one of those people that will complain until the end of time that spiderman 3 and the amazing spiderman 2 that they had too many villains you have no right to complain about those movies if you are ok with the amount of characters in this movie even with thor and hulk taking vacation this is just avengers 3 dont be fooled not only is it avengers 3 it is captain america 3 iron man 4 and even spiderman 13 there is just way too much plot and too many new characters being crammed in when there were too many to begin with ive always had that problem with the other avengers movies but here it is avengers plus spiderman plus black panther plus antman plus martin freeman plus daniel bruhl plus hope davis plus william hurt plus so many freaking people to deal with so lets break down each movie with in the movie since this does feel like a marathon of too many movie for the captain america movie i enjoyed it as i have with the past two just as i have been screaming for the past year i just wanted a third captain america movie since he is the only one that can carry an interesting solo franchise outside of these other avengers because i really dont think thor or iron man are interesting at all for compelling stories even though captain america is in another one of my complaints in the category of all the avengers are so repetitive in powers with super strength and being able to jump around building to building and shooting a gun while doing this which is the plus of adding in black panther spiderman and somewhat antman because they bring something new to the battle scenes i think the essence of what the character of captain america is supposed to be creates compelling solo stories as seen in his first movie with a great historical fiction wwii movie and the second being a great spy thriller here it really cant get its due because so much is surrounding this kind of a friendship drama with captain america trying to rebuild a relationship to his old friend bucky who he wont let out hope that he can be brought back to their side which creates the main tension for the overall movie but also creates a larger chaos that would have been better if kept off the screen to focus on more of an actual captain america movie all of their stuff is good and scarlett johanssons black widow is best served along side of captain america and anthony mackie but it just isnt given room to breathe now to talk about the iron man movie if it werent for don cheadle i would have hated everything about it for being so boring long and awfully paced robert downey jr just is not a funny actor his comedic timing is so rushed that it sometimes gets mumbled but the humor is just not funny at all as much as i love spiderman still my favorite superhero that i wish was left alone from this mess he just is here to skip the solo intro movie so we dont have to sit through another origins for him and it just isnt very necessary tom holland is wonderful as peter parker but its something that could have been cut for time and to make the movie less exhausting the whole iron mans parents subplot is ok because i love hope davis but its another one of those thousands of plotlines that you forget about after a while and by the time a resolution happens you dont really care and wonder why this was jammed into this movie and not into something separate still same problem too many jammed plots in an already overstuffed movie talking about the avengers movie in this the issue with it is the lack of any suspense of resolution these people are all friends and havent done anything too drastic to make them enemies except where their politics lie but it makes the fight scene so lackluster because you have no idea what these people think they are going to accomplish with just punching each other and throwing them around but making sure they take the time to remind the audience we are still friends right like what is the purpose of this destruction that the government has already yelled at you about if this is just a friendly brawl if i had to sit through another car flipping across a long area i was going to throw my popcorn across the theater the action is so repetitive and lackluster to the point the directors dont want you to see it since they fall into the same new clique of shaky cam action scenes to make you feel like you are in the action which it does the exact opposite making you remember you are watching a movie and giving you a migraine in the process and i cant imagine how awful it is in 3d like i said antman spiderman and black panther spice up the action by the actual climax of the movie between captain american and iron man you are so done with him hitting iron man with his shield and iron man blasting him and bucky across the room i appreciated the plot line of the government finally getting involved with the amount of destruction the avengers create almost taking on a similar plot line from the incredibles but it kind of just said nope to that plot line and decided instead of hurting innocent people it is still ok to trash an airport and destroy everyones cars so the things i liked about this movie chadwick boseman is just exceptional as black panther i have been a big champion of chadwick these past 3ish years championing his performances in 42 and get on up and while everyone screams michael b jordans name when oscarsowhite happens and no one is giving chadwick the attention he deserves i continue to shout his name for attention and so happy he finally gets the chance to be noticed since no one went to see the great 42 and get on up im excited for his stand alone movie and he really gives the best performance in this movie tom holland as i mentioned was delightful and though ill always be bitter for the world giving up with andrew garfield i welcome him to my favorite superhero franchise and hope he can really win back the world so spiderman can stop being the butt of a joke for always being remade and holland can carry his own franchise hopefully not overdoing it by constantly joining this lame gang i was a big champion of last years antman and i think paul rudd really saves this movie it terms of it being very boring for a good hour and 45 min bringing in his great comedic timing which he does miles and miles better than downeys iron man and really unique superhero abilities i liked elizabeth olsen better in this movie but the whole subplot between her and that vision guy that left me confused more than interested in him was just worthless and needed to be cut out the pacing is the main problem with this movie it builds and builds for this big avengers civil war battle and then i am kind of happy because i thought that meant the movie is about to wrap up and check my clock one second and see another half hour is left and im left annoyed because it just keeps going and going and will never just wear off even into the end credits scenes which continue to be gimmicks that need to just be the end of the movie not the final post credits scene the mid credits scene is this review overlong and overstuffed speaks merits to the movie  i think i covered everything but this is my problem so much happened that i cant even remember every single pin point did i mention daniel bruhl of course not i really liked daniel bruhl in this and finally serves as a great villain for the avengers films with lackluster villains like loki and ultron in the past few he is more in the league of robert redfords character in the second captain america movie serving as a great villain without needing to actually battle our superhero he messes with peoples minds and oversees chaos without having to get really involved and oh my god i forgot about someone else emily vancamp is really wonderful as peggy carters niece and i hope we get a lot more of her because honestly i enjoyed her kicking ass more than the other women in this movie so lets wrap this up the sound design is great the writing is give or take same with the direction side note every transition line from scene to scene in this movie is i know a guy for that leading to a big reveal to another new character reveal since every secondary character is played by someone well known at least by me also are we at the point that disney wants to name drop every damn property they own in all their movies star wars references in avengers movies now it was a cute moment granted but give me a break and the score is a little repetitive of past scores for this franchise and overall its a solid summer movie when it comes to the action the overall movie just is too much to handle and full of clutter of course fanboys will love it but for us outsiders who appreciate certain elements of this cinematic universe it still is just a mixbag of entertainment teamcap teamblackpanther teamspiderman teamhopedavis teamalfrewoodard teammartinfreeman teamemilyvancamp
May 11 2016,positive,lets not beat around the bush this is the best marvel movie yet period
May 11 2016,positive,i watched this movie on the 7th and it has taken a few days for a chunk of the movie to truly settle in and i know there are still aspects of the movie banging around in the back of my head that wont surface until i can screen the movie again  who knows when that will be though so ill power thru what keeps jumping to the forefront    possible spoilers but ill do my best to leave things to the imagination and focus on what worked and what didnt    unfortunately with movies like this you have to make comparisons to what came before  as a part of the captain american movies i have to put this one behind the winter soldier  for me the winter soldier offered a more rounded tale of political intrigue  mixing in how engrained hydra was to shield left such a bitter but joyous taste in my mouth that i cant help but watch the movies that came before and wonder how much influence the multiheaded monster had in the events that unfolded  on the flip side as an avenger movie i would put this one on par with the first avengers and ahead of age of ulton  if i take a step back from the actual storytelling and go for pure superhero geekdom then this beats them all    the bad  the villain crossbones  other than setting up what is to come and also presenting a rather heartbreaking reality check for the scarlet witch there was nothing here  the villain once again zemo  the motivation for what he did was there but character development was seriously lacking here  i would have put this under the terrible but what zemo pulled off without the benefit of wealth or powers puts him ahead of those that came before him  he just needed to be fleshed out more  given his status at the end of the movie i hope to get more of him in the future  agent 13 and the closing out of agent carters story  a funeral and a few lines of dialog isnt enough to transition from one lost love to a blossoming one  this is one aspect of the story that suffered from turning a cap movie into a part cap part avenger movie    the neutral  stark  its amazing that the character that started this train moving is now the character i truly hate  looking back at his progression from iron man to civil war the writing was on the wall so his attitude isnt coming out of left field here  i had to drop this into the neutral category because i just dont know how to feel about this  i think what bothered me more than anything else wasnt how easily he was lead to where he ended up at the end but what he did along the way to get there  his recruitment of spiderman in particular  i guess well have to wait and see where things progress from here    the good  bucky and falcon  their interactions were surprisingly enjoyable  it had the feel of the new best friend bickering with the old best friend as they jockey for who gets to have the bromance with cap  the scene with them in the car waiting for agent 13 and cap is particularly amusing and very much a bro moment  vision  the scarlett witch  in truth these two could get their own reviews but even on opposite sides of the fight there are still tied to each other  their development and humanity stood out to me and they both seemed to react the most to their own actions  i wanted more of both of their characters  spiderman  the kid is great and i am looking forward to homecoming  the star wars reference had me grinning like an idiot and his banter during the airport sequence was right out of the comics  his reverence of the heroes he is fighting alongside and also against is endearing and makes me think of how i would react if i was in the same situation  antman  paul rudd  nuff said  i really want to say more but any quotes written here would spoil the viewers enjoyment of hearing them for the first time  pauls scott lang is such a joy to watch  he has a similar take on the heroes that spidey does    the great  the airport scene  i wont go into any details but i was in geek overload  black panther  i dont even know where to begin so ill just say i was so very happy with amount of screen time he received and he had the most complete story arc in the movie  his motivations were clear and their shift from beginning to end was completely believable  he is the black panther i wanted to see on the big screen    this is both a captain american movie and an avenger movie and although at times it may seem a little mashed up i still feel it works  i walked out of the theater wanting more  thankfully we have so much more to look forward to in the coming years
May 11 2016,positive,it was good but not as great as its hyped to be tony stark was far more tame and less witty and sarcastic as normal
May 11 2016,positive,seen in 3d  surprisingly characterdriven with a good amount of action captain america civil war is yet another successful film in the best superhero series within the marvel universe the drama in this film succeeds more than the borderline melodrama of ironman 3 but is occasionally too serious the movie does feel a bit long but its necessary for the multitude of character development the best characters were surprisingly not the two leads captain america and ironman but rather the incredible performances by the actors who played black panther scarlet witch antman albeit a too brief appearance and spiderman
May 11 2016,positive,another awesome captain america movie another gem added to the marvel cinematic universe the plot and the script are mature the reason behind the division between iron man  the captain seems believable the acting is good the action sequences great antman and spiderman bring in the lighter moments to the screenplay while chadwick boseman shines as black panther making it a three way conflict
May 11 2016,positive,sarah watches for you captain america civil warhero vs hero       warherovsherohtmlspreftw 
May 11 2016,positive,phase 3 of the marvel cinematic universe kicks off nicely with captain america civil war within 2 hrs and 26 mins we were exposed to a solid story that deals with the conflicting ideals on safeguarding the world we got a good wrap up of the bucky barneswinter soldier story we got a spectacular hero vs hero fight scene which was everything that we dreamed of as children we also got the best interpretations of two of marvels gamechanging characters you know who im talking about with all the things that made civil war awesome we were served with a villain who made a minute impact on the story no matter how clever his plan was he didnt seem like a major threat     once again the russo bros scored big with this entry in the captain america trilogy  if captain america civil war is this good imagine how infinity war will turn out
May 11 2016,positive,by far the most enjoyable and risky outing from marvel you cant get any more broken seeing the tension between cap and tony yet smile once your favorite character gets to shine action story drama and superheroes done right and enough excitement and twist to keep your emotions rising until the final beat plus spiderman if youre reading i was born in queens flushing i still go there often we gotta hang out
May 11 2016,positive,best movie in the mcu
May 11 2016,negative,wait for the dvd if you want to see it i am a die hard action flick movie guy and this is the first action movie in which half way thru the movie i thought to myself this movie sucks there were so many fights that things started to blur so many characters that i started thinking did they just brought in a bunch of characters just to make a movie a lame action movie
May 11 2016,negative,captain america movie getting worse everytime
May 11 2016,positive,should have been longer
May 11 2016,positive,there are very strong points to this movie it rests completely on the already built mcu we know almost all the characters and thats taken for granted which is perfectly fine robert downey jr gives a great performance and becomes at least to me the most emotionally relatable character in the movie when it comes to the new characters they steal this movie black panther has the best motivation and the biggest character arc spidey is pure fan service but the best kind of fan service hes smart and fast on his feet tom holland has me the most excited for his movie however on the down side we have cap he is the least interesting character in his own movie which shouldve been figured out before attaching so many characters
May 11 2016,neutral,a few standout moments but otherwise poorly paced and shockingly generic sorely disappointed
May 11 2016,positive,excellent movie with good plot twist and it has spiderman
May 11 2016,positive,the ideological fight matched the physical in ways batman vs superman wished to achieve but failed miserably marvel has shown dc how to pit two of our favorite superheroes against each other in a smart interesting way not just for the heck of it whats even more incredible is the use of all the characters involved i felt like each proved their powers and advanced the story at the same time thats a hard feat to pull off when you have these many characters just look at the successful introduction of spiderman and black panther im amazed by how the russo brothers made it work so coherently i cant wait to see what they do with the massive infinity wars this was a delight for everyone and shows how superior marvel is when compared to dc a
May 11 2016,positive,spiderman intro was really well done
May 11 2016,positive,best marvel movie so far packed with action and humour just general fun
May 11 2016,positive,praise for the maturity of the storyline  marvels captain america franchise just got better and better the progression of the story comes with a constant blending of conspiracies conflicts complications and actions unlike any traditional marvels films the tone of this film is set to bring out the seriousness of the crisis creating a tensed atmosphere from the beginning till the end of the movie  the addition of antman black panther and spiderman into the avengers family further enhanced the flow of the story be amazed with these freshmen for their special abilities and actions particularly black panther he rocks  there is no doubt this is definitely one of  the best summer blockbuster of 2016
May 11 2016,positive,best marvel movie in the mcu
May 11 2016,positive,loved it best marvel movie to date
May 11 2016,positive,a ton to digest but i really enjoyed it after a second viewing
May 11 2016,positive,excellent fun movie and not to much having to deal with all of the heroes
May 11 2016,positive,absolutely the best marvel movie ever just phenomenal had to go see it twice because once was not enough every superhero in the movie was superb especially how they did black panther they did him justice perfect cant wait for the sequels
May 11 2016,positive,captain america civil war is not just an incredibly fun and enjoyable comic book movie you understand the motivations behind every character during every well paced scene poignant drama character moments great writing and amazing action direction is what makes this comic book blockbuster stand out above marvels already hefty lineup as one of the greatest films of its kind and a game changer
May 11 2016,positive,the worst captain america movie by far i loved the first two films  i agree with the basic argument in the movie about not signing away your freedom to the government but it had too much going on too many characters and was overly long  with so many superheros running around it was more the avengers 25 than captain america 3  i would have liked to see them cut out a few characters and cut about 20 minutes off the run time to simplify it a little
May 11 2016,positive,the very best marvel movie great story
May 11 2016,positive,the russo brothers have out done themselves with the latest installment of the marvel cinematic universe combining actiondramasuspense and a little comedy in a fantastic joy ride from start to finish the airport fight scene in my opinion the greatest comic fight scene caught on camera spider man makes his debut in the mcu films and let me say what sony tried to do in 5 films the russo brothers nailed 20 minutes with him tom holland welcome to the universe seen it twice most likely will see a 3rd time
May 11 2016,positive,amazing from start to finish
May 11 2016,positive,great movie a few problems but not big enough to make me not like it fun exciting and great story
May 11 2016,positive,best captain america movie so far
May 11 2016,negative,no more im done with the superhero genre
May 11 2016,positive,with a fantastic roster of superheroes containing old favorites and exciting new additions such as the relentless wise black panther and witty peter parker captain america civil war is an actionpacked and exciting film that ends the starspangled heros trilogy in flying colors this installment also delivers a smart and worthy villain in daniel bruhls zemo a political savvy arc and last but not least complex superheroes who do more than just avenging
May 11 2016,positive,captain america takes the formula to a new level with this movie it is by great to see the addition of black panther chadwick boseman and spiderman tom holland with the great storyline addressing the events of age of ultron this movie gets everything right from the charactersto the villain zeemo to the amazing action sequences there are you cant help but marvel at the airport fight captain america civil war is a must see and amazing adaption to the comic captain america is the perfect marvel movie and superhero movie in general this is a must watch and i could not recommend it enough
May 11 2016,neutral,in all honesty the best part of the film we spiderman and ant man the bad guy was un compelling the big fight was underweling and there was nothing making want to see the next one the logic of the move did not seem to flow well and the guy you ment to be rooting for is not intresting or developed in any way same old st action was in testing for the first half of the film but nothing realy intresting happened toward the end good humer from the two stars the were very funny but for a serious setting for a film the comic relief was too pervelant
May 11 2016,negative,are you all serious right now this is the worst avengers because this was an avengers movie ever the movie was a fucking mistake cheesy lines everywhere the only good thing in this movie was spiderman and black panther bad movie overall so many mistakes so many gaps and waaaaay too predictable outcomes
May 11 2016,negative,there are so many flaws in civil war how did the critics miss them also the fight scenes were redundant it was like stock footage of the same two people fighting dressed in different costumes after a while it was hohum the little quips had me cringing the whole way through do you fanboys really like this stuff now i see the xmen movie thats coming out soon and it looks like crap whats next   at least be more even handed i can handle a three star rating but five stars and its the greatest movie ever i rushed to the theater expecting that and instead i got anything but that it pissed me off i say screw this flick and go see something else out
May 11 2016,positive,captain america civil war has wowed the audience globally yet again the story pulled me at the end of my seat after every conversation the action sequences is original funny thanks to spiderman tom holland  antman paul rudd  the way marvel studios brought new characters in the big screen is phenomenal filled with every single unforgettable moment in this actionpacked film that reincarnated the hopes of fans after the halfdisappointment of batman vs superman
May 11 2016,positive,captain america civil war is action packed and deliveries on all the levels that age of ultron failed it is harded to be disappointed but a movie as well made as civil war the story for the most part is really compelling although i still do not understand the emotional connection between steve and bucky the new comers black panther and spiderman completely steal the show and out shine some of the duller moments the plot while a tad predictable is still really enjoyable my biggest problem is that while it touches on some pretty mature themes and ideas the film is never allowed to explore them in any detail
May 11 2016,positive,humor action with even some thoughtprovoking themes
May 11 2016,positive,this movie was awesome from showing the audience to where the marvel characters are to building up the tensions between the characters and ultimately introducing other heroes like spiderman black panther andr antman especially giant ant man were what made this movie a 1010 rating especially the way in which we still get to see captain americas emotions on who he is where he is and what he signed up for when he became a super soldier he still misses home and his only friend left is his other friends enemy he has to choose between his anchor to his home and past or his other friend stark the only thing i did not like though was the portrayal of aunt may she wasnt really depicted as a wise mature and serious aunt aunt may is supposed to have those qualities as she is fundamental to peter parkers growth as a hero in previous spiderman movies peter parker was always influenced by his aunt and uncle like  uncle ben with great power comes great responsibility despite that flaw the movie did show a darker side of marvel yet still made me laugh and enjoy it
May 11 2016,positive,this movie had everything that batman v superman tried to be marvel and the russo brothers managed to build off characters that the audience loved and introduced characters will and are loving it is a must watch with small niggling issues that can be ignored if you managed to like batman v superman while bvs had its moments the entirety of the movie was bad for the sole reason that the plot was not cohesive and some characters did not have the charisma and the ability to connect with the audience civil war on the other hand manages to successfully keep the stakes high allow the audience to connect with the ideas and viewpoints of the characters civil war was a strong cohesive movie that also set up the entirety of marvels phase three while bvs could not successfully set its own movie and future movies as it felt rushed zemo as a villain had much better motivation than lex luthor while again some of his plans were worked quite too well more than often it was not on the level of luthor who managed to wing 99 of his plans all in all civil war is a must see and it fully deserves its plaudits because it managed to succeed where a movie with two of the worlds most famous characters could not and in a much superior manner    also like to add the airport fight scene was absolutely epic and it felt as long as they said it was unlike bvs where the title fight was barely 58 minutes long at least it felt like that
May 11 2016,positive,with some of the greatest action sequences cinema has ever seen captain america civil war delivers as one of if not the best marvel movie to date although it has some holes here and there and struggles with pacing a couple times throughout the film it offers clear cut character intentions while also introducing two new heroes to the marvel universe a story that naturally flows from this universe they have built and heart wrenching moments that will give you goosebumps
May 11 2016,positive,captain america civil war is the latest installment in the marvel franchise in this installment steve rogers and tony stark are on opposite sides of two philosophical movements that surround how the avengers should operate rogers believes in less oversight so the avengers can operate unfettered stark believes in accountability for the collateral damage suffered as a result of the avengers endeavors what ensues is a divided avengers where the opposing factions want to kick each others asses the film has beaucomp entertainment value the action scenes are gripping and electrifying and the action is whirlwind i thought the character development and story partially took a backseat since the film moves at such a fast clip which is why i found the film good but not great but overall this film is a worthwhile addition to the marvel franchise  b
May 11 2016,positive,captain america 3 civil war i loved this movie it was great i did not get up to pee once amazed my friend it truly is a comic bookseries come to life over 16 minutes of previews and 2 hours and 26 minutes you have to stay through credits for end scenes i did not want to miss bit its a lot of story there are funnies and i like the new spiderman but its only flaw is that it could have been funnier like the original avengers film but i understand that it would have hurt the story if you have been following the marvel movies you will love it and will not want to wait long for more if not then you may not understand it as a complete movie other than there are a lot of comic book people doing amazing things in it 455 stars cinemaworthy and approved though 3d is not a necessity
May 11 2016,positive,surprisingly well balanced film balanced in a way that you understand each character motivations if you were cap then youd do what he did in the film if you were in iron man situation then youd do the same as tony did in the film
May 11 2016,negative,captain america kid revenge war  i dont gonna say the action scenes are best or captain ideology and iron man ideology conflicts the deeper facts in bucky life all things just shit total shit  think a man who lost his family and start a war between avengers by making bucky in just to get his own revenge  it look like a kid create a mess and avengers clean it by fighting their own and spiderman how can you ask a kid to fight captain knowing that its captain america movies and his ass gonna hurt story is lame  best scene bucky lost his arm and in last no one gets hurt because revenge is bad thing 100 marks to show this
May 11 2016,positive,when i first saw the trailers and the hype around this movie i was really excited to see it but when i got out of the theatre i was a bit disappointed lets state the goods parts of the movie i enjoyed the fights a lot they are wellorganized and diversified spiderman and ant man were great even though we see them little i also appreciate the general humour in the movie which was a bit avengers like but it works nicely the fact that iron man is more serious character in the movie also appealed me     now what made me sad first im not a hard core super hero follower and fan but i usually go and watch them anyway because i enjoy them in civil war the story was kind of poor in my opinion there is a big gap and i feel like they dont achieve anything in the movie i was hoping for a real war between two clans and was really disappointed it is not even really about two different opinions in the end but more about a personal fight between the two leaders and in the end they arent even mad at each others    to conclude i think the movie might be one of the best marvels if you are a fan because it may sets up something for future movies etc  but as a casual i think the movie is overall a bit empty but the personalities of the heroes the action and the humour make it enjoyable by everyone
May 11 2016,positive,almost everything about this film is jawdroopingly entertaining and the relationships that marvel has been building up for nearly a decade come to a satisfying and logical boiling point well worth viewing  easily upholds the legacy begun by the winter soldier for anyone that afraid this would turn into an avengers 25 dont worry  the film reminds you that its staunchly about captain america and the winter soldier throughout theres enough political intrigue and intercharacter drama to keep you interested between the stunningly well directed action scenes and black panther sneaks in from off camera and steals every scene hes featured in
May 11 2016,positive,my favorite part about this film is that spiderman has never been better but youve probably heard all the good things about this film  so ill give you the bad because this is not a perfect film and also not the best comic book film either  first  they used way too much shaky cam in the action scenes the most pointless and most boring villain ever that villain is only one of many unnecessary characters half of the minor roles couldve been cut completely with no impact on the story at all also too many mentions of characters from avengers movies who couldnt be in this one all this leads to a movie thats about an hour too long i do like this movie  just not as much as everyone else seems to
May 10 2016,positive,the flights looks great the whole story line try very hard to pull everyone together but pull everyone together only  its more like avengers 25 than captain america 3
May 10 2016,positive,i got the y but im sure lots havnt seen it so wont spoil it but it was s very good movie better then i had expected
May 10 2016,positive,great movie but dont go to hartlepool cinema to watch it they had 3 movie start times and not 1 was correct ended up watching it at teesside
May 10 2016,positive,i loved this movie and left me feeling very satisfied i definitely want to see the next installments in the mcu what more can i say except if you havent seen the movie yet go and watch it i promise it wont leave a dawn of justice feeling and no one has a mother named martha in the film
May 10 2016,positive,so amazing i really recommend it
May 10 2016,positive,really just a brand expansion that is just a 2  a half hour set up for the next marvel film either way these actors are so imbedded in their characters its hard to imagine them playing anyone else but the superheroes
May 10 2016,positive,one of the best films of the genre
May 10 2016,negative,this is the caps most unfun outing and huge step backwards compared to the previous avengers films weak characters too much talking few fights and only one thats worthwhile the worst film iteration of spiderman yet and a misuse of what was supposed to be an exciting turn for tony starks character its phenomenally weak compared batman v superman a movie which it apes in a stylistic sense
May 10 2016,positive,seldom does a film with so many characters actually work that means everyone gets their moments and new characters black panther and spiderman benefit from an economical character development informing the audience about these characters backgrounds and what drives them in limited timebeyond the characters the story has a completely organic structure events that we the audience have witnessed have consequences the avengers are not free from accountability the russos have mastered putting a larger than life world in our reality without me questioning whether its realistic or not friendships are tested through loyalty duty and honor this is character driven political actionadventure at its best
May 10 2016,negative,capt america is a hypocrite    remember this scene from age of ultron    stark but that up there thats the end game how are you guys planning on beating that  capt together  stark well lose  capt then well do that together too    then civil war came and he eats what he said by not asking help from those close allies he considered friends and instead recruited a thief wtf capt you didnt tell your while team coz you knew they wont believe you really     1st true friends no brothers in arms may not agree on everything but you are supposed to trust them that they will also trust you    and 2nd i didnt know capt developed a new super power predicting the fufure capt you didnt just failed to trust your friends you also prejudged them essentially
May 10 2016,positive,civil war isnt perfect but for longtime fans of the marvel cinematic universe its a dream come true to see these guys and gals duke it out the theme of friendship also leads to an emotional climax that will make you question what it means to be a hero
May 10 2016,positive,more than ever its like watching a comic book come to life onscreen marvels most grownup outing so far as it asks some interesting questions while being okay with not providing easy answers also thats how you do spiderman this is the first time i really feel as if peter parker jumped off the page
May 10 2016,positive,very exciting to watch from beginning to end
May 10 2016,positive,tough fun and as action packed as one could want the russo brothers continue to impress with their handle and direction of the marvel movie universe despite an over saturated film
May 10 2016,positive,this movie has just about everything no serious it does  of course we see some of our favorite comic heros in some amazing action sequences  but it also has the classic well placed comedy and friends feel between the characters  great job marvel but wait  it does not stop there it even has a very deep compelling story about friend ships and one of the most touching love stories i have seen in some time hint captain americaagent carter
May 10 2016,negative,boring movieno story
May 10 2016,positive,absolutely one of the best superheroes this year
May 10 2016,positive,spoilers    this movie was just slightly better than bvss  sony blew it letting new spiderman appear  they should have stuck with garfield and that storyline  another spiderman reboot that will set new lows for their franchise    civil war excluding the spiderman plug in was decent storyline  my only complaint is that they had pretty much everyone from avengers and other franchises  why didnt they just call it avengers civil war  kiddie pleaser no one dies    black panther was fun to see hope the solo film works out
May 10 2016,positive,ant man is the best avenger ever or what d
May 10 2016,negative,stupid civil war scene ends with sorry guys were on the same team plot was a bvss knockoff way to many characters in one film and spidermans suit and role sucked marvels most iconic hero gets a 5 minute scene movie sucked its way to animated and is intended for 12 year olds
May 10 2016,positive,there are of course no spoilers in this review    i had picked a side going into this i was sure that i would be team iron man no matter what and i was right in this avengers film which was cleverly disguised as a captain america flick there were several notable moments that had me actually invested which is increasingly uncommon for comic book movies the story was decent but there were quite a few flaws with it im of course not revealing anything but just know a lot of this story could have not happened and the movie would have turned out the same way its the exact same problem i had with age of ultron i dont want to give you the impression that this is a bad movie though because civil war was excellent    you already knew the action scenes would be brilliant i dont even need to talk about it because the standard of high quality is just a given the stunt people who worked on civil war were hopefully well paid as every scene was done just right and aside from the obvious comic craziness they were all realistic i wish there were more action scenes with my favorite heroes but that leads into my other main problem with the film    we are absolutely spoiled to have captain america iron man black widow and the rest of them all in one movie how is that a problem its because they constantly remind us that this is a captain america film and not an avengers one some of the main stars are featured more than others and the ones that dont get as much screen time just leave you wanting more from them its definitely a nice problem to have but there are a few moments where just a little bit more from a few of them would have gone a long way yes i know its a captain america movie but it still feels like a giant tease    bucky is the worst im not starting another complaint dont worry i just cant stand him could his role in the film have influenced me slightly probably youll have to see civil war to find out i really think everyone should see it as civil war is basically avengers 25 so there will be at least a few scenes for everyone the comedy is there the action is there black panther is there and the story is for the most part coherent i enjoyed civil war quite a bit and it will certainly have a place in my top ten is it the best marvel movie ever like quite a few people are saying it is in this awful reviewers opinion no it is not you will still have yourself a great time though so head out to the theater and enjoy yourself
May 10 2016,positive,holy shit they pulled it off
May 10 2016,negative,actionpacked with insightful depth but sometimes too simplistic
May 10 2016,positive,cap and iron man fight and its fun lots of characters you need to know and like mcu
May 10 2016,negative,the greatest movie ever made then you wake up
May 10 2016,positive,the russo brothers have outdone it this time with captain america civil war it has a great plot and most importantly a marvelous work on character development
May 10 2016,positive,the superheroes are still at war and you will not be disappointed  the new spiderman and black panther are almost perfect    
May 10 2016,positive,loved the new spiderman and the black panther  they both did an awesome job  the rest of the cast delivered as expected  i think most people who saw it would agree that it should have been entitled the avengers civil war  small complaints like that are all you can find in this great movie
May 10 2016,positive,worth the price of admission for the airport battle alone
May 10 2016,positive,i think this is one of the greatest action films that ive ever seen being a kid from the 80s i always wanted to see live action depictions of the comics this movie was like the antidote for bvs even though i liked that one too i heard people call this the third avengers but i think people sleep on capn his fight scenes are always the best the only thing i think the mcu lacks is a joker caliber villain like dr doom that new ff flick that is not doom mephisto fox has a chokehold on who i think is marvels best villain magnetoimo i guess they want to keep us hungry until the infinity war or hit us with gob oct or kingpin with spiderman but everyone should see this movie twice in 3d i felt like a kid again its funny i didnt even like capn that much in the comics but i think hes the baddest of the heroes in the adaptations
May 10 2016,positive,marvel has done it again this movie was awesome too bad they showed spiderman in the trailer as he would have been a hell of a surprise the movie still had other surprises that had the audience cheering loudly great movie cant wait for whats next
May 10 2016,negative,what is there to saythe movie was good not great not awsome just goodi felt it was too rushed and had too muchnot enough yeeaaa moments too much serious momentsi donno maybe it is just me but i left the theater dissapointed and confuzed
May 10 2016,positive,by far the greatest installment in the marvel universe thus far just wow
May 10 2016,negative,typical comic movie with too much cgi
May 10 2016,positive,in general civil war is a mess but damn is it a fun one dont go into this thinking of it as a captain america and iron man movie think of it as an avengers movie with probably the last appearance of rdj as iron man     to restate myself yes this film is a mess but unlike bvs the action isnt just a few scenes that dont last very long the action is massive intense and fun to watch i know allot of people have said this already but during that airport scene my jaw was dropped because of the pure awesomeness     now time to discuss why i believe this movie is a bit of a mess all the characters not just a few of them all of them even the ones you dont know much about it feels like the writers had to stuff one too many introductions in and while allot of them hit their mark by the middle mark these newentries were feeling a bit tired also while the action is amazing i do feel as if there were one too many fistfights in this film i mean it isnt much to complain about because all of them kicked ass     another thing i really loved about this film is the story the past few movies i feel could be summarized in just a few sentences with a few details you can tackon after you write that sentence but this i believe the writers found a decent balance between amazing fight sequences and also decent story writing the villain was interesting and though you may find a few little plotholes had interesting motivations to top this off asides from the original avengers movie in 2012 i believe this is one of the funniest marvel movies to date    in conclusion i enjoyed civil war much more than i thought i would sure the soundtrack is still slim and forgettable and people who skipped on the past few films might ask a few questions while watching like whos that guy for example but its still a fun romp  if i were to imagine a battle between this vs bvs its like bvs got into a gun fight with a knife in place of a gun in other words theres little competition because civil wars already won
May 10 2016,positive,simply mindblowing face neck and chest  two times two times
May 10 2016,positive,a brawny intelligent action spectacle balanced by a solid grasp of deeper themes captain america civil war plants itself firmly in the upper ranks of marvel cinema
May 10 2016,positive,well marvel has really out done themselvesthis is an excellent display of a great superhero blockbuster the directing for a movie of this scale is superbthere is a lot in this movie it has the job of introducing new characters creating a conflict and progressing the characterswhich is all done with gracenow this movie does has some dark moments but they dont dwell on it too much just enough all of the new cast was really greatblack panther is very solidly introduced as well as spider manwhich is one of the best parts of the movie the story does have a lot in it which can lose you sometimesand there are a lot of characters to keep track ofbut over all this is a wonderfully put together and is a great timeit is a wonderful time that moves the story forward
May 10 2016,positive,the airport battle is fucking epic
May 10 2016,positive,great movie loved it
May 10 2016,positive,it was amazing civil war had everything i expected and more definitely one of my favorite movies and in my opinion the best marvel movie yet
May 10 2016,positive,marvels captain american 3 is full of action and has a lot of comedy punchlines i loved seeing antman  spiderman and black panther the animations and fighting scenes are well done and the movie keeps you entertained till the end a great addition to your viewing pleasures
May 10 2016,positive,instead of captain america 3 this movie should have been called avengers 3 i know it is based on the comic civil war but i had rather have had another stand alone movie for captain america other than that it was a good movie and worth watching now i would like to see captain america and wolverine team up in a movie
May 10 2016,neutral,marvel fails again with no villain and dare to be great with a story line always have to wrap things up in a pretty bow does marvel
May 10 2016,positive,best movie this year so far
May 10 2016,positive,do i really need to write a review this movie was perfect go and see it
May 10 2016,positive,meh just a few great thoughtful lines but other than that its all stunts and cgi i guess im getting old for these superhero movies now
May 10 2016,positive,best marvel movie action was great character progression was great there could be a bit of improvement with the steve bucky friendship but everything else was great
May 10 2016,negative,worst movie i ever saw way too long no story line very boring
May 10 2016,positive,one of the best marvel movies to date   but it draws some wrong conclusions on my opinion   the movie made you genuinely concerned for the well being of the characters which for marvel is a first
May 10 2016,positive,the film was just amazing well paced good character development and black panther and spiderman kicked butt
May 10 2016,positive,wow  all i have to say is with as little time spiderman was in this movie  marvel knocks it out the fucking park  this movie is great and it shows why tony and steve would do comes to odds over bucky and other things  marvel keeps making great movies i cant wait to see spidermans new movie after this for the fist time we have the true peter packerspiderman  one last thing i have to say is  that airport fight  holy shit
May 10 2016,positive,greatest marvel movie yet all these user tht are dc fan boys are just mad bvs was terrible and this destroyed it by far get over it dnt come and try to bash this movie because dc screwed up with bvs same way they will with suicide squad
May 10 2016,positive,felt like it had nothing to do with the comic book civil war if they would have had called it anything but civil war i would have gone in with different expectations and enjoyed it more
May 10 2016,positive,thoughtful avengers sequel that also wraps up the winter soldier trilogy for cap filled with moral dilemmas not a happy ending flick introduces panther and zemo as well as depth to many characters i felt this improved upon one of my least favorite miniseries in comics
May 10 2016,positive,phase 3 of the marvel cinematic universe starts out with a bang  civil war is a terrific actionpacked movie loaded with humour  throughly enjoyable movie with a few gutpunching moments to keep you on your toes
May 10 2016,positive,i can see why the ratings were so high
May 10 2016,positive,pretty much what i expected it to be super fun super awesome funny oneliners and performances by paul rudd and tom holland ant man and spiderman for the short amount of time that they appear also great suspense and action people are debating about the sekovia accord too youve got the pro and anti accord camp so interesting
May 10 2016,positive,it was all what i want to see
May 10 2016,positive,its all right but dont expect it to be as good as the other captain america movies it starts off awesome however it gets boring
May 10 2016,positive,a fantastic movie  even if it felt uneven due to shoehorning the avengers into a captain america flick
May 10 2016,positive,awesome as is every marvel movie
May 10 2016,positive,when i see it without 3d ill prob up the rating
May 10 2016,positive,similar plotline to batman vs superman why do they all care about destroying buildings and people all lf a sudden
May 10 2016,positive,the superior marvel film civil war adds great new characters with astonishingly fantastic development for their brief parts in the storytelling coupled with a truly well written political issue which grounds the entire avengers in a realm of reality marvel also gave audiences an unexpected amount of depth from even its villain baron zemo who serves as a metaphor for the themes of consequence buried within a comic book film however buried can mean two things suffocation aka batman v superman and also hidden treasures you can clearly see the filmmakers actively are developing that simply require the viewer to be invested and with 12 previous films it is a good chance that audience is invested flaws include some minor crappy shaky cam as well as a few brief plot conveniences all in all though this is objectively the smartest marvel film ever made and subjectively the greatest disney marvel film so far and subjectively subjectively the 3rd greatest comic book film ever made
May 10 2016,positive,while everyone raves this as the best that the mcu has dished thus far i was mildly disappointed    although the action was plentiful there wasnt overly much humour typical to the recent marvel titles throwing additional characters for the sake of a tie in seems just cheap tacky and quite frankly pointless    yes there was a couple of unexpected appearances but the russo brothers pushed this to a simple popcorn flick that was neither a captain america or iron man to rave about rather more should have been titled avengers  civil war 2 pmsl
May 10 2016,positive,a good movie that did a much better job of handling multiple characters and didnt confuse the audience the story flowed quite well and left nothing for you to ponder about in one case almost forgot the movie was named captain america when they talked about the other characters more than him i am not a fan of cap in the comics but in the movies i love him i know he just happens to be the only person that steroids actually stuck  but just a sign to let you know how the govt wants to tag everyone also really enjoyed the villian so to speak well played i cannot wait for the others to come out
May 10 2016,negative,bad as far as marvel movies go  the kid they had playing spiderman was terrible
May 10 2016,positive,civil war is a mostly cohesive flick that takes a note from the violence without consequences of its previous installments the fight sequences are slick and enticing however it adds nothing new to the canon besides gritty conflict its main cast feels tired and old the actual civil war conflict feels forced and barely believable its more an excuse for some cool fight scenes and randomly introduced new characters than anything however its real story and emotional core is the conflict surrounding the winter soldier and its done well enough that ill give it a pass because it would have been completely tedious  without the avengers divide beyond that its villain colonel zemo who i assume will be developed into baron zemo is indistinguishable from every other brooding bad guy in the series only his motivations differ and while the plot more or less carries again its only a vessel for its characters who i dont like enough to care about the dialogue is all bantering filler and exposition the relationships between the main cast members feels whiny rather than tense or emotional and because they all maintain their friendships throughout the conflict minus cap and iron man of course the stakes never feel that high what saves it from being genuinely boring is its new supporting cast black panther spiderman and ant man the film paid off in that respect as im now genuinely interested in a new spider man flick and a black panther origins story perhaps this should be a sign to move onto new territory and let the avengers burn themselves out     and a ps did some of the cgi feel crappy to anyone else with a budget this huge bad cg is inexcusable
May 10 2016,negative,this movie felt way to rushed not only that it wasnt even a war overall it was a good comedyaction film nothing more
May 10 2016,negative,full of above average action and special effects but the predictable plot coupled with poor character development and motivations left me wondering if the marvel movies even have to try anymore at a good story
May 10 2016,neutral,constant action with characters as deep as a kiddie pool disappointing
May 10 2016,neutral,very slow movie and to fight to stay interested spiderman was great possibly the best big screen version so far action scenes were nice bu the movie as a whole left a lot to be desired for me
May 10 2016,positive,it was one of the best movies ive seen in such a long time and its even 10 times better than batman vs superman
May 10 2016,positive,there are only a few words to describe this movie awesome action sadness humor and justification
May 10 2016,positive,funny but i didnt feel engage to the actions scenes since they are friends fighting eachother with no goal to kill this might be true to marvels comic but its not the best story  action scenes felt like just super smash melee battle
May 10 2016,positive,great movie with actions going on everywhere but the choosing side thing is not quite well explained
May 10 2016,negative,i am going to say that i have loved all the marvel moviesup to now  i have no idea what movie people have been seeing but i must have seen something totally different  other than the spiderman stuff this movie was putting me to sleep  ill continue to watch the marvel stuffbut out of all the movies that marvel has put out under its own brand this was the worst of the bunch i dont knowmaybe after seeing batman vs superman by warner brothers i was expecting this movie to top it by a long ways  i actually enjoyed that movie a hell of a lot more than this oh wellthey cant win them all hopefully doctor strange makes up up for this
May 10 2016,negative,the introduction of new heroes not withstanding i was bored
May 10 2016,positive,almost as good as the first avengersand the best captain america so far if thats what theyre calling it   
May 10 2016,negative,overrated overhyped movie this is for all the fanboys take that to the bank
May 10 2016,positive,the best captain america yet a must see
May 10 2016,positive,everything you want from this kind of movie while managing to be different just in time to keep the formula from being overdone
May 10 2016,positive,some people like it when there are so many characters in a movie competing for screen time and corny jokes that it feels like someone tried to stuff too many ingredients into a burrito and now the tortilla wont close others seem to feel this sort of thing reduces characterization and causes some characters to become virtually indistinguishable i subscribe to the second opinion captain america civil war is not a bad film although its plot points seem weakly motivated and it has a couple plot holes the film is just okay and this is where it goes wrong its entertaining but not very stimulating
May 10 2016,positive,impossible not to compare this batman vs superman and what an unfortunate comparison for warner brothers that is almost everything wrong about batman vs superman is done well here this movie manages to improve the source material the rather poorly plotted comic civil war and makes a fun entertaining and exciting story it also corrects two problems that have cropped up lately with marvel movies bad villains and no real stakes other than to set up the next sequel oh it also brilliantly introduces two iconic marvel characters black panther and spiderman others take note this is how you make a comic book movie
May 10 2016,positive,awesome awesome movie it is a movie focused on captain america not avengers 25 lots of action with a psychological focus on each character everyone casted did a good job and overall ill be seeing this movie again sometime soon
May 10 2016,positive,first viewing i absolutely loved every moment of it i have to watch it again before i can write any sort of review though go see it go see it now
May 10 2016,positive,this was great aside from my nitpicking that i would have liked to see thor and hulk in there and im not too sold on some of the newer guys this movie oddly has lots of elements from the batman vs superman movie but done so much better
May 10 2016,positive,very good movie  best movies no longer marvel that beats the winter soldier is for my taste the best marvel movie to date hopefully exceed infinity the war 
May 10 2016,positive,its all built up to this a perfect homage to movies with the right balance of actions and more importantly passion that is not seen in the modern action movie you will be moved and you will take sides
May 10 2016,positive,what is it with people hating great movies is it because they just want to stray from the pack or are their standards so absurdly high no modern movie will satisfy them either way this was an amazing movie plot was great villain was wonderful and action sequences were superb this was a captain america movie not an abengers movie for some reason people didnt get that the importance of the movie was not the fight sequences although those were freaking awesome the importance was the relationship between captain america and steve through the conflict of bucky i thought they did a spectacular job amazing movie go see it
May 10 2016,positive,just too amazing for words
May 10 2016,positive,thoroughly enjoyed this movie one of my favorite superhero movies to date
May 10 2016,negative,steve g an amazing criticism but i unlike you am not a comic book fan so i am less forgiving if youre a comic fan go and watch and enjoy if you are not skip it if it wasnt for the superhero clad beings in this movie there would be nothing special and in reality there isnt what im saying is if you love a character youre going to the theater to watch and if the movie is so so your still to an extent going to like it and be engaged because youre invested marvel has done a great job of cultivating their brand thus the undeserved high rating there is so much wrong with this movie see steve gs critique but it will earn well over a billion and marvel will churn out more garbage some day the public will wise up and stop attending but until that time to the general public be fickled  when reading a critic research him a bit before accepting his word as gospel you might be surprised with what you find and his  taste in movies might be quiet different from yours  oh one more comment enough of the one liners please
May 10 2016,positive,finally a marvel movie that strips away the cartoonish villains and hits home with a thoroughly solid thoughtprovoking movie that delivers as much intelligence and dark humor as it does explosions  the plot is grounded in reality while at the same time managing to convince you that there is real danger in the work of the bad guy as much psychological thriller as it is superhero movie it works on a number of levels rdj and chris evans even had to dust off some of those acting chops as these roles required more than hero poses and pithy sayings it takes its time developing the animosity but never strays too far into the unbelievable these are people who at their heart are friends who are having a violent disagreement about possibly the most important decision of their lives and this movie never forgets that    this movie also had what all good blockbusters require a sympathetic bad guy you get his pain you understand it and his actions while monstrous offer a glimpse into the battle being waged inside every avenger    i see that a lot of the negative reviews are stating things like it was boring or slowly paced i suspect these are the types of reviewers who gave phantom menace a thumbs up and think the best part of the prequels is the light saber scenes    see this movie you will not regret a single moment
May 10 2016,positive,has a few plot holes but overall solid addition to the franchise
May 10 2016,positive,team cap all the way
May 10 2016,positive,masterpiece 99  i want to see more of black panther and spiderman
May 10 2016,neutral,marvel just cant cheat me  255
May 10 2016,positive,this is easily the best movie marvel has made  its awesome
May 10 2016,positive,well acted  definitely a movie to see multiple times in the theater
May 10 2016,positive,quite possibly the best marvel movie to date only thing that was kinda lame was it did not follow through with one of the more famous comics in history fast paced definitely need to see it again to understand and find all the easter eggs wow though great movie
May 10 2016,positive,great as avengers 25 a bit disappointed but good enough as captain america 3 there is  no need to mention how great all those action scene are as a fan of cap it is a little disappointed that too much screen time had been offer to other characters and this movie didnt really show caps spirit clear enough it is more like avengers 25 but not captain america 3 but after all it is great
May 10 2016,positive,it is hard enough to create a superhero movie and meet fans expectations it is even harder to introduce new characters and have them relate to the old ones while keeping your special effects editing and pace under control well marvel does it once again captain america civil war finds the perfect balance and creates a captain america movie with many other superheroes without turning into a full avengers 3 film at the end of the day you can tell this is a movie about captain america    even though there are many superheroes in this film each one gets their own time and story even the new characters spiderman and black panther get their own quick introduction which is enough to understand this film but not too much so that we can expect the real explanation when the films for these come out the only complaint i have is that we are still somewhat empty on scarlets witch past although they did make an attempt to portray some of her problems in being the youngest and unable to control her powers properly    the comedic relief is like any other marvel movie just right the film does not feel like two hours and a half it goes by fast however we get more than enough action and from my perspective a superb story and script the battle between captain america and iron man shows the strengths and weaknesses that they are known for showing at the very end why the captain is the leader of the group in the comics    while the movie was a little fastpaced and almost forced characters such as antman and spiderman to make an appearance lets be honest this is what the fans wanted and it came out beautifully using the same comedyaction formula marvel has been using in their movies captain america civil war is a movie that anyone can enjoy    ps team ironman ftw
May 10 2016,positive,ive have enjoyed all of the avengers movies so far and this one is no exception as most of you already know the avengers are forced to choose to stay rogue or fall under government oversight an enhanced human called the winter soldier has been accused of setting off a bomb that killed an african leader but captain america knows him from days past and thinks hes been set up so he is on the opposite side as tony stark who wants to bring him in thus the conflict ensues with about as much emotional tugging as the material allows lots of favorite avengers are in this one including a new spiderman boy and ant man is back too but thor and the hulk are noticeably missing some of the action scenes are very frenetic jumpy and sped up early on which bothered me considering the film had the budget to whatever they wanted but there are also some huge action set pieces that are magnificent to behold i saw it in imax light 3d probably not necessary all in all this is a very good movie for fans as the avengers universe moves on 3 12 out of 5 stars
May 10 2016,positive,while i was entertained the whole time it felt very much like a part 1 movie
May 10 2016,positive,a lot of excessive jokes and a median script made this movie so much inferior to batman v superman
May 10 2016,positive,so glad the russo brothers are taking care of the 2 next avengers movies instead of whedon they are far superior to him
May 10 2016,positive,not expected what it has to be or maybe it just a good movie not a fan of marvel universe but we need cool movies than a drama
May 10 2016,positive,it was a good movie but there were so many hero drop ins and new characters that were not flushed out that to the lay person who hasnt been engrossed in marvel comics since they were 9 might be wondering what is all this airport action scene felt contrived black widow shaky camera work adds to her twitch movement amidst a cast of heroes that can actually do stuff rdj and evans jive well rdj finds perfect counterpoint to bloviating attitude with  new peter parker its a good movie winter soldier was better after a while you lose empathy for barnes and rogerss struggle and start to feel the same way you do when  youre watching cnn pundits break the same news over and over and over throughout the course of a day
May 10 2016,positive,didnt destroy the comic book arc the way hat other comic book based movies do a lot of focus on character development even though these characters have be developed already but in a way of how they interact with each other   con  the best 3d scene is the major fight other than that imax non3d will work also
May 10 2016,positive,near damn perfectwatch it on a group outing perfect pacing
May 10 2016,neutral,review avengers 25 aka captain america civil war    sigh i mustve said that at least a dozen times while watching this movie captain america civil war is a very well made superhero film that has many superbly choreographed action sequences that showcase the characters powers very well that is unfortunately devoid of any real emotional impact i have not felt this indifferent watching a marvel studios movie since thor 2 and although i appreciate marvel changing up the formula by making the stakes smaller and more intimate it didnt save civil war from being a rather underwhelming experience    firstly yes this is a better movie than batman v superman it has a better script better acting and a more appropriate tone but unlike bvs there was not a single moment where i thought wow that was awesome or i want to rewatch that part bvs had several moments like that and although civil war never reaches the annoyingly stupid depths of thor 2 but this may be my second least favorite marvel movie to date    im having a hard time critiquing this movie because im already starting to forget large portions of it the first hour of this very long movie bored me to death but it does pick up nicely later on overall the movie isnt bad id say for most people its perfectly watchable and entertaining the high stakes from the previous avengers movies have been brought down to earth for a more personal conflict between the team itself    the movie is titled captain america civil war but this really is an avengers ensemble cap actually doesnt stand out no more than anyone else actually less so cap may be the center of the conflict but its tony stark who ultimately drives most of the story forward the standout character has to be the new spiderman hes young energetic and likeable so far lets hope that carries over into his upcoming standalone movie because the spiderman character has never been one of my favorites    vision is once again the best character with the best dialogue and is once again underused black panther makes a respectable debut black widow is serviceable yet forgettable falcon and rhodes are once again decent token sidekicks scarlet witch gets to use her powers more this time around but gets practically zero character growth hawkeye and antman feel to serve no purpose other than to even out the opposing sides and to do some admittedly sweet looking moves during a big fight scene at an airport    and civil war just may have the most underwhelming uninteresting boring villain to date its as if the studio is seeing just how lazy they can be with their villains     my big problem with civil war is that nothing seems to carry any emotional weight until a not so surprising revelation at the end the entire film has a sterile bland feel that lacks genuine drama and intensity it may be exceptionally well made on a technical level with plenty of little things to enjoy but its definitely one marvel movie i wont be watching again anytime soon    score 610
May 10 2016,negative,nope complete fanboy fodder overrated big time
May 10 2016,positive,its like been a 8 years boy when you see this movie
May 10 2016,neutral,unlike many of the previous films the civil war felt a bit dull but the circus is in town and   you got to go see it
May 10 2016,positive,a great way to kick off phase 3 marvel fans will rejoice their reluctant movie partners will have a smile on their faces too
May 10 2016,positive,one word motorcycle
May 10 2016,positive,it takes a little while to get going but when it does everything falls into place and is pitch perfect  maybe spiderman was unnecessary but he was one of the films best elements and they got the characterization perfect  im now eagerly anticipating the next spiderman movie
May 10 2016,negative,utterly terrible  worst marvel cinematic universe movie to date
May 10 2016,positive,i was eager to see this movie which surprised me because im not a sucker for the superherovssuperhero frenzy thats currently dominating the genre however civil war plays this newfound trope like a fine tuned fiddle marvel has always had a confidence in its fare but here it is thrusted into a new gear sporting its prestige on its chrome sleeve quick notes this is robert downey jrs most exemplary performance as the acerbic billionaire tony stark to date black panther is the outstanding disappointment here poorly conceived and integrated into the universe and dare i say misscasted the next iteration of spiderman played by the engaging tom holland is a big heaping ball of vital potential for the aging universe i just wish spideys powers were more internal and less strapon gadgetry but hey thats why theres such a thing as future character development
May 10 2016,negative,i thought it was going to be a lot better then what it was
May 10 2016,positive,superhero movies should be fun and this one is for sure   even in its bleak moments of despair or desperation it doesnt feel like the weight of the movie is on the viewers shoulders
May 10 2016,positive,saw it yesterday and loved it
May 10 2016,negative,not surehavent watched the movie
May 10 2016,positive,good if not abit predictable
May 10 2016,positive,captain america civil war full movie       on imgur    on fb 
May 10 2016,positive,technically awesome and filled with jawdropping action sequences  and better than avengers age of ultron  although sometimes its quite silly and exhausting
May 10 2016,positive,with the exception of deadpool ive become bored with super hero movies as of late but captain america civil war finally brings something fresh to the table without stomping on what we all love about the avengers though the plot seems to very much mirror batman vs superman marvel has taken the ambiguity of morality and drenched it in the development of their characters making for an engaging film  the characters are very wonderfully themselves as opposed to the crackfic that was age of ultron natasha is charming steve and bucky are sympathetic and tony is well tony you get the drill    this movie has some of the best action scenes ive seen in a long times with audible gasps coming from the audience when i went to see it opening day  the pacing of the movie is generally very good but the slow start about 30 minutes makes it seem a lot longer than it actually is  spiderman was a wonderful addition and i hope that marvel sticks with this rendition of peter parker  the story is cohesive with the exception of a couple seemingly out of place scenes that i hope will be addressed and dealt with appropriately in the upcoming marvel movies    long story short worth your money worth the wait
May 10 2016,positive,more dramatic than other marvel movies but not to the point where you cant have fun with it it has the signature marvel humor with an amazing variety of characters including spiderman which was played amazingly by tom holland who might be my favorite peter parker even better than the winter soldier which is undoubtedly a masterpiece
May 10 2016,positive,the final show down was so dramatic mi heart was about to explode
May 10 2016,negative,unbalanced and unrealistic way too much bullsht
May 10 2016,positive,overstuffed entertainment but entertaining nonetheless
May 10 2016,positive,you want to watch it over and over
May 10 2016,negative,this movie was horrible
May 10 2016,positive,lots of characters yet none of them feel left out  great movie
May 10 2016,positive,good film good confident performances amazing new spiderman
May 10 2016,positive,where batman vs superman fails to give us real reasons why there should be a rift between the factions civil war shines with the complexity of the characters their backstories and real human emotion without having to be all gloomy very nice work once again by the russo brothers
May 10 2016,positive,contrary to pretty much every review going i dont think this is the best marvel film guardians always guardians  nor is it the best captain film that honor still goes to the leaner and more well crafted winter soldier and it has plenty of issues to go along with all the good stuff like a way too busy plot that never stays in one place long enough to let the film actually fucking settle in which annoyed me a little and it is a victim to modern blockbuster bloat although in all fairness hardly any of it is superfluous to the plot unlike for instance the whole of the plot of batman v superman surprisingly too considering the mostly practical stunt work and action of winter soldier directors the russo brothers fill the movie with distractingly sloppy cgi glaringly computer generated helicopters again what the fuck hollywood but civil war is a bold dismantling of the marvel world and its formula giving us honest to god moral quandaries and stuff to debate as it rips apart our heroes in sometimes surprisingly distressing ways its also a huge movie its ambition is impressive as hell working as simultaneously a gritty political action thriller an espionage adventure a science fiction movie and a big superhero smash up the action scenes are insane the standout being a truly incredibly orchestrated foot chase car chase fight scene early on that is just amazing in its skilled execution another big highlight being the now legendary airport scene which is like a hundred comic book infused dreams coming true in front of your eyes on a big screen its just unhinged joyous madness popcorn entertainment with real balls and guts
May 10 2016,positive,amaizing once again marvel has proved that they know how to make a graphic novel come alive  this film had a great development just enough humor to keep you connected and awesome action scenes i just wish dc would swallow their pride and learn from marvel
May 10 2016,positive,captain america is a rarity of a movie it blends character development action drama and suspense together perfectly altough i was excited i was also concerned if marvel could pull it off one again because of the disappointment that was age of ultron and the huge challenge of creating a movie that resonates well with comic book fans and the typical cinema goer    fifteen minutes into the film and all my doubts were proven wrong   the way they set up the upcoming clash between tony and steve was very believable and also quite heartbreaking robert downey jr as always plays it perfect and also chris evans shines again as cap    the only issue i had with the movie that in my opinion nothing really changed in the mcu    overall i would say its one of the best marvel movie to date and a perfect watch for anyone who can appreciate a great movie
May 10 2016,negative,not good or horrible somewhere in between
May 10 2016,positive,captain america civil war is a fresh and entertaining film that is able to keep one eye on the action and leave the room wanting to see the movie again impeccable performances  mesmerizing action  still for fans of comics as i can be some disappointment  eventhough it keeps the essence of the comic and has moments of comic traced 
May 10 2016,positive,marvels masterpiece  a two and a half hour rush that feels like 90 minutes that ponders the cost of doing the right thing and the unexpected results of collateral damage  while this is being sold as authoritarian vs libertarian leadership theres a deeper common thread  an instant classic
May 10 2016,positive,while the crossbones piece of the movie seemed out of place and short i would that overall the movie was a great action filled popcorn flick
May 10 2016,positive,5 starsnuff said
May 10 2016,positive,not that many movies make me want to see it twice this is one of those movies
May 10 2016,positive,i think the director should more focus on caps inner world i mean this is film captain america right not ironman
May 10 2016,negative,dissatisfaction somebody stop this comicbook ruining conveyer spiderman was nice though
May 10 2016,positive,it had a lot of really well directed action as well as really emotional scenes so so good have seen it twice did not disappoint
May 10 2016,positive,1  teamloser  deandeandean
May 10 2016,positive,to have these many characters on screen and everyone has their moment to shine is incredible well paced dramatic and just down right an entertaining movie
May 10 2016,positive,ive outgrown the continuous introduction of new characters in marvel films and this one feels like one of those gary marshall ensemble cast movies with all the characters coming together in this one so when they revealed black panther and hollands spiderman i was more like meh than anything else however what the film executed perfectly is the split between cap and tony over the idea of government limitations on hero actions i bought into the conflict and even chose a side myself whats especially great here is that the division feels real and not just a tiny conflict thats immediately resolved a rift has opened between the avengers and i hope it lasts for at least another movie
May 10 2016,positive,marvel has changed the superhero movies paradigm doesnt matter the origins the suits the powers there are superheroes in the world and they can appear where they were needed but they are humans or have humanity and are complex beliable and you can emphatize with them
May 10 2016,positive,some nauseous shakycam early on but smooths out into awesome thrill ride  lack of hand holding may confuse people new to the mcu
May 10 2016,positive,civil war is standard marvel fare action packed with dollops of drama and humour
May 10 2016,positive,the cap movies had been the most adult parts of the marvel movieverse with civil war the creators took another  big step forward and made the best solomovie of the franchise for me only the first avengers movie and the partially connected guardians of the galaxy were better civil war brings a weighty thoughtprovoking but understandable dilemma great or even better and shaded old and brilliantly involved new characters with amazing visuality and action the big story towards thanos levels up and the bet is higher than ever before the best news is that the audience is still excited
May 10 2016,positive,good movie in general tense and fun action scenes were exciting having some problem with the plot seems to me they had chances to sort things out in peaceful way but forced into fight by the script
May 10 2016,positive,captain america civil war reaches a new milestone and sets a new bar in superhero films we officially live in a post captain america civil war world anyone who gave this film a less than great reviewwellthis type of film just isnt really for them this is a big piece of cinematic history
May 9 2016,positive,baron zemos role in the story was incredibly unbelievable felt like they did a sloppy job of writing him in just so that iron man and captain america would have a reason to fight that being said i enjoyed every minute of this film
May 9 2016,negative,not really very good quite boring and final battle a little dumb
May 9 2016,positive,in the the twelve marvel cinematic universe mcu films that preceded this one weve come to know a thing or two about tony stark and steve rogers in a sentence iron man is brilliant cocky and irrepressible he thinks he can get away with anything and usually does captain america on the other hand is straitlaced noble and dependable a goodytwoboots who wont even swear when earth is on the edge of armageddon now heres the plot of joe and anthony russos civil war in brief a proposal for political supervision of the avengers splits the heroes into two opposing factions  those who agree that the avengers need to be held in check by the government and those who believe that they should be accountable to nobody iron man and captain america head the warring groups which groups do you think they are most likely to lead    wrong and therein lies the beauty of the marvel movies more than glossy visuals spectacular action sequences and masterful marketing this is what makes marvel special they understand their characters just like the rest of us these characters arent necessarily what they first appear to be and their beauty isnt spandexdeep isnt it possible that tony starks unrelenting bravado might be hiding some dark wounds could these repressed issues catch up to him someday denting his confidence if not his suit  isnt it conceivable that caps unerring moral compass would one day point in a direction away from popular opinion after all what is morality if not the ability to be a minority of one once you think a little deeper about these people the answer doesnt seem that obvious anymore civil war does this thinking and somehow manages to do it while delivering one of the best action films to have ever come out of hollywood    nope not an exaggeration the movie is packed with mesmerizing action sequences i had typed breathless in the previous sentence too but deleted it because its an inaccurate adjective just like all good longdistance runners this movie breathes there are gaps between the jawdropping action set pieces and these are used to intelligently further the story the script achieves a mindboggling balancing act it draws out the iron man v captain america conflict with some intelligent ethical debates it finds time to develop nine other characters by my count while introducing two major new heroes and one villain it sews up stories from past films in the mcu and sets up new ones oh and at the end it turns out that the movie has been a kind of detective mystery all along weve just been too bedazzled to notice    captain america civil war    the russo brothers emphasize their mastery in other ways as well the movie anticipates questions that the internets legion of smartalecks might ask and dispatches them with a smirk wondering where thor and hulk are theres a snappy line of dialogue explaining that away think marisa tomei is too sexy to be an aunt theyve got a quip for that as well when you watch certain scenes you realize they were photoshopped in the trailer to hide key information hell the studio has the nerve to drop black panther and spiderman in the middle of their story without troubling with backstory marvels complete command of their universe was most apparent to me when after a rather heavy moment towards the middle of the film they had the audacity to cut to vision cooking in a sweater muttering a pinch of paprika make no mistake these are storytellers at the peak of their confidence         while this is at its heart a captain america film special mention must be made of two other characters the first is iron man the early career of robert downey jr introduced us to an actor of remarkable abilities but he hasnt really had the opportunity to showcase his talent since taking on the role of iron man in 2008 this film finally changes that we get to see much more of tony stark here perhaps we see who he really is for the first time because weve seen tony joking around for so long it really means something when he is serious much of the films emotional heft comes from iron man and downey soars to the challenge with a fantastic performance the second character is spiderman sigh how do i put this i wont attempt to distill into words the giddy highs of spideys introduction into the mcu all ill say to marvel is you had me at queens    this is easily one of the finest mcu  films to date hell its one of the finest films in the superhero genre although slightly shy of perfect when most people think of the climax to spiderman 2 2004 they think of peter parker battling doc ock on the new york subway that scene was so spectacular that it overshadowed the movies actual ending which featured a milder waterfront confrontation civil war has a similar problem although im really stretching in calling it a problem the sheer brilliance of the movies airport sequence means that the twenty or so minutes that follow it make for a slight anticlimax    finally i have to end with a comparison to this summers other superhero civil war batman v superman dawn of justice i hate to draw a parallel but the similarities are too strong to ignore both films are about warring heroes both have troublemakers that try to incite and exploit the rivalry between the rival camps both feature other enhanced beings that have to be recruited to a cause both debate the accountability of superheroes in the world however the difference between the two movies  pun intended  is stark while i enjoyed bvs i cant objectively defend it as a good film  even people who havent read a comic book or watched a superhero movie will know the iconic dc characters but warner bros failed to make us care about them marvel on the other hand makes us gasp when falcon or war machine seem to be in danger a great man once said that it is our choices far more than our abilities that show who we truly are this is the true difference between the two films dc went for spectacle without story marvel gave us both dc showed us how cool their characters abilities were marvel told a story  about choices
May 9 2016,positive,this was half an hour too long that is my main complaint it was also hard at first to follow all the storylines but in the end it was cool witty action packed and worth seeing
May 9 2016,positive,i really wanted to give this movie 55 but as amazing as the dialog and conflict was it felt rushed both on the build up and on the resolution  cap going from american hero to terrorist because hes my friend felt forced and underwhelming  the movie is beautiful funny and exciting yes but civil war was too big an undertaking for only one film to resolve  a great movie well worth a rent borrow or buy but i feel some potential was left on the table
May 9 2016,positive,the marvel movies have had their ups and downs but theyve been consistent there isnt one that really stands out either as a dud or a great until now this one is most definitely in the great category    though it feels more like miniavengers movie than a captain america movie theres really very little to complain about a truly impressive feat given that the movie contains 12 heroes  6 each for team cap and team iron man all of whom are given moments to shine seriously all 12 of them are given their moment in the sun and they all make the most of it this is a movie that should feel cluttered weighed down by too many characters and it really doesnt    the story is truly something to behold there is a lot of good discussion about power who wields it who guards the guardians all of this is debated with the winter soldier front and center of it all all 12 heroes are given if not outstanding believable actions for the sides they take some doing it because they agree with our two heavyweights others out of friendship for said heavyweights    the performances are all solid but the mvp is far and away robert downey jr this is without question his best performance as tony stark and if the year is rather weak he should merit consideration for a best supporting actor oscar nomination hes that good downey brings the pain of the consequences of his actions in the previous entries in the marvel universe to light and does it wonderfully you truly can feel the toll his actions as iron man take on him    a few of the action scenes are edited a tad weirdly the cuts are a little too fast and some feel a tad off luckily the piece de la resistance an epic fight at a leipzig airport involving all 12 heroes is one of the best action sequences youll see there is no other word for it its badass antman and spiderman are particular stand outs for this epic clash    as is standard for the marvel movies our villain is pretty forgettable but thats not really daniel bruhls fault he does what he needs to do and does get one great moment at the end    marvel has entrusted the russo brothers to do infinity war if this film is any indication infinity war is in insanely capable hands
May 9 2016,positive,there be spoilers ahead    i had looked forward to this movie not with the sense of dread i felt at the release of batman v superman im still angry with snyder over that one but with the understanding of how great winter soldier was and the rave reviews    i read the comic books in which this movie is loosely based on while im not overly fan boy of the series it had a good basis of the division of beliefs this was the first failing of mcus version of civil war there was no earth shattering repercussions for all of the characters complying as the girlfriend pointed out if they were ordered to go somewhere they felt strongly against just dont go not to mention that the only real issue that cap and co had could have simply been negotiated it wasnt reveal your secrets or go to jail like the comic series wherein so many heroes families would have been in dire jeopardy no it was we need some oversight here the justice league can do it but the avengers stomp their feet and whine    the sharon cartersteve rogers moment was more forced than the sudden romance between clark kent and lois lane in man of steel made no sense as there hadnt been proper build up    the actual villain of the piece zemo wellhe failed miserably were talking john travolta in punisher fail great concept great actor terrible execution tear the avengers down from the inside after they let my family die thumbs up sneak off to mother russia to kill off extra winter soldiers that didnt have any part in the movie so whats the point so we have a fight in the missile silo between cap bucky and iron man whaaaaaa lame villain worthy of john travolta in swordfish love ya travolta youve just had some bad film choices brother    but what really lost me here was the revelation that cap knew how tonys parents died and who killed them and didnt tell him from the lack of reference of time its likely he knew this prior to bucky taking a shot at fury or shortly thereafter so cap rips stark apart in age of ultron for hiding things the screenwriters and director have just turned cap into a deceitful hypocrite steve makes the hard choice as the mcu version he would have had the conversation and have been affected by it as howard stark was a companion to steve for all the man of steel haters over what happened to zod this angers me just as much if not more so it wasnt an instantaneous choice but a prolonged reinforced decision making process that has rendered captain america as morally askew as congress    the saving grace was the rest of the avengers and the fun fighting tom holland has been praised enough that you get it the banter from all of them was quite deliciously good    great premise beaten down by stupid decisions
May 9 2016,positive,the problem with this film is it was so entertaining that i was heartbroken that it ended my spoiled ass was sitting through both of the post credits hoping the scenes had something pushing the story further but thats not the case or at least not for the first post cred scene the side characters were intense and made the story have more layers in depth it had a good balance of positive and dark moments i love it
May 9 2016,positive,amazing one of the best comic book movies of all time
May 9 2016,positive,i watched the movie twice already still love it the second time best action and comedy so far
May 9 2016,positive,12 films two phases one big interconnected universe or shall we say universes several superhero introductions and appearances and after a lacklustre phase2 the marvel cinematic universe mcu hits the ground running with the first film in its phase3  steve rogers aka captain america has been the moral compass of the avengers even before the formal formation of the team in a way he actually led to their formation but for what purpose he would say that it is to make the world a safer place but what about collateral damage and with whom does the accountability and responsibility rest with regards to the irreparable damage thats caused otherwise does it not warrant a mechanism to keep things in check but most importantly who is to decide what the right way is where is the moral compass supposed to tilt then  these questions were raised in the source material for the movie the eponymous comic series by mark millar and the film raises the same and more but why do we the viewers care about this it is because we have invested ourselves emotionally in the mcu and the films in it for such a long time we care about these characters because even as superhuman they are the viewer surrogates to the questions of rights and wrongs fair and unfair justice and injustice however improbable or impossible the situations may be and this investment pays off in a massive way in civil war the movie as we are presented with the same dilemma that our beloved characters at the end of the movie we come out questioning what and more importantly who was right and that is the biggest achievement of this film and the creative team behind it  following the events of avengers age of ultron which lead to the death of numerous people in sokovia the avengers who found themselves fractured at the end of that movie on ideological grounds and more civil war picks up with another operation that goes haywire and leads to a catastrophe the ramifications of this event are felt the world over and countries unite and devise a plan to keep the avengers in check that plan is the sokovia accords which will enable the united nations to take control and supervise the activities of the avengers who will only undertake missions sanctioned by the higherups this obviously does not sit well with steve rogers who believes this to be an attack on the avengers ability to make right decisions at the right time and may actually lead to the misuse of their powers tony stark rejects this theory because he sincerely believes that it is time for them to be accountable for their actions and there could be no better way to do so the fracture deepens however another worldshaking event blows everything to hell with the winter soldier aka bucky barnes the alleged primary culprit for the same and the avengers break away for steve it is the question of trust on bucky his childhood friend that drives him forward while for tony and many others it is the simple fact that bucky needs to be stopped the wedge thus driven deepens with the ensuing conflict that also involves the ruler of the african nation wakanda tchalla and a certain teenager called peter parker loyalties shift friendships break and all this leads to an emotionally resonating payoff  this is not an avengers movie this is a captain america movie and chris evans brings out his best we all respect and adore cap and evans respects this fact his cap is still the righteous one and though there are several moments where it seems like he may blink or even doubt his own beliefs he comes back to questioning himself about the idea of justice and the righteous path to achieve it he is not a superhuman he is a man who believes in certain moral values who just happens to have superpowers and it is this inherent quality of the character that evans taps to its fullest in bringing this conflict to life the film is laced with humour and wit and this works to exemplify its charm even further robert downey jr leads the pack in this case apart from getting to showcase the emotional side of tony stark in his best performance as the character yet anthony mackie who plays falcon tom holland as the new spiderman as well as paul rudd as antman provide some much needed respite chadwick boseman as tchalla holds his own against so many heavyweights and he along with players new and old paul bettany don cheadle jeremy renner scarlett johansson elizabeth olsen and emily vancamp make for solid supporting players theyre never relegated to the backseat and get their parts done in a satisfactory manner another new addition as helmut zemo is daniel brühl who is such a fine addition to the ensemble that you ache to see more of him in terms of setpieces the film is loaded to the top with them with the leipzig airport sequence acing them all  the real winners here are actually the writers christopher marcus and stephen mcfeely and the director duo the russo brothers who not only understand the emotions that drive these characters superheroes or not but also make sure that the stakes are sufficiently high throughout the movie so that the viewers remain interested i have no doubt they will ace the twoparter avengers infinity war saga and will bring the mcu which would by then would have grown 18 films larger to an exceptional close  with all being said this is the best marvel movie ever this is to the mcu what skyfall is to the bond films and this is one movie you shouldnt miss
May 9 2016,positive,there were a lot of little details that bothered mebut overall the whole movie was epic the character were great and expertly written into the storyline it was about as fun as it could have been easily the best of the series
May 9 2016,positive,just awesome top 3 comic movies ever made
May 9 2016,positive,the best movies of super heroes ever  you name it 
May 9 2016,positive,enjoyed the movie but would not consider it great  the closeup action trying to create fast hitting action was a little weak for me  was expecting better
May 9 2016,positive,both sides of the story crafted eloquently  its an action packed political thriller on par with the winter soldier
May 9 2016,negative,plot and substance nothing new for so much praise what about its development could have been much shorter with better sequencing and editing a worthy marvel movie going experience rather the opposite it was one of those films where i felt completely exhausted during and after
May 9 2016,positive,perfectly balanced superb fightaction scenes
May 9 2016,positive,amazing spiderman and black panther  3 amazing character development  dc comics take notes
May 9 2016,positive,great movie i will be reseeing it in the near future
May 9 2016,positive,marvels greatest yet
May 9 2016,positive,only one word awesome this makes me respect cap not only as a great cinematic hero so badass he beat the crap out of every other hero in the movie but with the right ideas and attitudes you do not let fear and a committee of bureaucrats tell you what you should or should not do with great power comes great responsibility it was a shame that the equally awesome spidey ended up in the wrong side but that of course was tony starks fault
May 9 2016,positive,i have had a bit of fatigue watching comic book movies of recent  they seem a bit redundant with regard to story and action sequences  i heard this movie was really good and i went in with modest expectations  i liked the previous two captain america movies  this was odd because before i had no exposure to the character  i have to say that civil war is not only the best captain america movie it is the best movie in the mcu    the action sequences are top notch  fight scenes were well choreographed the movie involves all the characters at a deeper level something which i felt the previous avenger movies did not do  it also personalizes the main character captain america better than any previous solo marvel movie did  the back and forth between iron man and captain america was priceless  im surprised it took this long for captain america to mention to tony stark that he knew his father  i thought that would have happened in the first avengers movie  but im glad it came up in this movie as it clearly upped the stakes with respect to their alliance
May 9 2016,positive,i thought this was brilliant like everything superman v batman shouldve been but fell so short of great twist and storyline
May 9 2016,positive,so captain american pisses off iron man or is it visa versa  either way it makes for an entertaining movie and one of the better marvel films as of late better than ultron  thats right folks ballwars break out at a massive scale between these superheros and refreshingly they care when innocent people are killed  that actually plays big into the story and gives the bad guy an interesting character arc  should people in spandex be regulated by a world conspiracy government or should they go off and blow up city blocks just to save the entire world  good question  no one seems to think that saving the world is more important than killing a few innocents so its game time  also if you are a cat person there is a catman in this who likes to save cats from trees when he isnt playing ultimate ballwars with the winter soldier  enjoy  even though i havent seen batman vs superman i can probably tell you this will be way more worth your money
May 9 2016,positive,this movie was awesome
May 9 2016,negative,terrible movie made ironman a bad guy way too many super heroes
May 9 2016,positive,i really needed this after age of ultron no big complaintsand i loved spiderman black panther and antmans inclusion into the team
May 9 2016,positive,spiderboy was the best parts
May 9 2016,positive,action packed amazing action sequences
May 9 2016,positive,i absolutely loved it i wasnt expecting anything special from spiderman or antman i honestly thought those characters  wouldnt fit the movie but i have to thank marvel for making me excited again about spiderman and for giving substance to both characters in the movie even if they werent the central feature of the film
May 9 2016,positive,possibly marvel film studios best movie yet dc and warner bros should sell their film rights to marvel
May 9 2016,positive,the russo brothers take the reigns again on this continuation of the captain america story and although cap is the super followed most closely the avengers ensemble plus some newbies to the disneymarvel studio universe make it more a continuation of the avengers plot in my opinion this is a big improvement dramatically and actionwise over josss age of ultron effort since it is all about the split between the superheroes the villains or maybe simply obstacles is a better label zemo played by daniel brühl and secretary of state ross played by william hurt as well as crossbones and the other super soldiers are not memorable civil war asks what is the line between hero and vigilante is there redemption for brain washed assassins like bucky barnes and is forcing those with super powers or super suits to register with the government the right thing to do many of these characters are welldeveloped now for movie audiences after multiple film appearances we know them we love characters on both sides of the divide even if we are not familiar with their comic book origins there are life and death stakes even the newer characters like tom hollands version of spiderman paul rudds antman and chadwick bosemans black panther are immediately appealing there are many big actioneffect sequences that are exciting and advance the plot rather than being messy freeforalls kevin feige and his team at marvel have a great grasp on the storytelling arch in this cinematic universe
May 9 2016,positive,batman v superman had great elements potential and the promise of great things to come the concluding chapter to the captain america trilogy has all that and works as a great movie on its own it may not be completely fair to compare the two but civil war easily shows have you can have a complex plot a large cast of characters and entertaining action and still make a great film
May 9 2016,positive,marvel studios delivers once again and of course they do they havent let us down in a long long time my only wish was that it had more characters on each side im team cap 55 a the whole cast delivers  the new spider is phenomenally cast
May 9 2016,positive,great action some occasionally funny dialogue and great acting but honestly felt like a little taste for things to come in the upcoming avengers film rather than a captain america film  76100
May 9 2016,positive,best marvel film to date the plot is a bit thin and the villain underwhelming but the only point of the movie is to have fun watching the avengers fight each other i really enjoy the direction from the russo brothers
May 9 2016,neutral,civil war is a mediocre film with some great although misplaced elements throughout the action scenes apart from the one at the airport are poorly filmed like the entirety of the movie which looks visually boring and ruined by an awful edit the soundtrack is generic and also boring technically the only thing thats are good are the sound effects even the vfx are way too noticeable what was supposed to be an epic and ideological confrontation feels too small and ultimately disappointing when its revealed that its all being not very well orchestrated by zemo which is one of the worst and most cliché villains you could have asked for with a ridiculously complex planto show a twominute video none of the motivations are very strong and even spiderman which is amazing by the way is shoehorned in the story and is completely unnecessary to the plot civil wars worst mistake though is what is becoming marvels most dangerous one it feels pointless by the end of the movie not much really changed and even if the journey matters more than its destination its mostly a boring and confusing one
May 9 2016,positive,actiondramacomedyall packed into one great movie marvel does it again
May 9 2016,positive,saw it in 3d imaxbest superhero film ever so far  this one goes to eleven
May 9 2016,positive,well written good movie
May 9 2016,positive,marvel is just taking over great movie loved it  i know the true comic book heads are crying on who was on who side but it was great regardless will watch again
May 9 2016,negative,because it wasnt that bad to be a 12 star
May 9 2016,positive,good fighting scene id say
May 9 2016,positive,homem coxinha  homem de ferro  tony stark  teamcap
May 9 2016,positive,absolutely amazing movie must see movie of the year
May 9 2016,negative,i dont know a couple of my favorite superheroes were in civil war but 
May 9 2016,positive,mindblowing go see it if you havent already
May 9 2016,positive,sometimes i want to punch you in your perfect teeth says robert downey jrs iron man to chris evans captain america early in civil war at the risk to betraying my hashtag sympathies i couldnt agree more captain america is likely the least interesting of the main avengers a dogooder beefcake with a kindadumb aesthetic his fishoutofwater tendencies are his redeeming feature and hes vastly outpaced in that department by thor hes a bland hero which makes him a fine center for the action of others but a difficult sell to carry his own movies the first avenger was fun enough thanks to its wwii period setting and winter soldier similarly had fun with format while placing half of the starpower demands on the evercapable shoulders of scarlett johanssons black widow its no secret that civil war is an ensemble piece and much more of an avengers movie than a captain america one whats surprising is that while civil war still doesnt quite sell cap its the best iron man movie since the first one came out eight years ago    the central argument of civil war iron man defending regulation of the avengers while cap demands autonomy is sold surprisingly convincingly and with as much gravitas as possible without being too ridiculous the avengers leave a wake a destruction with little culpability tony stark recognizes this at long last after creating the last avengers supervillain in ultron while captain america ironically is untrusting of government intervention its a neat inversion of their character types but one that makes sense in context the decision of teamcap or teamironman really does come down to how tethered to reality the mcu is if we can believe that the avengers are some incorruptible moral force then un oversight is clearly a terrible plan especially given that we know that william hurts thunderbolt ross is a bit of a megalomaniac however the movie pays much more than lip service to reality putting the avengers to task for the collateral damage they are responsible for for caps side extra motivation comes when bucky barnes reappears as the winter soldier possibly framed for an attack on the un while a mysterious operative played by daniel bruhl lurks on the sidelines barnes is probably my least favourite character in the mcu a mopier steve rogers with a toocoincidental origin story and his reappearance is a bit too much after taking a major role in the last cap outing but hes a cog in the big machine this time and suffices as a plot device to divide the extended avengers sans hulk and thor plus spiderman and black panther  what is really remarkable about civil war in the context of the mcu is how it keeps the stakes relatively small floating cities and alien invasions are nowhere to be seen and while bruhl is an effective and memorable villain in the underwhelming marvel pantheon the conflict is nearly entirely between heroes while not nearly as many faceless lives are at risk the battles seem to have real consequence and are miles more engaging than anything in age of ultron the action scenes in the first half are a less involving as they mostly involve the team fighting goons with guns but when heroonhero action starts civil war finds its feet fast and produces the most flatout enjoyable mcu scenes since the first avengers  it helps that marvel has crafted its squad so carefully while some of the motivations for the minor characters are fuzzy notably hawkeye and antman these characters work best when together paul rudds antman is more enjoyable in his five minutes in civil war than the entirety of his own movie and anthony mackie proves himself once again as the secret weapon the cap movies the two big new additions tom hollands spiderman and chadwick bosemans black panther are both great even given semiawkward introductions spiderman in particular is a joy easily stealing the movie and injecting some muchneeded new blood the scene where all these personalities meet is worth the price of admission alone  if the mcu films havent worked for you civil war isnt likely to wave the problems away theyre still dumb fun which uses physics any way it wants and takes itself maybe a smidge too seriously but they nicely avoid the darkness that plagues their dc bretheren in favour of sheer joy while cap is as uninteresting as ever the cast around him is exceptional and the interplay on display is fantastic fun the movie doesnt hit the reset button and nicely sets up future mcu films by leaving some distrust sown among the heroes im sure a big space alien will force everyone to make nice again soon but mining trouble in paradise has led to one of the better marvel films even pieces are getting tired
May 9 2016,positive,marvel hits another home run as a giant dc fan i would recommend this movie for the half hour of spiderman alone
May 9 2016,positive,love it love itjust wish they were not fighting eachother like that love how they put everyone in it
May 9 2016,negative,the same as evey marvel movie in the past 5 yrs 
May 9 2016,positive,fantastic absolutely fantastic in every sense    few trilogies have gotten exponentially better with each installment but you can now add the captain america trilogy to it
May 9 2016,negative,skip it enough said
May 9 2016,positive,thoughtprovoking and very well played captain america civil war had me with so much emotions the final act was truly a shocking moment their were dull moments in there that might put some viewers to sleep and thats the first hour in the film second hour is amazing and fun the best mcu film ever made never in a movie had made me think about the characters so much that when they fought they had a good reason too its so memorable and unforgettable
May 9 2016,negative,im telling you folks this is not a very good movie long and boring i watched it last night maybe i was tired from saturday night but i dozed off a couple of times skip it unless youre a comic nerd then i say enjoy
May 9 2016,positive,russo brothers did it again 
May 9 2016,positive,absolute awesomeness
May 9 2016,positive,this movie is amazing it contains lots of depthemotionactionand interesting story chadwick boseman kills it as black panther tom holland is awesome as spider man chris evans delivers again and so does robert downey jr the russo brothers have delivered another amazing captain america film  
May 9 2016,positive,i really loved this movie go and see it right now
May 9 2016,positive,theyve prolonged it  but didnt fail to entertain
May 9 2016,positive,review timethis is redunkulously long sorryalso i get geeky about the fightingi really like the fighting    marvel did it again with another brilliant movie im not sure what to say to be honest i got nothing to bitch aboutit was amazballsumok how bout this ill rate the characters and state why theyre superior to anything dc has done i need a little fuel for the fire and nothing gets me going like acknowledging how much dc is fuckn up here we go    captain america  hes everything ubermench aka mos should have been he stands for something hes a good man he inspirational upbeat and positive he believes in people and stands by his friends and hes all heart like with boxing not the captain planet version of heart in civil war you get to see cap at his finest a culmination of 3 movies of character building that presents you with a protagonist you actually care about mos emphasize with and understand because of who cap is you know why he does what he does thats how you build a great character thats why great characters are great im talking to you zack snyder  egotistical prick cap was great and i love his fighting style he was kind of a brawlerwrestler with drop kicks and throws direct and powerful attacks with a flashy acrobatic moves tossed in here and there his shield attacks were creative and fun just like in the comics    ironman  ironman was great rdj had his serious face on for this movie and his augments for registration or the accordswere valid eeeven though he did kinda cause it all all the fighting styles were unique which was one of the things i loved most about this movie ironman used mostly haymakers and alot of hand blast and some of his arsenal i felt like i do when i play marvel vs capcon 3 all the different fighting styles make it more interesting the only comparison to dc that i can make is the relationship between the 2 pairs of heroes in civil war there is an established relationship in bvs theres nothin cap and tony had history and chemistry bs just had alot of hypocrisy i dont like you cus youre dangerous well i dont like you cus youre dangerous momsgtfo here if ironman wasnt an intriguing character then cap wouldnt have been an intriguing character and the conflict would have sucked this is what 2 heroes fighting each other is supposed to look like    black widow  scarjo has one of my favorite lines in the movie    falcon anyone tell you youre kinda paranoid    black widow not to my face why did you hear something    lol i thought that was so fucking clever her fighting style is brilliant bw would have to have an incredible amount of stamina to pull of this fighting style in real life a lot of fast movements and throwing her body around just when i thought she was using her legstraddleflip move too much she changed it up making it never the same move twice she really fights like she has to put someone down quickly i would much rather see a black widow movie than a wonder woman one i could give 2 shit about that version of ww in mos bw is witty capable and hot not to mention a little shady which makes for a very interesting character    i think this review is gona get long in the tooth youre a real trooper if youre still reading d    falcon  holye fuckn shit i loved falcon in this  his abilitiespowers tech whatever got so much cooler    wing shields    so fuckn good all the tactical stuff too    wing rockets    redwing    pantsomg some poeple might hate but falcon may be slowly becoming my fav marvel character holy christ he was cool as shit and his fighting style while using his wings was awesome hes not a close quarters fighter but he seemed highly adaptable and versatile i really like this character his relationship with cap was well established and believable and i see him as more of a partner and friend in civil war than a side kick    bucky barne the winter soldier  ive heard some people complain that he didnt emote enough or he didnt have a personality that made him easy to emphasize with these people need to shut the fuck up and go watch the first movie which establishes cap and buckys friendship hes been the winter soldier since then and the winter soldiers brain has been scrambled hes messed up in the head hes not bubbly and charismatic cus hes trying to deal with the guilt of killing a shitton of people cus some quasinazis used him as a meat puppet his fighting style seemed a bit more vicious than everyone else alot of heavy punches and throat grabs made him seem very menacing tws uses his metal arm alot when fighting even using it as a shield which i thought was really cool buckyforcap2018or2019orsometimeintheforseeablefuture    hawkeye  hawkeye is scappy he was a distance fighter shooting arrows that never missedawesome even tho he lost every hand to hand battle it was fun as shit to watch hawkeye doesnt give up even when fighting the vision who ridiculously outmatched him i love watching him try to kick ass and his use of arrows was clever    black pannopenot yet    war machine  war machines arsenal is atrociously sick theres a scene where someone tries to hit him with a semitruck or semitruck trailer no i think it was an entire frickn semitruck trailer and all and he machine guns and missilerockets that thing to absolute shit lol it was beautiful rhody and tonys friendship again well established was great and it hit me right in the feels when that scene from the trailer came up i had no idea how they were going to play that i cant bring myself to ruin it    vision  ok so ive been giving alot of glowing praise to this movie but vision is one of my small complaints and its a little dumb    why was vision wearing clothes    it didnt make him look more human he looked so weird and out of place like when people put clothes on dogs college professor sweater aside i like that they are building a relationship between him and scarlet witch cus its straight from the comics and keeping the characters close to the comics is important zach snyder vision fighting style was mostly power based or a show of power slow deliberate movements power blast and phase and density shifting vision was trying not to hurt anyone while also trying to intimidate i think thats how i would do it    so much typing lol my fingers hurtalmost done    the scarlet witch    i loved tsw she was the power on caps side and man did she use it shes hurln cars and fuckn up vision shes kinda unstoppable i do have to admit i miss that scary aspect of her from the post credits scene of ca2 the winter solider and the beginning of aou that eerily quick jerky movement she had is gone and i hope they bring it back she doesnt punch or kick anyone its all power moves which is cool cus it shows how much she can doscarjo is still waaaaay hotter tho just sayn    time for the main attractions    antman  lolsigh holy shit  from the time antman came on the scene to the last time you see him hes funny and clever and a pure fucking joy to watch hes that kind of joy you get when youre eating a really good cookies and cream milkshake and ur getn sad cus your almost done with the milkshake and then you realize the bottom of the cup is filled with oreo cookie bits    still with me good thats how awesome antman is just when you think he couldnt be anymore awesome he does some more awesome shit im not even gona say nothin else all um gona say final word on antmanorange slices    mic drop    spiderman  perfect    what more could you possibly fucking want    ok ill give you a little more    was he too young nooope  did his eyes look not rightridiculous nooope  was he too quippy nooope    he was everything spiderman was supposed to be and fought multiple people falcon the winter solider cap antman he was on fire sonfyeyaaaaa    well i think thats it i covered all the heroes um the villain was imo the best villain so far his character had a lot of heart hes did some irreparable damagemaybe probably not tho so yea thanks for reading i cant believe anyone would read all of this its like a frickn novel ha ha i guess my next review will bnonooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo    i saved the best for last son    black panther bitches    yes yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaasssssssssssss bitch  black panther was so fuckn badass ive been waiting to do this review cus i need to calm down ive seen the movie 3 times and i could be wrong but i think hes getting better every time i see it im pretty sure he waved at me like chris reeves did at the end of the first superman movie    black panther when he fought was an embodiment of bruce leehe even struck a bruce lee posed before his fight with bucky jim kelly and wesley snipes fighting with attitude and a lot of kicks he just might be the best hand to hand fighter  i was so worried theyd fuck his character up cus hes the best black superhero ever made dc has no equivalent to black panther none im just so glad marvel didnt make him the comic relief star wars force awakens or a crying whiny bitch walking dead or lightskinned or whiteno offense to any lightskinned or white readers but this is important most hollywood movies    black panther was a strong  confident capable nonsidekicklike black character that doesnt die horror and xmen movies  and its aboutdamntime    i love marvel for giving me the movies ive been waiting to see since i was a child and i intend to throw as much money at this movie as i possible can if youve read this far you are fucking amazballs    later d
May 9 2016,positive,civil war will stand as one of the most ambitious and successful superhero movies for a long time it is a prime example of how an intimate emotional conflict between a select few can be balanced with incredible action sequences and a densely populated secondary cast of characters the story is fairly mature and the newly introduced heroes are a welcome addition to the cinematic universe plus the photography and humour are surprisingly outstandingly captain america movies are going from strength to strength
May 9 2016,positive,the reason civil war is one of the better marvel films is because it shows the consequences of what the avengers battles create in the world therefore making the audience never look a fight scene the same again the inclusion of the winter soldier and baron zemo being the perpetrators of the chaos which cause the avengers to separate only exacerbates how power even with the intention of good can be manipulated    wonderfully acted and directed civil war is the filmlite version of the comic of the same name however still manages to yet again change the direction of marvel movies
May 9 2016,positive,thought it was great it was hard to watch the avengers beat the crap out of each other though  really wanted thor and the hulk in it though
May 9 2016,positive,it belongs there up there with the dark knight avengers and captain america winter solider as the best all time of the genre it balances tone action and characters perfectly while it may not be perfect its a perfect comic book film
May 9 2016,positive,full disclosure i was a marvel collector back in the day that said i have loved moves way longer than comics despite some strangely close similarities captain america civil war was just an infinitely better movie than batman v superman the more i think back on civil war the more i like it the writing of this movie is much deeper that many see it being a fan of the original comic story and based on early story opinions i went in on team cap within the first 30 minutes i realized this story was not the comic arc captain america and iron man were two opposing but similar viewsopinions on how americans and the world want think or wish american power to be used neither side was going to be right throw in the winter soldier as a metaphor for how special forces are used abused and this movie was headed to a dark spot  but in full daylight    all of that deeper meaning aside civil war was a lot of fun the airport fight was worth the price of admission alone i love the political thriller feel of the captan america movies and this third trip paid off big or should i say in a giant way i didnt even get to the black panther but now i just want to see his stand alone movie
May 9 2016,positive,no wow moments but it did its work of keeping you entertain
May 9 2016,positive,i saw the movie with my friends and it was pretty good a lot of action to deal with
May 9 2016,positive,so much better than batman and super man    what a difference
May 9 2016,positive,everything age of ultron wasnt id recommend seeing it in 2d vs 3d the first time as the action sequences are so off the hook you cant track them with 3d and you will miss stuff everyone had a role to play with a great story
May 9 2016,positive,probably the best movie of the mcu the russos have done it again
May 9 2016,positive,a superhero tour de force super vs bat shouldnt even be mentioned in the same breath as civil war
May 9 2016,positive,not what i expected it was better
May 9 2016,positive,pretty awesome every character is done really well the mood of the movie follows winter solder and for some reason that off set me but it was great
May 9 2016,positive,yes you can dub this an avengers 25 almost but just remember it is indeed a captain america movie hence the story focusing about the civil war but still much about captain america also if youre expecting it to match the civil war comics obviously youre going to be heavily disappointed it basically takes the concept of tony and steve fighting about a registration act thats really the only thing that comes from the comics so if you can accept the fact that it is its own storyline that is loosely based on the comics you can thoroughly enjoy this movie with the surprise that spidey makes a little bit more of an appearance than just a short cameo i have to say this is my favorite mcu movie to date hell best superhero flick so far period
May 9 2016,positive,very well done didnt seem as long as its 226 running time
May 9 2016,positive,very entertaining action with a no so compelling plot
May 9 2016,positive,exactly what you want in a superhero movie
May 9 2016,negative,civil war was a big disappointment     i think i have seen this generic disney marvel comic book action movie once or twice before      the rift between the avengers is so weak and unbelievable to happen at a drop of a hat  they cant come to an agreement in one meeting so they decide to fight each other it even though they are the avengers and friends    no one even seems too serious about fighting each other except cap america and iron man  and then they want to kill each other and then end the movie with cap america sending iron man a love letter saying  sorry we are friends still    the villain  who the hell is he  basically loki from the first avengers try to pit the avengers against each other   which he succeeded over loki in doing so    action sequences were awfully shot because of the shaky cam
May 9 2016,negative,i dont think this movie was that good
May 9 2016,negative,didnt really liked it either fell asleep a couple times
May 9 2016,positive,awsome action it was not like the comics but its still a awsome movie you should go see it 
May 9 2016,positive,great and exiting movie need to watch it again
May 9 2016,positive,another perfect film for the marvel guys now if we could only get the other guys who work with the other superheros on track
May 9 2016,negative,amazing action sequences plot is coherent but boring
May 9 2016,positive,its ok but a bit long and a avengers film no matter what they tell you these films are getting to be very samey and i preferred ant man and deadpool to be honest
May 9 2016,positive,this movie is awesome i simply do not have a single negative thing to say about it best marvel movie since the first avengers
May 9 2016,positive,mixed positive feelings want to watch all over gain
May 9 2016,positive,this feels a lot like batman vs superman but just so much better the first captain america film is still my favorite and really this could have been an avengers movie rather than a captain america movie anyway very entertaining film
May 9 2016,positive,goooood better than i thought got kind of lost  trying to back track to the previous movies but thats my fault lol
May 9 2016,positive,so basically tom holland steals the show that being said captain america civil war is an extremely solid entry to the mcu
May 9 2016,positive,the best of the 3 captain america movies
May 9 2016,positive,captain america civil war 3d2016pg13may 7  bythe movie guy    captain america civil war is marvel comics newest superhero flick a thrilling  highly entertaining blockbuster  the best of the three captain america movies six months after the pivotal events in age of ultron most of the original avengers team has dispersed  gone their separate ways with the exception of steve rogerscaptain america chris evans  natasha romanoffblack widow scarlett johansson together they are leading a new team scarlett witchwanda maxinoff elizabeth olsen falconsam wilson anthony mackie war machinelt james rhodes don cheadle  vision paul bettany on a mission in lagos nigeria to track down hydra agent brockton rumlowcrossbones frank grillo unfortunately the mission results in collateral damages  the loss of innocent lives which has become too often the result of the avengers actions the united nations decides that the avengers can no longer operate as free agents  must agree to oversight according to the terms of the newly drafted sokovia accords or retire this splits the group into two factions ironmantony stark robert downey jr heading up the faction in agreement with the sanctions  captain america heading up the resistors ultimately they must face off against each other in superpower combat the film is directed by anthony  joe russe from the script written by christopher markus  stephen mcfeely the performances from the staff are solid  the action nonstop there are two postcredit scenes for diehard fans see this film which is showing in 2d 3d  imax 3d
May 9 2016,negative,captain america  civil wars is a repetitive bore slow to get moving and then it becomes stretch a long one that alternates between sketchy conveyed expository dialogue and excessively choreographed fights ruined by a combination of mtv editing and a preponderance of seizure inducing camera work that jittered jostled and in general neared the visual incoherence of a transformers movieand for christ sake tony stark get even more bruce wayneish with newly revealed murdered parents issues what desperate drag this wasnot that it was badly made to be sure cacw had the marvelhouse style that makes sure that matters of camera angles  cgi effects fight scenes and editing are executed and presented in seamless fashion there is a bland professionalism that has taken over marvel studios that are making their films stylistically indistinguishable from one another less so say than the sort of factoryassembled cop shows that dominated 70s television    this is a shame of course because the captain america tale on film has had a wonderful arc on screen prior to the latest offering beginning with the heros origins in ww2 expanding splendidly in the first avengers film and evincing great potential for political intrigue with their plot borrowings from three days of the condor with the second ca film captain americawinter soldier this more closely resembles a saturday morning cartoon show in the vein of animaniacs where there are dozens of recognizable and more obscure pop culture personas running about in a varied states of frenzy and violent upheaval only to each take a beat to deliver a quip a joke an ironic aside humor blended with accelerated mayhem is marvels signature but the glut of heroes fighting heroes each with a polished repartee is too much of what used to be a good thing the film seems like watching the last acts at comedy store amateur night and at other times it comes across as characters auditioning for their own franchises cacw seems only in service to set up the future of the marvel universe  underconsidered alternately plodding and manic hysterically talkative jittery and jumbled as an action enterprise this film is a selfdistracting mess
May 9 2016,positive,based on the accolade this movie had received i was excited to see it i should preface with i am not hugely in to the marveldom that is this genre of movie i do however enjoy a good action flick and if a action hero is in it no problem this movie however was just a bit boring the storyline was a bit nonsensical and the action was relatively unspectacular all in all i felt like this movie was average to put it on par with a great movie that would be deserving of a 90 rating is flat out silly
May 9 2016,positive,amazing from start to finish
May 9 2016,positive,despite some minor missteps civil war stands as one of the finest marvel movies with a tense and emotional story good humor and some great action
May 9 2016,negative,this is a movie you would only watch once that says a lot   marvel has been playing it too safe on their movies as of late  one word  boring  you will get that same feeling when you saw age of ultron  simply disappointed  the villain zemo is weak and not interesting  they could do better  some good stuff  spiderman and black panther were breath of fresh air  seems like marvel is getting uninteresting on every movie  the 1st ironman avengers and captain america are the only good movies that came out of marvel
May 9 2016,negative,a boring film which has well shot action sequences with decent performances the stand out being robert downy jr but the film fails on pacing and especially the plot the motivations are clear but there isnt enough conflict for me to think they really have a vendetta against each other     also characters such as ant man and especially hawkeye were just blatantly forced in in addition to that spiderman also felt placed in just for the airport fight which you saw in the trailer he was there for the fight and then just left the actor of spiderman tom holland was good as peter but as spiderman he falls flat and this primarily the scripts fault they force joke after joke and they all fall flat     overall this isnt the worse film ever has a decent opening with some good action sequences but the plot and pacing lets the film down    310
May 9 2016,positive,a thrilling addition to the marvel film franchise that is more so the avengers featuring captain america  the showdown of rogers vs stark was well done and if felt like every character had their moment onscreen especially the addition of spiderman      although the story is solid i wish they would have pulled more from the comic books  there were some similar character arcs but i think following the registration act storyline is something i would have preferred to see onscreen
May 9 2016,positive,could have been twice as long and i wouldnt have complained
May 9 2016,positive,1991  one of the first things you see at the start of this movie  i took time to try and remember what was i doing in 1991    crossbones  crossbones  poor guy  he revved up his gear for nothing    black widow  theres a signature move that black widow has where she does this jump sit around someones neck then twist around to bring them down  its a pretty bad ass move but im tired of seeing it she first did it in iron man 2 and 23 times here  needless to say natasha is that chick  who else can kick ass in jeans a biker jacket boots and not break any sort of a sweat    scarlet witch  the growth of wandas character from when we first saw her in avengers age of ultron to now is compelling  she saved a couple of her team mates lives  when youre in these types of situations where you are whowhat you are you have to expect casualties of some sort  the crossbones blow up sure she could have directed him elsewhere but if she wasnt there to save cap there would have been just as many casualties if not more    the vision  the vision is just an amazing character  i could listen and watch him talk all day  the sight of him being in clothes and cooking is rather weird but cute  obviously hes highly intelligent his moves and decisions are highly based on logic and facts  the conclusions he comes to from those two things makes sense but the conflict is that hes not a human  in the comics the vision and scarlet witch are married so the tender moments shown of their budding relationship was probably shocking to some but appropriate  the airport battle scene he stood firm in the side he chose and his actions  aside from scarlet hurting his feelings when she decided to leave the compound with hawkeye he seemed pretty upset that opposing heroes didnt get it perhaps comply is a better word here that was quite surprising    the falconred wing  im proud of how far they have brought the falcon and his gear  to make red wing a drone  brilliant  in captain america the winter soldier you could tell that sam had been a little bit rusty with his gear  the upgrades and im sure intensiveextensive practice that hes had im excited to see whats next for him  he also didnt seem to fit in sort of an outsider new to the team literally hes more comfortable amongst others  him and caps friendship has grown you also got to see a bond forming between him and bucky which im sure is important to cap  three amigos reincarnated    the winter soldier  most times when you are introduced to a villain or former villain in this case you see how they come into their own they accept who they are the power they posses to become some evil rude untouchable person  i appreciated seeing the struggle of him not wanting to turn into this remote controlled assassin because not too much of who his character is was exposed in captain america  the first avenger  a lot more was shown on the strength with his metal arm which is by far his greatest asset    captain america  this 3rd installation of this series was probably what brought the storyline back full circle to the beginning  the friendship and loyalty between steve rodgers and james barnes  steve rodgers is very much so a voice of reason which is why me being teamcap was a no brainer  hes not a one directional thinker he assesses the entire situation weighs pros and cons of all outcomes and makes a valid decision based on the right thing to do humanly possible  hes an exceptional leader that can take blame and owns mistakes hes made  hes the guy that you can always count on he keeps his word    tony stark  tony has these neck jerking mannerisms i dont know if its a robert downey jr thing or a tony stark thing  but during his barf demo the younger version of him did them it was funny and annoying at the same time  in iron man 3 we saw that tony started having panicanxiety attacks due to everything hes been through as iron man and on the avengers team  at the conclusion of iron man 3 he got rid of the chest piece  theres a scene between him and steve where he tells steve that he and pepper are on a break  so his decision to sign the accords  i get it  to me he was looking for a way out somewhat of a break  alfre woodards character blaming him for the death of her son was more than likely the nail in the coffin  we found out who was responsible for the death of tonys parents in the winter soldier movie his reaction could be deemed appropriate because who wouldnt react like that  the issue that i had with that is if the tables were turned tony would have had rhodeys back 1000 yes one thousand percent    peter parkerspidermanaunt may  first off who casted marisa tomei as aunt may  they need a bonus  the older versions of aunt may were played out  so glad to see a fresh face  speaking of fresh faces peter parkers casting was also perfect  i loved toby mcguire in the first set of spiderman films i think the amazing spiderman cast was more in line with who peter parker was but this casting is and will probably be the best casting thus far  hes young impressionable funny awkward a dorkgeek given the opportunity to travel abroad and hes concerned about homework    antmangiantman  antman to giantman not a big surprise that he would do that being that they released the giantman funko pop figure but it was a nice touch  my hopes are for the next time we see giantman hes mastered his movement and coordination    baron zemo  for some reason i wanted there to be a better reason why baron was pitted as the bad guy  i understand the tie in from age of ultron that sparked his interest in being pitted against captain america but it just didnt work out well  his motive though valid was lacking like the writers just said oh lets make him a victim of what happened before  anywho  was that his famous death ray that we saw contraption he was hiding in the hotel closet  an ode to his real character perhaps    tchakatchallablack panther  it had already been circulated that tchalla being in this movie was due to the death of tchaka at the hands of the winter soldier  so i was not expecting to see tchaka though brief tchakas role was highly significant his character iswas well respected exposing the audience to how he governs wakanda obviously the black panther being a part of this cast was a major staple for this film  ive never seen so much respect given to anybody in a film as respect was given to the kings of wakanda very awe inspiring  there was a bit of intrigue surrounding tchallas first scene in the movie i think everybody was holding their breath waiting for him to appear and speak  the vengeance he had was subtle yet fearsome he has a warrior spirit that seemed to be underestimated  he made his intentions very clear and was set on seeing them through  wakanda is a rich nation far ahead of its time if you stayed to see the post credit scenes you saw a snippet of this  the chasing scene where he clamped onto the falcon was ironic being that he is a cat and the falcon is a bird    stan lee  i almost forgot that stan lee was supposed to make a cameo  he showed up at a great time when spiritsfeelings were possibly down  his placement is always impeccable    movie  i never thought iron man could actually beat cap in hand to hand combat iron mans intelligent system even told him that  tony is nothing without his armor once an opponent realizes that its a wrap  so the comic storyline of civil war is that captain america dies  going into the movie you have no idea how it will end  im glad that none of the heroes were killed a lot of us became attached to them and their stories theres so much more that could be shared with fans that it would have been unwise to kill off key players  with that being said im pleased that someone had to be sacrificed there couldnt have been a complete happy ending  unfortunately rhodeywar machine may be grounded for a while but with tony and tonys money tech by his side im sure hell be back at em soon  theres a connecting theme that started in the avengers that persisted through age of ultron and made its way here to civil war the team is easily torn apart  by 1 person  they have no trust in each other as unit  though they always seem to come together in the end and prevail they seriously have to work on that in preparations for the next avengers movie  infinity war  cause thanos  the movie wasnt as intense as the winter soldier was and i think for once im ok with that
May 9 2016,positive,much better than expected
May 9 2016,positive,excellent well worth staying to the very end xx
May 9 2016,positive,this is what comic book movies are all about great scripting scenes that flow as naturally as water two of many problems that batman vs superman suffered from    marvel has stepped up to the plate again and has hit a home run with the captain america series
May 9 2016,positive,not my fave cap movie i love winter soldier and there were parts i wish were done differently but there were parts i loved including the spidey bits i just didnt feel like this was a cap centric movie i feel like stark has mor screen time and lines i still look forward to seeing it again on the screen and owning it on bluray and chris evans should get 5 stars for those arms of his ã
May 9 2016,positive,after avengers a weekend with ultron now its  captain america civil squabble p
May 9 2016,positive,everything i thought it would be and more this movie takes you through a roller coaster of different emotions  the story is smooth and easy to follow so nice to really see my comic book heroes come to lifewow its just an amazing time to be a fan  thanks marvel
May 9 2016,positive,why do they whisper before they kill someone weird
May 9 2016,negative,this movie was marvelnot
May 9 2016,positive,seriously best movie this year
May 9 2016,positive,as action films go this is a fanboys wet dream
May 9 2016,positive,really enjoyed this movie the only downside for me was spiderman
May 9 2016,positive,this film is everything i possibly could have wanted and so much more its a nearperfect superhero film and is truly one of marvels best films ever made period
May 9 2016,positive,probably the best mcu movie since the first avengers its funny well written and bursting with well choreographed action scenes and chemistry between the actors unlike batman v superman which built a plot on a shaky premise and felt amazingly rushed this movie takes its time allows characters to develop  and builds an intriguing plot its remarkable how successful this movie is my only gripes is that its very very safe for civil war a film youd expect to create some huge ramifications for the film universe but it doesnt nevertheless this is a high calibre superhero blockbuster
May 9 2016,positive,great interweaving of heros in a hero v hero movie that outshines bvs tenfold boycott dc til they get their act together and fire that idiot zach snyder
May 9 2016,positive,it feels very long as there are several unnecessary corny sequences but a few extraordinary action scenes and intense dialogues keep it more or less exciting the best part is seeing most of the marvel heroes going at it also they finally found the right peter parker
May 9 2016,negative,this movie is for kids
May 9 2016,positive,marvel knocks it out of the park yet again    in this latest installment into the mcu the russo brothers attempt to make a movie that incorporates what feels like a dozen different characters and make them all work  do they accomplish this    youre damn right they do  not only do they manage to make a movie with all these moving parts work  they manage to make us care about those moving parts  everything from the dramatic elements to the beyond astounding action to the humor and to the new characters introduced this shows what happens when a movie fires on all cylinders    not only does the movie fire on all cylinders  it manages to make a movie that has so many characters still focus on the human story between brothers  what brothers am i talking about  the brotherly relationship between steve rogers captain america  bucky barnes the winter soldier and the brotherly relationship between tony stark iron man  steve rogers  the writers narrowed in on what makes these characters tick and broadcast it to the audience in an almost a perfect way    the evolution of the characters we have come to know are shown in full force  from the guilt that tony stark feels about all his actions in previous films to the distrust that steve rogers feels towards governmental control  these two evolutions between these characters have now come to a head and explode in an ending that is entertaining to watch but also heartbreaking at the same time  while stark feels he has been betrayed by one of his closest friends rogers feels that he has to protect his best friend bucky at all costs and the consequences are dire     so the characters we have come to love have a place to shine but how do the new characters do  how does black panther and spiderman do in this film  well they just so happen to steal the show  tom hollands spiderman is something of pure joy  the decision by marvel  sony to make this incarnation of spider man a teenager in highschool has shown to be a decision of genius  tom holland nails this role down completely and it is shown in his conversations with tony stark and the way he is throwing out one liners in battle  round of applause for tom holland as spiderman but the real star was chadwick boseman as black panther  boseman details everything about this character perfectly  everything down to the accent to his presence in a room to the ruthlessness in his fighting style encapsulates the black panther perfectly and after seeing this movie the black panther solo film is now on my most anticipated    the only negative about this movie is a rushed romance arc that really had no place being in this movie and the main villain in this movie i never felt his plan made sense and relied too much on coincidence    overall this movie is a fantastic movie and worth of your money  go see it first chance you get  my movie rating is a 455  justin ramos
May 9 2016,positive,tackling a film with such a boisterous character count is no easy task even for a studio powerhouse like marvel but the same studio that brought us several other heroic blockbusters delivers once more and proves that no roster is too big for them every character gets the screen time they deserve and plays a welcome part in the story mcus new spiderman is a total treat and one of the films highlights the spotlight shines on captain america however and his fight to preserve the liberty of himself and friends while the climax is a tad underwhelming this film is proof that marvel studios is the reigning blockbuster champ
May 9 2016,positive,best to date from marvel studios
May 9 2016,positive,i swear that whoever plotted the mcu they should be given some special oscar for keeping the fans coming back time and time again  this was as good as or better than any other avenger movie
May 9 2016,positive,best superhero movie ever
May 9 2016,positive,best film to come from the mcu yet the russo bros know exactly what theyre doing and it shows repeated viewing highly recommended ill be going a second time i dont even know where to begin to describe how much fun this was to watch and im hesitant to tryif youre reading this then just go see it already
May 9 2016,positive,out of either of the first two captain america movies this one surpasses them both however i still am giving this a god but not great rating because i still cannot stand captain america a little communication would have helped him and his friend a lot iron man was amusing as always and the extra characters made up a nice touch spider man was great the team convolution and the mixed messages about each characters goals were a bit annoying and the fights didnt always seem intense based on the fact that they all knew they were friends overall this was an entertaining glimpse into the marvel heroes but not even close to the best
May 9 2016,positive,marvel never seems to fail better than bvs but slighly overrated by critics i would have given it 81 loaded with action but nowdays directors are not focused on villains they want to put a fight between superheroes themselves
May 9 2016,positive,an amazing culmination of the mcu so far with some of the best action and character sequences to date  the film does a stunning job at getting you emotionally invested into these characters in a way not many marvel films have pulled off its incredible that the russo brothers and the screenwriters were able do all of this  its impossible not to appreciate the sheer magnitude of all of the characters on screen and all of the separate storylines weaving perfectly between each other     i cant say the film is without any negatives  even with everything important going on it can drag a hair here and there  that could mainly be due to expectations though and wanting to see the next big fight sequence especially when you know the masterpiece airport scene is just ahead  while the film can have some perfect cgi it can also have some jarring cgi work that somehow made it to the final cut minor spoiler for ending  as for the ending while there are consequences and fallout to the films events the last 5 or so minutes are shaped and presented in a way that leaves the film on an oddly hopeful note  one that almost cheats the audience of the dark and powerful scenes that came before it     even with those minor flaws the film worked and that is a spectacular achievement on its own  on top of all that the film gives us the best spiderman yet and an incredible and breathtaking portrayal of black panther    civil war is one of marvels best  one that carries those spectacular action set pieces but doesnt forget its characters in the chaos  if the russo brothers can pull this off i am shaking with excitement at what they have in store for the finale of this mcu saga
May 9 2016,positive,best superhero movie since the dark knight so frickin good tom holland as spiderman was amazing no pun intended
May 9 2016,negative,my least favourite avengers movie still good but not great
May 9 2016,positive,i think this movie is a lot of fun and cool but i hated baren zemo in the comics zemo was very cool but they changed him into a guy that made the avenger fight one another by the way spiderman was freaking awesome
May 9 2016,positive,after some processing and some mental digestion i can confidently say that captain america civil war is the best super hero movie since the dark knight and has become the golden standard for films of this genre be warned if you are a fan of the good vs evil this film will disappoint you it is good vs good hero vs hero whether its intentional or not marvel studios has set out to destroy the popcorn movie making the line between art and entertainment blurry and unrecognizable most impressive is the way the film flawlessly adds depth and a personal element to every hero involved and there are a lot marvels resident funny guys ironman ant man and iron man feed off each other exceptionally well to create what is probably the best comic relief ive ever seen in a super hero film which is a great distraction from the heart wrenching fight to the death between beloved heroes weve all come to adore my only complaint is the title mostly because it is in no way a story about captain america but a story about the avengers and their personal struggles to fight for what believe in while protecting others civil war had my approval and i highly recommend it
May 9 2016,positive,bruh   amazing movie from beginning to end teamironman
May 9 2016,positive,while it does feel more like an avengers sequel much of the time the central conflict centers around a rebellious captain america this is still very much his film and the personal conflict between himself bucky and stark is what really drives the drama the action is sometimes a tad too chaotic but its always a lot of fun overall this is one of the best films in the marvel cinematic universe
May 9 2016,positive,best movie about the civil war ever
May 9 2016,positive,i saw captain america civil war on opening day and until now i had held off posting a review to it the reason for this is that i wanted to give the film much time to sink in i wanted to absorb what the filmmakers had to offer and really consider what they brought to the table this time around the fact that i left a superhero film made by marvel studios no less and had the desire to stop and think about it is a testament to what this movie brings and is certainly noteworthy this is not to say that the films content or its narrative is polarizing controversial or hectic but rather that it is a meticulouslymade film so much happens and the movie is successfully so many things at once    civil war is the thirteenth instalment in the marvel cinematic universe and to say that there has been much built up for this film would be a massive understatement at its core it is a followup to 2014s captain america the winter soldier and 2015s avengers age of ultron after several battles much destruction and casualties met in cities around the world in the previous films people are frightened by what the avengers are capable of the government decides to push for the antihero registration act a law that limits a superheros actions so that the population is reassured that there is restrain and control to the avengers and they cannot be held accountable for vigilante activity disagreement over international oversight of the avengers fractures them into opposing factions one led by captain america and another by iron man    the films greatest strength surprisingly comes from its story in many ways civil war is as large actionpacked and entertaining as the avengers instalments that came before but now we are exposed to a noncartoonish plot and the movie explores thoughtprovoking themes this is part of the reason as to why i held off reviewing the film immediately after seeing it as it is one that demands to be reflected on i love the avengers and avengers age of ultron but even i will admit that if you take out all the wonderfullycrafted characters gorgeous action and music one could take notice that they are dumb plots albeit wellwritten on one hand they are meant to be silly plots as their premises are relatively straightforward easy to understand and demonstrated as clearcut black and white good vs evil in many ways the avengers movies are similar to 1977s star wars with that said i would equate captain america civil war with 1980s the empire strikes back this is a darker more mature instalment beyond the cruel and personal intentions of a mostly lowkey villain there is no good or bad side to the main conflict the film does an excellent job making the viewer understand both sides without at any point giving leeway to one end more than the other from a narrative standpoint its a good problem not to know who to root for and how this story is going to end     this is not to say that this is a film all about politics at its core this is a film about friendship and relations about how new ones can build old ones can fall some can be maintained and the situations people can be put in when we are finally exposed to the measures they would take to get what they can and keep whatever else they can because of this it is also a story about how clinging on to just about anything can reveal ones true colours  of course none of this would matter if you dont care for these characters the good news you do care for these characters theyre wellwritten wellconstructed differentiating and memorable much of this is also due to great acting performances the acting in the mcu movies has always been good enough but this was the first time i felt the acting the filmmakers understood that this was a story that needed to be felt in order to be delivered so time is taken to get to know these characters and all the actors are provided with a balance of comedic moments and dramatic moments and almost everyone shines    one could argue that civil war is a noticeably slowerpaced film than its predecessors but i found it to be a necessary evil as the buildup is strong makes for great character development and it added atmosphere to the overall arc spread across this powerful story and all its little bits is goodquality action that never lets up albeit a little bit too much shaky camera in the earlier action scenes the viewer is always capable of making out whats going onscreen and feels every hit and blow that is delivered this is very fine action in a superhero movie there is so much variety and every superhero has at least one shining moment without ones display lessened compared to another    for all these reasons and more civil war is a nearperfect blend of the extravagant entertainment that was the avengers and the serious politically astute captain america the winter soldier both of which were my favourite films in the marvel cinematic universe i understand that some may glance over this instalment for not bearing the avengers title but just how the avengers was the payoff to the buildup which was that films predecessors captain america civil war is the same with no disrespect to avengers age of ultron civil war is a more worthwhile and significant chapter in the mcu with that film surprisingly acting as buildup for this one    though not a perfect movie captain america civil war is the closest marvel studios has gotten to that state it gets my full fivestar rating and is arguably my favourite superhero film to date
May 9 2016,neutral,loved the movie but they get 25 stars for aunt may
May 9 2016,positive,a moral dilemma in which neither side is really right and each side truly believes in what theyre fighting for  the fight scenes especially the airport scene thats been heavily featured in the previews are super fun and highlight the different powers of the heroes
May 9 2016,positive,best comic book movie ever         
May 9 2016,positive,what an entertainingemotional  intelligent and smart film for a blockbuster with the perfect humour  russo brothers are the best thing that happen to mcu   marvel is really on a right track if this is the beginning of mcus phase 3 then i couldnt wait for doctor strange d i should say this is the best marvel movie yet  so far 
May 9 2016,positive,captain america continues to prove to be the mcus most worthwhile franchise with civil war an actionpacked and engaging ride that smartly understands the moral dilemmas of these largerthanlife characters
May 9 2016,positive,captain america civil war you would think that captain america would be the at least be one of the main focuses in the movie i was sad when they made him a side character in his own movie i was also upset that they took a very important storyline and turned it into a mid afternoon soap show a for baron zero i felt like he had no development and wasnt even the real villain in the movie i really couldnt tell who the main antagonist was    on a positive note i can full get behind spiderman and black panther they both succeeded in their complicated roles with flying colors     cap deserves his own standalone movie to complete his trilogy not ironman 4
May 9 2016,positive,somehow an amazing plot definitely a clear cleaver and interesting story line for someone like me not super heroes fan or comics literate detailed enough to understand the characters and conflict      despite of the amazing plot and maybe because of the complexity of it you cant really connect or take a side  audience hasnt a real emotional connection affecting the experience of civil war
May 9 2016,negative,not what i expected no villains in this movie
May 9 2016,positive,movie was awesome right from the start it pulls you in the battles were great not in the dark like must battles are you see everything love the storyline kept you on edge with a emotionally twist you have to love this film
May 9 2016,positive,a great take and a fun ride it was confusing at times and i wasnt convinced that stark suddenly grew a conscience
May 9 2016,negative,terribly simplistic and drab as always character interactions are entertaining but when the plot tries to present a nuanced conflict it borders on ridicule  the movie eventually dismisses its own implied depth and arrives to a blunt and thoughtless resolution that undermines the characters theyve created its a cheap crowd pleaser but a dumb one at that
May 9 2016,positive,the reason it works so well is that weve come to care about these characters across several films and what they go through and the decisions they make are genuinely affecting for this movie universe and the audience captain america civil war isnt the best film in the mcu but its the most emotionally impactful and rewarding one functioning as a superb sequel to the two captain america and the two avengers films while working as its own thrilling and entertaining blockbuster that balances the politically serious narrative with the comicbook fun
May 9 2016,positive,loved it so much   given that the theme of the year seems to be superhero versus superhero i was slightly cautious despite being a diehard marvel fan but the viewpoints of both sides were both very well argued thought out as well as having substantial evidence
May 9 2016,positive,thought provoking compelling funny and emotional this third installment offers something unique and well written into the mcu not in a while have i seen a film this large with great new characters well fleshed out old ones and a story so dividing in the best sense good job russo bros and great job marvel
May 9 2016,negative,kind of dull wouldnt recommend unless youre a marvel superhero fan
May 9 2016,positive,even with all other the avengers and superheroes in it it still felt like a captain america movie not an avengers movie
May 9 2016,positive,actually pretty good  i felt that the two notable new characters spiderman and black panther both felt like they slid into the film very gracefully and did nothing but add  the film is rooted in character and ideological conflict and while theres a bit of evil mustache twirling to get there theres no magic thought control or evil sorcery to get there  its paced well and feels really good    the actions a bit muddy at times but not to the point of dysfunction  this is avengers 2 best to avoid age of ultron and just watch this one
May 9 2016,positive,what can you say another awesome movie from marvel beautiful story telling with great humor in between
May 9 2016,positive,fantastic  msg to dc comics game on bitches
May 9 2016,positive,captain america civil war was a great entertaining movie for the whole family to enjoy  it was a little too long of a movie for my eight year old  he stuck trough it till the end  it was action packed  cant wait for the next installment of this movie  the one thing this movie should have toned down was all the political government and un propaganda  i guess its expected like all the previous captain america movies
May 9 2016,positive,this movie is way better than batman v superman
May 9 2016,positive,everything you ever wanted from a team superhero movie they finally got spiderman right a little miffed that black widow filled the fem comforter roles while the only other woman on the team was locked up being protected
May 9 2016,negative,civil war was much too convoluted for its own good the conflict between iron man and captain america didnt need to involve more than 4 characters as a result you get a halfhearted fight of people who really didnt want to fight each other they strayed so far from the source content that the added characters lost their meaning in the comics spiderman was the heart of the entire story as his decision to reveal himself and sign with the government signaled several people to believe in their cause his later decision to switch sides was a turning point in the story none of which was touched on in this adaptation if spiderman and black panther werent thrown in to promote their future solo movies would anyone have even cared black widow and hawkeye arent needed and if they simply sent them on a mission to find the hulk the story wouldnt have changed all all that being said black panther was excellent the final fight between iron man and captain america was very good even though they got the winner wrong
May 9 2016,positive,really enjoyed it with my 3 boys  fun movie  and gets away from the standard format of fight  loose lick wounds  fight win and the new guy is great
May 9 2016,positive,i dont usually review movies but i had to for this one   it is by far one of the top 3 if not the best superhero movies to date the fight scene was one the greatest movie events in the past few years not just super hero movies movies in general  the movie is a blast where every character is perfectly exemplifies every character in a flawless and amazing way
May 9 2016,positive,this movie is phenomenal the characters are welldeveloped you have emotional attachment with them the movie is still a definitive captain america movie but each character has their own moment to shine
May 9 2016,positive,unlike batman v superman i dont think it took itself seriously enough
May 9 2016,positive,one of the more entertaining films in marvels super hero movie cannon this one makes up for the travesty of the last avengers film with a film that is full of characters and a lot of fun the captain america vs iron man conflict is set up believably and within character for each of them and the film does a good job with all the other multiple marvel characters that show up for such a crowded film they manage to get character bits in for everyone and introduce black panther and spiderman also the main villains plan is awfully convoluted and seems like it relies on a lot of things happening that he had little control over but thats probably the one flaw in this film one of the better super hero movies made and certainly the best from marvels cinematic universe
May 9 2016,positive,marvel has done it again the russo brothers are two for two now as they have taken so many characters and put them into the same movie and made it a coherent nonjumbled story captain america is indeed the main focus of this movie but the amount of added depth that they have given to tony stark is amazing he is seen in a whole new light now the relationship between cap bucky and iron man is astonishingly beautiful and i cannot wait to see what comes next the action is some of the best i have ever seen in a superhero film and there was a lot of it the villain was complex and brilliantly acted by daniel bruhl this is one of the best marvel movies to date and one of the best comic book movies period 465
May 9 2016,positive,really good action and good acting by the cast with decent direction on an halfway decent storyline
May 9 2016,positive,good storyline great fight scenes and a good mix of pathos and humor   equal parts fists and quips this is classic marvel storytelling   verdict a must see for any longtime marvel fan
May 9 2016,positive,it was pretty awesome
May 9 2016,positive,great plot great effects great acting
May 9 2016,positive,i was mind blownthis is the best marvel movie to date very well made the connection to the other movies mcu the action sequences are amazing  cap and buck vs ironman wow the best one is the airport sequence that truly is the best battle ever made in a marvel movie the development is made perfectly there are many emotional moments as wow moments spiderman is the best one ever like the comic he is amazing in this movie and the jokes are well delivered reference to star wars and other movies great adaptation antman steals the show and surprises and black panther a true badass must see guys is a very well made movie  you understand each hero motivations some minor nitpicks but thats all overall 1010 see the other movies very recommended  this movie blown away can t wait to see it again  see it in the biggest screen you can
May 9 2016,positive,winter soldier stands on its own and a great superhero movie but can one watch civil war without seeing either of the avengers movies or other solo films its the most connected solo movie of the mcu but it was handled perfect no over crowding smooth introductions the story flowed well cool action sequences it may have been more an iron man movie or just avengers rather than ca as it seemed his role was limited but whatever there was no need for a true villain here as subject of govt involvement and resulting conflict was enough another great installment in the mcu
May 9 2016,negative,everyones motivation is so contrived as to be unwatchable  how did tony stark become so dumb  or capt america  or any of them  just a mess  i now feel like marvel is just stealing from us and feels no obligation to even try to make a good movie any longer
May 9 2016,positive,captain america civil war marks the end of the captain america trilogy of marvel films  it simultaneously brings an end to the story that started with captain america  the first avenger while also serving as a jumping off point for phase 3 of the marvel cinematic universe    with a runtime of 2 hours and 37 minutes civil war uses every bit of that time to tie up all the emotional loose ends of the past 5 years of marvel movies  a daunting task for the russo brothers and writers christopher markus and stephen mcfeely  but they succeeded by delivering an epic morality tale centered around the two biggest names of the mcu    picking up right after the events of age of ultron the avengers team is called into question after a botched mission causes innocent casualties  this leads 116 countries drafting the sokovia accords asking all superheroes but namely the avengers to register themselves and be held accountable to a government subcommittee  naturally as the title of the movie implies this causes some mixed feelings in the group    civil war gets its title from the famous marvel comics run of the same name but make no mistake this is a captain america movie that manages to surpass its predecessors in nearly every way from action to storytelling and especially emotion you believe that every hero in this film is keeping it 100 and over the course of the film its easy to find yourself either supporting or sympathizing with both sides of this internal superhero soap opera    steve rogers chris evans believes that since he and his fellow avengers are the only ones capable of stopping world threatening disasters having a group of figureheads control their freedom and decision making process could end up in resulting in more loss of life  tony stark robert downey jr having eliminated his own companies weapons programs in light of seeing what unchecked power can do disagrees with his long time friend and their divide splits the avengers crew into two camps    that divide is deepened after a bomb goes off at the sokovia accords signing event and the implicated culprit is caps old friend bucky barnes aka the winter solider sebastian stan  this event springboards the balancing act of the film incorporating the spy thriller aesthetic of the captain america films and the allout action of previous avengers titles the russo brothers succeeded in laying out pieces of story candy and emotional levity in a natural way that rarely feels forced or out of place    a common complaint against these superhero packed films is the fair distribution of screen time for each character and how they contribute to the overall emotional impact of the story  the luxury this movie has is that the movies before it have already built those characters we know who they are where theyre motivations lie and how that influences their decision making in these times of internal crisis  each characters choice of side and the reasoning behind it was never surprising and when your movie is built around such a diverse cast the solid foundation built in the previous movies greatly helps each individual scene and aleaves any potential psychological confusion for their characters and the audience watching them    newcomer black panther chadwick boseman will have his own solo film to flesh out his character so hes given the simple motivation of vengeance against the man he believes killed his father  scarlet witch elizabeth olsen and vision paul bettany play a conflicted couple struggling with what they each believe is the right way but unable to come to the middle for the betterment of each other  falcon anthony mackie and war machine don cheadle are loyal to steve and tony respectively and that friendship is unwavering even if they dont necessarily agree with the lengths each is willing to go to to complete their goals  black widow scarlett johansson cant turn off being a double agent and her fluctuating moral compass works for and against our title heroes when its suits the or her own greater good    antman paul rudd hawkeye jeremy renner and your friendly neighborhood spiderman tom holland join the fray but are mostly there to fill out the respective rosters for the movies biggest setpiece fight at an airport terminal and without a doubt the best action sequence in the mcu to date  each heroes abilities and tricks shines through with epic grandiosity and though it does run a little long you are never bored    theres a villian in this movie colonel helmut zemo daniel bruhl and by the end of the movie you understand his motivations and why he has a grudge against the avengers  unfortunately it falls flat  the movie could have created the same tension relying solely on the plots of the previous movies and sticking in a completely random character instead of a villian that only diehard marvel fans would appreciate  however this is a captain america movie first and zemo helps bridge the gaps between fights and keeps steve and the audience focused on finding out who framed his friend  it wouldve been nice if the writers hadnt shoehorned the cliche of the main characters figuring out the true evil in the last 30 minutes but it was used as a means to the create the climactic end    after the superhero dust has settled the mcu is divided and the impact of the events of the film should ripple into the spiderman and black panther solo films and in 2 years when avengers  infinity war pt 1 releases  the impact of the film is somewhat dampened by another movie cliche that i wont spoil but is ultimately not an overall detriment or takes away from the last 2 hours and 30 minutes    in conclusion captain america civil war is the best superhero movie to date  combining the emotional and political intrigue of the previous captain america films along with the action and setpiece moments of an avengers movie the russo brothers achieved what many have tried but none have succeeded at  a near perfect 11 of a comic book to the screen packed with action and emotional resonance that builds upon itself as natural as what would happen when one turns a panel  the new bar has been set and its an amazing start to the summer movie season
May 9 2016,positive,with captain america civil war marvel has sent an open letter to zach snyder and dc comics  dear morons this is how you make a movie in which heroes fight each other  note that this movie has a coherent intelligent believable plot fantastic effects and action and yet manages to also include humor romance drama and shocks  also note that it is not a joyless wonder  you idiots    at a running time of just under 2 12 hours i found myself saying its already over when the credits rolled  that was how engaging the plot was  the acting was also astounding not an easy feat with a cast larger than the starting line of most professional football teams  character motivations are clear well developed logical and most of all believable  you can find yourself standing on either side of the civil war and feel justified in your decision  those motivations provide the fuel for the fire that drives most of the action    not that the movie is perfect however and it is in the action itself that i find the largest flaw in the movie shakycam  i would gladly for two cents strangle the sick silly jerk who first came up with the idea of filming a fight with a handheld camera and shaking it so much that its nearly impossible to see the action  fortunately it is not overdone and they do not use too much jumpycam so the action remains comprehensible and appreciable    and fun  wisecracking and deadpan lines are interspersed into the fights keeping what could be a depressing work of friends fighting friends into one that still manages to stay upbeat though you still find yourself wishing they could all just get along    the movie plays very well to those who are intimately familiar with the marvel cinematic universe and even better with those who have a familiarity with the source comics  but even people who are unfamiliar with those should still enjoy this film if they have at least seen the previous marvel movies  those who have not will have a few questions no doubt    be sure to stay through the credits as well  there is the usual midcredits extra scene for which marvel has become so very famousinfamous and in this one there is also an endcredit scene that more than makes up for the lame howard the duck scene at the end of guardians    as always your mileage may vary
May 9 2016,positive,this movie is what a superhero movie should be   in a film filled with so many wonderful things perhaps nothing was as welldone as managing to weave so many characters so seamlessly  each not only had a chance to shine but also felt completely believable  you not only know where everybody stands you know why they stand thereand it feels completely natural  its a superb movie and one worth seeing multiple times  go  you wont regret it
May 9 2016,positive,loved it so much i saw it twice in less than 48 hours
May 9 2016,positive,may be the greatest marvel movie ever
May 9 2016,positive,these marvel movies just keep getting better civil war with the prominent roles iron man black widow and other favorites play feels more like avengers 25 even the absence of thor and hulk is addressed this movie is just fun worth every penny of the ticket price and the current crown jewel in the franchise
May 9 2016,positive,possibly the best mcu movie yet
May 9 2016,neutral,the first captain america sucked the second was awesome and the third is a severe letdown rushed plot with too many characters thrown in without much development it was cute for the kids but it was well below average for comic book fans who are adults
May 9 2016,positive,im bias but i love these movies avengers capt america thor etc i felt it was a little slow getting started but once it did boom it was nonstop
May 9 2016,positive,same theme as batman vs superman yet better made only flaw is ms tomei too beautiful as aunt may would be funny if they got joe pesci to play uncle ben in spiderman movie
May 9 2016,positive,overall a decent movie a bit deeper than other marvel movies however the whole rational for the movie seems a bit forced when the payoff finally comes the link to the past is good but the whole frameup to get them really fighting each another to begin with seems a bit of a stretch also as is usual for marvell why do the normal folks seem to be as indestructible  as the enhanced ones  making it set throughout the world gives it a bigger feel however there is no attention paid to the logistics of actually flying around the world
May 9 2016,positive,captain america civil war kicks off phase 3 of marvels ambitious spider web hehe of blockbusters by catering both to fans of what seems to be an everlasting and expanding marvel universe and casual moviegoers alike by delivering stunning action scenes alongside stimulating and tantalizing themes worthy of discussion until we patiently wait for the next one     this was not a perfect movie  winter soldier and the avengers still set the bar for how to properly formulate an interesting and successful plot like in the former and how to expertly combine an ensemble of a cast as in the latter  while i think guardians of the galaxy may be the most fun and arguably best film in the mcu civil war will certainly challenge for the title purely based off its characters alone    lets first discuss just how crowded civil war turns out  we now have close to 30 heroes and villains to keep track of since this all kicked off with iron man and while certain staples like thor and hulk arent present we are rewarded with the inclusion of new and quite frankly better faces to expand an already massive library  spiderman black panther and ant man effectively steal the movie  hands down  their inclusion to the group long awaited for some turns out to be the very best civil war has to offer  it took years for disney to get spiderman  weve seen so many iterations of him over the last decade the biggest hurdle to clear was going to be can we make him fresh again  tom holland is a perfect casting and delivers some of the funniest lines of the movie  equally impressive is chadwick boseman as black panther  we are introduced to a new mythology and if his introduction both as a character and his homeland of wakanda is any indication of how serious marvel is taking him we should only be excited    but this comes as a doubleedged sword for movie construction  do we care more about the characters than we do the plot  at least for civil war  certainly  while we remain so interested in seeing the airport fight to get a glimpse at every power used against someone elses many of the main themes and storylines get squashed under the weight of special effects and those moments that make you say oooooh and ahhhh  trust me i did      quite frankly civil war did everything right what batman vs superman did wrong  it committed to its characters morals and beliefs  we are offered two evenlyweighted ideologies with starks hardheld belief heroes need regulation juxtaposed to rodgers firm stance on the only ones needed to keep them in check is themselves  while we dont care about the politics of it the russo brothers do a much better job of grounding these opinions in its characters we care about and have the most affection for    as is always the case keep an eye out for the myriad of easter eggs planted throughout the film both for references to the past and future films we will be seeing in the next two years      so lets talk about the meat of the film nowstark v rodgers and bucky  its a mouthwatering fight scene with pulls from the comics that will surely leave you satisfied and smiling  i hesitate to say anything has been completely wrapped up as far as storyline goes because lets face it one movie just flows into the next but we do have what you could call an ending to the captain america trilogy as far as bucky is considered  while zemo was a more grounded villain and pretty underwhelming to boot there is still potential there  it was smart not to call him out as the villain of the film  the real conflict here lied not with someone wanting to take over the world for once but someone hellbent on fracturing a team    theres just too much for me to get into on here and without writing a novel the best conversation about these movies always happens in person  the theories are endless  what civil war set out to do was act as a firestarter for the next phase of the mcu but it also felt like it wrapped up much of what the mcu consider phase 2  sure it all runs along the same vein as one bleeds into the other but if civil war is any indication of how infinity wars  will be in two years time you can bet your bottom dollar theyve got the right people helming the biggest juggernaut in the movie industry    civil war offers the thrills and spills of a traditional blockbuster while flexing its character muscles with the inclusion of both new and old over a slightly elongated two and a half hours  whos side are you on
May 9 2016,positive,great ride from start to finish it includes a huge cast of marvel favorites while still manages to be a captain america movie
May 9 2016,positive,best marvel movie yet and best onscreen presence of spiderman thanks to being in the official mcu
May 9 2016,neutral,spiderman and antman bumped the score up a 12 star without them this film is as empty as its predecessors whilst creating a strong dialectic regarding current politics its ultimately an example of recycled formulaic material at the expense of the consumer
May 9 2016,positive,this was a hard movie to grasp 4a person like me   i hated the idea of the good guys being bad however the concept worked great
May 9 2016,positive,it perfectly meshes its characters commentary humor action and character development together while never feeling overly long or too ambitious probably the best marvel movie since iron man if not the best not a whole lot it could have done differently as its pretty much flawless and nonstop entertaining great movie
May 9 2016,negative,only  10 mins is watchable
May 9 2016,positive,i enjoyed this movie so much
May 9 2016,positive,the best marvel movie yet black panther looks very cool and promising spiderman stole the show
May 9 2016,positive,best movie yet loved ever damn second of it
May 9 2016,positive,brother versus brother
May 9 2016,positive,great moviepacked with action
May 9 2016,positive,awesome and very funny movie  the whole family is going to enjoy it    everybody should know what they are getting with the regular crew and when sprinkled in with some new friends the fun becomes that much more entertaining
May 9 2016,positive,the best comic movie i have ever watch the russo brothers directed another gem as they did with winter soldier a definite mustsee even if you are not familiar with mcu
May 9 2016,positive,best comic book movie ever
May 9 2016,positive,this is the best superhero movie made a lot of people will not see the depth of what is going on in this movie because they might not know the characters in detail the storyline is extremely complex in a good way dealing with vengeance loyalty friendship freedom security and politics the action is really impressive i want to see this movie 4 times
May 9 2016,positive,epic fun definitely plan on owning this one
May 9 2016,negative,so disappointed  the second movie was great but the third onewell it has committed the worst crime that is possible for a comicbook based movie it was boring 25 hours of boring nonsense   i dont know what the screenwriters were smoking but they definitely didnt share it with the actors who did look like theyd rather be somewhere else right now
May 9 2016,positive,russo brothers strike again with an intense political thriller well choreographed action scenes quality acting by the lead actors good build up and fantastic spiderman only flaw in this potential masterpiece is baron zemo and some questionable choices by characters
May 9 2016,positive,not only is captain america civil war the super hero antidote to this years horrid batman vs superman dawn of justice it may just be the best superhero film to be released since the almost decade long fixation hollywood has had with superhero films since ironman began
May 9 2016,positive,the story is anorexic compared to the comics it is based on rdj shines the acting is cool the anorexic plot is solid but it doesnt deserve to be called civil war it is more of a misunderstanding
May 9 2016,positive,this movie is by far the greatest comic book movie ever shout to the cast and russo brothers for keeping a wonderful balance movie
May 9 2016,positive,a marvel cinematic universe delight one should not miss
May 9 2016,positive,best superhero movie since the 2002 spiderman movie
May 9 2016,positive,captain america civil war    the systematic dumbing down of a great comic book story to make it more palatable for a generic move going public     lots of new ways to throw old punches a few surprises and a really great spiderman  overall a fun way to spend a few hours but nothing i will remember for years to come brainonpause     do more marvel and do it differently phase4 
May 9 2016,positive,this movie may be a little overrated but it was very enjoyable the action scenes were choreographed incredibly and the plot was smarter than the usual marvel film the plot was a little cluttered at times and the motives of the various villains were kind of unclear it was also hard to follow for those who didnt know much about the marvel universe but it wasnt bad also where are thor and hulk
May 9 2016,positive,was weird winter soldier for knocked out when the helicopter crashed but it moved the story along and why is that they avoid calling each other their comic book names like cap called black panther your highness rather than black panther which woulda been much cooler and then black panther shouldve known who hawkeye was and the baron zemo shouldve called iron man that instead of mr stark  the opening fight scenes seemed a bit choreographed but the fighting got better as the movie progressed and there was classic themes in the movie straight from the comics as was the cap and iron mans stalemate scene was a classic moment in the books loved it
May 9 2016,positive,this movie was fun and entertaining i wish they nailed the last two ironman the same way they have nailed the last two captain america movies but having tony stark as such a big part of civil war made up for it spider man was amazing  ant man is official an avenger this movie is what avengers 2 shoulda been  love it who ever gives this a bad review needs to slap there mother for giving birth to them 
May 9 2016,positive,this movie was an absolute joy ride the emotion within each character the setting the stakes and what its all come down to the way that they introduced new players such as black panther and spiderman was beautiful having that emotional yet still action packed plot and along with a few laughs that airport scenes were a work of art putting avenger against avenger i can honestly say this is the best marvel movie and i would gladly see it again
May 9 2016,positive,captain america  civil war was to no surprise amazing i admit that i enjoyed this more than batman v superman yet i feel these 2 shouldnt be compared anyway this movie is solid and a good addition to the mceu i must admit that this is my first mceu movie that i have watched in awhile i didnt watch the previous movies other than iron man 1 2 and 3 as beautiful and emotional this movie can get it has flaws like every other movie go watch this movie if you havent already itll make u get more into the mceu or marvel in general
May 9 2016,positive,wow a superhero movie days are gone with one releasing every month  and the interest levels getting saturated with the audience in these  times the studios artists and technicians are always trying to find  ways to outdo each other come up with something fresh and innovative  each revision which sometimes work marvel seems to be a clear winner  in the genre war against dc which seems to be imploding with its  heavyhandedness continuing the strategy successfully used by  christopher nolan in the dark knight trilogy on the other hand marvel  seems to have understood the pulse of its mass audience better and kept  churning out blockbusters with relative ease  but not sure how long  the same strategy works    the storyline is very close to dawn of justice and many other recent  superhero ventures dealing with peoples tolerance towards vigilante  justice and accountability for collateral damage after an operation to  thwart a mercenary from stealing a biohazardous virus goes bad in  lagos nigeria leading to deaths of innocent civilians the avengers  are held accountable and an accord is passed to give control of their  missions to a un committee tony stark robert downey jr and natasha  aka black widow scarlett johansson sees reason in this request and  plays ball but not captain america chris evans when a bomb explodes  in the accords convention at berlin and bucky barnes sebastian stan  comes out as a prime suspect battles lines are drawn and each member  of avengers are forced to take sides    what marvel is getting right in the avengers series is the treatment   after all these characters and story lines are straight out of comic  books while they try to build mature character arcs and brings in a  serious plot involving death of some characters the treatment is still  on the lighter note focused solely on quick and cheap entertainment if  a viewer takes especially this storyline seriously there couldnt be a  sillier premise with the two groups of avengers fighting each other but  not seriously enough to hurt each other another attribute that marvel  has been doing so good is how to write a script that gives enough  screen time and importance to this plethora of characters    starting with the technical departments the special effects are slick  and on par with other recent movies a special credit goes to the  writers for coming up with a smooth screenplay with so many characters  each having their space while it features some of the best actors that  hollywood could offer there isnt enough in the script which requires  them to play out of their skin most of the actors are veterans in this  series who has established characters and mannerisms so rather than  indulging in their performance analysis  i would rather go over some  new characters in the avengers series chadwick boseman as black  panther doesnt come off as menacing as he wants to be without the  costume but the effeminate mannerisms with the costume makes it highly  inconsistent paul rudd antman has built his entire career on his  comic timing and the writers have ensured they leveraged the most out  of it however the revelation has been how good peter parker aka  spiderman tom holland has been integrated into the avengers universe  with lots of wit charm and heart  which the web wielding audience  favorite is know for overall the pace is brisk the battle scenes of  the actual premise is entertaining and silly at the same time while  other action scenes are worth a watch the actors seem to be having a  good time and it shows in their performances the makers have  overstayed their welcome for sure with the repetitive gags and banter  between their lead characters across multiple marvel movies i am not  sure if i am ready for more of this    entertaining and silly at the same time while the writers manage to not  make a mess out of this huge ensemble cast
May 9 2016,positive,came back from the movie theater and i have to say civil war blew all my expectations out of the water i am a huge fan of the avengers franchise     best avengers movie yet  amazing new spiderman and black panther  steve rogers sorry tony you know i wouldnt do this if i had any another choice but hes my friend   tony stark so was i
May 9 2016,negative,boring and confusing film the only reason i sat through more than a half hour of this film is that i wanted to see the second feature
May 9 2016,positive,was really good was a little long
May 9 2016,positive,best of the bunch they just get better
May 9 2016,positive,not without flaws but a superb addition to the steve rogers saga and the marvel cinematic universe didnt think they could outshine winter soldier but this does so with ease
May 9 2016,positive,354 closer to a 4 here some actual conflict of ideas between friends no less is present here which is good tonally its not perfect but its elevated especially by rdjs performance not bad pretty good the plot is not perfect but it seems to work a bit better here than in the last film winter soldier though that also aimed for big ideas overall better than the previous two captain america films
May 9 2016,positive,ok soo much to go over so i would say this movie covers so much in the 2 hours and a 30 mins they tackle alot of tough subjects that are never seen before in superhero movies i cant really say more without going into spoilers
May 9 2016,positive,now this is what superheroes fighting each other should look like dc comics should be taking notes
May 9 2016,negative,went in with high expectations since everybody seems to be drooling over this film boy what a let down i love winter soldier iron man the avengers antman but this one missed the mark the action was boring and the pacing was just slow it was just not what i expected    i would not recommend this movie
May 8 2016,positive,lived up to my high expectations
May 8 2016,positive,thought it was a bit long however the movie was outstanding  i really enjoyed seeing the flashbacks of bucky and tony  really hope bucky makes it into the next movies
May 8 2016,positive,one of the best superhero movies to date twists and turns pain and anguish brother vs brother this is civil war great intro to new characters in black panther and spider man wo their origin story very well written and the action sequences are simply amazing go see this movie im at least going 2 more times marvel knows how to make a great movie for comic and film lovers alike eat your heart out bvs
May 8 2016,positive,going in i wanted to love this one and that might have been what made it so underwhelming the action sequences in civil war are bar none but theres way too much posturing and standing still while conveniently arrayed for the camera to pan across  the airport sequence was marvelfan nirvana though notable improvements to almost everybodys fight choreography as well especially with falcon lookin good mackie
May 8 2016,positive,captain america civil war is everything that batman v superman should have been
May 8 2016,positive,as good as it gets  ie the stuff lifelong dreams are made of
May 8 2016,positive,amazing movie with a great plot line one of the best superhero movies in recent years marvel continues their magic trust me you wont be disappointed
May 8 2016,neutral,meh    too long who are all those people
May 8 2016,positive,how to describe it  a lot of fun
May 8 2016,positive,loved the show  great balance of action humor and story
May 8 2016,positive,great balance of screen time for cap and iron man justice is done to every character except maybe the villain spiderman and the relationship between falcon and bucky steal the show the black panther was a nice addition to the mcu and antman continued to amaze
May 8 2016,positive,its kind of hard not to enjoy the hell out of this movie it continues the saga well while adding more dimensions into the marvel universe the battle scene with all of them together is probably one of the best scenes of any marvel film and i like how it really dives into some traumatic background on tony stark revealing things the iron man films didnt even do
May 8 2016,positive,while i was at a loss for words for batman v superman for how lacking it was civil war summarized for me what a great superhero movie should be great story compelling clear and zero unnecessary complications     i loved this movie it was hands down the best super hero movie ever made with all the nuances of different characters and storytelling the movie panned out very very well the conflict between captain america and iron man were clearly compelling unlike batman v superman and every dialogue was very suave and engaging no wasted words no wasted scenes and at the end of the movie i asked no questions because the movie answers every issue it brings up     very good job russo brothers very good
May 8 2016,positive,tied with jungle book as my favorite cinematic viewing experience of the year i was on the edge of my seat from start to finish i was pleasantly surprised at how well my home city of lagos was represented the vehicles people markets names buildings streets and so on showed so much attention to detail it avoided the generic yellow overlay filter and a desert landscape in depicting a stereotyped land this attention to detail is mirrored throughout the movie the conflict between captain america and iron man does not seem forced and slowly builds up from a casual disagreement to outright hatred i wondered what ending could top the airport scene but having the main characters isolated from smaller characters and taking out their rage on one another was such a thrilling finale one of my favorites in a long time    the airport fight scene in my opinion is the greatest superhero action scene in the history of film almost every superhero movie especially marvel suffers from an emotional disengagement where the ultra powerful superheroes face off against an army of faceless weak enemies who always conveniently end up losing pitting the superheroes themselves against each other was a thrilling ride these are characters we have seen grow over so many years and have become very emotionally invested in them the nuance of ethics of super powers was handled subtly and brilliantly i still am unsure whose side i stand on    black panther was my favorite character from this movie he owned every scene he was in and has a captivating and powerful aura i cannot wait to see him in theaters finally as a black human of african descent i finally have a super hero i can identify with on so many levels i never knew how much i needed that until i saw this movie representation does matter spiderman was perfectly woven into the tale supplying enough humor where necessary i was wondering how so many characters were going to battle it out for such little screen time i respect the russo brothers for perfecting that  balance this was probably my favorite paul rudd performance    i did feel vision and scarlett witch were under utilized and under written characters but i understand that their super powers might have suspended disbelief and overpowered the script cant wait for all the other marvel movies slated for release they are absolutely killing the game
May 8 2016,positive,wow what a ride will be seeing again sometime soon  all i can say is  wow
May 8 2016,positive,my only grievance here is that there are so many big heroes in the movie that cap almost got overshadowed infact  in a few scenes he did this did feel more like an avengers movie than a captain america film but i still give it a 5 star because a simple mislabeling should not hold back a fantastic movie
May 8 2016,positive,a wellrounded emotional rollercoaster civil war may be a captain america film but its the avengers sequel fans have been waiting for
May 8 2016,negative,terrible film the story was weak and was not true to the civil war series the misdirection is sad because the civil war piece was one of marvels greatest another monopolized superhero movie by marvel
May 8 2016,positive,i loved every minute of this action pack movie
May 8 2016,negative,loved the movie because of its interesting plot for once the world wasnt in danger great job marvel but spiderman killed the movie not just for me but for most of your fans he was a horrible actor and should not have been chosen to play the role as spiderman even tony stark makes fun of him by saying hes not spiderman hes spiderboy there are so many people you could have chosen that wouldnt have made him look like this little annoying kid i just wanted to close my eyes and not look at the movie anymore but then i heard his voice and hoping spiderboy would just stop talking your amazing spiderman series was amazing and it gave me high hopes for this movie and then you squashed them like a bug
May 8 2016,positive,a very good movie with a good story and good action most of the characters got their time to shine on screen
May 8 2016,positive,this movie should not be called captain america anythingit should be the avengers get pissed at each other and steve rogers is a libertarian douche how dare this fucking roided motherfucker try to fight iron man lucky bastard could have been blown away but tony kindly let him live    this movie should be watched at least twice to get a real good appreciation so i might have to go back tomorrow    in the meantime black panther is my all time favorite superhero and bucky sucks
May 8 2016,positive,amazing action flick but story day okay  however antman was grandiose and spiderman was spectacular
May 8 2016,positive,i definitely liked this movie  not a masterpiece even in the genre but very good entertaining funny and poignant enough  the battle scenes were great and the dialogue snappy where it needed to be even though the movie in overlong at 25 hours really why i was entertained and much like your favorite tv show the characters are now familiar enough that youre happy to go along for the ride     i particularly thought the emotional investment each character had in the key decisions worked well each character was trapped by their own past and how those different pasts shaped each characters world view was interesting even a little touching     yes the whole concept of the why there were two sides was a little weak and the producers never made the philosophical battle feel genuine  and spider man who played the moral center of the comic book on which the movie is based is relegated to a side character a well played and highly entertaining side character  and did i mention that there is just no reason for these films to be over 2 hours
May 8 2016,positive,this was a fun ride  id rank it above age of ultron and below avengers
May 8 2016,positive,one of the best comic book movies ever
May 8 2016,positive,great story line full of surprises a must see
May 8 2016,positive,this might be the best marvel film to date  guardians of the galaxy probably is still my all time favorite but wow this is an extremely close second  youve got twelve heroes in this movie but no one feels like they got shorted everyone had something fun to contribute and it was great to watch  black panther was handled perfectly and chad boseman is awesome he steals every scene hes in  downey jr is so good and you get to see more of his inner demons play out so well he captures the essence of iron man so freaking amazingly  the plot twist is great and was stunning  tom holland is freaking awesome as spiderman and his fights and interactions with the teams is just hilarious and true to form  this movie is everything batman vs superman wanted to be but couldnt be and it was one of those movies you truly enjoy coming out of
May 8 2016,positive,toptier superhero movie what really got me excited is how they integrated the superhero world into the actual world
May 8 2016,positive,i had fun but i wish they had stayed true to the comic book and killed iron man
May 8 2016,positive,best comic book movie ever made
May 8 2016,positive,united they stand holy crap i havent seen a superhero movie this good in a long time still great after the 3rd time
May 8 2016,positive,great movie highly recommend
May 8 2016,negative,too many characters not used to see good guys fighting good guys strange movie
May 8 2016,positive,civilwar is pretty brilliant from beginning to end believe it when they say its built like an old cold warera espionage movie
May 8 2016,positive,the movie was so good  watched it with my family and we talked about it all day 
May 8 2016,negative,why does everyone love this movie its full of plot holes it is generic does not strive to be different in any way and is full of bad cgi
May 8 2016,positive,very very good the only movie that was almost 3 hours that i liked
May 8 2016,positive,this was the best superhero movie ive ever seen it made spiderman finally look good also this made me cry harder than my grandmas funeral
May 8 2016,positive,was great from start to finish cant wait till dc catches up
May 8 2016,positive,grade a very good it had parts where there was no action and just talk but those parts had meaning to it and wasnt just a waste of time like most movies there are a few errors but for the most part it was pretty good
May 8 2016,positive,the fight scenes drag in the best way so funny so many characters from the marvel universe exceptional third cap movie 
May 8 2016,positive,sprawling epic scale tremendously high stakes insane action all the while tightly focused with a nuanced story filled to the brim with character development and moral ambiguity without question my favorite captain america film and my new favorite film in the avengers franchise
May 8 2016,positive,incredible acting meshed with excellent new characters
May 8 2016,positive,always teamameripecs err i mean teamcap
May 8 2016,positive,i just came back from the movie theater and i have to say civil war blew all my expectations out of the water i am a huge fan of the avengers franchise and this was spectacular even for me civil wars been getting a lot of hype recently and im so glad it lives up to it it made me laugh then stomped on my heart in the best way i dont want to spoil the movie for anyone so i cant get into plot details but just know that every aspect of the movie was on point if youve been on the fence about seeing this i urge you to give it a chance 1010 would recommend
May 8 2016,positive,they did it they made captain america great again makecaptainamericagreat again
May 8 2016,positive,finally a good movie about superheroes fighting each other
May 8 2016,positive,potential spoilers i would give this a solid 8 out of 10 it was very entertaining but not the best in the series i still think the original iron man and first avengers are better good story though it took some time getting going was also a bit disjointed at times the spiderman introduction was very well done vision was underused there is a cooi surprise involving antman and i am really looking forward to the first black panther movie liked they left the ending a bit ambiguous
May 8 2016,positive,best marvel movie yet
May 8 2016,positive,marvel does it again with another in the avengers storyline this time its a battle between ironman and captain american against a backdrop of public outrage due to past carnage during avengers vs badguy battles the characters are reasonably well developed the story is plausible and the superhero crossover is refreshing kudos to the marvel universe for its ability to sustain itself this far however its essence is not as fresh as it once was
May 8 2016,positive,spiderman was the glue erhm or web that held this movie together 
May 8 2016,positive,best avengers movie yet  amazing new spiderman and black panther
May 8 2016,positive,i thought it was decent but not great  i liked the plot line to have a government oversee and direct them it added a couple of cool new characters and it was loaded with stars  but it got quite repetitive with all of the fighting and a little overlong  im not very excited to see the next one 710
May 8 2016,positive,captain america  hands down the best marvel since guardian of the galaxy nonstop fun and action cant wait to see it again
May 8 2016,positive,outstanding must see film  wait  a must see three times film
May 8 2016,positive,one of the best marvel movies to date
May 8 2016,positive,goddamn  i feel worn outand ready for a wintersoldier solo movie aside to warner bros  this is how you make a movie about heroes fighting each other     you give them each real issues and valid but conflicting points of view so the story is actually a little complex its not wholly clear at the end who won and you have something to think about when you get home    this was the avengers ii we shouldve gotten  they even included a variant of my favorite speech from the civil war comics event 
May 8 2016,positive,very overrated communication was so unreal that the plot seemed to be just a cluster action scenes were okay but nothing better than the previous marvel films
May 8 2016,positive,a visually and narratively entertaining movie that not only brought all our favorite marvel characters to one place but also gave them clear motivations its the avengers movie age of ultron couldnt quite be and so much more
May 8 2016,positive,its great to see a movie series  that actually progresses its characters story line although it does nothing to advance the avengers infinity stone plot line an awesome stand alone action flick     gripes    aside from the mandarin or any other villain from the iron man series this villain is the lamest thus far they couldve so easily tied loki or heaven forbid introduce a new villain from the infinite roster of villains available from marvel comics     where are thor hulk and nick fury    where are the guardians of the galaxy    why is it so hard to connect these films outside of an avengers movie
May 8 2016,neutral,although some good actionhumor and fairly decent story the movie falls completely flat in final act story is obviously a set up for next avengers but just had no danger to fight just internal dramaweakkkkkkkk   almost dozed off a few times  not aweful just extremely anticlimatic
May 8 2016,positive,great movie again but it still hasnt beat the first avenger chris evans never broke character or seemed out of character i must say that this has been on of marvels biggest battles ever
May 8 2016,positive,best marvel our superhero movie to date cant wait for it to come out on bluray now so i can watch it over and over again
May 8 2016,positive,this movie was full of adventure it was funny it was full of people with good acting skills or i certainly enjoyed their skills  the movie was fun i do kind of feel i would have preferred them to fight each other less cause they all wanted to do the right thing  sometimes it is hard to know the right side  certainly worth watching
May 8 2016,positive,loved it from beginning to end
May 8 2016,positive,movie magic just when you think things got staleboom the house of mouse leaves you wanting more perfect
May 8 2016,positive,rooted deep in the human drama of what makes us tick and filed to the brim with brilliant action gorgeous spectacle humor and emotion civil war is one of the greatest marvel films yet and one that grows more intelligent the more you think about it
May 8 2016,positive,this conflict has been building for a few years now  it was amazing to watch  enjoyed the movie so much had to see it twice once in 3d and one not in 3d  definitely one of the better marvel movies
May 8 2016,negative,i think the picture was too long and it was a little boring same old action picture
May 8 2016,positive,while not quite as good as winter soldier the third captain america movie really stands up well on its own this movie really could have been called captain america avengers iii but that only adds to the fun of the movie    the additions of the black panther and spider man characters were handled really well while the old stalwarts evolved well during the course of the movie    the plot points pacing felt a little stilted and jagged during certain points in the movie but were resolved well by the end the evolution of tony starks character felt a little strange and shortcut to me robert downey jr doesnt make for a convincing grownup    the heroes on heroes climactic battle is sheer comic book fan orgasm worthy    however what ends up really making this movie more than just a good action flick is the chemistry of the characters chris evans really should get a lot of credit for pulling off marvels biggest boy scout time and again
May 8 2016,positive,captain america civil war was great black panther and spiderman were great and had some of the best scenes and lines only critic was when changing locations the name of place would be shown on giant while bold letters across the screen kinda annoying but only problem with movie i felt
May 8 2016,negative,no more avengers movies please
May 8 2016,positive,i loved spider man and any man great comedy in the middle of an epic fight
May 8 2016,positive,i just came back from the theater and the only word that i can say is wow the russo brothers have done it again     now captain america the first avenger was a pretty good start to the series i for one really enjoyed it captain america winter solider was another fantastic movie for the series after watching it winter solider i thought wow how could they out do this one and they did believe me they did    at first i was skeptical about watching this movie especially after batman v superman did not please some fans and can be considered a bomb by many i was nervous about how all the heroes would come together and fight each other but in he end i was wrong this is a film you want to see over and over again    the new spiderman played by tom holland was something i was excited about for me the amazing spiderman  movies werent for me i enjoyed the first spiderman with tobey maguire after seeing tom hollands verison of this amazing character simply wow and i can not wait for spiderman homecoming    the other heroes in this film who made their avenger debut also were amazing antman black panther were truly amazing i loved antman a loved i thought it was an amazing film and cant wait for the second one    the only thing i did not like about the movie was the villain in it zeemo played by daniel brühl was ok i didnt think he was bad but he felt unneeded it didnt take away from my experience at all but it was just something to point out    captain america and iron man wow i loved the chemistry between them every second of the way i cant wait for the next avengers film    go watch this movie i know i will be seeing this many more times
May 8 2016,positive,amazinggood choice of director it is a mixed of action and which side are you on this was so amazing
May 8 2016,positive,i dont have to say this flick is good because everyones already been saying it what i will say is that im glad i dont have to defend the original civil war books anymore this is the first time i can say the movie is far and away better than the comic eat shit mark millar     this also seems like the apex of a turning point for the marvel movies because this flick antman and guardians felt like they were more than just facsimiles of the comic books that came before them good movies that didnt have to religiously pull from the books and feel like a regular ol action movie     my only real gripe being a spiderman fan is the piss poor job done on webheads cg suit and im not crazy about an 11 year old spidey but like i said its their spidey and not my spidey from the books so i guess im ok with it although i still believe andrew garfield was robbed and his series had the potential to go big with sinister six the superior foes of spiderman and the spiderverse and can you imagine him and paul rudd being bug bros oh and andrew garfield was way better with the quips than the new kid     anyways good stuff i think from here on out when people ask me what books to read before a new flick comes out i can finally tell them they can just watch the movies that came before because the mcu is now officially its own thing
May 8 2016,positive,my son and i went this afternoon to see this movie it was in 3d and it was rock and roll from scene 1 it was well written and good humor for all i give it two thumbs up peace
May 8 2016,positive,best superhero movie evergreat plot great characters and spideys cameo was awesome
May 8 2016,positive,this was by far the best marvel movie i really liked bvs but as i walked away from this all i could think about how bvs should have been this the conflict between friends really drove this story i hope dc wb take notes
May 8 2016,negative,spinoff starter kit paper thin plot and barely a character arc to be found
May 8 2016,negative,this movie is totally boring and i cannot believe it has a 90 rating  the story has no suspense mystery or drama  there are way too many characters with no characterization for most of them  totally dull and boring villian    it plays like a demo reel for a special effects company  i couldnt wait to leave the theatre      the one good thing i can say about it is the scene with the introduction of the new spider man was pretty good
May 8 2016,negative,move past the fact that its captain america vs iron man and see the movie for what it really is  terrible the plot and script are as dull as the first two captain america movies and it feels forced the dynamic from avengers  no longer exists its as if the writers and directors didnt allow them to be the characters theyve inhabited for almost a decade the biggest mistake marvel ever made was letting joss whedon walk away his attention to detail and ability to know every step of the characters story is clearly missing i didnt know a movie could be as bad as iron man 3 until now
May 8 2016,positive,the greatest spider in my opinion
May 8 2016,negative,i know disney bought marvel so they could make movies out of the best story lines but if they are the best story lines why change them completely    you had a tried and true gold why make it into a very sad rusted tin can
May 8 2016,positive,amazing grasp of the characters brilliant pacing some stumbles with minor things like an unnecessary romance subplot for exactly five minutes which ended up just being an awkward shout out to the comic book fans but all together an amazing film
May 8 2016,positive,i feel like the critics that gave this film a bad review accidentally saw batman vs superman and thought it was civil war i loved this movie it balanced all the characters on screen giving steve rogers the most screen time because you know its his movie and all and gave valid views to both sides of the argument you feel the joy you feel the laughs and you also feel the pain that this movie delivers in a fantastic way
May 8 2016,positive,i wasnt sure how this would play out but i loved it great action and dynamics between all the characters i was glad that finally the destruction that was made by the avengers is addressed i loved seeing bucky as well as spiderman and antman those 2 brought the humour i was team captain america but could totally understand team ironman
May 8 2016,negative,okay so i dont mind spending 1050 cos ive spent money on worse movies but having said that this really isnt very good i do believe that marvel has done a great job of promoting its brand theyve done a great job of marketing thus the fanboys not only in the general public but in the media showering civil wars with unabashed praise the truth is that its an average movie and im being kind in reality its not much better then batman versus superman
May 8 2016,positive,way better than the theatrical release of batman v superman times infinity and way better than age of ultron still lacking substance when it comes to the final act
May 8 2016,positive,this movie was amazing you leave with the feeling that no one will come back from these events the same will the team ever see eyetoeye and make amends are the scars that they inflicted against each other too deep this movie ends with the audience asking many questions which perfectly sets up next marvel movies marvel has a formula for making quality summer blockbusters and this one is no different
May 8 2016,positive,fit portion between humor story and action
May 8 2016,positive,political pressure mounts to install a system of accountability when the actions of the avengers lead to collateral damage the new status quo deeply divides the members of the team captain america believes superheroes should remain free to defend humanity without government interference iron man sharply disagrees and supports oversight as the debate escalates into an allout feud black widow hawkeye war machine and falcon must pick a side wow what an awesome superhero film as a huge captain america fan i wanted so badly to like this new movie but after having been let down by the notasgoodasitcouldhavebeen age of ultron last summer i was truly afraid that my enthusiasm would be met with disappointment once again here man am i glad to say that isnt the case civil war is fantastic a superhero movie that tackles serious issues successfully integrates and uses a comicbook full of characters makes sense storywise uses comic relief in just the right places and isnt a huge downer check check and check if you are a fan of captain america iron man or just superhero movies in general you will love civil war i cant wait to go back it is hands down the best superhero movie yet
May 8 2016,positive,maybe it was because batman v superman was such a appointments that this superhero film felt better than it was it was fresh creative filled with good characters and actors and was entertaining filled with great drama scenes and also a fantastic second act with one of the greatest superhero fights ever to date the third act wraps up nicely and contains s slower and darker pace also film does a great job at introducing black panther and spiderman helping to secure their future of continuing their reign of superhero movies
May 8 2016,positive,captain america civil war is perhaps the best movie in the marvel cinematic universe so far  the whole cast does a terrific job as always but this time the feelings are amplified as the audience is forced to choose a side in this war  the action scenes of this thoughtful blockbuster are beautifully shot and the soundtrack helps it rise among the top movies of this saga
May 8 2016,positive,captain america civil war delivers everything you expect out of not only a great marvel film but a great film period i was so engrossed in the story and characters that i hadnt realized i had been shaking from the raw emotions that ranged from excitement sorrow empathy and sheer giddy joy throughout the entire film
May 8 2016,positive,strong adaptation they gave good air time to many major players sets up the third act of marvels movie lineup very well action is intense as always but acting was truly top notch new standard for marvel films
May 8 2016,positive,great movie by far the best captain america todate great photography writing and acting
May 8 2016,positive,marvel put everything plus the kitchen sink into this one and created one of the best films of the mcu  the action scenes are great and the story adds just enough humor to keep things entertaining while not sacrificing the serious nature of the story  additionally the introductions of black panther and spiderman are handled perfectly and both actors give fans a good reason to be excited for their solo films  4 12 stars
May 8 2016,negative,some good parts but not enough very disappointed
May 8 2016,positive,captain america civil war has great characters exciting action and an engaging story
May 8 2016,positive,a comic book movie that handless having a big cast of stars very well the movie is driven by a story line that is much more compelling than just saving the world the biggest downside of the movie at times is the use if shaky cam in the fights
May 8 2016,positive,best marvel movie yet captain american imho is the best super hero trilogy ever put on screen civil war is the perfect ending for this franchise great performances makes me excited to see what comes next
May 8 2016,positive,this is just a continuation of the top tier storytelling treatment captain america has received writing direction choreography scoring character handlingall put this at the top of my marvel list
May 8 2016,positive,despite being a tad too long it did a good job of being about something more than just superheroes punching each other despite having a lot of that in it a little too much shaky cam for my liking but it was a huge improvement over avengers 2
May 8 2016,positive,another great installment to the marvel mcu
May 8 2016,negative,a movie written by 12 year olds and directed by a 10 year old this movie was absolutely dreadful and if my wife wasnt there with me i would have walked out on it to go watch something more entertaining like the popcorn popping in the lobby some of the dialog in this movie was so idiotic i felt stupid just sitting in the theater aside from being about the most boring superhero movie ive ever seen the few action scenes there were in the movie seemed to follow the borne identy method of filming whereby you put 30 cameras on washing machines and then edit the resulting footage in a cuisinart so that nobody can have a clue what actually is happening mix that with some gradeschool level dialog and youve got another cinematic abortion to fall in line with the previous captain americairon manavengers flicks the only regret i have more than seeing this movie was not walking out on it at least the trailer for rogue one and suicide squad looked good which was the only redeeming quality of going to see this movie
May 8 2016,positive,it is good but i think a little too much was going on
May 8 2016,positive,this is a great movie and a great superhero film because for the first time in a long time all of the action scenes actually had me excited other superhero films action sequences have become so textbook and uninteresting that they ultimately become boring yeah sure it would be easy for me to make fun of dc here but even in something like age of ultron the action scenes are enjoyable they didnt really blow me away all the action scenes here had me on the edge of my seat the chase scene through the streets of berlin the battle in lagos and the airport battle were all fantastic big thumbs up to the excitement factor but every action film has to have its drama and i like it here although i may not have liked the premise as much as the winter soldiers civil wars story does have enough intrigue to keep me watching it also gave me some twists that i should have seen coming the more i thought about it so props to the movie for that overall this is a very well made action superhero flick one of marvels better entries also best spiderman weve ever had on screen
May 8 2016,positive,this is what happens when you put virtually the same plot and script to batman vs superman into the hands of a capable director replace batman with tony stark superman with captain america and winter soldier lex luthor with smart mysterious agenda man wont spoil and in the end say you know what we dont need a doomsday in this film or doomsdays as it were and you essentially have the same film but good very very good
May 8 2016,positive,no disrespect to dc comics but captain america civil war is much better than batman v superman it was executed better in regards to how superheroics can have serious consequences including innocent lives being lost
May 8 2016,positive,so awesome captain america is my hero
May 8 2016,positive,saturated with your favorite marvel heroes and boasts a solid narrativetheme on what friendship truly means
May 8 2016,positive,great movie still not as good as avengers 1
May 8 2016,positive,saw this with my wife and some friends over the weekend i think this movie is the best comicbook movie so far  the action is amazing and the plot twists will knock you off your feet  see this movie
May 8 2016,positive,one of the best mcu films so far civil war balances its big cast with a compelling story fast action and moments of humor this is the movie that will change future mcu films in the future its themes of friendship and loyalty are at the center the movie does a good job presenting both sides of the coin and it never tries to favor one over the other the highlight is the airport fight which includes antman and the introductions of spiderman and black panther but with all the characters this is still a captain america movie with bucky and iron man being two of the strongest supporting characters it doesnt matter which side you choose we all win at the end     grade a
May 8 2016,negative,this should have been called captain ameirca pain and anger management  it was long and lacking in heart  typical comic book fluff with little humor
May 8 2016,negative,felt like watching an overly long made for tv movie
May 8 2016,positive,its marvel whats not to like i will say this is probably one of the bleakest of the marvel franchise really exciting and fun to watch in the theatre sorry no spoilers
May 8 2016,positive,great movie its just impossible for me to believe that captain america could ever beat iron man in a fight that made it difficult for me to fully enjoy the movie
May 8 2016,positive,lets get these out of the way first the action scenes particularly early on rely heavily on quickcuts  have a shake to them that can be disconcerting it is a little too convenient how the climax plays out with all the necessary players converging on one spot when there really was no particular reason for them all to be there it also may be a bit heavy on the infight quips as while i expect that from spiderman it does seem like theres a bit too much between the others as well its also slightly convenient how the airport was evacuated so quickly but at least theres a narrative reason for it to be evacuated    that said what a breathe of fresh air this was for my complaints about the fight sequences i really didnt have trouble following the action at any point as its more in the style of the bourne movies where there are enough long shots that you can tell whats happening there is a lot happening here but the film manages to weave its two central stories  differing views on oversight for the avengers and cap trying to prove buckys innocence in a bombing  into a single complementary narrative ill admit both antman and spidey seem a little tacked on but even then the reasons for their presence make enough sense that its not jarring black panthers introduction is phenomenal and his characters appearance movement and even sound design is so well done at times you swear you are watching a cat hunt its prey the fight scenes with the possible exception of the first which is really a reintroduction to some of the new avengers are all great and they have enough confidence in their visual effects crew to have them take place mostly in daylight the big battle involving all of the avengers save thor and hulk is outstanding best of all though it never really does paint either the capvstony battle as being wrong as you do understand why each feels the way they do and neither is fully correct either moral ambiguity played well    at the risk of a minor spoiler i am a bit disappointed though that it didnt take one big risk whereas another film went down that road way too soon here its the thirteenth film in the series i do wish they had pulled that trigger no im not counting quicksilver in aoe i also wish they had fleshed out caps reasons for objecting to the oversight more as there are certainly enough historical reasons for him to be distrustful hydra anyone it spends a lot of time justifying tonys position but it seems to just assume caps is going to be the default    still for me this was extremely satisfying its not my favorite mcu film  thats still guardians of the galaxy  and im not even sure i like it more than the winter soldier but its up there
May 8 2016,positive,this is definitely the best movie i have seen this year funny so funny that you need to see it again to catch all the jokes bc people were laughing too hard to hear the other jokes in the first 15 minutes i knew it was better than batman v superman the black panther spiderman and antman are amazing it was like if jason bourne had superpowers only 2 things keep this movie from being perfect 1 there was a lot of shakey cam in the first act 2 there were some slow parts but they were still good winter soldier was my favorite marvel movie civil war might of just eeked it out to be better it was amazing
May 8 2016,positive,packed with interesting characters good acting the fundamental dilemma the story stands on is interesting the only bigger flaw the movie has is the one which it shares with all marvel movies  too many explosions and too few conversations as a result character development suffers and ethical dilemmas are explored a bit shallowly    im still praying for a marvel movie which will not primarily try to attract transformers fans but rather aim for success at the oscars
May 8 2016,positive,i liked it better than superman vs batman
May 8 2016,positive,if this had been billed as marvel civil war i might not have the nagging feeling that the lead character was underserved having said that this is a remarkable movie that it does not crumble under the weight of its own plot  excess of superheroes is a testament to the brothers russo as directors its a more satisfying picture than avengers age of ultron and black panther spiderman do in fact steal the show
May 8 2016,positive,just amazing  the fastest 2 hours 26 minutes  i wish it was longer and cant wait for the next one
May 8 2016,positive,the kind of movie other superhero movies wish they could be   i have found the captain america movies to be a cut above most hero movies so i had high expectations for this one and it was easily one of the best   marvel does a phenomenal john of tying movie plots together and this one tied a bunch up nice and neat especially the last avengers movie   although it was titled captain america it could have been called  iron man 4 with its deep dive into tony starks personal life and history   this movie in no way paces the comic series which would have probably not translated well on the big screen anyway the concept was used with far fewer characters than the comics and the ones that were used pretty much followed over in the movie with regards to their allegiances   the movie ends well and ties things up quite well i felt the teaser after the initial credits was okay though im not sure what it was leading to for future movies other than to reinforce the new characters
May 8 2016,positive,when the worlds greatest heroes are forced to fight each other all thats left is chaos
May 8 2016,positive,nothing else to say they hit all the right buttons a nearly flawless movie it shows the length that marvel is working on its cinematic universe because they simply go for the obvious fact that good movie making is good business
May 8 2016,neutral,the black panther sucked
May 8 2016,positive,civil war jesus what a beautiful car wreck it really is a fantastic film that falls just short of perfection but it does so by its own accord and fully accepts it while i will explain in great detail why i feel the way i do let me first tell you about the things that hit spot on     caution   spoilers to follow    ok youve been warned      spiderman we all lost our collective minds in the theater when he showed up its ok you can admit it and let me be the first to say well done marvel tom holland does a fantastic job bringing the webhead weve known and loved from the comics to the screen full of all the wise cracks and sarcasm we always expected but rarely got  sorry andrew  im seriously looking forward to his solo film as marvel has proven it can really do very little wrong at this point ps the battle with giant man was highlight for me    black panther since the first blade movie many comic fans have been clamoring for tchalla to be given the opportunity to shine on the big screen and his place here is well earned we are given enough to wet our appetites without being overwhelmed the hint of wakanda at the end has me ready for black panthers movie in 2017    the battles holy shit the fight scenes across the board were fantastic and the airport scene was hands down the best fight sequence in a comic movie period from spideys entrance to iron man taking on ant man it all just flowed and worked really every battle scene just came together and that last one between tony and cap was an emotional roller coaster which leads me to my one complaint    captain america civil war is mainly about two over arching core concepts choice and consequence since the beginning of the mcu these heroes have all chosen to take up arms against all levels of threats local and global in the efforts to save mankind but throughout all of these choices there has been severe consequences for the populace not so much for the avengers  sorry pietro  this is the heart of the matter in this film after what would likely seem a small amount of civilian casualties when viewed in the larger scheme of things during a mission tracking down crossbones woefully underused villain yet again marvel the worlds leaders come to the agreement that the avengers need to be put on a leash tony who has been questioning him self since age of ultron is all about the idea cap on the other hand sees the long term ramifications of giving the wheel to someone other than the team itself at this point the powder keg is set with the flashpoint being provided by a framed  bucky buchanan at the united nations meeting celebrating the signing of the sokovian accord a car bomb is set off and the blame placed on the winter soldier unbeknownst to all is that baron zemo has been masterminded the whole scenario in an effort to destroy the avengers from within this is where everything picks up sides are chosen with cap and falcon leading a group in an effort to capture zemo and clear bucky and stark leading a team charged with stopping rogers by any means necessary a good story but here are my complaints nit picky maybe but hear me out    the accord the movie version of the registration act took a backseat once zemos plan came to light and keep in mind that when it was all said and done the accord was still there standing a much larger issue than before that had made way for the movies main villains true driving force which in comparison to me seemed kinda weak    zemo plan here zemo wasnt a hydra agent he was sokovian officer who lost his family and wanted revenge plain and simple his entire plan was to destroy the avengers by putting its two largest players against each other who mind you were already fighting due to the accord and while it worked kind of there really were no long term consequences to his plan succeeding     the fallout ok so ive been on record with the fact that this movie needed to end with the same ending from the comics that is the death of steve rogers now if you ask me imo the only reason it did not was due to the financial hit marvel could take by killing cap off because for the story line it wouldve worked after all that happened there were no consequences nothing now for those of you that saw it let me address the first point youll try to make yes there are two teams now the secret avengers cap falcon hawkeye scarlet witch and ant man and the official government sanctioned group iron man vision spider man war machine not sure where widow falls likely on team cap but both of these teams are aware of each other and are only a phone call away according to steve so guess what no loss there all the missions not sanctioned by ross while likely be taken by cap and his group ok next rhodey yes he had partial paralysis but come on now hes friends with tony goddamn stark he was walking by the end of the movie rhodey will be back in his new and improved bio mechanical enhanced suit by infinity wars next theres bucky well hes on ice again in wakanda where they will likely make him another arm they have the technology as well as the resources cap and iron mans relationship yeah thats good hes not looking for him didnt even seem all that peeved when he got the letter from him and it wasnt that long after since tony was still bruised so after trying to annihilate barnes all he needed was a day or two to cool off annnnnnd we are good so really how had any long term consequences to deal with civilians thats about it berlin airport toast bucharest millions in damage you get the idea but the worlds mightiest heroes they came away pretty much unscathed since cap broke his team out of the raft in its final moments     but i get it marvel wanted it tied up neatly in the end but still i see the promise of what couldve been an incredible story line left aside but who knows with the captain on the run and no longer with his shield we may see a search for a new captain could be a great story line for agents of shield all in all though it was a fantastic conclusion for the captain america trilogy and yet again another feather in marvels cap 4 out of 5 stars
May 8 2016,negative,have just been to see captain america civil war with brother and mrs dobson and we all agreed that it was at least halfanhour too long    during the interminable fight scenes i did try to snooze but the noise of their metal suits clanking kept me awake far too many super and not so super heroes far too much fighting good actors wasted no plot to spoil 4 out of 10 and im being generous because im a fan of robert downey it never bodes well if im thinking oh for heavens sake kill the lot of them half way through a film
May 8 2016,positive,i just cant describe this movie speechless loved it just go and watch now
May 8 2016,positive,very good  better than the original story in the comics
May 8 2016,positive,non stop action  the way a civil war movie should have been made  a must see movie for the year
May 8 2016,positive,great movie when i was watching it i didnt even realize that 2 12 hours had gone by great acting great cast and characters and great story
May 8 2016,positive,stunningly powerful  emotionally moving  action packed  what more could a movie need
May 8 2016,positive,probably the most adult of all marvel movies thus far  a plot designed to fully divide the audience with a relevantly themed plot  nice blend of drama action and some comedy
May 8 2016,positive,in all fairness i am pleased with this installment of captain america  it is just as good as winter soilder and ties the avengers story lines in as well the black panther is awesome and just needs his own movie  yet i think this movie played on the same level as batman v supermana lot going on and a lot to take in so i think we have some marvel fanboys at rotten tomatoes  but a give a marvel and dc a solid bon both movies
May 8 2016,positive,this is an avengers movie not captain america but it combines both franchises and borrows from the best of both the more subdued special effects feast of the capt films meets the comic book character buffet that is the avengers what we end up with here is probably the best avengers film to date and as a franchise film it does the perfect job of leaving you wanting more in the end i cant wait for the next chapter
May 8 2016,positive,ammaazzzzinngggg almost every scene was awesome  and the addition of spiderman wow just wow he really held his own
May 8 2016,positive,great movie but could have had a better ending
May 8 2016,positive,probably by far the best film that marvel has to offer with loads of action drama and humor civil war knocks all other superhero films out of the park  big shout out to black panther and spiderman for being two of my favorite characters in the film that airport fight scene though  although i wish that the film followed the comics more im happy with the direction this film took and believe that this marvelous masterpiece will entertain for lifetimes    my rating a
May 8 2016,negative,reason why for the thumbs down  hollywood ruined the movie and ignored the comic  cap should be dead  it is just views hate it when the hero dies it cuts in to the ticket sales  boohoo  how the entertainment industry ruins good stories
May 8 2016,positive,what could could be the best mcu movie
May 8 2016,negative,this movie was way too long and the moral of the story was zero accountability   how disappointing
May 8 2016,positive,great movie the actionfight scenes are awesome
May 8 2016,positive,fabulous i love the integration of the characters the storytelling is stupendous and nonstop i like how throughout the movie theres tension somewhere even to the bitter end and the moviemakers have created curiosity if not tension as to whats next theyve got me interested
May 8 2016,positive,great movie lots of twists and turns keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole movie great to see some of the new heroes as well
May 8 2016,positive,the russo brothers deliver a spectacular superhero showdown with beautifully choreographed action deep characterisation and a welcome thematic resonance i had written off the mcu it was a very pleasant surprise to discover it still has some legs
May 8 2016,positive,totally awesome movie
May 8 2016,negative,too much hype  fun movie but overdone philosophical conflict i am more impressed with premiss of  captain america winter soldier as it plays into my paranoia
May 8 2016,positive,saw it twice in three days
May 8 2016,positive,best marvel movie for sure i loved how they were able to make it in a way that it was tough to choose a side i still think its tough for noncomic book fans to e really buy into these films it was cute my friend thought that hawkeye was green arrow but she knew who spiderman was
May 8 2016,positive,its good nothing out of this world when they fight each other is what were waiting for the whole time and is over in about 20mins maybe but overall yes gotta go see it but for me no repeats
May 8 2016,positive,this is the best performance in a marvel film for rdjr since iron man there are too many characters but the russo brothers deliver one of the best sh films to date  im surprised more critics arent calling out marvel for not calling this movie what it is an avengers sequel
May 8 2016,positive,as the mcu goes this movie is damn near perfect i really really enjoyed it
May 8 2016,positive,by far the best marvel studios film you will seeonly complaint is you want more so many rich characters with important growth that it leaves you wanting more
May 8 2016,positive,captain america civil war is intense emotional and in a way realistic that not only ascends from its prior installment but the cinematic universe as well the performances are amazing and the chemistry between the cast is incredible and definitely translated well on screen
May 8 2016,positive,captain america civil war is hands down the greatest superhero blockbuster in the marvel cinematic universe it balances comedy action and a welldeveloped storyline that creates nothing short of a masterpiece where other franchises have stumbled and failed the mcu has risen to the occasion showing us that superhero movies are capable of more than what others are led to believe    910
May 8 2016,positive,better than age of ultron awesome movie
May 8 2016,positive,one of the best cinematic adventures i have seen in a while with action storyline feelings drama everything i could even begin to imagine was there just awesome
May 8 2016,positive,warning spoilers ahead  i thought judging by money wasnt the right way to judge a movie if were judging according to what matters it was typical marvel  disney bright and colorful with a few laughs and some drama the score was the same ol same ol story was simplistic a man who lost his family and wanted revenge thats it really after black panther who was actually badass caught the guy then the end of the movie just hurried its way along not very deep or complex but then marvel isnt trying for that audience its all about sales right the action scenes were great if you liked age of ultron then youll enjoy this age of ultron was better the second time around civil war well lets just say i absorbed it all much easier no need to see it again this was enjoyable and worth watching but please stop saying best marvel movie ever guardians was a better movie  who really owns rotten tomatoescom
May 8 2016,positive,this is the best marvel movie weve been given it hits the right notes at every single turn everyone is involved for a reason there is always motivation for that person being involved and the villain of the movie is fantastic if youre tired of each villain just being a different version of the hero then youll love this villain its just a fantastic movie its all youve ever wanted in a super hero movie
May 8 2016,positive,great characters a compelling story excellent performances a great villain the best incarnation of spiderman to date which gives tobey maguire and andrew garfield a run for their money and finally the best  superhero fight of all time if you loved the batman vs superman fight you will orgasm at the airport fight in captain america civil war
May 8 2016,positive,mystery science theater joe 5000 review new disney marvel characters in this movie are black panther and spiderman the rest marvel character in the movie are iron man captain america war machine vision  hawkeye antman scarlett witch black window winter solider and captain falcon  villains in the movie baron zemo and an assassin lots of action in the movie this movie is very funny ten stars all the way there two scenes in the end credits
May 8 2016,positive,best marvel movie so far  great story review from my 7yearold son but i happen to agree
May 8 2016,positive,i complained that last years avengers movie felt burdened by the many subplots characters and cliches this super story was more focused even though the whole gang showed up it was about friendship and consequences that works unfortunately the two characters that most forced action stark and the villain stopped making rational decisions eventuallyalso when spidey went away so did the humor so it was really good but not great
May 8 2016,positive,better avengers movie than ultron
May 8 2016,negative,well in my humble opinion i personally believe this movie doesnt deserve 91 positive from rotten tomatoes i dont get paid to rate movies rather i pay to watch them ever since disney bought marvels right it has not been the same now they rebooting spiderman story as a high school student what changing the story back and forth to gain new fans im always up for changes but old fans should be respected too
May 8 2016,positive,probably my 2nd or 3rd favorite mcu movie  it felt like this movie had everything  its hard to make a cast this massive work in a movie but they did a great job making everyone feel relevant  i still dont like the idea of heroes fighting each other but the action sequences are so good and so convincing that this old issue of mine common in kung fu movies wasnt a problem  my god what incredible action sequences just like in winter soldier  god bless the russo brothers  and also teamcap
May 8 2016,positive,best disney marvel movie to date the avengers films are garbage compared to this
May 8 2016,positive,incredible  literally one of the best marvel movies and one of the best super hero movies of all time
May 8 2016,positive,waiting to see if xmen apocalypse beats this as best movie of the year
May 8 2016,positive,good film big script baddy is bad but his reason seems s little weak but well worth going to see
May 8 2016,positive,its the best one yet comedy action drama all rolled into one big happy pie or whatever baked good youre currently thinking about right now mines pie
May 8 2016,positive,civil war is now without question the best film in the marvel cinematic universe the deftness with which the russo brothers manage to direct this superhero epic is so precise that it is at times staggering the film not only succeeds in delivering on the hype promised by the disney marketing team it eclipses it completely largely due to the honest trailerproof narrative constructed by an adroit writing team
May 8 2016,positive,civil war is a good movie i did prefer winter soldier i felt this movie lack the emotion but the ending did bring it back maybe that emotion should have been brought right in the middle of the movie some elements were too obvious good bits of humour and great actions scene difficult themes were brought but they were unequal in terms of dialogues and story still a solid movie
May 8 2016,positive,the russo brothers did an amazing job again
May 8 2016,positive,i thought this movie was great batman v superman was good but not great civil war was better than great it was fantastic spiderman was good but not as good as the original the action was outstanding the story was spot on better than age of ultron ant man is still one of the best characters in the movie it was hard to find any flaws in this movie 1010 rating of course this is my own opinion tell me your thoughts
May 8 2016,positive,not sure how disneymarvel can keep making these films better than the one before but they sure have done it again civil war is terrific and brings an emotional conflict between the superheroes that is tears at the audience and also thrills us as each character fights for what they believe in ultimately they find out they believe in each other more than the politicians but recognize their collateral damage isnt acceptable much more successful than the batman vs superman film the movie has heart a great plot line  and brilliant action not to be missed
May 8 2016,positive,gotta love this crew  great action just the right amount of comedy and best part  more to come
May 8 2016,positive,the greatest superhero movie of all time
May 8 2016,positive,real quick really quick like reeeeaaaallly quickly i just want you to know that this captain america civil war islikeoneofthebestmoviesofalltime  and im not being 100 completely serious about that statement but still like wow   so if your asking yourself why is it so good and should i really cough up the cash to go see another superhero movie well all you really need to hear from me is that its good because its set up to be good and with that im saying heres a movie that is manipulating strings fourteen movies in already made and the making thats fourteen movies down the pipeline of such major juggernauts like iron man the avengers the winter soldier and the very successful but less than aspiring age of ultron and with aallll that baggage under it civil war manages to tell a compelling story rooted from cap 2 winter soldier but also manages to juggle into its act nine separate character arcs into two and a half hours of spectacular entertainment too many caps you say well too many is never even an issue with captain america civil war and that is a very big testament to theyre worship the russo brothers after being ridiculed for not having directed anything but comedy when first helming winter soldier the tag team duo of bro bros has without a doubt given us the crowning achievement in marvel cinematic universe  civil war is big its bold but its also not overwhelming and very heartfelt like eating an entire ben and jerrys ice cream on a late afternoon your finished before you know it and have stop to realize how far youve come which i believe can be attributed to the russos love and respect for the civil wars source material the comics that inspired it does it set up for more movies down the road sure it does but does it neglect your time money and intelligence to do so no way jose this is pureform raw coldcut crack cocai uhhh no pop corn fare so get snackin yall  lastly i just want to say that its a really good time to be a kid at the movies its like watching your own imagination come to life up there on the big screen and no matter if your guy or gal its easier than ever to still have a really good time with these hard hitting fictionalized worlds and characters youre a very lucky soul if your a marvel fan and you know it 5 stars
May 8 2016,positive,one of the best mcu movies to date the russo brothers implement a masterful mix of humor story and characters the character motivations are very understandable regardless of whatever side you are for there were missed opportunities to develop characters that havent received much yet the introduction of black panther and spiderman were effective and joined in on the fighting the antagonist was incredibly well done and amazing action this is one of the mcus best films to date and delivers such an effective story go out and watch it for yourself though to make your own opinions though
May 8 2016,positive,the airport scene is one of the best action sequences ive ever seen in a film and as the first film in phase 3 it gave a perfect introduction to spiderman and black panther  heres my full review 
May 8 2016,positive,untoppable  stays a drama   makes you laugh at the appropriate time   gut renching emotions   epic fight sequences
May 8 2016,positive,dull overlong exhausting and mildly entertaining without rising to the heights of the first captain americas palpable thrills suspense and intrigue
May 8 2016,positive,very well done action from start to finish a worthy successor to winter soldier lots of fun go see it
May 8 2016,positive,its a good movie  i would have liked for capt america to finish off iron man but he would never kill someone outright like that
May 8 2016,positive,best movie marvel has ever produced
May 8 2016,positive,loved it so much action and fun dc come on you have to answer with something equal
May 8 2016,positive,epic they just keep getting better
May 8 2016,positive,best superhero movie ever see it in imax 3d if you can d was great
May 8 2016,neutral,too much going on action was pretty good though
May 8 2016,positive,im not going to lie ive been looking forward to this one since the first teaser trailer and i think it lived up to the hype i would of loved it if it surpassed the hype but i was thoroughly entertained the entire time i found myself going back and forth as to whose side i agreed with more as did some of the characters it was interesting to watch though the dynamic between every character was really clear and it was interesting that although they fought each other they still maintained those relationships while seeing that they all were still friends and respected each other was great it also meant that the stakes were not as high everyone was just running around trying to punch each other at worst knock somebody out so that big fight while still really cool i didnt sense that any of them was really in danger we did get a knock down drag out fight in the end and that made sense with what was going on i know im being a bit nitpicky because i did really enjoy this overall it was really cool to see that many people on one screen and all of those actors just work so well off one another the special effects are awesome per usual and two new characters black panther and spider man were introduced really well while i wish it had been a tad more epic and surprising i still really enjoyed it
May 8 2016,positive,batman v superman who
May 8 2016,negative,saw it last night really nothing special enough said
May 8 2016,positive,10 minutes of plot 5 minutes of that were to explain who spiderman is and 1 minute of it was to set up the next movie 2 hours of entertainment ant man is so fun all of the actors are super cool i dont think that i heard one cuss word which is nice for a movie like this and really nice if you see this movie with kids
May 8 2016,positive,this was the best marvel movie to date no part in this movie had me bored at all full of action surprises and of course makes you want to see all the other marvel movies coming out in the future even more
May 8 2016,positive,triumphs in every little way a true bench mark for the other superhero mashups out there the russos definitely know how to keep things fresh for a genre in dire need of a break bravo
May 8 2016,positive,the fact that this film was able to juggle the large amount of personalities it had with style and balance was a feat within itself not to mention that each character was fully fleshed out once again the russo brothers deliver on every level possible there are amazing action sequences an enthralling plot and you care about each character regardless of what side they stand on this film lays the groundwork for the rest of the mcu but manages to work very well as its own movie without shoving setup down your throat additionally the russos understood what was at the core of this movie captain america despite the other superheroes this film doesnt feel like avengers 25 although its extremely long this film goes down as not just a great comic book movie but a solid film as well
May 8 2016,positive,great story good acting some parts are too long
May 8 2016,neutral,how can people complained about the length of michael bays fight scenes and not marvels too many characters and over extended action scenes
May 8 2016,positive,the best captain america yet
May 8 2016,positive,captain america civil war couldve benefited from condensation less bloat and more focus on captain america but the directors did a good job at balancing all of the characters and plot points not to mention the action sequences and choreography are insane
May 8 2016,positive,well made in every aspect
May 8 2016,neutral,it was not a bad movie for what it was but in the end it did not move the overall plot forward at all  avengers fighting each other  i will say they did a decent job of balancing it out  i mean there was no bad avengers just different points of view      but dont believe the 5 star reviews  nothing ground breaking happened
May 8 2016,positive,blended humour action and suspense extremely well
May 8 2016,positive,the winter soldier and black panther made it cool
May 8 2016,positive,as you see with my rating i thought the film was great but why bore you with why i thought the film was great  as hawkeye told wanda  get off your ass  and go see it  then make your decision
May 8 2016,positive,nice way to rebound after avengers 2 and antman
May 8 2016,positive,this was an epic marvel film lots of action humor plot reveals and thought provoking arguments the fights were on point spiderman was fun to watch and props to black panther having an impact in his role a must see film
May 8 2016,negative,it was ok not as exciting as i expected captains parts were great and the airport scene was over hyped antman did amazing though in that scene
May 8 2016,negative,by far the most disappointing over hyped marvel movie yet i went in expecting more than there was the best part of the entire 2 12 hours was the fight scene at the airport with spiderman and ant man
May 8 2016,positive,a lot of fun great throw down between the sides  could have been a little shorter based on the story  anymore feedback would mostly would be nitpicking or personal preference  it was worth the wait
May 8 2016,negative,its 2 12 hours long and it doesnt earn the time youre going to be pissed at all the comic book fans that suckered you into seeing this slow moving yawner of a movie
May 8 2016,positive,moved by an excellent and totally coherent story full of emotion wit and thoughtprovoking themes loyal to the spirit of the original graphic novel buoyed by magnificent performances from its allstar cast and especially from newcomers tom holland and chadwick boseman beautifully filmed by trent opaloch outstandingly directed by joe and anthony russo and delivering high doses of pure entertainment thanks to its epicscale fight scenes captain america civil war starts the third phase in the mcu in unmatchable fashion and easily soars as one of the best superhero films ever made
May 8 2016,positive,such a good film exact opposite of batman v superman very strong writing great action and a suspenseful and engaging story awesome
May 8 2016,positive,couple of minor holes in the story but im going to  see it a second time thats all there is to say
May 8 2016,positive,a wonderfullycrafted introduction to phase 3 that takes the series in a new direction
May 8 2016,positive,those fight scenes are epic each fight scene grabs the essence of the character perfectly
May 8 2016,positive,very well done action sequences and the incorporation of characters especially spiderman were very well done good use of comedy at points but the movie does drag out a little i thought the choice of villain was interesting bruhel was very good in that role
May 8 2016,positive,freaking awesome  didnt want to see it hate to see my favorite characters fighting each other but this was perfect a movie that after you see it you want to see it again
May 8 2016,negative,i just found out marvel fanboys are flooding this site and others and giving civil war 5 stars its a 2 12 star movie but because of the idiots that prompted me to go see this movie early today im giving it 12 star i should have waited for the dvd to come out but no i had to go see this great great movie me and my two friends were utterly disappointed its too long and ultimately not worth the time and money go see the jungle book or zootopia
May 8 2016,positive,following up what was a spectacular sequel civil war is a mighty third installment of a series that no one could have foreseen being this good philosophy and ideology are questioned and tested and the undertone of political divisiveness is a strong parallel to that of the real world atop these noteworthy attributes are some fantastic action sequences that make this one of the definitive comic book films ever made a superb entry into marvels growing library of films
May 8 2016,positive,really good plot and action
May 8 2016,negative,theres about 20 minutes of a good movie with cap buckey and iron man  the rest is just boring
May 8 2016,negative,this was bad movie the script was terrible how can capitan america let live winter soldier so wrong too many characters fighting to save this man   too much really i expected a better ending
May 8 2016,negative,if youve seen one marvel movie you have seen them all
May 8 2016,negative,i say let the fanboys have their crap but as for the rest of us lets save our money maybe then well get less and less of these average to bad movies dont fall for the hype this is not a great movie or even a good one
May 8 2016,positive,didnt knock me out of my socks but still enjoyable  felt like a better followup to the first avengers movie than the actual avengers sequel
May 8 2016,positive,holy st that was a pretty awesome movie it had you hooked all the way through i loved the giant surprise at the airport
May 8 2016,positive,this was definitely the best marvel film made so far my son and i may see it again
May 8 2016,positive,the captain america films are always more serious in tone for a marvel film and rightfully so with its main character carrying the weight of the world and pure righteousness on his buff praise  shoulders civil war is the best evolution of this series yet the critics are right  the themes are emotionally satisfying action sequences are done well the cast of actors deliver nonstop strong performances and come on marvel listens  the diversity in heroes is better than ever and this is the best spiderman yet i applaud the choice to make him younger and closer to the source material in dialogue and persona and black panther wow what a great addition id thought those retractable cat claws that reminds me of the manicure that is in vogue right now  comical until i saw chadwick bosemans bp     overall while full of action civil war plays like a slow burn for me with the storyline unraveling in a rare way i wouldnt go as far as to describe it as complex but pretty damn intricate for a superhero film i am pretty satisfied    only complaints are 1 its definitely an avengers film thinly veiled as a captain america marquee but is this really a bad thing 2 im slightly uncomfortable with the amount of violence movies now accept as normal  esp once i realized that holy shit spidey is like 16 and literally caught up in violence nbd talk about inception    ill end this long post with honestly i couldnt stop singing friendship never endssss  in my head throughout the film  vengeance redemption trust friendship it never ends
May 8 2016,positive,the best yet what a way to inter new super heroes into the mix and how the government trys to take over control of something they know nothing about it gets better and better the more i watch it
May 8 2016,negative,atrocious bloated iterative marvel genre piece wherein there is some conflict that divides the avengers and they set against each other in foolish battle scenes  at 2 12 hours this tests the resolve of any mortal  the mind deadening quality of the dialogue wooden rendition by the actors and reliance on violence to settle all problems doesnt help  even excellent 3d doesnt help this one  leave it to the kiddies and the trump voters
May 8 2016,positive,captainamericacivilwar is a nonstop nerdgasm that somehow keeps all the fantastical elements grounded in a thoughtprovoking political reality its crazy how well this movie works bravo
May 8 2016,positive,this movie exceeded my lofty expectations tho not true to the comicbooks this film adapts the civil war storyline perfectly to fit the mcu tom holland appears to be perfectly cast as spidermanand the introduction of black panther is well done scarlet witch and vision are growing into powerful additions to the overall marvel universe everything about this film is spectacular excelsior
May 8 2016,neutral,an overhyped movie with little stakes and fluctuating themes at time this movie is serious then a few minutes later it turns into a forced comedy its essentially another movie in this overbloated universe with an ugly air port confrontation while this movie sets up more movies in this universe
May 8 2016,positive,this is an amazing movie it make me feel like i was 10 years old again
May 8 2016,positive,best marvel film to date spiderman was ripped straight from the pages of the comics and i love how well they integrated black panther and spiderman into the story although the movie doesnt follow the civil war story arc from the comics exactly its still a must watch not only for marvel fans but for fans of the superhero genre as a whole there are also many references that only fans of the comic will understand so be sure to keep an eye out for those
May 8 2016,positive,good movie but somewhat overrated  i gave it three stars because it is a good movie but i say it is overrated because many believe it is the greatest superhero movie ever made  that i just dont see  i read a review where one person said that the reason he feels this way is because of all the superheros in the movie  really  thats how we are going to start rating movies now by the number of pretty colored costumes  in the movies as in life quantity does not mean quality  that being said it was indeed fun to see all these heroes going at it  heres the problem with such a scenario though there is never any winner and this never any closure  what i mean is that all these heroes are kicking each others butts but they just keep getting back up  theres a saying in sportsa game that ends in a tie is like kissing your sister  well it feels like all of the fights between heroes in this movie end in a tie simply put i find that incredibly boring  the other problem with the movie is the story there are many a simple minded person out there who will see the story as one that is worthy of something greater than a comic book movie but those people are not really paying attention  first the underlying story of why all of this is taking place is as old as movies themselves  moreover it is a direct ripoff of why wanda and pietro wanted to kill our heroes in avengers 2  second marvel just tried to get way too complicated in this movie with too many characters in too many time periods in too many places  its all just too much to keep up with at times  there are also too many holes in the story  slight spoilers ahead why were starks parents carrying something that special around in an unlocked case in their trunk  how did zemo know all about the winter soldier project  how did zemo get the funds to do all he did how did he infiltrate shield  how did cap know where bucky was living  why didnt ant man simply shrink instead of allowing his legs to get tied  black widow is in a truck when a grenade blows up inside  its so powerful that it blows the doors off yet shes completely finehow  and those are just questions off the top of my head  i had a bunch more while watching the movie one was thisat what point are we going to start saying how ridiculous it is that iron man can make a suit or in this movie a part of one out of almost nothing  i realize it was only a glove that he made in this movie but im supposed to believe that everything needed to make it and moreover to power it fits into a small bracelet  speaking of tony starkisnt it a bit ridiculous how much money he apparently has  at this point its like he has the same amount as a small country  the guy spends close to a billion dollars on some project to reconstructchange his memoriesfor whatever reasonand its nothing to him  really  he then goes on to fund all grants at mit  i mean come on especially since his company no longer makes the same things that made it so successful to begin with  i realize hes ridiculously wealthy  his net worth is estimated at 125 billion  but sometimes its all a bit too much  also when did falcons wings become so heavily armed and is there anything they cannot do  its not that its not cool and i fully get that we have to suspend reality when watching these films but doesnt it seems as though marvel has decided that nothing has to be explained to us anymore i mean i realize that in the comics the vision can phase through objects but in the movies they never explain how he gets this power  and anyone saying it is because of the infinity gem is not paying attention because possessing a gem does not mean you can do anything you like thats why thanos needs all of the gems to become omnipotent  because each one asked the holder to do different things  another thing tony stark can build things that even from a science fiction movie standpoint seem beyond the realm of possibility but he cant make something so that war machine can walk again without falling  speaking of that wouldnt the beam from vision that took out wm also have done the same or worse to falcon  but if he was just going to take out falcons thrusters why did it blow right through wms suit  but look like i said earlier even with all of the above i would never say this is a bad movie  it has the ability to bore one at times with uninspired dialogue and some of the earlier fight scenes are overkill ie cap and bucky in the stairwell was not necessary but the movie as a whole is definitely entertaining  it also has the correct amount of laughs not too many not too little something that ive criticized marvel about in the past  would i say to go seethis film  absolutely  just dont be dazzled by all of the pretty colored costumes and be prepared for no real winner and except for wm no one even getting really injured during a fight that essentially destroys an entire airport  moreover be prepared to not experience that feeling of exhilaration and joy similar to the moment in avengers when cap tells hulk to smash and hulk starts taking out the bad guys with a vengeance because a neither character is a bad guy and b the hero you are rooting for punches his enemy but his enemy doesnt stay down  there is no time in this movie that provides the type of feeling typically associated with other movies of the same genre  no time to punch the air in triumph and take that sigh of relief knowing your side has won  no closure
May 8 2016,positive,thought  it was was  ok  first two were better  also thought bvss  was way  better 
May 8 2016,negative,too much talking hard to follow let spent the movie trying to figure out why they were really fighting should have been called avengers ego tripping
May 8 2016,positive,6310 my review 
May 8 2016,positive,fantastic movie great way to followup what was a disappointing movie in age of ultron the story was fantastic the introduction to black panther and spiderman were well done the only issue i had was that they didnt really follow the actual civil war storyline but that doesnt stop it from being an amazing movie
May 8 2016,positive,pretty entertaining but unfortunately suffered from having to live up to the joss whedon legacy
May 8 2016,positive,it may have been a half hour too long but the fact that so much of it felt like i was watching a jason bourne movie but with super powers was more than a little satisfying
May 8 2016,negative,captain american became a self righteous child i was annoyed by him throughout most of the movie the acting was wonderful and the story was good but ca was a baby grow up
May 8 2016,positive,smart complex story telling with interesting  deep characters and brilliant action  the film certainly has its flaws with some confusing logistics and some hand waving logic  you cant deny that you are thoroughly entertained  just be careful you might end up with some serious arguments with your friends on the issues presented in the movie
May 8 2016,positive,best marvel movie so far  the fight scene alone is worth the money to see it in the theatre
May 8 2016,positive,captain america winter soldier is the farthest away marvel has strayed from their stereotypical blockbuster superhero movie this is what made this movie amazing it strayed away from the tracking shots of beating up mindless henchmen or trying to squeeze every single line with a little pun or inside jokes to get the audience to remember throughout the film even though they just want to see where and how the marvel cinematic universe will progress this is what hurt age of ultron and what makes civil war the best mcu movie ive ever seen because it does the opposite another thing age of ultron did that ultimately killed it from being a great marvel film was that it tried to set up two films while juggling other events in the film civil war was supposedly set up in age of ultron but the set up was so vague it had nothing to do with the actual new film rendering age of ultron useless civil war didnt set up anything that is certainly a rarity for superhero movies now and aided it in making it phenomenal the acting was great as usual but the dialogue and story was just so damn good that it pushed these actors into roles we had never seen before people will whine and bitch about the villain and yes he was at worst forgettable but not all bad guys have to be menacing it worked for the film and thats all you need when everything else is outstanding i cannot think of a more worthy rating than an 11 out of 10 for this film at times i forgot i was watching a marvel movie and sometimes a superhero movie altogether
May 8 2016,positive,great movie loved it
May 8 2016,positive,marvels best movie yet captain america civil war delivers the action and humor better than ever
May 8 2016,positive,simply the best marvel movie yet and one of the best movies ever seen unbelievable p
May 8 2016,positive,the story is thick as lava and keeps you entertained and interested for the entire movie
May 8 2016,positive,awesome movie  if your a comic book junkie or basic superhero fan you will enjoy this one
May 8 2016,positive,great movie the action and plot were just awesome a must see film
May 8 2016,positive,this is an extremely fun roller coaster ride if youre a fan of the recent surge of superhero movies and even if youre brand new to the genre civil war does their job of meeting fanboy expectations while also introducing new heroes for general audience members the beginning might seem to lag just a bit but once all the players are introduced everything picks right up i suggest this movie to anyone and especially if youre usually entertained by most action or superhero films  in two words great flick
May 8 2016,positive,yet another incredible installment in the marvel cinematic universe i had heardread a lot of things about this film going in one of those things being that this is essentially just a miniavengers film while it definitely has a large cast of avengers this is very much a captain america movie with some tony stark thrown in the rest of the cast largely plays a supporting role for those two the rest of the film falls in line with what weve come to expect from mcu films great acting continued phenomenal character development incredible action sequences and bits of humor thrown in just the right places the first half of the film was a bit slower than i wouldve preferred but once spiderman and antman come into the film the rest is perfection teamcaptainamerica
May 8 2016,negative,if you enjoy seeing superheroes hit each other a million times and not feel an ounce of pain then this overthetop film is just for you
May 8 2016,positive,damn this is a great movie literally the only thing i didnt like was the giant white text that took over the entire screen when they were telling you what location or year they were in although thats just me nitpicking and also i didnt like the fact that it was too good like my top three super hero movies of all time would be batman the dark knight captain america the winter soldier and now captain america civil war the thing is though civil war tops all of those movies for me by like 50 percent  and now i feel like every other comic book movie has to live up to this one or maybe even top it which i think will be very hard to do granted this is an event type movie with like every super hero in the mcu in it so i dont expect all the stand alone movies to be as good as this ie black panther spider man captain marvel etc but now i expect avengers infinity wars to be this good or even better and so on and so forth
May 8 2016,positive,best movie so far i believe that each captain  america sequels get better and better i love see the new spiderman i enjoy the epic fight scene with cap team vs iron man team it was very enjoyable to watch than batman v superman overall i love this movie and want to see again also this month  the new release x men movie is coming out
May 8 2016,positive,excellent lots of fun
May 8 2016,negative,way over rated it was kind of about nothing there wasnt really a point i expect a lot more this disappointed more than age of ultron and iron man 3 spidermans character was comic relief i didnt really mind i actually liked him best character was black panther the only redemption his was the only part that made any sense
May 8 2016,positive,this is my favorite movie so far spiderman was awesome antman and black phanter where great to
May 8 2016,positive,civil war is what the fans wanted a real fight between all the marvel heroes focus on captain america all characters have their time to shine new characters such spiderman and black panther are introduced so good making you want to see their solo movies
May 8 2016,positive,this is one of the best sequels of captain america
May 8 2016,positive,outstanding loved every minute
May 8 2016,positive,civil war gives us everything that its genre can offer awesome fightscenes thrilling turnouts deep feelings and a new ally black panther whose graceful motions are simply stunning well not too manly but stunning
May 8 2016,negative,movie was boring and way to long not enough action for a super hero movie
May 8 2016,positive,love this movie one of the best marvel movies ever
May 8 2016,positive,civil war is not only the best super hero movie ever it enters into a space of best ensemble movie of the year   we have a long way to go and a lot of movies but if you can point out a bad scene or poor performance you paid far too much attention and missed the beautiful picture and lead in to so many more movies on the horizon    batman and superman are tired and marvel just keeps swinging for the fences  this is the best yet
May 8 2016,positive,tom holland was great black panther is a stone cold baller
May 8 2016,negative,awful movie fell asleep twice leading up to the big battle the fights were shot horrible shaking everywhere robert downey again the only saving grace a simple money grabsoundtrack for the movie of this magnitude was also non existent save your money
May 8 2016,positive,its even better than the winter soldier which was off da chain you gotta see it
May 8 2016,positive,just as good as we were all hoping spiderman was the real star here he stole the show
May 8 2016,positive,awesome movie great action
May 8 2016,positive,it was awesome a dozen times better than that depressing batman v superman dawn of justice
May 8 2016,positive,in my top 5 marvel movies
May 8 2016,positive,an exceptional film topics of family love and loyalty revenge accepting responsibility for your actions and others resonate for me additionally it sets up iron man apart from the rest of his team when the team will need him most just like in his vision from age of ultron
May 8 2016,positive,moviews captain america  civil war    expectations were definitely high  and im glad to say that they were definitely met ive said this before and ill say it again you can have the fanciest special effects beloved characters great costumes and cinematography  but without a story a film can potentially die the great thing about civil war is that we have all of the above with a very well written story to stitch everything together even though the movie is over 2 hours long the storytellers do a good job of keeping things moving at a nice pace    warning spoilers ahead    even though it reads like a marvelstyle telenovela it is definitely well written the moral ambiguities that tear the avengers team apart are real for those deeply involved in it and at the center of it all is bucky the winter soldier there is definitely a big onscreen bromance that is the basis of the entire movie and even before the big secrets are revealed we are emotionally compromised to take one side or the other in the writing the storytellers make sure to pit us against ourselves to ensure we feel what the characters are going through both sets of teams and for arguments sake ill keep the medias labels as teamcaptain and teamironman are fighting for what they believe is right  and both teams believe that the other side is wrong and truth be told  they both have a point   the writers were also smart in easily eliminating two big hitters from the previous movies thor and the hulk are conveniently not called into this situation the addition of antman into the story is a well placed move especially with his new powers and in place of the two notorious absences we have some worthy replacements one with a great story and key character development all the way to the end  easily my favorite addition thus far to the marvel universe teamblackpanther and the appearance of a powersnewlyacquired spiderman with a young acnevisible face and the running of the mouth that makes him famous however his appearance is not only refreshing but endearing and by admission through the clip at the very end of the credits well be seeing more of this new spiderman soon now the question remains with bucky now safely stored away and in good hands will the next movie keep the two sets of avengers split or are they coming back together to fight a common foe  we shall see for now my opinion   dont miss it 4 out of 4  he dicho
May 8 2016,neutral,as a comic book fan this movie was not that good it did not follow the comic books not even close it really wasnt that much better than batman vs superman i guess disney does own all the critics
May 8 2016,positive,fantastic action humour drama and an emotional rollercoaster
May 8 2016,positive,marvel did a great job with civil war plot steve rogers and ironman have enough screen time to deliver best action this is serious threat to dc universe  spiderman gives good cracking sarcastic joke sarcasm battle should happen between spiderman ant man and ironman  all man p  both post credit scene are good expectation for infinity war is getting high
May 8 2016,positive,beginning was to slow for my taste but overall great action and very funny its a must see
May 8 2016,positive,civil wars greatest strength is its not the avengers what i mean by that is that at the heart of this action packed thrill ride is three characters with a fourth hovering on the outside and the russo brothers dos a great job of using the full teams when they needed to then taking them off the table for a gripping final sequence thats not to say theyre discarded each character is fleshed out nicely with show stealing performances from antman and spiderman many were weary about how rudds scott lang would fit into the team but he comes up big in terms of comedy and spirit    definitely the greatest mcu thus far
May 8 2016,positive,all i have to say is  amazing never has a movie made me scream cry and twitch best superhero movie ever best action movie ever
May 8 2016,positive,actually really good wasnt expecting this to be all that good and i was pleasantly surprised
May 8 2016,negative,i came away from this slugfest underwhelmed  compared to bat v super i find it hard to understand the way critics have responded to each film  this installment of capt america is my least favorite of the three it did have great moments and whenever antman or spiderman graced the screen the movie excelled  the villains were not well developed and the plot suffered from having to have the villain monologue an explanation at the very end  chris evans was great and this is no reflection on him but more a critique of a confused script and a movie that could not decide what it was  for parents beware lots of violence with the depiction up close of an assassination of a characters parents
May 8 2016,positive,this movie had my excitement levels on maximum overdrive so much that i wore a captain america shirt to the theatre and cheered for him like he was hulk hogan in the 1980s  for a marvel fan this movie had it all good acting good story telling great characters great action sequences i had a nerdgazzom over that air port scene which was perfect
May 8 2016,negative,ok but a bit confusing at first
May 8 2016,positive,rather than the standard get this item to save the world it dove head first into one of the either loved or hated marvel comic book topics
May 8 2016,positive,a powerful and deep examination of loyalty and friendship civil war does what bvs could not do bridge the gap between the opening sequences and what we all came to see the newly introduced black panther and spiderman were a breath of fresh air overall it is difficult to deem civil war as anything other that the best marvel film yet since iron man
May 8 2016,positive,227 hsand you feel the movie is too short and want see more and more best marvel s yet
May 8 2016,positive,loved the movie  it is a good sequel to the winter soldier  marvel has given screen time to each heroes and spidey is one of the best in the bunch  the conflict we expect among ourselves is there  any one going into this movie will be split most definitely on which side was right
May 8 2016,positive,oh so good spider man and black panther steal the show
May 8 2016,positive,what could serve as the detriment to some herostuffed movies actually works to the advantage of civil war part of what is so delightful is how easily the characters the majority of which weâtmve come to know over the course of 13 marvel studios movies interact and play off each other scarlet witch using her powers to allow captain america to super jump into a highrise building hawkeye firing a miniaturized antman on an arrow inside iron manâtms armor spiderman using his webbing to wrap upâok that one is too good to spoil here    after this sequence which would be an extremely hard act to follow directors joe and anthony russo wisely dial back the scope of the film instead of trying to go even bigger and bringing every single one of our heroes back for a fight against a giant spiny cgi glob the focus shifts to our three main protagonists tony steve and bucky while more than one character manipulates the events of this film for their own nefarious purposes it all comes down to these characters ultimately captain america vs iron man and their own beliefs personalities neuroses and paranoias coming out to play tony expresses resentment over how his father howard stark liked steve rogers more than he liked his own son steve repeats a line a presuper serum steve told a group of bullies who were beating him up in an alley âi could do this all dayâ    this is not some hastily assembled superhero brawl to sell more movie tickets these two have been bickering and brawling over the course of two avengers movies â one of their very first conversations includes cap telling stark âput on the suit letâtms go a few roundsâ â and that all comes to a head over the course of the film whose finale feels earned rather than a corporate mandate
May 8 2016,positive,the action the suspense the humor the extra nerd surprises why marvel keeps hitting runslook at that airport scene
May 8 2016,positive,civil war was not just a great cbm but a great film period great acting and pacing strong story and visuals and some great plot twists performances by the actors were superb in this film the returning actors were stellar and the newcomers were outstanding chadwick boseman was incredible as tchallablack panther he commanded the screen every time he was on it he was serious and intense and very confident he proved to be a very wise choice for marvel tom holland also stood out as spiderman and hes captured the adolescent fun and charm of a young peter parker like none has before on the big screen this guy appears to be tailor made for the role of spiderman im really looking forward to black panther and spidermans solo films paul rudd as scott lang didnt have as much time as some other heroes but when he entered the scene he was great as well i was never the biggest antman fan but i must admit which each film i see this guy in the bigger of a fan i become rdj as tony starkiron man was as intense and emotional as ive ever seen him i think its his finest performance yet in the mcu chris evans just continues to grow in the role of steve rogers and shows why i couldnt envision anyone else playing captain america the guy is absolutely superb in the role once again bettany johansson mackie olson cheedle and reener all give strong perfomances as well in supporting roles sebastian stan is another one who continues to grow in his role as buckywinter soldier hes given much more dialog in this film and does a fine job in it as far as villains go marvel has admittedly been hit and miss throughout the years its not the strongest point in this film but also wasnt the focal point frank grillo was good as crossbones in the time he had on screen daniel bruhl was a different kind of villain once i saw and understood what his role truly was his motives made a lot of sense in a way he was a very successful villain whenyou really think about it because he succeeded in doing to the avengers what ultron could never do he divided the house magnificently and youll see what i mean when you see the film its been a while since ive seen a film that left me thinking this much and trying to piece thing together it also was tough and pretty emotional seeing friendsalliesformer team mates just beat the hell out of each other like rogers and starks were this is easily the most emotional and personal film yet from the mcu and the most powerful like the terrific winter soldier this film is going to shake up things because ladies and gentle s has hit the fan lol and i would be remiss without mentioning the much talked about airport fight scene like ive heard before i seen it is absolutely amazing and truly a sight to behold for me its definitely the best action sequence ive ever seen in a superhero film bar none and it just might be the most impressive action sequence ive ever seen in any film its that good with everything this film has going on it might be the finest cbm to ever hit the big screen
May 8 2016,positive,im going to break with the consensus a bit i actually liked winter soldier better spoiler i did not like the pivot with stark at the end hes perfectly willing to accept the fact bucky was brainwashed one second but then suddenly cant get over the fact that bucky killed his parents the next the sudden bloodlust didnt seem in line with starks character the movie tries to telegraph it near the beginning but it still rung hollow to me its a fairly minor quibble in an otherwise great movie marvel has invested a lot of time into developing these characters and this movie is the pay off despite their differences it is clear that these people really care about each other despite it all you can clearly see everyone holding back during the airport fight sam wilson not even hesitating to speed to rhodys aid felt perfectly natural even though these characters are on opposite sides the freshmen characters of black panther and spiderman are also fantastic chadwick boseman as usual steals any scene hes in i continue to be amazed by his range hollands spiderman is a perfect adaptation of the character unlike the two other recent versions hollands version is full of youthful energy complete with all the teenage awkwardness that entails
May 8 2016,positive,the closest thing to perfection   to describe it in a sentence it was fucking awesome  im not exaggerating this movie have everything and at its finest form ever known to us the action in this movie has made it my favorite action movie it had it all from heartbreaking punches to mesmerizing moments it scared me at a point and made me awe at some   great job marvel
May 8 2016,positive,arguably the best marvel film to date
May 8 2016,positive,couldnt have asked for anything more and i now have a new favorite mcu movie
May 8 2016,positive,hard not to give this movie 5 stars based on the action and graphics although it really needed a prologue it wasnt until i saw the orange chairs at the end that i remembered how the last movie ended which was a while ago this movie hones in on the subtleties of the super heros characters sometimes simple is key though thats probably why the spiderman character was so appealing simple humourous and easy to relate to
May 8 2016,positive,awesome movie it was well worth seeing it at 1130pm
May 8 2016,positive,a perfect blend of actionhumor and awesomeness 3
May 8 2016,positive,it shows up bvs doesnt it
May 8 2016,positive,duuude im having trouble finding an adequate way to express how much i loved this movie it was everything i couldve hoped for and more
May 8 2016,positive,another movie about heroes fighting but it isnt the boring exhausting and genuinely terrible slog that its competitor turned out to be
May 8 2016,positive,the movie was awesome and its definitely one of the best marvel films out there we get a great story with coherent plot points and good performances we actually feel emotionally invested at the end with what is going on    however i felt the movie was really overhyped by the critics and why am i not surprised from a marvel film    when you read about the airport scene and critics saying  that is the best comic book sequence ever made then after watching it you felt nothing that says a lot i did not felt the excitement from the first avengers movie fight in new york i did not get goosebumps like when i saw wonder woman on the scene and the trinity fighting together  civil war has great choreography on their action scenes but they felt a bit lackluster    at the end the pros out weight their cons
May 8 2016,positive,captain america sequel ranks the highest among all marvels productions
May 8 2016,positive,the best superhero movie till date
May 8 2016,positive,captain america civil war might be the best super hero film of all time simply incredible
May 8 2016,negative,this film gets off to a slow start with roughly an hour of poorly introduced characters talking and arguing in a variety of settings  board rooms apartments hotel lobbies and more board rooms the early brief action scenes are shot using a distracting shakycam technique and much of the film seems contrived to get all the main characters to a mysteriouslyabandoned airport so they can duke it out with fistfights
May 8 2016,positive,freaking awesome that is all
May 8 2016,positive,marvel kicks off the summer blockbuster season with a big bang in the form of captain america civil war this films runtime is enough for it to put its intelligent  political plots thoughtprovoking themes human emotion heartwrenching drama appropriate humor hardhitting surprises and its wit into itself to make itself a grand time this film gets 5 out of 5 stars from me because it visually recreated what marvel was doing with its comics back in the day and is doing in the present day making superheroes human creating stories and character arcs that are interesting and rousing and not following the formula that depressionera people expected from comics that formula was just making stories about damsel rescues from superheroes with unemotional and constant words of heroism i am looking at you dc marvel has not followed that formula since then and has succeeded with the limitless minds of the immortal stan lee jack kirby steve ditko and a plethora of other talented artists batman v superman is looking at us right now and is being disappointed in themselves at how perfect civil war is in the ways that it wasnt how it expected itself to be i hope this movie can help define future generations to come and make them as a people do good and great things for the world that we live in in conclusion captain america civil war is the agame marvel movie and i stupidly almost forgot to mention the actors performances they bring genuine character and emotion that we have havent expected in this movie and makes us cry to the characters that we have grown to love as people newcomer chadwick boseman brings a fantastic performance as tchalla and black panther as their shared and understandable neutrality in situations and peter parkerspiderman tom holland has brought the famous character that we have always wanted in superhero cinema that maguire and garfield couldnt as they individually performed one of the both parts of the young arachnid with maguire only a great dogooding peter and with garfield only a great snarky spiderman tom rounds out the character by bringing an innocence adolescent energy humor power and excitement to both alter egos and he and civil war has saved this iconic character from cinematic failure from sam raimis failed trilogy and the notso amazing series daniel brühls  performance as baron zemo is unparalleled to loki as zemo is the villain that doesnt fit the typical villainy mold has reasons for his actions that makes us feel empathy for him and whos said actions are put on a smaller scale but brings largely disastrous results kudos to him for bringing a new type of a worthy foe you know it hurted seeing these characters we love fight each other and it breaks our hearts but makes us think of what a superhero can go through behind the mask in conclusion directors anthony and joe russo and the film crew has brought us a film like no other superhero film before and delves deep into the light and dark sides of our human characters captain america civil war has to be 2016s greatest movie ever and the greatest superhero film of all time teamironman booyah
May 8 2016,positive,check out what sie says about captain america civil war  
May 8 2016,positive,this movie was a thing of beauty from start to finish i was really worried about how they would portray tchalla and wakanda but marvel nails it
May 8 2016,positive,another timely adequate superhero movie from marvel and this one makes more sense and packs more punches than the avengers movies
May 8 2016,negative,i think ive finally come to accept that ill never love the mcu films civil war is overstuffed over long and has tonal issues its strengths lie mostly with the new characters vision antman scarlett witch black panther and spiderman all upstage the two characters this movie is supposed to be about many would argue its a comic book come to life i agree with that sentiment but i wouldnt necessarily consider it a compliment characters pop in and out for no reason peripheral characters suddenly become love interests with little reason the themes are a little too on the nose for them to feel like anything other than set dressing and the conflict between iron man and captain america never really feels like a true clash of ideals like bvs the audience must wonder why these two characters never just talk it out this feels even more out of place in civil war because here were watching two friends become enemies rather than two legends meet for the first time all in all the film is kind of a slog with the exception of a few truly great set pieces the battle at the airport might be the first action set piece worth remembering from this series peter parkers introduction is fun and made me excited for his standalone film and the climax was appropriately small and intimate this has been called avengers 25 and i would argue that its at least a notch above any of the avengers films if not by much 255
May 8 2016,positive,spiderman cap and ironman 100 all i want to do is get back in line and watch it again
May 8 2016,negative,snooze fest where nothing is at stake instead of disney or marvel they should change their name to evian because they are in the business of watering things down great job im sure this bland tripe will go over great in china
May 8 2016,positive,amazing movie  one of the this year the black panther the way they introduced him is so cool  the story was amazing 
May 8 2016,positive,yet another masterful entry in the growing cinematic pantheon that is the marvel cinematic universe captain america civil war is deftly paced brilliantly performed and incredibly wellstaged featuring a veritable ocean of jawdropping surprises for both the casual viewer and the comic book aficionado
May 8 2016,positive,best marvel film so far  really enjoined it
May 8 2016,positive,one thing to note about 2016 all the superhero movies out this year so far have a lot of political overtones with several characters in this film asking can good really be good the search for the answer throughout this film is very exciting this is easily one of the most intriguing superhero movies i have seen in a while unlike the recently released batman v superman this film approached the politics of heroism in a less bleak way it provided laughs throughout when comic relief felt needed mainly from one robert downey jr and the plot twists though some a tad predictable made for excellent action and thrills definitely one of the better entries in the marvel series
May 8 2016,negative,the movie would have been just fine with steve bucky  tony and possibly sam but it has excessive of everything characters action scenes the only things it actually lacks is depth and development whether it is in terms of the romance between steve and sharon or the characters personalities i have never seen a movie that is so afraid of delving into its plot that each time it comes close to doing so it breaks into an action scene   there are so many irrelevant characters in this movie but i can hardly complain about that because about 70 of the movie itself is irrelevant the actual plot lies mostly within the last 3035 minutes   i left the cinema feeling like ive wasted money on this movie this has never happened to me  it made me wonder how does one manage to go from the winter soldier to a disaster like this
May 8 2016,positive,the only complaint i have is how this and other avenger movies start in middle of complex fight scenes and if you take someone who had never seen one of earlier movies has no idea who is who and what the fight is about they should explain the back story so newcomers have some idea what its all about  the plot was complex and well done  the acting was great special effects superb
May 8 2016,positive,im shallow but chris evans is smoking hot
May 8 2016,positive,another top notch movie from marvel studios  this time spiderman is finally part of the mcu now that sony and marvel were able to make a deal to share the character   ironman will be in sonys spiderman homecoming movie next summer though i think sony is pretty much just letting marvel make the movie and sony will simply distribute and put there pretty little logo on it  we also get introduced to black panther who get his own movie right before infinity war part 1 my only nit picky complaint is some shaky camera action scene early in the movie  i hate shaky camera action scenes  other than that it is nearly a perfect movie
May 8 2016,positive,amazing movie  better than i expected
May 7 2016,positive,what marvel does spectacularly this time is that it decides to touch some great topics while keeping their formula intact and balance all of that perfectly i still want them to stop fearing and dare to make a plot heavy film
May 7 2016,negative,the fact that this garbage has such a high rating makes me embarrassed to be a human
May 7 2016,positive,one of the best marvel films to date
May 7 2016,positive,if i could rate it a 10 i would captain america films have always been the best in the mcu
May 7 2016,positive,a very good and clear action packed story all the characters fit in and contribute to the plot without seeming cluttered and everyones motivation is very clear only a few characters shy of being avengers 3
May 7 2016,positive,really good movie lots of action and a lot of info to process favorite parts were anything spiderman and black panther only downside was expecting to see a very important death but didnt 
May 7 2016,positive,captain america civil war is the latest in disneys seemingly endless marvel cinematic universe mcu for short and the third film in the captain america solo franchise while also serving as an almost direct sequel to last years avengers age of ultron which followed on from marvels the avengers and will soon lead to avengers infinity war make sense while im sure nobody needs explaining as to what the mcu is we have finally reached the definitive point where the casual fan might start to get a little bit confused why is there a new spiderman again ive heard many people ask why is iron man the baddie when will iron man fight batman or superman etc     now to the people who ask these questions this movie is not for you but of course disneymarvel studios dont mind the fact that youll watch it anyway enjoy it become slightly confused and then go about your lives as if nothing has happened until the next super hero film is released these movies have become hard to review simply because you have to try and see it as its own film but that is not what they are anymore they are all part of a bigger picture and while that ambition was far more admirable nearly a decade ago when iron man took the world by storm it is still quite a remarkable achievement that they have been able to release consistently lets say decent movies every year i guess you could say now it is more like a tv series with featurelength episodes captain america civil war is one of the better entries weve seen so far  for the first time in the mcu it feels like something is at stake this issue has plagued the franchise and prevented it from becoming so much more than it currently is personally there are some decisions i wish had been changed to really raise the tension to the next level but compared to what we have seen in the past this is where things have finally started to pack a bit more of an emotional punch we knew that we would see iron man fight captain america in this movie but its the conflict between steve rogers and tony stark that breaks our hearts its a fresh feeling to actually care who our heroes are fighting and what they are fighting for with the mandatory villain of the week aspect scrapped this time around for the most part at least    the marketing for the film had audiences scratching their heads as to why this film was titled captain america and not avengers i can safely say that it definitely is a captain america or maybe an iron man film and thank goodness because despite featuring what are essentially extended cameos in an undeniably entertaining action sequence the film definitely wouldve struggled to keep a strong focus and consistent tone otherwise the fight scene at the airport was glorious to watch but it definitely felt like it was from another film it does feature a few of the avengers in larger roles but this is all about cap and iron man and their conflicting beliefs     civil war doesnt necessarily break any ground for the franchise but it is as entertaining an instalment we have seen so far and most importantly it brings in enough fresh ideas to keep even the slightly more cynical fans interested for at least another round the avengers sequences while insanely entertaining were a little jarring and that does not bode particularly well for the upcoming infinity war twoparter which feels like it is really going to struggle to balance all of these characters at the end of the day you know what youre getting into with this one so dont expect this to change your mind about super hero movies
May 7 2016,negative,2hrs of boring dialog 10 min of socalled fighting and 16 more minutes of more boring conversation snore fest
May 7 2016,positive,i am a big spiderman fan the new spiderman is fresh and hilarious reminds me of the ultimate spiderman comics  black panther was one of the most faithful comic adaptations ever on par with deadpool  black widow had some really great fight scenesand showed how strong she is  be expecting a black widow solo film  scarlet witch got a lot of screen time and they are fleshing her character out which is great  iron man was as solid as ever  he made the overall story very compelling  captain america bucky and falcon were amazing together almost like a little family  had some of the best comedy in the movie besides of course spiderman antman was sooooooooo awesome great comedy and shows how he can keep up with the big leaguers  scot lang is his own kind of tactical genius especially with is suit the russo brothers have their sht down  on complaint why didnt baron von zemo have all of his powers  this movie was great it is a must watch
May 7 2016,positive,this is going to be the best spiderman in the history of marvel he nailed that part all n all this movie was amazing
May 7 2016,positive,45 to base off other comic book movies from this year so far not as good as deadpool way better than bvs
May 7 2016,positive,everything a superhero movie should be and more
May 7 2016,positive,absoulty loved the movie
May 7 2016,positive,this movie was so good that it made ben affleck cry 
May 7 2016,positive,great action packed with well put story line but lacked some visual effects and spider man was not well put in the story
May 7 2016,positive,it was so good it ripped the heart out of my chest and stomped on though i could have done without the really rushed romance between cap and sharon
May 7 2016,positive,if trump wins the election i hope captain america is the first to cross the border he kicks ass and i think would look great wearing the maple leaf
May 7 2016,positive,although a bit bloated by 20 minutes or so theres still a lot to like here  the main battle in the movies namesake war does not disappoint  the new characters introduced especially black panther are compelling  the action is well directed and the conflicts between the characters unlike another tent pole this summer  lookin at you batman v superman are well earned
May 7 2016,positive,the graphics and the reality of the world was incredibly believable acting and stunts were flawless i especially enjoyed the new spidey but how can any avenger fan enjoy watching them beat on each other i hated the whole premise of the plot my favorite part was the first easter egg
May 7 2016,positive,saw captain america civil war todaya real knockout amazing job by the directors and writers of juggling many characters and giving so many either character arcs or strong bits to advance your knowledge of the characters downey is such a fine actor that he sells why he backs the governments sidebut you know that cap knows best nice beats from vision ant man and spiderman tho its sad to be older than aunt may the villain isnt into world   domination for a changetho some aspects of his plans could be clearer  the big battle made me squeal like a kid one of the best super hero films to date
May 7 2016,positive,best film in the marvel universe yet really great to see the handle that fiege and the russo brothers have on the content characters and themes by infusing totally new elements into familiar storylines they have reinvigorated the entire universe propelling it into new directions for future spinoffs highly recommend and super pleased with my experience
May 7 2016,positive,second favorite marvels film for me right now
May 7 2016,positive,really fun but honestly i thought batman v superman was better only because the marvel movies are starting to feel pretty much the same i did love the spiderman introduction though even though it totally feels a little forced oh look we have the rights from sony to use spiderman now so here he is
May 7 2016,positive,a well made movie that isnt afraid to break the rules stay to the end there is a teaser
May 7 2016,positive,if banner was there none of this wouldve happened
May 7 2016,positive,third times the charm as captain america suits up in an epic and ideological face off with the iconic jokeslinking billionaire iron man marvel is no stanger to a largerthanlife ensemble but the way civil war magically weaves together its magneticallycaptivating characters is far more exceptional than both avengers and the recent blunder of its rival batman v superman the captain america subseries have always been a mature staple of the marvel cinematic universe civil war both embraces its roots of political entanglement with the sharp understated humor of its more charming guests like antman and spiderman with that being said the choreography of the many adrenalinepumping fight scenes are creatively stylish with anâ attention to detail in particular there is an apartment stairwell scene and the final showdown that will have you biting your nails all of the characters are well established with buyable motivations which in turn butt heads the motivations of others this growing web of interactions will lock your attention as the film properly acknowledges the consequences of its predecessors its pleasantly enjoyable to witness a marvel film earn the emotional weight demanded by its story and the characters  something i found to be a work in progress for marvel in the past here it is exquisitely achieved with brisk pacing and a noncartoonish approach to its themes and dialogue the irony is civil war is everything batman v superman should have been and yes if you want to be jaded there are small gripes in midst simply put captain america is the best inhouse marvel movie to date and an accomplishment in what it wishes to achieve im happy to report more that civil war is definitely worth your time and money
May 7 2016,positive,good movie overall but did seem a bit scattered no so much as bvs but enough to notice would like to see a little more grit brought into the marvel universe
May 7 2016,positive,captain america was good  winter soldier was great   civil war is epic
May 7 2016,positive,while not as compelling as winter soldier civil war is still an excellent addition to the mcu its a bit long and stuffed but its never boring and the stuff its crammed with is pure awesome sauce
May 7 2016,negative,the movie was a mess bad story telling and bad filming saw it in 3d and was not worth it
May 7 2016,negative,not enough spiderman
May 7 2016,positive,all the nuance of a tank barreling down the highway with a hint of sass and a dash of razzle dazzle cap and co come flying through guns blazing in an epic sequel with enough explosions insubordination and belly laughs to make michael bay stand up and cheer
May 7 2016,positive,howard stark john slattery to a young tony stark you know they say sarcasm is a metric for potential if thats true youll be a great man some day    i liked this much better than avengers age of ultron  from the beginning there was nonstop action while the story arc seamlessly blended in the dialogue  thoroughly enjoyable actionpack and entertaining missing a few notable high profile characters thor and hulk but spiderman peter parker played by tom holland black panther tchalla played by chadwick boseman and antman scott lang played by paul rudd more than made up for the the two mega stars absencemaybe even made the film better imho  the storyline was bit more somber in the beginning but midway through the film there was a fair amount of humor best delivered by the man himself stan lee  overall highly entertaining worthy of the price of admission
May 7 2016,positive,civil war has lofty goals perhaps too lofty for audience expectations but that is where it excels it gives you almost everything you expect and then breaks your expectations for what popcorn films can achieve
May 7 2016,positive,i will buy the blue ray of it
May 7 2016,positive,will watch again later today
May 7 2016,positive,the short of it hands down the best marvel movie ever     ok the extended non spoiler review short of it if you were subjected to the horrible humpback whale after birth  festering elephant carcass in the nevada desert which was batman v superman dong of justice then run to the theater no seriously go now and see this twice stop reading and go now     still here ok  the balance of characters humor action drama and plenty of laugh out loud moments true lol is impressive the airport battle scene from the trailers is alone worth the price of admission  you feel every characters struggle and motivation and the battles are bloody and people do get  up     theres some awesome surprises and now finally the definitive spiderman is on film hes perfect here so is black panther whom i cant wait to see in his own movie this movie is everything you hope for and sadly everything bats v supes wishes it couldve been im down to see it two more times go now
May 7 2016,positive,really good long movie but wanted even more
May 7 2016,positive,quite possibly the best marvel movie to date
May 7 2016,positive,see the movie it is excellent
May 7 2016,positive,great movie  surprisingly good i really enjoyed the characters and i enjoyed the tension between the good guys when what is good is sometimes not clear  this movie is also clever  go see it
May 7 2016,positive,great moviewell put together
May 7 2016,positive,greatest comic book movie ever
May 7 2016,positive,once again marvel succeeds where dc fails a tight script that is able to masterfully weave in so many different characters and storylines
May 7 2016,positive,another great marvel movie easily the best spiderman portrayal so far i am disappointed that they changed another quality villain and made him seem very lame but over all it was awesome i could have easily watched another 2 hours and 40 minutes second credits scene was the best of all second credit scenes worth the wait
May 7 2016,positive,everything that a great superhero film should be there is a surprising depth of honest emotion that comes from heroes taking responsibility for collateral deaths after this movie the genre cant ignore the people the on the battleground in the background any more then there is great humor throughout and the action is more meaningful and sometimes fun than in any super hero movie to date this is the best of them all marvel or dc
May 7 2016,positive,hand down the best movie of the year it was exciting and good from the start to finish well crafted such a great gift to the fans   thank you for the amazing delivery     first movie that i didnt go to the bathroom   it should not be compared to batman vs superman there is not comparison to be made
May 7 2016,positive,the batman forever of the cap trilogy honestly the movie comes no where near as close to the comic that its named after its a good movie thats falls to the hype leading up to it marvel has had better movies but at least it had spiderman if you had issues with bvs youre gonna have issues with this  so far marvel could only get loki red skull  obedia stane correct when it comes to its villains
May 7 2016,positive,captain america civil war once again by the russos brothers at the helm of directing another captain america movie the russos his brothers to prove that they can make an excellent avengers movie seeing this film brings me joy lately when i came out of the movie theater i came out saying that this is the best marvel movie i have ever seen in my life despise from my favorite alltime favorite superhero film is the dark knight directed and written by christopher nolan and i never have a second one but till today captain america civil war is my second favorite superhero phone i have ever seen in my life and i never once in my life is a marvel fan i do enjoy reading the comics from marvel and dc i was really hoping for this film to be much better than batman versus superman citing on from the comic books i was fighting on captain america and this is not focus more on the avengers is more focus on the relationship of captain america theres only one little flaw that did bother me for sex in the film and i was just the main villain but at the end he had a purpose for being in the film so good for the russos brothers for writing that in a very strongly for their film and for tom hollands spiderman holy crap this is the best spiderman i have ever seen in the cinematic world of marvel at i am not kidding around here tom holland proves to be the best peter parkerspiderman we have ever seen in theater history of spiderman as for this film altogether does very well i am extremely excited for the next spiderman film of spiderman homecoming and it ventures part one and two by the russos brothers i am cant wait for those films to come out and i cant wait to see what marvel can stirup for its audience lazy gentlemen the only movie company that really want to make really good movies but never have a desire of having awards is disney and disney does care for their audience and i do care for disney what they are doing what the marvel cinematic world and star wars they are doing it right and i am having a smile on my face saying it well done disney and well done marvel this is an excellent film and this is going to be on my top of my list of this year for best films very happy i extremely recommend seeing this phone before go straight out to bluray in four months or so and please for the arrivals of dc which i associate more too please learn from disneys and marvels makings of making a very good cinematic movie of superheroes please learn from the russos brothers for making out well entertaining and heartfelt movie i was superhero christopher nolan did it right same of the russos brothers      tom holland you are the man    grade   a perfect 10
May 7 2016,positive,interesting story of superheroes with super awesome action sequences but too many characters have its own false
May 7 2016,positive,i almost cried from extremes of each emotion throughout the entire movie
May 7 2016,neutral,well this movie didnt feel right wasnt feeling the love between cap and winter dont drink the koolaid it was ok
May 7 2016,negative,fanboys are filling cyberspace with their nonsense not worth seeing
May 7 2016,positive,i have to admit the superhero genre is a tough one for me not particularly a fan civil war has its moments though i loved the new spiderman hes a total dork and thats really lovable the new incarnations of spiderman on film i think have major potential thank god the andrew garfield days are over also paul rudd is back and funny as ever as antman
May 7 2016,positive,best comic book movie ever made and quite possibly just flat out one of the best films ever made
May 7 2016,positive,overly complicated plot that leaves you asking why
May 7 2016,positive,must keep thinking about it
May 7 2016,positive,this ones gonna make you a fan
May 7 2016,negative,meh  ok movie with great action scenes but abismal plot
May 7 2016,positive,by far the best ensemble marvel movie that has been put together thus the russo brothers took upon themselves a seemingly daunting and impossible task and nailed all the beats if marvel doesnt hand the reigns of showpiece films off to these brothers after this i will be very surprised this felt like a coming of age for the style of movies marvel has been striving to make the closest they have come to a swan song for the genre thus far it nailed the tragedy in a compelling and very human way i went into the movie expecting to side with captain america the ending however provides the gravitas needed to leave the audience leaving  the theater strongly compelled in rhetorical modes of persuasion by both team cap and team stark it is the tale of two brothers and it is at the same time a tale of contemporary america and the unacknowledged consequences of our lingering imperialism agenda   some may draw issue with the underdeveloped villain in this movie i would argue that in retrospect of his master plan he is perchance one of the most compelling and human villains to grace the superhero cinema stage in recent memory the expertise with which he carries out his master plan is wonderfully sophisticated and compelling   the highlight of the movie where it all pulls together and forever cements within my mind that the ensemble superhero movies is something indeed possible and successful is the airport scene roughly halfway through the film no character is underutilized or underappreciated the signature actioninfused comedy which has become marvels trademark has never been better especially with the welcome additions of ant man and spiderman   speaking of spiderman and oh is he someone that should be talked about rest assured spiderman has been done right this time round although i find the merits in garfields performance and maguire will always be the definitive peter parker newcomer tom holland makes a compelling case for himself the friendly neighborhood arachnid has never had better dialogue each line hit with all the paradoxically brilliant wit awkwardness intellect and humor that fans of the comic books have been yearning for so long it will be interesting to see how more screen time given to the face behind the mask will pan out my hope is equally onpoint  as a further testament to the crew behind these movies and the masters at the helm the russo brothers black panther and spiderman were introduced and developed to the necessary level while at the same time avoiding detraction and unnecessary sidelining of the main plot if anything is a testament to the films mastery this seemingly small matter i would in fact argue is the films greatest boon   and while the film does have its flaws particularly an easily resolved issue at the end after the main climax these hitching points are far and few between and are as unnoticeable as they have ever been my only lingering complaint this is not a captain america film but damn if it needs to be
May 7 2016,positive,captain america civil war truly ranks as one of the best films in the marvel cinematic universe and the superhero genre
May 7 2016,positive,perfect  what a phenomenal film in every way  character development pacing and action sequences are all top notch
May 7 2016,neutral,if you have watched the trailer you have watched the movie only those who go to movies to see some sfx action will like this movie this aint civil war this aint even war this is just a dog fight over a stupid thing the actual civil war from comics was nasty much bigger while this one felt like a ego fight between iron man and captain america externded version of what you see in the trailer is what you get in the movie there is nothing more to it
May 7 2016,positive,i enjoyed this movie enough to score it 35  without tossing any spoilers out just yet i will just say they did and did not do some things that would have made this movie that much more in my opinion
May 7 2016,positive,the action comedy plot and characters were all done perfectly best marvel movie by far
May 7 2016,positive,the best marvel movie so far
May 7 2016,positive,i love all of the avenger related movies but this one just didnt do it for methe storyline and cinematography lacked id call it a b  c
May 7 2016,positive,cant even lie the movie was great aside from two minor complaints i cant really say anything bad about this film
May 7 2016,positive,it was amazing fun but intense definitely avengers 25 but awesome movie tom holland is a great spiderman black panther was great bring on phase 3
May 7 2016,positive,honestly a perfect movie had nothing but fun watching it
May 7 2016,positive,marvel did it again they just keep getting better and better so much i could talk about so much happened and every bit of it was better then the next they introduced spider man and nailed it black panther again nailed it  the writingphenomenal  casting couldnt of been better and the direction great  theyre firing on all cylinders here in this movie and as of right now are swinging at the knees and cant be stopped  if you havent already seen all the other movies leading to this you could still enjoy it and not be to lost  they still have room to grow here too thats whats amazing  they didnt even use the hulk or thor thats two major players who didnt get 1 second of airtime and there was still so much to take in  ive already typed more then i should get up go see it spend the money and enjoy  lot of crap out there to waste money on this is well worth it  absolute slam dunk home run best marvel movie to date surpassing the avengers 1      ps  i was team cap going in and im still team cap going out
May 7 2016,positive,i really dont know what to say other then is movie was awesome
May 7 2016,positive,great storytelling with just enough action great way to introduce new character especially black panther
May 7 2016,positive,loved it this is marvels best movie yet
May 7 2016,positive,deep story with emotion  marvel does it again  the movie doesnt seem 2 and 12 hours because youre invested in the story both black panther and spiderman were introduced very well and i can not wait for their movies  the winter solider has so many more layers added to his character  ant man  great action  great movie go see it
May 7 2016,positive,the russo brothers have managed to take an approach few superhero movies have done in the past while most have been thankful the avengers have saved mankind countless times others have a big concern that they live outside the law and need to answer for the damages theyve left in their wake  the film smartly talks about a realworld concern we have as captain america puts it the safest arms are still our own meaning is it really better to have a higher form of government authority oversee everything we do to ensure the safety of the world steve rogers has been through hell and back fighting hydra in wwii bringing down hydra again when shield was infiltrated and now questions whether or not giving up individual freedoms is better or worse  iron mans guilt is also starting to catch up with him as well feeling that if he and the others dont keep themselves in check from time to time things will spiral out of control  meanwhile with rogers allies and starks both are at odds with conflicting ideologies an explosion takes place during a un peace signing escalating tensions even further  one of the members tchalla of the nation wakanda dons the black panther persona going after the winter soldierbucky barnes believing he is responsible  scarlett witch after a mishap during a mission in lagos struggles with controlling her abilities afraid of whom she might hurt in the process but she has vision guiding her and warning that strength invites challenge challenge incites conflict and conflict breeds catastrophe  everything has a price so the movie doesnt have you agree with just one side of the argument you see both sides even if they may be right or wrong  the middle of the movie is actually better than the climax which is a real shame because more of the excitement lies in the clashing of ideals both physically and mentally  someone else is pulling the strings pitting our heroes against one another but hes just not that interesting as a central villain the same cant be said for crossbones at the beginning he looks cool but is sadly wasted  the real reason to see this movie though is the debut of spiderman whom the fans have been begging for to be part of the avengers for a long time and boy does he make an impression youll be jittering with glee while also geeking out at the hero vs hero action set pieces  there are two very good twists in the plot as well that rightfully tears the team apart getting them to where they are  i still feel the russo brothers could have gone a bit darker as well as further with the heavy themes yet this all still works making two sides of a coin  like captain america points out this job says people have to be saved but that doesnt mean everyone  tough decisions still have to be made for the greater good
May 7 2016,positive,every character in the film is fleshed out perfectly with each getting their moments but focuses on captain america since this is a captain america movie the action visuals and cinematography is amazing the airport battle scene one of the best if not the best action scene i had seen in film history spiderman and black panther is awesome in the movie and i cant wait to see them in their own solo movie the villain was also good better than most villains in the mcu only behind loki and winter solider i give it a 1010 go watch the movie it is worth it
May 7 2016,neutral,great action and lots of joke but i found the story kind of meh
May 7 2016,positive,another good marvel movie winter soldier is still my favorite marvel film but this is a close 2nd the airport sequence was pretty epic
May 7 2016,positive,this film is one of the best comic book movies i have ever seen  this film is what i wanted avengers age of ultron to be from the massive cast of superheroes to the fantastic action scenes  as for what everyone was waiting for spiderman  spiderman has always been my favorite marvel hero and i have been waiting to see a perfect spidermanpeter parker on screen  toby mcguire had the emotion andrew garfield had the humor but tom holland has both i loved him
May 7 2016,positive,the movie was a bit long and i wish thor hulk and samuel l jackson were able too i make an appearance but overall civil war delivers the addition of spiderman and black panther was more than welcome and the story was complex and a fresh change from the good guys vs bad guys formula that a lot of marvel movies have followed i am interested in where the avengers will go from here and i cant wait to find out
May 7 2016,positive,dc take note this is how you make a superhero movie in the mcu id rank this only behind the first avengers
May 7 2016,positive,not just the best marvel movie but probably the best super hero movie ever
May 7 2016,positive,great movie  probably not as good of a captain america movie as the winter soldier but a better avengers movie than age of ultron
May 7 2016,positive,im giving it a 5 to counteract the cry babies that want to give it â½ star as if its vengeance for how terrible batman vs superman was boo hoo cry a river all in all with that being said it was a great movie with solid action and fight sequences the plotstory was intriguing with a few twists and my only complain is the under poweringover powering of certain heroes to make certain fights seem more fair also i found the ending very abrupt
May 7 2016,positive,favorite marvel movie yet smart plot twists action sequences and fantastic character developments pull this late addition to the marvel universe to the top of my list only gripe would be the new spiderman i know im in the minority but i thought this was the worst adaptation of the character to make the big screen yet instead of smart one liners i got cheesy oh wow metal arm quips lame
May 7 2016,positive,captain america was the right balance of humour action plot and characters  definitely one of the best super hero movies
May 7 2016,positive,awesome this movie couldnt have been more perfect exceeded my expectations
May 7 2016,positive,if you see this movie like a series this could be a season finale the emotion is there the motivations the great action scenes the mature of the characters and the end of its relationship that we saw grow up  civil war is the combination of a great cast and a screenplay that pays off
May 7 2016,negative,movie was too much like a video game very little story line and too much fighting blowing up buildings and flying around
May 7 2016,positive,okayheres a review  growing up i read a lot of comic books over the years   i was usually drawn to the dc line but as issues stacked up i fell more and more into the marvel track  still seems to be the case these days  i saw and yes in some ways enjoyed batman vs superman  but i was aware that the action scenes were too fast and fleeting to really follow thingsâwhich was also sometimes true of the plot  and as much as i admiredenjoyed superman and batman as a kid it was a bit hard to feelâconnectedâwith either of the title characters  and was it dark  imho these are not problems in the marvel universe  i totally loved captain america civil war and i think im also speaking for my wife  part of my ongoing enjoyment of the marvel franchises is that i feel like i can identify with almost all of the characters well the good guys at least one way or another  i may shed a tear when one of them suffers emotional pain def when someone who is cared for dies feel their drive when on a mission and joyfully look forward to the humor that is so often presented in almost any setting of the films  and the humorous moments big and small were all delightful and often unexpected  cacw certainly has a lot of action but it can be followed  the characters their powers costumes and equipment have all been effectively brought to the screen and their personalities well fleshed out  one way or another i enjoyed each one of them including those that may have had relatively little screen time    i promise no spoilers  this one is clearly the next logical step in the development or splintering of the avengers although this isnt an avengers film and this is clearly seen in all of the trailers out there  i admit to being in the captain america camp when i walked in based mostly on his unwavering loyalty and commitment  but suffice to say loyalty isnt everythingâat least not in this case  by the end of the movies i couldnt clearly say i was in favor of one side or the other  i could certainly feel the conflicted emotions in both steve rogers and tony stark among others  evans and downey are perfect in their rolesâand frankly so is everyone else  not wanting to dwell on too many keypoints ill segue off into saying that the latest incarnation of spiderman had a great introduction into the newest marvel universe and i look forward to his next film reimagining  i also enjoyed the inclusion of ant man another good movie on its own as well as the introduction of black panther whose kingdom was hinted at in the last avengers film  all in all a great movie  many conflicts twists and turns surprises resolutions and enough left unresolved so as to set up the next very eagerly anticipated installment  and you cant beat the action although i did miss hulk and thorâbut neither were necessary to the plot frankly  and a great doctor strange trailer too  i need to see it againâin 3d  so much for this thumbnail review  any questions
May 7 2016,positive,a great and fun marvel addition
May 7 2016,positive,maybe one of the best superhero movies yet
May 7 2016,positive,great fun movie with great action and heart  took 5 off because of over crowding and marvel still suffering from a lack of memorable villains
May 7 2016,positive,captain america civil war is the most enjoyable movie that i have seen in a very long time and probably the best of the marvel movies it will be tough to top this one
May 7 2016,positive,i was a little bored until spiderman and ant man showed up
May 7 2016,positive,this movie is everything i wanted it to be the action is absolutely incredible but it is driven by an emotional story after bucky sebastian stan is blamed for an act of terrorism cap fights to defend him from the us government these action scenes are amazing to watch the russos proved they could direct action in the winter soldier and they show that talent again with this film i was surprised with how many action scenes are in this film considering they only highlighted the giant airport battle in the trailers but there are so many sprinkled throughout the film that you are constantly entertained the airport scene is without a doubt the best part of the movie and may be one of the best action scenes in any of the marvel cinematic universe films    read the full review here 
May 7 2016,positive,nonspoiler easily one of the best marvel films to date although there are a lot of avengers in this movie captain america is still the center of this movie the movie is loaded with action and laugher spiderman and black panther are the stand out characters of this movie this movies only negative is the villain if you enjoy superhero movies and a good laugh then this is defiantly the movie for you
May 7 2016,positive,a competent superhero yarn it tries to reach the heights of winter soldierand does not succeed      the story is lazy as apparently all characters have invulnerability as a trait but i guess this movie does not attempt to show the true impact of the level of violence presented except for one scene  otherwise the movie portrayed these characters as simple and unsophisticatedbut i guess that makes them relatable to the audience    the movie is competentwatch it once    if you like agents of shield you can even watch it twice    but it aint no winter soldier which is still the mcu high watermark by some way
May 7 2016,positive,its interesting to have them fighting each other on a principle however buckys back story is tiring and so is the ageing iron man  its time for him to fade into the background and give space to the newbies this is you wanda and black panther jeremy renner does himself proud and spider man is fun ant man you rock  the airport battle sequence is amazingly well choreographed
May 7 2016,positive,spidermans aunt is hot af
May 7 2016,negative,ehok captain america civil war liked falcons new outfit and fight scenes ok only few 1 liners hit for me rest fell flat needed tighter smarter script and story
May 7 2016,positive,easily the best marvel film to date the airport sequence alone is worth the price of admission this is how you handle an ensemble of superheroes highly recommended
May 7 2016,positive,such a great movie 45 to 5 out of 5 stars only loses half a star for some nitpicky stuff like tiny plotholes or conveniences but there was too much good in it for that to matter loved all the little hints throughout the game towards other things comic book things that i hope to see
May 7 2016,positive,action packed black panther looked incredible 
May 7 2016,negative,this movie felt like an excuse for everyones favorite superheroes to have a banterfilledyetsomehowhighstakes battle the plot was weak the main villains goal hinged on iron man also showing up how did he know that he would why didnt anyone ever try to get black panther into the loop and the characterization was crazy bucky flipped a switch from i dont know what i remember to oh hey remember that time we bought hot dogs captain american was 100 unreasonable and unwilling to talk and when iron man asked him if he know bucky had killed his parents he didnt even manage an im sorry i should have  except that letter at the end which was 100 a self righteous im clearly right and when you figure that out ill be around to help you out the fight at the end between iron man captain america and bucky  does this movie really expect us to believe all three of them would be that degree of unreasonable and easily manipulated the plot was written in a way for iron man to end up wrong  he ends up with no one except vision and rhodney while captain america gets all the friends but both characters had valid points and neither were wrong this movie could have reached an ending where the avengers were still on opposing sides but it didnt seemed like it really tried it was just an excuse for internal conflict and big explosions disappointing
May 7 2016,positive,spoiler alert this movie is so great ill need a few more views to say whether or not its the best mcu movie yet but its up there markus and mcfeely know how to write especially considering the sheer amount of characters in this film the russo brothers magically put the script to screen getting some of the best performances out of recurring actors like downy and evans and the action was shot so well probs to them and stahelki and leitch for shooting these incredible action scenes spiderman and black panther were introduced so well and the actors playing them were incredible seeing the character interactions between scarlet witch and vision and tony and peter gave me nerd chills this film is like a well crafted argument it makes you see both sides of the argument and at different moments you may lean to one side or the other beautifully making this civil war seem real although marvel has a bad record with villans with loki as a notable exception this installment didnt need a big baddy and zemos character was well developed enough to be believable and played an integral part in dividing tge avengers and unlike the other marvel villains he won going forward this movie set up black panther and spiderman as perfectly as it could the russo brothers have succeeded in every way and i have full confidence infinity war will be incredible
May 7 2016,positive,awesome excluding that the stories heart seems to be derived from a committee poll
May 7 2016,positive,awesome the black panther is so cool
May 7 2016,positive,they got everything right with this flick this is what bvs shouldve been
May 7 2016,positive,the only bright spot was the debut of the next spiderman tom holland  the rest of the story fell flat
May 7 2016,positive,unfortunately  my 5 stars wont help the movie getting any oscar nominations in terms of pure enter this hits the mark  so long as youre aware that some stunts are outlandish and not possible in reality
May 7 2016,positive,awesome movie  a well written plot  this is not a z snyder film and thats a good thing
May 7 2016,positive,a better avengers movie than the avengers and ultron
May 7 2016,positive,best main marvel movie
May 7 2016,positive,the best film of 2016 as is my confident prediction  it will be quite challenging to compete with this incredible thriller as even bvs probably wished they had released their despondent flick in a different year  this is the heroic movie we deserve
May 7 2016,positive,this  was  a true  clash  of  superheroes the  batman superman  fight  should  have  been  this  good and  my  boy  spidey  was  awsome but  the  voice  from a teenager  who hits purbity to  a voice that  he  didnt cap  and  ironman fights  were amazing and  that  final  fight  in the  end was truly a fight
May 7 2016,negative,not as good as rated
May 7 2016,positive,great moviesstory line was great action was great and the intro to other characters awesome
May 7 2016,negative,quite frankly i was bored one epic fight battle with a surprise wasnt enough the commercials showed the best parts of the show
May 7 2016,positive,absolutely fun and amazing  i absolutely loved this
May 7 2016,positive,a great story with a lot of really good action and humour the new additions are great but in my opinion antman steals the show stay until after the credits for a bonus scene the villain could have been better but otherwise a near perfect super hero film
May 7 2016,positive,it was everything i wanted in a marvel movie i went in knowing about the comics and how it was and this is by far a better outcome because i went in team cap all the way and i left with not knowing what side i wanted to be on ever actor in this movie was perfect there was a ton of emotion and i plan on seeing this movie another 5 times
May 7 2016,positive,the only things i didnt like about this movie was the omission of nick fury and the fact that no one died   otherwise it was a completely fun ride that completes a well done trilogy  ant man and spiderman injected some great comedy to their teams while black panther stole the show   the 360 degree completion from company man solider to vigilante do gooder has made captain america my favorite character
May 7 2016,positive,kinda long but pretty good
May 7 2016,positive,straight up bad azz much better than age of ultron i didnt think they would make another flick as bad azz as winter soldier but im glad i was wrong spidey damn near stole the show and i was happy to see ant man use the suits potential
May 7 2016,positive,with a title as bold as civil war the latest marvel movie takes very few risks and ends with an unsatisfying conclusion
May 7 2016,positive,outstanding movie  riveting story and incredible action and fight scenes  great introduction to new characters the black panther and the new spiderman  i really like them  besides the tremendous action theres some good dramatic and funny parts  another triumph by brother directors joe and anthony russo  i highly recommend it  it was worth it to see it in imax 3d
May 7 2016,negative,its an okay movie but if youve seen the other avengers movie youve seen it all
May 7 2016,positive,it was a good movie but i dont see what everybody is so hyped about it wasnt the best marvel movie
May 7 2016,positive,civil war its the pinnacle of overly produced entertainment for the masses its a different kind of oreo cookie not a steak dinner
May 7 2016,positive,captain america 3 civil war is one of the top 10 marvel movies though a huge ensemble cast this superhero flick actually takes the time to establish and develop character and motivations additionally civil war takes a semirealistic look at real world consequences for comic book action sequences several side characters from the past few marvel movies such as vision scarlet witch and hawkeye all receive additional screen time and character development the break out new characters of  black panther and spiderman shine in their limited screen time and have genuine presence and endearing traits most impressive is the continuing character development and dynamic of the relationship between chris evans captain america and robert downey jrs ironman each second these two are on screen together is like a paneled page from the comics this superhero vs movie does everything a certain earlier movie this summer wishes it had been able to accomplish all in all this film is comic book geek fun from start to finish but equally thought provoking and well written
May 7 2016,positive,some of the best actions scenes ive seen on film incorporated with excellent characters and an great story make for a hell of a movie
May 7 2016,positive,its difficult not to love a marvel film that tries to relate to its audience while simultaneously being entertaining like this one some more serious undertones here such as when heroism can miss the mark and the overall battle of innocence vs guilt and mercy vs bloodshed is shown brightly through the inner rivalry all these characters have its hard to find anything integrally wrong with civil war it follows in the lines of avengers and other superhero films that have significance
May 7 2016,positive,my favorite film within the mcu was captain america winter solider i thought combining the superhero genre with the spyespionage genre was a really clever and interesting direction to take captain america within a modern world the same directors and writers have returned for civil war and it shows  instead of avengers 25 we get a captain america centred film that focuses on the themes of family revenge and guilt that made for a really compelling and engaging story that was complimented by some of the best action and handtohand combat scenes ever put to film comic book film or otherwise the stunt work is also worthy of a standing ovation it was breath taking to watch just because of how raw and real it felt more action films should take a note from the action scenes here  unlike a certain other vs movie this year i completely understood the motivations of each character and why they were doing what they were doing it would have been easy to make iron man the black and white villain of the film that was just acting for the government but instead the creators opted to tell a story that divided not just the characters but fans and audiences as well who was right its a matter of perspective and personal beliefs and i loved how that idea was addressed within the film itself  civil war not only works as a welcome addition to the mcu and sequel to winter solider but also as its own standalone film about a group of heroes who are finally seeing the consequences of their actions come to light its a film that can also be enjoyed by moviegoers that do not follow the marvel films my girlfriend typically doesnt like superhero films but the drama and realism from civil war won her over more than any avengers movie ever could  my only complaint there was an actual villain in the movie that really felt like he didnt need to be there there were other plot devices they could have used to move the story in the direction they wanted without him great actor and performance he just wasnt a necessity to the story  overall this could arguably be marvel studios best film i have never seen such a great story complimented by such great action and humor in any of their other films it wasnt just a great story though it was a mature one that transcended the typical material found in most comic book films its my new favorite comic book film and i recommend it to anyone who loves these types of movies or just wants a really goodcompelling story thats also entertaining
May 7 2016,positive,it is for sure my favorite movie of the year
May 7 2016,positive,best comic book movie ive seen since the dark knight
May 7 2016,positive,and thats how you progress the storyline nospoiler  spiderman was awesome so near to the comics funny geeky    aunt may was hot black panther hot damn dem vibranium suit  each and every character was developed their relationships explored   fight choreography was so awesome russo brothers knew exactly where to place the camera and to imagine that half of the heroes were added in the frame later  it was dark when it needed to be and funny when it was natural to be  best superhero movie of the year quite likely top 3 all time  while it was a cap movie i am still teamironman  it pays off brilliantly if you rewatch the movies in the right order and recently too to compare tony stark in im1 and this and to see steve evolve from ca1 to this is mind boggling     spoilers ahead      origin stories of black panther and spider man were handled so good black panthers origin was explained extensively as less people would have known about it and spider mans origin story was fluid when pete just says something happened and i got my powers youre like yeah i know and when tony starts to name him spider boy spider nib etc  winter soldiers bike catching scene black panther chasing him airport and final prison fight i can watch them on loop for hours    in the end i feel good about russo brothers directing infinity wars but even for that would be hard to top this
May 7 2016,positive,captain america civil wars best quality is providing humanity to our characters and taking the audience through the struggles of each individual its a movie about superheroes not a superhero movie it was a fun experience and a fantastic introduction to phase 3
May 7 2016,positive,is civil obedience always moral that is the question central to captain america civil war the two main characters captain america and iron man approach the  matter with vastly differing perspectives which put them in opposition with one another and forces their friends to choose sides although cap is the main character this does feel more like an avengers movie also one cannot watch this without comparing it to dawn of justice other than the number of heroes i would argue the greatest difference is the amazing depth of characterization endowed by the writers actors and director onto each of these heroes the rising tension throughout this movie allows the audience to empathize with both main characters as they go mano a mano  and mano sin mano  by the end very enjoyable    b
May 7 2016,positive,i loved the new spider man
May 7 2016,positive,hands down the best hero movie ever
May 7 2016,positive,awesome awesome to the max
May 7 2016,negative,i see where the fanboys are out to score civil war in the upper 90 to the public at large  beware this is not a horrible movie but it is far from good i cant recommend this movie attend at your own risk
May 7 2016,negative,too long too slow too much fighting too little acting and too boring gives this two stars which is too generous
May 7 2016,positive,captain america civil war is in some ways the best film in the avengers franchise i did however have criticisms the camera angles during some of the fights were disorienting cross bones was a useless villain and a few scenes drag on too long but inspite of that the characters are realistic with each side having a reason for what their doing and strong dilemas the action variety in the fights made them fun to watch it knew when to be dramatic and when to be comedic a fan of marvel wont be dissapointed
May 7 2016,positive,captain asshole all im going to say
May 7 2016,positive,this movie is exactly what a vs movie is supposed to be the charectors are motivated by there own ideas while something outside of them is makeing those ideas come to a head   the only down side of this movie is pacing it does not hold well entire segments and scenes drag on for far to long surprise and shock scenes are not that because by the time you get to the big surprise you are all ready spent from the previous moment not as good as other marvel movies it could have used with a better editor
May 7 2016,positive,this i want see mybe tomorrow is happy mother day from my super hero mom i want see mybe tomorrow after lunch time or this week
May 7 2016,positive,this should have been the second avengers movie
May 7 2016,positive,solid movie great acting the directing was the most compelling of any mcu movie so far  my biggest issues is with the plot line there are a couple major plotholes that anyone with a brain will be able to discover on your first viewing  the critics are being overly generous on this  is it worth seeing yes but it is on par with bvs to me  both had shortcomings and both had certain things going for them
May 7 2016,positive,so what are my thoughts on it this isnt just a great superhero movie it feels like a genuinely great compelling action flick with great humor and some excellent drama the dark knight comparison gets thrown around a bit too much but here is actually applies in more ways than one even if youre not usually a fan of these sorts of movies theres still plenty to appreciate and enjoy the acting is terrific all the characters have purpose and after much thought it may be my new favorite in the mcu took 8 years to finally beat out iron man for that spot
May 7 2016,positive,saw this movie today and it is honestly my favorite comic book movie of all time i went into this expecting something different boy am i glad it turned out differently than i thought it would great job russo brothers spiderman
May 7 2016,positive,what do i have to say about this movie  hmmmm 6 words best superhero and marvel movie ever   this movie got everything right    spider man is awesome funny as fuck and comic book acurate   black panther was the shit loved every scene with him   scarlett witch stool the movie for me because they showed who powerfull she is   captain america was and still is right about everything    stark was a complete egomaniacal selfcentered idiot that was wrong the entire time and he didnt wanted to admite it    bucky was awesome as well and also i cri evertime for what happen in the end credits scene    oh and by the way no spoilers here i have to say this antman omg  overall the movie was great the action was amazing and well shot the cgi was great as always and the soundtrack just amazing  so im gonna give captain america 3 civil war an a and 1010  its amazing just go see it for yourselves you wont regret it
May 7 2016,positive,if you like marvel movies you will love this movie plain and dinple
May 7 2016,positive,movie was fantastic
May 7 2016,positive,i fail to see where reviewers have praised civil war as having a noncartoonish plot  its exactly a comicbook plot ripped out of a comic book of the same name with comic book level writing its disappointing it is absolutely not a captain america movie regardless of what the producers tell you  its as much about starks struggle probably more this could have been iron man 4 and no one would have noticed  marvel just did too much this time around  this movie is a collection of interesting scenes strung together over two hoursthen dragged out over two sections of the credits  in a movie where the most fun is had when characters based on ants and arachnids are on screen i cant help but think that marvel was thinking more about their connected universe than creating a good individual movie
May 7 2016,positive,huge improvement over age of ultron which i was somewhat disappointed with this ones tons of fun from start to finish
May 7 2016,negative,a pile of garbage
May 7 2016,positive,stunt team spider man black panther with a solid script and performance
May 7 2016,positive,loved it one of the best marvel movies to date 455
May 7 2016,positive,really well done all around  great action film with a good story of unresolved differences and secrets leading to infighting among the ranks demonstrating how its not easy when trying to maintain a team thats supposed to be fighting for a common goal  they can massively disagree on how to reach that goal causing real strain in their team dynamic and personal relationships  good drama fueling great action
May 7 2016,positive,multiple characters are masterfully balanced and the new heroes please at every turn the story falters a bit at the end but the action never lets up without a doubt civil war has the best action sequence of all superhero movies but im not sure if it succeeds in making its climax a smaller emotional beat
May 7 2016,positive,a true achievement on using so many characters in and letting them all have truly outstanding moments then to top it off with a good story that not only served as a winter solider squeal but as a avengers squeal and iron man squeal best marvel film to date for sure
May 7 2016,positive,what every marvel movie should strive for perfection
May 7 2016,positive,while the beginning is a bit slow with a lot of build up the pay off is most definitely worth it sporting the biggest and best superhero showdown to date the best onscreen spidermanpeter parker experience yet and the introduction of a brand new superhero to the mcu black panther civil war has almost everything going for it however even with the 2 hour and 30 minute run time the movie at times feels rushed and underwhelming it has little time to explore the new and interesting aspects it has introduced black panther and spiderman while the movie is action packed and has a coherent story unlike its dc counterpart many of the characters feel left out and underused however the russos did a brilliant job with what they were given and what they have accomplished should be applauded hopefully now they will have the experience needed to handle the enormous cast of the third avengers 455 stars
May 7 2016,positive,ill call it best comic book movie ever done complex but it holds together action packed but i could follow everything emotional but not sappy incredibly tense but loaded with natural humor two great new characters spiderman and black panther exhilarating
May 7 2016,positive,amazing movie spiderman was incredible best marvel movie to date
May 7 2016,positive,fantastic movie i loved it looking forward to the next
May 7 2016,positive,awesome we loved it
May 7 2016,positive,magnificent  kudos to the russo brothers who make sure that the crowded cast members all get moments to shineand produce some incredible action sequences  steve rogers continues to be the most morally upright character in this universe  tony stark continues to degress  but every characters position makes at least some sense when you stand in their shoes  spectacularly done
May 7 2016,positive,total redemption for just okay ultron may be my fave marvel movie nowand someone nailed spiderman perfectly
May 7 2016,positive,i really cant think of any part of the movie that let me down  best marvel movie yet  dctake notesthats how its done
May 7 2016,positive,as expected the film was action packed with a few good bits of juicy dialogue graphics and stunts were better then in previous movies without the exception of the hulk obviously the new characters were all very interesting and were grafted into the story just right overall id give it a 45
May 7 2016,positive,wow what a movie wasnt sure what to expect but its a 2 and a half hour film and it keeps you on your edge the whole way chris evans capt america and robert downey ironman are at their best its a movie about friendships and conflicts that happen its a great movie ride that leaves you wanting more
May 7 2016,positive,the movie was as amazing as expected action friendship hard decisions to make by both groups of superheroes now facing the sokovia accord dilemma bucky barnes  winter soldier plays a key role again but his bond with cap and his fighting skills are a bonus for the plot the rest of the avengers play their part special mention for antman whose hilarious jokes are remarkable the newbies spiderman and black panther had a significant role and will surely have successful movies of their own among the best marvel movies for sure likely second only to the winter soldier
May 7 2016,positive,another fun marvel flick great action i thought all the black widow stunt work was very impressive this is the movie batman v superman wanted to be the heroes actually have a decent reason to fight they dont put their differences aside in a matter of seconds and new characters are introduced in a way thats very entertaining i had fun
May 7 2016,positive,one of the best mcu movies out even one of the best movies out
May 7 2016,positive,the dynamic of bucky and cap s real and familiar for combat vets its really what makes this movie work in the end
May 7 2016,positive,choosing a side the whole premise of this plot as long it is done based on doing the right thing i will not spoil any more details but go see it now this was beyond what i expected      do stay until the end you know the drill two very awesome teasers in the end
May 7 2016,positive,the movie hit many key points that we have all been waiting for ever since the announcement of the movieand goes well for diehard comic book fans i found the villain to be interesting but hes definitely not going to be remembered the movie doesnt take many risks which is a downer considering how explosive the movie was hyped up to be otherwise the new performance of spiderman by tom holland is the best i have seen on screen he fits to perfect comic book peter and it perfectly snatches that from the pages action scenes were greatbut you could tell they werent going all out on each other but that was expected great movie overall and very interesting plot
May 7 2016,positive,pretty much the best example of this kind of movie that is to be found  performances effects choreography and editing of the fights is top notch      what really makes it stand out though is the thoughtfulness of the story and the issues raised  13 years ago a few people not nearly enough pointed out that once we broke iraq we would own it  thats now so obvious that sometimes even donald trump acknowledges it all of the avengers are aware of the costs of the collateral damage done by their efforts to save the world  tony stark has come to understand that he needs someone to  place a check on what they do  steve rogers trusts himself maybe too much and does not trust the government  thats wise  neither side is completely right or completely wrong  a superhero movie that also makes you think is great
May 7 2016,positive,i just saw captain america  civil war in 3d today and it was simply awesome    visually the film was terrific especially in 3d  also i enjoyed all of the action scenes especially the big fight scenes involving the superheroes    i loved the storyline of the movie and breaks my heart when captain america and iron man are now fighting against each other    its a truly wonderful film to kick off the summer movie season  cant wait for the next marvel movie    i definitely recommend everyone to see it    i give it a grade of an a    enjoy
May 7 2016,positive,well could this movie rival superman vs batman as iron man vs captain america yes it can what a movie i think this was the most well written super hero movie yet the lines were funny smart well acted and much more the cgi was outstanding along with great sound i came in nervous but left very impressed the cameo by stan lee was funny and the cameo from another super hero no spoiling it was ingenious 8 out of 10
May 7 2016,positive,in my opinion captain america civil war is the best comic book movie that i have seen so far hail the russo brothers weve got directors that can actually make very good comic book movies the action in the movie is real like and exciting if russo brothers did the age of ultron it would of been a way better movie chadwick boseman is great as black panther  spiderman was very exciting the airport scene that everybody is talking about is superbi heard ratings that said that the villain was not great i agree in a way but the movie wasnt much about a villain more so about turning friends against each other  now i cant wait for avengers infinity war since the russo brothers is directing it
May 7 2016,positive,using so many diverse superhuman characters together in one film sounds very exciting and in captain america civil war directors joe and anthony russo make it look like playing ball in the backyard   whats incredible about this film are the multilayers of relationship development occurring throughout this film is not so much dependent on individual character development as it is relationship dynamic that is not so much as one or two characters change and become something different but characters change each other impacting each others worlds as well as the world of everyone surrounding them this impact and these changes are extraordinarily entertaining emotionally deep and satisfying filled amply with relatable circumstances and realism captain america isnt some perfected mechanism without flaws he is just a man with extraordinary strength and a devotion to justice and loyalty to friends and these are admirable traits in this film these characteristics which distinguish steve rogers from any other character shine as brightly as the american flag his suit represents     what still boggles my mind about seeing this movie besides the action sequences which are simply superb and majestic in creativity humor and style are the inner demons at work for both tony and steve as the trailers teased as well as the previous avengers films there is and has been a growing tension between these two the hyperawareness of their differences rapidly growing while still fighting as hard as they can pushing as hard as possible to stay amicable and on the same side since both of their intentions align to keep the world at large as safe as possible their strife becomes all the more real between them the difference in their strategy to maintain world security as well as loyalty to the avengers team is what begs them apart what differs is their interpretation and perspective on what would create the best for the world tony thinks relinquishing power to the government is the best choice because of the immense strength and seemingly uncontrollable power of the avengers as a conglomerate steve incorrigibly believes that retaining the silence of vigilantism is more powerful and reliable with the continual threats of other superpowered aliens loki and ultron up to this point to name a couple presented within the context of this marvel world these perspectives both make sense it simply is a matter of opinion and thats where the poignancy become most painful tony and steve are as sure of themselves as they can be and equally opposed to each others view that creates the space for war    beautifully crafted writing makes every character believable enjoyable relatable lively and fitting for this film steve and bucky continue in their relationship in this film and the underlying theme of their friendship truly creates an authentically solid foundation for the tone and end goal for civil wars finale what was created in the first captain america film is capitalized in this movie lifting these two iconic characters into the status of something earthly and yet still superhuman simultaneously so much is and has been at work between buck and steve between then and now and by the time this movie ends we leave with an even deeper understanding of what their friendship symbolizes as well as a truly introspective feel for steves undeniable loyalty in real life friendship means something significant to the human race connection means something for steve this dramatic theme of responsibility intermixed with loyalty and belief in the power of transformation and commitment has become something of an ultimatum there is nothing steve wont do for his friends and theres nothing he wont do to have the real bucky by his side their relationship dynamic is written impeccably for the screen and the end result is emotional gratifying poignant and irreversible     the end of this film leaves us wondering what will happen next as we know there is a much grander war on the horizon something far more fierce and threatening is heading straight for the screen and from the look of things the avengers need to find their way im extremely excited to see how they will
May 7 2016,positive,just an amazing thrilling fun movie and it brought out the kid in me to finally see spiderman in the mcu and to be done so perfectly this is now my favorite marvel film just slightly edging out avengers and winter soldier
May 7 2016,positive,i feel like this movie was overall very entertaining but misses the mark in a few key ares namely the movie doesnt really seem to trust the audiences critical thinking abilities because it delivers its themes and plot points with about all the subtlety of thors hammer what it does well is that it offers plenty of action and my favorite parts were without a doubt the parts with spiderman and black panther    if you didnt like batman v superman then i am pretty sure you will like this movie i was a little disappointed by it as a followup to the winter soldier though because while i felt that movie was stepping in a more mature and nuanced direction for marvel this movie seems to fall back more on escapism and cartoonish storytelling then again maybe i am just getting really tired of brainwashing and amnesia as central plot points in movies and it looks like thats a dead horse marvel doesnt intend to stop beating any time soon    its overall definitely worth a watch if you like superhero movies but id say take the 91 on rotten tomatoes with a grain of salt how much you like the movie will depend on what kind of movie youre expecting i liked it a lot better than age of ultron although i felt this was more of an avengers movie with extra emphasis on captain america rather than being an actual captain america 3
May 7 2016,positive,this is everything a superhero movie should be great characters great story great special effects and a lot of action this is a must see movie so if you havent seen it yet you really should see it
May 7 2016,positive,it was an amazing film that left me breathless the introduction to black panther and the story behind tony and the winter solider was stunning it is a film that will be seen again and purchased
May 7 2016,negative,movie studios must be manipulating rotten tomatoes this latest captain america movie was so long and boring maybe mindless action just doesnt do it for me anymore it definitely doesnt deserve the low 90s especially from critics from rotten tomatoes more like high 60s long story short it stinked  ps   the character vision played by paul bettany he reminds me of the  ghost on mike tyson mysterys    in fact the whole movie is on par with an episode of mike tyson mysterys as is its audience
May 7 2016,positive,certainly the same ol in some instances but simultaneously seems to hit home harder in certain parts something ive come to expect specifically from the cap installments kudos to not making the many introductions feel overwhelming spiderman antman previous movie or no black panther the rhodes moment and the fact that the linchpin of the whole movie  the philosophicalexistential argument  i felt was handled well also the balancing act the russos had to pull off between making this both a captain america movie and an avengers movie and one that didnt over or underuse any of the ensemble really also kudos
May 7 2016,positive,everything you expect and more the actors all killed their roles the scenes were epicwell shot and directed the comedy was spot on many of the newer characters finally took hold of the roles black panther and spiderman were amazing aunt may
May 7 2016,positive,it was intense had great action and an amazing story that fit all the personalities within this movie
May 7 2016,positive,most probably marvels most mature film to date captain america civil war sits comfortably among the best superhero movies delivering a thoughtprovoking emotionally complex storyline while delivering a fun movie in the process
May 7 2016,positive,marvel back at it again with the hit movies all the characters in the movie where very interesting there for making it a wonderful movie experience
May 7 2016,positive,so so much fun so worth it maximum super heroes  robert downey junior  what else can you ask for thor  loki loved it
May 7 2016,positive,what a amazing movie i seen this movie on friday may 6th 2016 spiderman introduction was awesome same with black panther this movie was freaking amazing
May 7 2016,positive,genuinely surprised how coherent the plot wasstory was my main worry going in i do have few nitpicks and certain things i personally find weird or stupid because i am a cynical human being but they do not take away the experience i had in the movie theater the captain america trilogy is the only superhero movie trilogy in my humble opinion that improved in each movie yes better than the dark knight trilogy because the third movie was weak first movie was just ehh its decent second was spectacular and third blow both avenger movies out of the water highly recommend it
May 7 2016,positive,im not quite sure why all the rave reviews are coming in for this movie granted there are some very good action sequences albeit with some glaring poor cgi effects but the presence of a weak villain and a questionable finale make for a very good but flawed film if you havent read the comics it would be hard to understand how zemo a person who lost loved ones in a previous avengers battle could nearly take down earths mightiest heroes again this isnt the comic books and we are simply led to believe that zemo uncovered the winter soldiers dossier framed bucky and used the avengers to nearly destroy each other very hard to believe in addition the writers didnt see fit to flesh out zemo in the film whatsoever the other writing flaw that occurs in the film involves the winter soldiers after bucky reveals the presence of several other winter soldiers the audience is led to believe that there will be a big showdown between the avengers and the winter soldiers instead the finale is a big letdown when zemo reveals that he killed all the winter soldiers in their sleep before the avengers arrive weak tea the audience never gets to see the full power of the winter soldiers or a damn good battle     aside from those flaws and the addition of a wimpy weak kneed spiderman who somehow has regressed in age through the years and you have some terrific action sequences and the presence of new infused blood in the group black panther and ant man stand out and you have the basis for a good superhero popcorn movie with some dark overtones it must be said that the story involving the power of superheroes and their repercussions has been beat to death in the superhero genre to its benefit the movie does have some good one liners in the humor department and it works to lighten the tone in certain points of the film its a good movie but certainly not great the first half of the movie drags in parts but the battle scenes more than make up for the excess length  grade b
May 7 2016,positive,best superhero movie ever a emotional and entertaining ride
May 7 2016,positive,i loved it you have to see it thats all im saying ill be giving a much longer and more in depth review later
May 7 2016,positive,fantastic action story and character development the best of the marvel series so far with the exception of guardians of the galaxy it was wonderful to see the heroes as vulnerable humans with a range of emotions and conflicts the villain of the film has his motivation slowly unfold throughout the story and its both heartbreaking and surprising how it comes to a head i highly recommend it his film
May 7 2016,positive,marvel is on a roll another great film
May 7 2016,positive,honestly i thought it was the best captian america movie yet
May 7 2016,positive,dug it  thought some of the action pieces went on a bit too long but spider man was great and black panther was great
May 7 2016,positive,an incredibly fun movie experience that sticks to the tried and true marvel formula of action sequences offset by comedic intervals however it falls drastically short of the high point captain america the winter soldier reached an airport fight sequence and an interesting twist at the end elevate it above mediocrity but this is pretty much your typical marvel fare
May 7 2016,positive,what a good movie  loved it right up there with the actual avengers movies and captain america 2
May 7 2016,positive,every half dozen or so marvel movies we get one that is truly great this is not one of those it is good but just seems like filler to the mcu
May 7 2016,positive,what a twist super great movie i was skeptical about it at first because of that batman vs superman thang but 5 stars for sure
May 7 2016,positive,not only my favorite film in the mcu and of the trilogy but also my absolute best movie of the summer
May 7 2016,positive,surprisingly good movie with good philosophical positions russo brothers seem to have this segment of marvel universe down  paul rudd is great im still gravely disappointed on the crappy cgi spiderman i hope they fix it for his movie because looks plasticy and so artificial looking
May 7 2016,positive,perfect welcome home spiderman
May 7 2016,positive,pro best spiderman ever awesome debut for black panther best super hero battle ive seen probably best avengers movie yet    con didnt really care about the story minus the avengers stuff mcu still having a problem with compelling villians little slow in the first act    overall although i dont feel it beats winter soldier  hard to beat its still a solid movie with a coherent story and great action solid a
May 7 2016,positive,the good robert downey jr continues to be an icon as tony sark iron man his role is very heavy here and he is constantly battling not just with other heroes but also with himself lots of inner turmoil tom holland as spidermanpeter parker is a knockout absolutely fantastic finally we get the quippy sidey weve always wanted he fits the role like a glove it really did feel like i was watching spidey from the comics on the big screen mucho excited for his upcoming solo film marissa tomei is super hawt as aunt may talk about having conflicting emotions chris evans is very good as cap but i wasnt as impressed as i was with him in winter soldier paul rudd is tons of fun and very funny as antman every action scene is great with the best ones being the airport battle and the final fight both of which are the best fights weve gotten in marvel films thus far still love scarjo as black widow sebastian stan really impresses as buckythe winter soldier hes also given some pretty heavy material to play with and handles it like a pro chadwick boseman as black panther is pretty cool managing to be pretty threatening but also very regal as well  i liked martin freeman as everett k ross but we spend very little time with him i expect him to play a bigger role in upcoming films i also really like emily vancamp as sharon carter niece to peggy and a possible new love interest for cap though we also spend very little time with her as well  the film tackles some very serious dark adult themes and succeeds where bvs failed     the bad the final ending is very disappointing the lack of death hurts the film overall theres no real resolution to the civil war storyline daniel bruhl is pretty good as zemo but its a thankless role that has the most basic of motivations frank grillo only gets one badass scene at the beginning of the film only to be quickly thrown away for good it would seem the action scenes near the beginning were way too shaky to the point where it became hard to make out what was going on at points     conclusion this film was awesome id say about 96 of it was just about perfect civil war manages to give us tons of great action scenes while still doling out some heavy adult material for us to chew on its fun but  sad to see our favorite heroes fighting with each other there are times where i was like cant we all just get alongplease its also a testament to the film that its actually pretty hard to pick sides both cap and stark have valid points i found myself stuck squarely in the middle though my sympathies fell more with stark for the most part civil war is almost everything you want it to be the final ending was disappointing but that doesnt take away from any of the fun i had before if only marvel wouldnt be so afraid to put actual lifeordeath stakes in their films hopefully they can fix this with the upcoming infinity war films civil war gets so close to perfection that it hurts all the more when it doesnt quite stick the landing that said it is still easily one of the best superhero films weve gotten and that is more than enough reason to celebrate
May 7 2016,positive,everything batman vs superman wanted to be civil war reminds us of the days when you were allowed to have fun at a superhero movie    the conflict within civil war works because there is history behind it in the comics and as well more importantly in the previous films in bvs they relied almost entirely on the comics to remind people why a fight between batman and superman was a big deal oh and having a villain with an actual acknowledgeable agenda makes it so much more satisfying    not to mention the resolution here isnt the claptrap lazy bullshit that was in bvs    one standout is tom holland spiderman who in his brief appliance in the movie i feel is more true to the character than anything we saw previously in the sony films another is chadwick boseman who plays black panther a complex character with ease
May 7 2016,positive,excellent movie  loved every minute of it
May 7 2016,positive,i thought it was really entertaining every single character gets their fair share of screen time the women were fantastic action sequences are perfect the best ive seen so far black panther was so impressive and awesome i cant wait to see his solo movie
May 7 2016,positive,great movie but could of done without spiderman
May 7 2016,positive,455 even better the second time civil war brings the thrills we expect along with an engaging story impressive emotional thrust and a barrage of characters that are miraculously balanced together
May 7 2016,negative,ok just went and saw civil war truthful it was just ok pretty slow looong and boring in a lot of places just ok lots of things left hanging ok thoughts on issues raised but this is not that type of movie slow
May 7 2016,positive,tom hollands spider man fully stole the show and his chemistry with rdj was the storys redemptive quality but overall the story was messy and didnt flow some of the movie was hard to watch and it seems like the whole movie was disney and lucasfilms excuse to make money predictive and typical hollywood bring back joss whedon
May 7 2016,positive,enjoyed it with all my boys  lots of action  loved seeing all the super heroes
May 7 2016,positive,funny and cool spiderman and black panther steal the show
May 7 2016,positive,best superhero movie trilogy ever
May 7 2016,positive,this starter spark to the third phase of marvelss cinematic universe is a meticulously crafted sequel to the subpar age of ultron and it leaves a sweet aftertaste civil war has delivered satisfaction on similar levels with its over the top sharp snappy action subtle comedy and brave attempt to tackle grimdark themes thank you marvel studios for giving us an extremely awesome time from start to the extremely shocking finish oh and kudos to marvel for getting me to dig the new spiderman in just 6 minutes in  not to mention black panther and antman stole the limelight in very scene they appeared in radically awesome
May 7 2016,positive,the goods great action lots of fighting surprise twist and turns well acted not as good as winter soldier but better then age of ultron   if geek will enjoy it a little two long   the bad   millar civil war better but from comic book and   and one pet peeve   marvel hey marvel if going make us wait for end credits give us something instead of some dumb ass spidy signal  for civil war   agreed with team cap on this ill though iron man less of prick in this one more human
May 7 2016,positive,the first 13 is a little draggy but the fun then build nicely once the whole ensemble is in action
May 7 2016,positive,emotionally gripping as it is thematically compelling captain america civil war is not just one of the best marvel movies ever  its one of the best superhero movies ever made with careerdefining performances and a braveru action scene that ranks among the best in film history
May 7 2016,positive,i a getting a bit bored of all these superheroes teaming up and crossing over into each others films marvel should just save that for the avengers franchise in saying that antman was a breath of fresh air spiderman has still never been cast right and is an annoying twink cunt
May 7 2016,positive,we watched it last night i liked it but a 91 rating hardly
May 7 2016,negative,redeeming factor  black panterloved him  mild spoilers everything was going good till i found out captain america is not really at all who hes been made out to be in all of the other movies  why everyone has to subdue themselves to his will is beyond me  turns out hes a selfrighteous deceptive liar who only thinks about himself and his friend bucky no matter what the price how many people get killed andor paralyzed or have been murdered by bucky  i wont give out any spoilers but i will say that the scene involving the starks was very emotional for me and the information that follows in an exchange between capt america and iron man blew me away and really ruined the movie for me  i was so disappointed and literally sick to my stomach with the plot twist  i will never see capt the same way again  hes one of the bad guys now in my eyes  in addition there was a lot of swearing beyond what my 7yrold child should have to put up with at a movie like thisnot childfriendly like the others have been  really disappointed overall and sad because i really liked all of the marvel movies up until this point
May 7 2016,positive,they did it this movie succeeds in every way that batman vs superman failed
May 7 2016,positive,great flick best use of spiderman yet in a film  black panther was used correctly as strong as capt america  as smart as stark but with the wisdom of a man worthy to be king  this movie is not for small kids
May 7 2016,positive,one of the best superhero films ive ever seen made possible by the brothers russo its amazing cast of characters and a culmination of all the previous mcu movies up to this point the established characters allow for the main characters conflict and it handles that perfectly its dark done right unlike a certain other recent superhero flick that i shall not name black panther and spiderman were great the large cast of characters also works really well thanks to balancing chemistry and solid direction from the russos in many ways its the avengers sequel you were hoping for but didnt get with age of ultron this film has solidified my confidence with the russo brothers i feel very comfortable that they can make the upcoming avengers films work some nitpicking the score isnt especially memorable and the shaky cam could make it difficult to understand the action on scene but most of the time it was solid
May 7 2016,positive,one of the best superheroes movies ever made
May 7 2016,positive,best comic movie ever made
May 7 2016,positive,love love love it   amazing movie   im team captain america and iron man i love both of them   damn captain america is hot 
May 7 2016,positive,best part were the creative action scenes but were overshadowed by the onedimensional characters and stakes plus the fact that these films are too long and theres so many of them now that they seem to be all bland and the same
May 7 2016,positive,pretty damn awesome the whole 25 hours
May 7 2016,positive,great movie i wished that vision had more of a stronger fighting role though
May 7 2016,positive,amazing movie great action great story and a lot of fun highly recommend this movie best marvel movie and maybe best comic book movie ever made 
May 7 2016,positive,its quite premature for steve to act in a movie with his alias as the movie title lots of compassion for tony  spidey is definitely a highlight ill definitely go watch for a second time
May 7 2016,positive,civil war is thus far marvels crowning achievement an astounding blend of consequential moral weight character evolution and action brilliance enhanced rather than burdened by the foundation set from previous films
May 7 2016,positive,beyond amazing the way super hero movies should be made perfection at its finest  marvel does it again
May 7 2016,positive,directors anthony and joe russo rub the genie lamp and bestow its audience with three wishes that transcend the expectations of even captain america winter soldier civil war is a film that must be viewed with optimism and a sense of perspective to truly understand the tremendous amount of weight these characters bare along with what precipitated a warits imperative to note that this is the largest and final piece to the puzzle of everything build upon from the layers of avengers to age of ultronthe chronology of captain america civil war is outstandingly plausible and this can be attributed to previous films giving explicit omens of something to comethe prelude of the film displays the assertion  of are superheroes saving us or are they most likely endangering our safetythis question is thrust upon the audience unexpectedly when scarlet witch makes an unintentional impetuous mistake and causes lives to perishfurthermorethroughout the film we see the emergence of peter parkerspiderman quintessentially portrayed by tom holland who wholeheartedly embodies peters dociledubiousinsecure and whiz kid type personality while also organically representing leeditkos spiderman ripped right from the pages of comics utilizing his jocular attitude for levitythe wakandan sovereign tchalla whose country suffered deeply after the destruction of his city in age of ultronwe see that he complys with the government registration of superheroes being under supervision and act only under government command and rulethis knocked upon philosophical question of should superheroes be working under zero accountability and unlimited power evokes this feeling of realism and estrangles the ensemble of distinguished sides of opinionthis next quarter of the film is a triumph at conveying a deep rooted ideological odyssey of the predominant characters of this film iron man and captain americathe way its explored on why their is quarrelsome tension and polarity between the two is remarkablein essence captain america has and always been symbolic of mans soulhis notion of moral integrity and compassion for allies or friends such as bucky the winter soldier is something that he wont or cant allow being taken from him again no matter how dire the circumstances may bewhich is yet again a guiding reason for caps unrelenting behavior to suspend the law for sake of his own selfish desirewhile iron man in this film is symbolic of mans mind thinking within logicreason and the sensible response in order to actually function as a team safely with the notion of preventing more deaths while captain america believes that deaths are inevitablein conclusion captain america civil war explores a plethora of political themes and philosophical differences but beneath the explicit storytellingsublime cinematics youll find that civil war represents a strong theme of the significance of friendship and how its a contributing whole on keeping our civility
May 7 2016,positive,movie wont disappoint action fans     however i cringed at times because it felt like the superheroes were occasionally acting like little kids having temper tantrums to justify the plot
May 7 2016,positive,captain america civil war is absolutely awesome the story line is fantastic and the action is just super this is a must see
May 7 2016,positive,cements the marvel cinematic universe as one of the most impressive cinematic undertakings and one of the most brilliantly handled businesses of our time a year ago i wouldve said i had superhero fatigue after this count me in for the next decade
May 7 2016,positive,marvel have given a best superhero movie this movie have not put down its fans the plot nd the cast was very good and had a very good story line  best part i liked was teen spidy fighting
May 7 2016,positive,really good movie one of the best captain america movies the only thing thats starting to get old is them fighting each other but all in all great movie
May 7 2016,positive,really great movie spiderman amazing antman is gigantic fun black panther movie needs to come sooner than later   everyone has a moment to shine it is the best out of all the movies
May 7 2016,positive,captain america 3 might as well been avengers 25 and thats okay the movie deals with the fall out of the groups actions and the ramifications they had amongst the common people putting the team at odds on how to deal with the fallout and it works its defently the best written of the three captain america films and has the most emotional levity i would say out of all the marvel films this far
May 7 2016,positive,this movie is the best of the mcu the action and storyline were expertly intertwined this managed to both make the story about captain america and seamlessly incorporate many characters
May 7 2016,positive,to keep it simple this is fantastic
May 7 2016,positive,very well written for how much ground that had to be covered the new charactersactors are very good cant wait for the next one especially spider man possibly being done right finally
May 7 2016,positive,awesome action scenes and a great story line
May 7 2016,positive,wouldve been 55 except for the obnoxious kids sitting behind my party in the theater the whole time besides that the movie was exceptional excellent pacing and writing also some of the best filmed action scenes ever put on film the film made me immediately want more which is good cant wait for the third avengers film
May 7 2016,positive,how does marvel keep doing it  captain america civil war is the best marvel film yet  the russo brothers are amazing at directing  i will never understand how marvel can pit 10 heroes in one jampacked action film have a coherent plot a rich story line and add such depth and feeling to each of the characters while dc crashes and burns in the dust yes im looking at you batman versus superman         my fellow fannites you will not be disappointed at all  without giving too much away all i can say isant man         just go watch the movie  thats all i can say  you will love it
May 7 2016,positive,whats wrong in this movie not a damn thing
May 7 2016,positive,to quote albus dumbledore it takes a great deal of courage to stand up to your enemies but even more to stand up to your friends civil war is a perfect example of that a surprisingly taut storyline from marvel a soft spoken and ice cold villain and edge of the seat action makes it a gripping watch and when a bloodied and bruised cap says  i could do this all day it takes us back to the first film when cap was weak and puny  getting beaten up by a bully in a brooklyn alley it shows that inside he is still the same guystanding up to bullies no matter what  all in all civil war sets a bench mark for superhero movies which will be hard to surpass
May 7 2016,positive,brilliant from its inception marvels civil war directed by russo brothers is amazingly fresh disposing cartoonish or too close to source material its multilayered action packed and wonderfully acted    setting backdrop for black panther and spiderman reboot again its bombastic in every sense   its one the best mcu movie till date
May 7 2016,positive,my mind is already gearing up to see this again in the theatres  thats how i determine how good a film truly is  admittedly it does start off a bit slow but man does it take off into orbit like no other superhero movie to date  getting inside the heads and emotions of these characters is the hallmark of this movie  the fight sequences were incredible    why only 45 stars  knowing that wanda and vision could each have singlehandedly wiped out each opposing side it would have benefitted the struggle to understand why they didnt  at the same time there were too many common themes that those themes no longer became unique to the respective characters  friend protecting friend revenge for fatherparents demise
May 7 2016,positive,this was one the best of the marvels  movie of the year it was well written and acted keep them coming
May 7 2016,positive,absolutely loved every moment cannot wait for black panther to step onto the scene in his own movie very pivotal moment for ironman and captain america get ready for entertainment and laughs
May 7 2016,positive,the best marvel movie to date the themes of guilt  grief and how people react differently gave us much more depth to the characters than ever before not only entertaining but well written  well directed can we get another captain america movie preferably in like 2 weeks when ill have watched civil war probably 5x by then
May 7 2016,positive,awesome so much fun to watch
May 7 2016,positive,this film earns every plaudit it has through multilayered storytelling a conflict that allows watchers to choose a side like a chooseyourownadventure film interactions between a wide cast of marvel characters that allow for incredible rewatchability and a fundamental respect for the characters as human and synthetic beings whose perspectives serve the unfolding drama rather than resorting to the cliche reduction of letting their powers define their perspective allegiance and story arc
May 7 2016,negative,spiderman black panther were excellent everything else ehhhhh fights were not satisfying because they were constantly interrupted by someone jumping in
May 7 2016,positive,an improvement on the stodgy age of ultron and a better superhero rivalry film than batman v superman civil war sees the avengers line up behind captain america or iron man as the government seek to control our motley crew and steve and tony are on opposite sides  unlike batman v superman marvel know how to have some fun with paul rudds ant man and tom holland as spider man bringing the quips however like bvs you dont quite buy these heroes actually wanting to kill each other   the winter soldier was a much tighter plotted and more complete film civil war has too many characters that might please the fan boys but lost me a bit   im a big iron man fan but robert downey jr is a lot more serious and less fun here  but as usual is the most charismatic actor meanwhile steve rogers obsession with his pal bucky despite him having committed many many crimes is rather  interesting  some have raved over this film but for me while i did enjoy it it is not even the best captain america film
May 7 2016,positive,only four because of spider man those parts were good
May 7 2016,positive,completely awesome may be the best of them all
May 7 2016,positive,best superhero movie of the year
May 7 2016,positive,super fun ride  so many great characters
May 7 2016,negative,one of the slowest longest without reason and worst avenger series ive ever seen i really wanted to see how spiderman plays into this and the new characters they were all lame the whole story and how they team up against each other was weak and i think it had 70 talk 30 action and being a late viewing i fell asleep at times not worth watching at all wait for download or bluray
May 7 2016,positive,holy cow this is such an awesome movie
May 7 2016,positive,this movie was outstanding i give it a ten out of ten
May 7 2016,positive,already saw it twice so good
May 7 2016,positive,ive got to give it some time to be sure but this might be my favorite marvel movie it does a really good job balancing some really great action scenes with humor and drama and it does an even better job than i expected of introducing the new characters
May 7 2016,positive,love iron man i didnt like that he didnt win the battle 
May 7 2016,positive,an overly complex dense occasionally excellent but generally just decent movie that has a truly dizzying number of moving parts    this is the least stand alone mcu movie yet relying hugely on people having seen all of the others and possibly even some knowledge of the awful agents of shield series    chris evans is likable as ever in the lead role but this movie he doesnt quite manage the sort of gravitas that he has shown previously especially in the superior winter soldier  robert downey jr does his usual twitchy fast talking bit that i got wise to years ago  the supporting cast do their best with bozeman black panther and holland spiderman both scoring big with their debuts in the series  scarlett johansen black widow doesnt really do much but the improving anthony mackie falcon actually comes across as a serious character this time    i cant stand the on screen vision character he comes across as old school star trek and it doesnt work  but elizabeth olsens scarlett witch does well in this one  paul rudds ant man just kinda shows up for no reason but he brings superb comic timing and likability as ever    the ending is very much setting up other movies  again  at the expense of this movie  but it is a good movie
May 7 2016,positive,ive been waiting 40 years for these kind of movies it is really good but 2 12 hours is a little long for me it really would have been really great if zemo had the purple sock on his head  my son came up with that when he couldnt remember his name purple sock head
May 7 2016,positive,loved it and i regard it as good as winter soldier which is my personal favourite mcu movie black panther and spiderman were the highlights as i thought their action and motivespersonalities were spot on we now have a spiderman that follows the comic character perfectly the action for me is 1010 and in my eyes it has the best action ever when compared to other comic book films you may go in on one side and come out changing to team cap or iron man you will suprise yourself and the russos do an amazing job of shaping the audiences opinions     however this is not a perfect movie the amazing acting and action make up for some of the plot holes and problems in the movie the character of zemo is completely flawed and his actions are simply farfetched as he predicts the outcome for the whole fight and last time i checked he did not have the support of professor x also his motives were cliched and boring as we see the same backstory as usual as his family were killed which magically turn him into a psycho i also think they killed of crossbones too early and would have liked for him to have teamed up with zemo to fight cap    this was by no means a war as none of the heros were killed and in the airport scene which was sick it did not feel like they were trying to kill each other i know this can be justified as they were friends but in that case it was a conflict not a war     the ending for me was a little off too as iron man seeminly just forgave cap at the end after he almost killed him after finding that bucky killed his parents which was an awesome twist btw the cgi was mostly great like when ant man became giant man but at some points it looked like they could have improved the visuals slightly    overall i recommend this movie immensely as it shows off the great acting and action in the mcu and although there are plot holes and flaws it was a very enjoyable and exciting film it really sets the scene for phase 3 and creates a platform marvel can build on as black panther and spiderman have quickly become my favourite characters in the mcu as they quite rightly should be 910 maybe an 8510 but i will have to see it multiple times to have a proper number in my head
May 7 2016,positive,finally got to see the movie and i cant say its replayable content but i love it the most replayable content from marvel was iron man avengers ultron because their action and all and the best was cw ws gotg civil war is a better movie anyway even if its not replayable
May 7 2016,positive,dont pay attention to the bad comments if youre a fan will love it
May 7 2016,positive,this is an absolute masterpiece of a movie it perfectly sets up the future of the mcu while still being an amazing standalone movie
May 7 2016,positive,loved it definitely gave us a great story with humor action and a twist at the end an unpredictable twist at the end it was great seen it twice cant wait for it to come out on bluray
May 7 2016,positive,wow    awesome movie
May 7 2016,positive,the best marvel movie yet not gonna compare it to batman v superman  they are to very different movies that have different good parts give it a 999100
May 7 2016,positive,1010 would see again
May 7 2016,positive,long but well paced everything about this movie was masterful disney has done a really great job with marvel this movie is perfect for the family pleases the comedy seeker has action and gives the fan boys what they want it has everything and more well done
May 7 2016,positive,definitely one of the better mcu movies to date if not the best sure i had my problems with it but overall a really enjoyable movie
May 7 2016,negative,boring fighting for no reason  needs any sort of real bad guy  useless destruction
May 7 2016,positive,great movie the only issue i have was the ending it fit well but i dislike cap even more now spiderman was what ive been waiting for black panther was perfect antman was hilarious and the whole crew did a great job i wish i could give it 5 stars but spoiler alert cap is still alive haha
May 7 2016,positive,good but awkward like watching your parents argue awkward teamcap
May 7 2016,negative,saw it in 3d last night and i am disappointed in the movie and shocked at the positive reviews this was easily the worst avengerscap movie yet dark themes had been set up for both iron mans and caps characters in ultron and winter soldier but instead of paying off we get a brief conflict based on a mistake that is resolved with no real consequences other than that most of the avengers continue to operate without official government sanction as they did before essentially civil war is an extended chase scene in search of a narrative or character development unless you count the new romantic development which i think is lame the premise for the movie is that the world is afraid of the heroes who saved them from aliens hydra a robot army and a biological weapons attack i can understand some fear of their powers but theyve saved the world multiple times to blame them for collateral damage when the alternative was global annihilation seems bizarre the reaction to this fear is the un negotiates a treaty that will make them employees of the united nations which must have been a public process but seems to catch them all by surprise conveniently hulk and thor are not in the movie because it would be impossible to enforce a treaty like this on a demigod and an indestructible monster when thunderbolt says to cap that hes basically lost the equivalent of two 30 megaton nukes by losing track of them the proper response would have been theyre people not property they can go where they like and how do you propose i tell the demigod and the monster what to do the team members who have been through so much together realistically would have hashed it out among themselves and even if they came to different conclusions about how to respond they would not physically go at with each other over those choices an old villain shows up for 90 seconds and dies without consequences a new mysterious villain shows up and successfully plays the avengers and the entire world for suckers even though he is just some guy not a genius by framing bucky getting himself close enough to bucky to control him after bucky is captured finding hydra secrets like hes a superspy acting on those secrets to lure the avengers to their doom his plan even involves them tearing themselves apart from the inside which is oh the third time weve seen that the undercard fight between team members at the airport is filled with quips which really struck me as the wrong tone  if these people fought each other theyd be extremely torn up about it then the title match between cap and iron man happens because iron man finds out the winter soldier killed his mommy when bucky was brainwashed even though starks actions have killed lots of mommies both before and while he was under mind control and in fact the whole plot of civil war is driven by revenge against him for just that thing and we already saw this in ultron there are some good action beats and tchalla was wll done but the addition of spiderman and antman to the crew seems more gimmicky than anything people liked spidermans youthful enthusiasm and naivete but i think they went about three oh man its so great to fight you moments too far there was also a disturbingly higher amount of shakycam in this one and the 3d really added nothing  in fact i dont know why youd need to see this in a theater at all overall it was a surprisingly thinly scripted film with a lot of meaningless action and no real payoffs i almost expected wonder woman to make an appearance and reconcile the bros wait for it to come out on video
May 7 2016,negative,same old formulaweak plotweak villaincheesy 1 linerstakes no riskshuge disappointment
May 7 2016,positive,perfection love it love it1010
May 7 2016,negative,great action sequences not so much in the story department
May 7 2016,positive,good plot every hero played to their best potential action sequences were top notch however the move dragged for too long
May 7 2016,positive,a perfect way to start summer it is action packed from the beginning integration of multiple marvel characters is great overall a great entertainer
May 7 2016,positive,superb fantastic mind blowing dont watch in 3d no such great 3d work felt awful for spiderman he was badly mocked p   all the characters are given equal importance with such starstudded avengerlike movie the wb should learn how to entertain watch it and have fun
May 7 2016,positive,one of the best marvel movies to date with a fantastic introduction to spiderman and black panther
May 7 2016,positive,best superhero movie in a long time especially for the tremendous action sequences good humor too sound was excellent  filmed in imax got to see it in imax preferably 3d imax saw it at 9 am in the morning and it was more than 12 full dont miss this one
May 7 2016,positive,the movie is jam packed with marvel characters yet all of them get their moment to shine no one gets shorted the new characters spiderman and black panther are awesome where the movie really excels though is its emotional depth you really get to see these characters in ways you havent before as their ideals and their emotions are tested
May 7 2016,positive,properly met expectations would definitely go watch again and buy a blu ray copy when its released
May 7 2016,positive,marvel you did it again one of the best if not the best on the mcu to date
May 7 2016,positive,one of the best movies
May 7 2016,positive,amazing funny action move loved it
May 7 2016,positive,people who complain and say its for kids also spider man isnt cgi dont judge a movie until you see it otherwise stop talking it was amazing the story was great and there wasent a time where i wasent on my toes
May 7 2016,positive,exactly what i wanted every actor was incredible the motivations were well explained the action left me in awe and the writing was as good as ever marvel fans need to see this movie
May 7 2016,positive,phase 3 of the marvel cinematic universe is off to a great start
May 7 2016,positive,damn good movie spidey was played perfectly  black panther was sooo bad ass bravo mcu
May 7 2016,positive,this is the thirteenth film in the marvel cinematic universe the number 13 is typically an unlucky number for some yet marvel is in top form with its third captain america film with so many characters it may seem like the next avengers film but captain americasteve rogers evans and the relationship he has with best friend bucky barnes stan is front and center buckys known as the winter solider and has been on the run following the events of the previous film the winter soldier he is believed to be the man responsible for an explosion at the united nations headquarters in vienna killing the nigerian leader steve knows that bucky wasnt behind the explosion and seeks to find him before the authorities catch him the man behind the explosion is captain helmut zemo brühl whos after secret hydra reports from a december 1991 mission involving bucky    this isnt the only problem plaguing steve the avengers are starting to unhinge after witnessing and realizing their actions and attempts at saving the world come with a cost many innocent lives have been taken and an incident in lagos nigeria left a shattering death toll this all leads to the creation of the sokovian accords if this passes it would mean that the avengers are no longer a private organization the government would step in and control them this concept drives a sharp divide between captain america iron mantony stark downey and the rest of the avengers    for those following along closely at home we have now entered phase 3 of marvels cinematic universe marvel continues to make smart choices with the direction of their franchises the winter soldier has been lauded as one of the best in the franchise so it was a wise move for producer kevin feige to keep that creative team in place with directors joe and anthony russo and writers stephen mcfeely and christopher marcus as i think back on the entire marvel canon the captain america entries have been the strongest and most consistent as they continue to evolve and raise the stakes for our central characters you cant just keep making the same good guys vs villain film over and over or else they start to all feel the same to a certain extent we have that here with daniel brühl in the villain role the real conflict and heart of the movie falls with steves relationship with bucky and the core group of avengers like many longlasting friendships there are times when you realize you vehemently disagree on a position the film tackles that very concept and its a sharp move to ask the audience to take on that journey of how we act when were wrong but think were right theres an impactful image of each side lining up as if they are in a shootout at the ok corral    a majority of the fan favorite characters are back with the exception of thor and the hulk steve continues to play the role of loyal friend to bucky as thats the one friendship he cant let go of from his past its easier for him to turn against tony this is robert downey jrs sixth film playing tony and were starting to see a very different side to the character hes worn down exhausted and no longer the hotshot playboy that were used to from previous films hes really starting to feel the ramifications of what iron man has done to his personal life with pepper potts and the lives that have been taken due to the avengers    civil war also acts as the introduction to new heroes who will be getting future movies in phase 3 chadwick boseman 42 get on up is donning the claws as tchallablack panther tchallas father is the nigerian leader who is killed in the un attacks its a relief to feel like he is given a proper arch in the film with a true conflict at hand against bucky the other noteworthy appearance is that of peter parkerspiderman there had been some studio disputes involving the rights to the character who was previously played by tobey maguire and andrew garfield while it seems redundant to have yet another spiderman kevin feige is taking a new spin on the character by reminding the audience he is actually a high school kid this time hes played with a spritely sense of humor by newcomer tom holland with marisa tomei popping up as lovable aunt may for those who were hesitant or feared he was a onescene cameo he is given more to do than whats been shown in the trailers    this film clocks in at being the marvel film with the longest runtime at 146 minutes in case you hadnt noticed yet the film has a lot of ground to cover with the multiple storylines and characters it all coalesces together well without feeling gimmicky or a ploy to add unnecessary characters which i was originally afraid of with all of the hype surrounding the film this can easily happen when screenwriters try to bite off more than they can chew but i never felt lost or confused by their choices the pace is kept up and never drags as the action sequences are swift yet controlled in how they are edited together i never felt like any of them suffered from being too long which plagued avengers age of ultron and many other superhero films like dc comics batman v superman dawn of justice    im drawn to the superhero movies that feel like they have plausible stakes at hand i am far more invested when the emotion and conflict is grounded in reality yes you can have fun with a man who can shrink down in size use a deadly shield or fly around in an iron suit but finding the proper balance is key directors joe and anthony russo have masterfully crafted their film and found that balance despite the serious tones and heavy weight put on steve rogers and tony stark there is still so much humor in the film thanks to the witty script and comedic entries of paul rudd as antman and tom holland as spiderman its a globetrotting spectacle which fully utilizes every avenger side hero and villain along the way just when you thought you might need a break from the superhero genre it pulls you back in again i need to find time in my calendar to see it a second time    is it worth your trip to the movies its the best marvel film in years    rating 4 out of 5 ticket stubs
May 7 2016,positive,since this is a marvel movie you know that its going to be wellmade my problem with marvel though is that instead of really wowing us its just perfectly fine overall i felt the movie was a retread of cap 2 in the first half and a retread of avengers 2 in the second obviously the plot points have changed but the basics are there they jump a lot from place to place in a really annoying in your face way the cgi was a bit too obvious this time around a lot of joking around at very serious moments and they didnt actually explore the themes of what superheroes should be allowed to do as much as i thought they were going to  there were also a lot of similarities with plot of batman v superman really the only changes were that each side has a team of people helping themyes captain america did a lot of things better than bvs but it wasnt as epic in scale  i liked tom holland as spidey more than peter parker himself but well see how that character turns out in his future films his appearance in the film was where i had the majority of my laughs  all in all its a movie you gotta see but i honestly expected it to be a lot better
May 7 2016,positive,only good part was with spider man at the airport hangar  the rest of the movie is a bit of a flop  i thought this movie wouldnt have been better than superman vs batman but totally didnt even come close to it
May 7 2016,positive,it does well on handling this huge marvel event even though the sides and motivations were blurry russo brothers did their best with this crowd its hard to tell a story with multiple major characters and put amazing action in it the movie could be better if only it had four hours of screentime is it perfect no but this is the best that can be done with twelve avengers and its one hell of an action summer blockbuster   final review certified fresh
May 7 2016,positive,great movie russo brothers seamlessly weaved avengers movie around story about cap n bucky nothing seemed forced loads of action with just the right amount of humor moviegoers wont be disappointed
May 7 2016,negative,expected a lot more considering how insanely good the winter solider was
May 7 2016,positive,one of the best marvel movies easy
May 7 2016,positive,the winter soldier is still the best marvel movie   civil war started of with a bang but sadly like the hobbit series some of the cgi ruined it for me il make a couple of points   1 tonys head looked like it was floating on the iron man suit   2 black panthers fight scenes reminded me of the terrible cgi in blade 2   3 the airport battle although very cool just felt forced in my opinion and have of the heros didnt really have a good reason to be there     additionally the whole plot is basically built around large scale destruction and what do the heros do they funk up an entire airport
May 7 2016,negative,i did not like this movie it was avengers 3 not captain america civil war
May 7 2016,positive,action was good story was over dramatized is all vengeance bad another attempt to show a one world authority knows best to the masses  chris doesnt want to be captain america anymore but they give a soft ending short of the funny added by the new characters not a must see in the series
May 7 2016,positive,this movie really did an amazing job at balancing storytelling and action sequences every character had something to do no matter what    the best part was the dynamic that captain america iron man and the winter soldier had with one another the scenes were versatile and stunning to view
May 7 2016,positive,do you like amazing set pieces does large ensemble casts intrigue you how about a film that uses the large cast well and even gives everyone a moment to shine as a character do you appreciate good writing good directing some of the best hand to hand combat america can offer how about a scene that was shown in the trailer but still be done so well to the point that as a fan of both good film making and characters that you are left overjoyed and didnt know what to do with your hands if all of that applies to you then youll effing love this film arguably the best superhero movie ever done
May 7 2016,positive,amazing this is now my favourite marvel movie i only have two small gripes which mostly have to do with comedy in the wrong places other than that i this movie raises the bar and ends the superhero slump we were in im so glad that the russo brothers are talking over directing the avengers movies
May 7 2016,positive,boring at first but awesome when the fighting starts
May 7 2016,positive,this movie is phenomenal it has everything a super hero movie should have dc take note this is what justice league needs to be like in order to succeed  it is well written well acted action packed funny and did i say action packed spiderman black panther and antman giant man were amazing i want more more more
May 7 2016,positive,spectacular and heart breaking  teamironman
May 7 2016,positive,incredible film a must see for any superhero fan
May 7 2016,positive,classic marvel comedy and story telling but they played it to safe and it lack a powerful villain they were building up to see nothing at the end
May 7 2016,positive,the movie never got better after the crossbones scene                i lied it did
May 7 2016,positive,enjoyable pretty much all the way through yet when it ended i couldnt help but feel like nothing that important happened after sharing this feeling with ultron i cant help but crave an entry that actually has serious consequences and changes     theres a lot to love and admire about this movie black panthers introduction is great and by the end he feels like an essential character to the film and the universe in general for how many characters there are theyre handled very well scarlett  witch vision and tony stark himself have a lot of my favorite moments and all feel more real and indepth than ever i especially loved tonys line about how he didnt want to stop being iron man finally making the ending of iron man 3 feel like it actually meant something i also appreciate how long the film is because of howwell fleshedout all the characters are spider man black panther antman etc would feel shoehorned in if their introductory scenes particularly peter parkers werent kept as long as they were i felt the diversion to peters apartment was particularly long and disconnected from the main conflict of the film but i appreciated that the filmmakers committed to each sequence being quality     at the same time however i still have the impression the film suffers from so many characters being shoehorned in did tony stark really need to go out of his way to get spider man as enjoyable as parts of the airport battle were it also felt like the most empty pointless sequence of the film none of the characters felt like they were really out for blood and so each punch just kind of felt like filler material while i understood the characters positions on the accords i didnt buy that they were at the point of disagreement where they would actually battle it out and hurt each other over it especially since rogers actually had valid reason to go where he was headed it wasnt until the final battle between stark rogers and bucky that the real civil war felt like it actually began i would rather have had a film with half the number of characters in it if it meant a tighter more emotionally impactful film additionally the conflict is quickly resolved in the end with steve basically apologizing to tony and steve saving all those that were on his side the team may be technically divided for now but unless that has serious consequences in future films i have a feeling theyll all be back together quite quickly then in the end it feels like nothing really happened in the film
May 7 2016,positive,i went in with high expectations and came out being satisfied on almost every level this movie strikes a balance with elements weve seen tank other superhero filmsit takes events from other movies and forces everyone to think of the consequences its a consequence heavy movie that handles incredibly dark themes to create an exceptional thrill ride it builds up a lot of the characters weve been following since day one while introducing new characters to chew on for years to come and every bit of it seemed necessary the new characters were also given their place to shine through and they did chadwick bosemans black panther was phenomenal and tom holland is by far the best spiderman that weve seen on screen to date civil war has broken the marvel formulaic approach to film and it did it with style
May 7 2016,neutral,the pacing was horrible and the first hour and half was wasted i expected better with the source material and marvels past spidey saved the movie from being a complete disaster antman was awesome as well the main motivation for a civil war was weak at best and black panther was done a huge disservice he felt tacked on just introduce his character and only had real significance in the post credit scene i came away with much the same feeling i did when leaving batman v superman it was still good enough because of the characters involved and good guys fighting one another is usually interesting but so much more could have been done
May 7 2016,positive,fantastic movie maybe the best super hero show of any studio the story is great and believable action sequences are expertly done and the classic marvel jokes are great this movie sets up everything for phase 3 tom holland plays a perfect ternage spiderman finally a spiderman done justice
May 7 2016,positive,civil war  bvs  my long winded rant about the two most anticipated sad men in tights movies mild spoilers ahead  a lot of the same themes but character motives are clearer and characters dont deviate from who theyre supposed to be you also bounce back and forth between being team cap or team iron in bvs you understand batmans motives but you never understand supes animosity towards batman during their first encounter  also every character in civil war has been given time to cook and grow from previous films in bvs i still have no idea who kal el is and what his mission in life is  there are certain moments in bvs where clark actually breaks the superman character by flat out saying things like i dont care when questioned about certain choices superman i think not  basically the marvel movie verse knows their characters and most importantly we know and understand them in bvs aside from some great action scenes i felt mostly alienated by superman and batman i felt as if i was watching alternate universe versions of these characters a lot of the time when these characters did or said something i kept saying to myself thats not supermanthats not batmanwhy did he do that why did he say that etc i wanted to like this film and i tried  the sad part of this is that im a huge batman fanboy most of my comics are batman and batgirl  if the last batman films were the nolan trilogy id be okay with this the dark knight and batman begins are still in my top 5 superhero movies of all time batman knew who he was in those films the first two mainly and we as an audience were given time to fully understand who bruce wayne was where he was coming from and the code he lived by  that being said aside from poor writing and questionable character motivations in bvs ben affleck was an awesome batman with a lot of potential given ben afflecks skills and craftsmanship as a phenomenal director i cant wait to see how he treats batman in his solo film  civil war had the audience cheering laughing and silent during the dramatic and quiet scenes as i looked on in the dark theater i could see that people were literally edging their seats to get closer to the action and to cap id imagine xd the audience was enthralled with everything that was going on and smiles were illuminated by the movie screen civil war is in my opinion one of the best superhero films we are going to see in a long time it was more avengers than age of ultron  go see civil war in theatres and go buy some batman comics
May 7 2016,positive,enjoyed the action pack
May 7 2016,positive,a movie with impressive action good pacing and intresting characters makes this one of the better marvel movies made in the mcu
May 7 2016,positive,the screen writers deserve as much respect as the directors for this movie have to say this is the best marvel movie so far a bit of shaky cam in the beginning but its over after this movies a purpose for age of ultron which is very much forgotten by now also best villain with a cause for marvel
May 7 2016,positive,probably my favorite marvel pic yet
May 7 2016,positive,its the greatest movie of 2016
May 7 2016,positive,absolutely amazing mixes action drama suspense and comedy all in to one epic film great performances by everyone involved
May 7 2016,positive,civil war continues marvels unrelenting dominance of comic book flicks and does so while demonstrating heart and emotion  friendships are put to the test and sides chosen  the captain america series of films are by the far the best marvel has to offer and this film feels more like avengers 3 with a few glaring omissions
May 7 2016,positive,this movie is the complete package and  exactly what you expect epic
May 7 2016,positive,this film was fantastic marvel did an amazing job at closing out phase 2 of the mcu marvel cinematic universe the black panther installment was very well scripted spiderman was strategically introduced and has a natural relationship with tony stark this movie had a lot to live up to and quite simply marvel delivered bravo
May 7 2016,positive,captain america civil war does not in any way transcend the conventions of the genre on the contrary it succeeds because it doesnt really try the new york times    it was entertaining and the fight scenes were pretty good one also has to wonder if the best fight scene was filmed in the infamous berlin airport to help them repay the overspending
May 7 2016,neutral,spoiler review    first thing first just like they made a mockery out of mandarin they literally ridiculed corssbones giving the character instant death why didnt they just killed him in the last movie what was the point on having a villain that killed captain america  in comics  for few minutes and then killed off what was crossbones even doing what was his motive behind stealing the biological weapon what happened to it after he was killed no explanation    captain america was a vigilante on watch yet he was able to fly all around the world without any restrictions vision was a cook and homemaker for avengers nice    story started from nowhere and ended nowhere it felt like it was stretched baron is a god  irony intended  he knew bucky caps and ironman would come after him and so he waited to show them the video  btw they had random cctv on streets  he could have just sent the video to iron man a mere nobody is able to create dispute between avengers    only thing that saved the movie was spidermans inclusion his chemistry with iron man is great the inclusion of black panther was not as expected but not too bad either    overall the movie is not as good as expected first half is way too boring that it makes you think what the hell is going on
May 7 2016,positive,if you see it wait till the end of the creditsthis one has two post credit sequence
May 7 2016,positive,it lacked the luster of all the past moviea no main bad guy and 1 major battle scene and 1 small scene
May 7 2016,positive,is very impressive the movie fell very real and funny at the same time ant man spider man black widow and black panther my favorite characters
May 7 2016,positive,good second best marvel film deadpool no 1 so far   best captain america film so far
May 7 2016,positive,i dont like how they double team iron man
May 7 2016,positive,well worth the money
May 7 2016,negative,gimmickdriven captain america civil war is sure to please fans but its surface level plot is stale and unsurprising
May 7 2016,positive,the movie was incredible it definitely was a captain america film but each other hero had their spotlight the 2 heroes that i feel really had more spotlight than the others aside from captain america and ironman were falcon scarlet witch and vision there was something brewing between vision and scarlet witch and throughout the movie we continue to see that scarlet witch even though more in control of her powers is still scared of them the fight at the airport was amazing as well as the ending fight between tony cap and bucky all around it was a great experience and the russo brothers did it again 55
May 7 2016,neutral,although not a terrible movie nor as terrible as its predecessors civil war manages to be a rather dull insipid superhero movie when watching  you will constantly find yourself not very engaged in the story or the characters but only the action scenes
May 7 2016,negative,crap dark crap winter soldier killed tonys parents you cannot end it on a happy note you shits
May 7 2016,positive,supercoolmanchu  or as it also couldve been called avengers dissembled  the airport fight is worth the price of admission alone
May 7 2016,positive,epic movie  was a bit serious at first to start but once it got going the action and perfectly placed humor never stopped  it was like another installment of the avengers but with the focus on captain america and iron man      absolutely phenomenal movie  seriously considering watching it again in the theaters which is something ive only done twice before  a must see for any movie or marvel fan
May 7 2016,positive,marvel outdid themselves
May 7 2016,positive,this is how you make a super hero movie  excellent
May 7 2016,positive,im going watch it again this opening weekend
May 7 2016,positive,thanks to the exhilarating action a smart and thought provoking story and great performances captain america civil war proves to be even better than the avengers
May 7 2016,positive,a charactercrammed action tentpole that doesnt disappoint yet nor match the expectations from the marvel universe though the dc comics cameo of spiderman was a fun surprise
May 7 2016,positive,civilwar was the amazing payoff that aou should have been marvel uses their toy box full of heroes very well the airport scene is the greatest scene in any comic book movie
May 7 2016,positive,when its channeling the avengers its a lot of fun great action and humor when its channeling winter soldier it really begins to suffer but ultimately i enjoyed it though these movies are starting to get a little boring and stale i hope they switch it up sometime soon
May 7 2016,positive,so good best cap yet
May 7 2016,positive,i thought this was a solid movie the fight scenes were incredible  black panther is awesome and falcon gets some nice upgrades antman was kind of a waste and distraction i like how some of the secondary characters were more involved i also liked how the super humans were more human definitely a step up from avengers 2 and one to see it on the big screen
May 7 2016,positive,captain america civil war after thoughts spoiler alert maybe totally free of expectations from the start i was visually filled  felt like a kid in a toy store on christmas in nyc strong story  nothing you will expect huge question asked take a side  how can i but as this film progressed you are torn but you will feel for both our main characters how did cap get main title for this huge avengers universe tchalla aka black panther  spiderboy oops spiderman  did not disappoint all heroes played valuable  essential parts must must must see  yes i will wash  repeat ¼¼¼¼¼ of 5 5 of 5
May 7 2016,positive,an absolutely phenomenal movie i was afraid that given previous films that certain characters wouldnt have their chance to shine or would be given brief moments as a cameo means but i was wrong every single superhero had their chance to shine and shine they did from chadwick boseman making his debut as tchallablack panther to the inclusion of paul rudd as antman and then witnessing the glorious moment of having spiderman finally make his appearance in the mcu this is a fantastic and wonderful movie to behold if youre a fan of these films its very rare that a movie trilogy gets better with each installment and captain america is certainly one of those id highly recommend this movie to comic book fans or anyone who wants to see some truly incredibly choreographed action    full disclosure if you see this movie in 3d or imax be prepared for a little bit of a headache some of the action scenes use a lot of shaking camera movements and it can be quite a strain on your eyes aside from that go forth and enjoy
May 7 2016,neutral,while civil war was indeed well done  in terms of the amount of special effects  it was lacking and substance  i am fond of the marvel superhero movies but i will not give a good rating where he does not deserve one i wanted to be invested in this movie however despite it all i felt more disconnected by the rapid pace and your constant amount of jumping from scene to scene i understand that this is a superhero movie and that is warranted of it however it does not make for necessarily the best film and your constant amount of jumping from scene to scene i understand that this is a superhero movie and that is warranted of it however it does not make for necessarily the best film
May 7 2016,positive,yes the epic showdown between our fav marvel heroes is superhero movie nirvana but its also a mess make no mistake this flick is a behemoth but its also 2 great films thatve been uncomfortably forcedfit into one with so much to cover ill go over the most important stuff the captain america storyline unsurprisingly and disappointingly gets shelved several times to make way forwell everyone this is a film with enough main characters to fill several other movies theres noticeable shifts in tone that go from playfully funexuberantly funny one minute and then suddenly shift gears to brooding intensity the next its as if one film was already made and other pieces were continuously added on the best way i can describe this flaw is an over decorated christmas tree thats so heavy with decorations that its about to fall over another flaw has to do with the screenwriters disregard of the source material without giving anything away marvel studios finally flinched this time and decided to play it safe here the good stuff its the newcomers that steal this one the extraordinarily talented chadwick boseman kills it as tchallablack panther if his role here is any indication 2017s standalone black panther film is gonna be first on my personal mostanticipated list hes a densely layered compelling hero with maybe the coolest superhero costume to date tom holland ispretty good as the young peter parkerspiderman although miles from tobey maguire what he does offer here is terrific potential and far better than anything andrew garfield brought to the table apart from the epic battle between our heroes its the last 20 minutes that truly rival the winter soldier for sheer depth and drama the finale is genuinely heartbreaking as tony bucky and steve square off because they have absolutely no other choice dont get me wrong this is a great summer popcorn flick its just not as good the original avengers and depending on your attention span may leave you with a splitting headache
May 7 2016,negative,such pretty fireworks and that was about it
May 7 2016,positive,big flashy and totally outrageous  remember its a comic book story the captain is mesmerizing
May 7 2016,positive,finally an actual superhero versus superhero movie and a great one at that
May 7 2016,positive,civil war challenges guardians of the galaxy for the title of funniest superhero movie ever in fact there are so many laugh out loud moments that we laughed over the next line of dialogue quite a few times terrific performances from the allstar cast and riviting action sequences abound it take a little while to get going but after the first 45orso minutes it really takes off tom holland steals the show in his scenes as peter parker and spiderman really building the excitement for his upcoming solo effort a really good entry into the mcu
May 7 2016,positive,underoos and why do the cap movies have the best fight scenes beware of creeping continuitydependence
May 7 2016,positive,this the best marvel movie since  spider man 2 tobey mcguire spider mam black panther ant mangiant man great movie
May 7 2016,neutral,like most the movies that preceded civil war the movie ultimately succeeds at being a fun joy ride through the cinematic marvel universe with funny quips and well done action scenes but sacrifices cohesive and tight storytelling for loud noise
May 7 2016,negative,a total waste of time  by far the worst of the captain america movies   the plot twists are slow to develop in fact the whole plot could have been worked out in ten minutes  unnecessary continual violence  if you had not seen or did not remember the characters from the earlier movies this movie made no sense at all  a real disappointment
May 7 2016,positive,this movie franchise just continues to top itself in action suspense and comedy  must see if you like these things
May 7 2016,positive,captain america civil war is fantastic it is a perfect balance of action drama and humour the thematic stream of guilt and revenge that flows through it really keeps you interested throughout the movie its most crowning achievement is how the writers managed to make the final confrontation between steve rogers and tony stark so personal and tragic that even against your better judgement you will come to truly believe that either one of them is truly going to willingly kill the other to put an end to the conflict it also wonderfully balanced the airport battle scene between all the characters so that none of them are superfluous each of them get their moments against multiple other characters with great displays of powers old and new the introductions of black panther and spiderman are equally exciting and just make one so impatient for their solo movies and baron zemo who introduced as the ultimate psychotic vendetta driven nihilist was a daring and masterfully executed tourdeforce 4 ½ stars
May 7 2016,positive,civil war is hands down among the best in the mcu and possibly one of the best all time super hero action movie to date i went in team iron man as the conflict came to a head i was torn i didnt want my avengers fighting each other however the fight scene were excellent each blow felt devastating it really displayed the power each character has the addition of spiderman was spot on being a comic book buff i can see the culmination of powers needed for future threats thanos it was a very human story just as large as the avengers movies that kept the action personal marvel has the formula down top marks
May 7 2016,positive,this is how its done dc captain america has the perfect blend of action and story telling while focusing extremely well on every single character in the film all the action feels gritty and grounded in reality and the pacing is amazing well done marvel you have done it again
May 7 2016,positive,this movie was almost perfect  tony was funny again paul rudd was awesome  falcon rocked  loved pink panther  and they really made spiderman workwhich i really didnt think they were gonna pull off  loved black widow  clint earned his place on the team  winter soldier was awesome  it is extremely rare that i go to a movie and not dislike a single thing i didnt even like ultron  this movie was in fact the best super hero movie and quite possibly one of the best movies ever loved it
May 7 2016,positive,watched it twice already and gonna watch it again definitely the best in the avengers series so far  great adaption of the comic and amazing fighting scenes  real characters buildings there as well loved it
May 7 2016,positive,cons  the build up is slow  a hand full of one liners  tries to much to be funny   tries to make jokes when not needed    pros  good fight scenes  good back and forth  the  jokes that landed where good
May 7 2016,positive,great movieï¼will watch againï¼
May 7 2016,positive,so good really really good so incredibly good it makes you want to tell dc comics just stop trying already
May 7 2016,positive,so much exhilarating action im pretty sure i stopped breathing for a minute   the fresh faces of tom hollands spiderman and chadwick bosemans black panther give the movie more heart suspense and excitation of whats to come  surprisingly with such a huge cast everyone gets a good share of screen time  engaging story that gives you the dilemma of who is right   wow just wow  score was really good but seemed a bit off at times  more than full price    overall people you have to watch this in theaters there are so many moving parts  in this movie that it could have easily been a disaster but directors joe and anthony russo gave it such fluidity and heart that ended up with a movie that brings in the laughs the action and raises the question whats better  a government sanctioned team of heroes that does the bidding of whoever is in control to reduce damage or a self managed group of superhumans that deal with any trouble they see fit to reduce casualties
May 7 2016,positive,still teamdeadpool  whether your team cap or team iron man you cant deny that civil war knocks it out of the park the thing i liked best was the amount of tension between both sides cap and iron are committed to their views and rdj and chris evans give it their all   the storyline is significantly different from the comic its based on the thing that bothered me other than spiderman is the pace is akward it wasnt as well directed as winter soldier   excited for black panther though
May 7 2016,positive,i would give it 10 stars if i could
May 7 2016,positive,expected more but better than aou
May 7 2016,positive,it was a great movie but the best thing about it was spiderman he made it amazing
May 7 2016,positive,this third installment of the captain america series is so layered that it makes the screenwriters of batman v superman look lazy  i have never seen three africanamerican superheroes in one movie so this is historical  and where did they find the kid playing peter parker  spiderman perfect casting choice  spiderman and black panther almost steal the movie  great balance between lighthearted moments and dark serious emotional moments  this is a really really good superhero film  almost too mature in nature for most young children though  a lot of dark themes explored
May 7 2016,positive,this is one of those series that only gets better with each movie loved winter soldier loved this
May 7 2016,negative,not drinking the kool aid i dont know if im watching the same movie as the other reviews  case and point opening night packed theater and when it was over everyone just got up and left no excited banter no cheeringeveryone seemed deflated  aside from one amazing fight scene this was a long self indulgent snoozefest spoiler the introduction of spiderman is the highlight get in line now for the full length spiderman reboot  black panther needed much more character developmenthe seemed to just go from az this movie overall just had too many story lines and nothing ever gets resolved nothing significant happens it just ends the hand to hand combat scenes were blurry with shaky camerawork   it appears the studios attitude was if we through enough superheros at the audience they will love it   ask yourself this how long should a marvel movie really need to be to make sense when it has 10 superheros in the storyline exactlypack all that into just 2 hours and its a complete mess  wait for the bluray
May 7 2016,positive,i enjoyed the movie love action i just didnt like captain american hurting my iron man i am a die hard iron man fan lol
May 7 2016,positive,excellent but very slow for a marvel film
May 7 2016,positive,this is the first film where there have been so many characters and none of them feel like theyre fighting for screen time remarkable directing wonderful humor definitely a mustsee
May 7 2016,positive,civil war is the best superhero movie ive seen its a culmination of all of marvels hard work to establish these characters that really pays off the plot provides the perfect setup to make these characters butt heads and the central villian is one i actually found to be quite good thatll probably be a divisive opinion as a lot of critics disagree but i found him to be a breath of fresh air most of these foes have been big and bad and have insane powers this time its just a man and his motives give him a humanity and characterization that the marvel villains have lacked lately not a single person in the film is denied a shining moment and the newcomers are welcomed to the marvel universe spectacularly black panther is the definition of badass a king who seeks to do right by the people of wakanda and by his father spiderman is a nerdy kid from queens who thinks all of the avengers are just awesome and doesnt quite realize the impact of everything thats going on most returning characters have their own dilemmas wanda is coping with her very powerful abilities and peoples perception of her vision is trying to fit in with society and not feel so robotic and tony has many issues in this film that i cant spoil here but let me say they are substantial youll notice im pretty much only talking about people and despite some of the best action sequences ive seen this film excels with its characters there are many of them and the russos knew that they should be the focus the characters the action the dialogue everything comes together to form an excellent tale of consequences and that everything these heros did and will ever do effect many truly this is an achievement cant wait to see it again
May 7 2016,positive,its 25 hrs but it definitely does not feel like it  great movie
May 7 2016,positive,excellent adaptation of the comic enjoy
May 7 2016,positive,the movie was great it had good story with the right amount of humor and action
May 7 2016,positive,worth the wait and so much better than bvs equal to captain america the winter soldier
May 7 2016,positive,thought it was great liked it as much as the cap 2
May 7 2016,positive,definitely in my top 5 in the mcu movies on top of age of ultron and the first avenger but below guardians of the galaxy and avengers assemble
May 7 2016,positive,this is officially my favorite comic book movie so far i just hope they keep getting better
May 7 2016,positive,the critics are talking just to talk if you are not a big super hero fan or fan at all then this film will make you one and if are then this is going to be the greatest most lovable and most watchable of all super hero movies sorrydc
May 7 2016,positive,an excellent movie that might be one of the best super hero movies in existence  a must see
May 7 2016,positive,a very action packed and fun film it was great seeing the highly anticipated airport scene besides having great action it seemed to drag at a few times and felt too long the villain didnt really do much and sometimes felt like they were resolved too easily it was another great captain america film but could have been a little shorter
May 7 2016,positive,was not impressed with the story at all batman v superman did a much better job at setting up the heroes to fight  what was very impressive was the fighting you could tell the avengers have been training hard so many creative fighting moves the airport scene was nothing but fan fare but still awesome especially spiderman
May 7 2016,positive,way beyond epicness 
May 7 2016,negative,god awful movie this is worse than 2011s green lantern i was looking forward to this movie when kimmel released the trailer but it was a big disappointment dont waste your money never have i ever been so disappointed at marvel
May 7 2016,neutral,the full out action scenes was cool to see it actually happen on screen it feel incredibly short and just plain boring the emergence of the new spider man and antman saved it from complete failure
May 7 2016,positive,teamcap all the way
May 7 2016,positive,incredible spiderman was spot on
May 7 2016,positive,one of the most entertaining films i have ever seen
May 7 2016,positive,since the avengers blew my mind i havent been this impressed with a superhero movie it is the best marvel movie and superheroe movie out there without a doubt
May 7 2016,positive,from beginning to end this movie is everything that you want at all times throughout the film the russo brothers have done something we didnt think was possible since the avengers deliver an equally monumental marvel film the movie deals out emotions like dollar bills at a strip club you cant have a moment to rest because the film is tugging you in so many directions all of which share equal levels of justification acting throughout is well above par even when compared to previous installments characters you are eager to see are more impressive than you would expect and the ones you glance over end up stealing the show the cameo characters are so good that it makes this feel like a 100 balanced ensemble of top tier talent robert downey jr delivers as youve come to expect up until the final fight the emotion that he brought to this fight and the brief moment prior is a performance to behold that one scene will solidify rdj as a true poineer of the genre i was turned into a child for a few hours and i enjoyed every second of it video review at youtubecomthetruemac
May 7 2016,positive,last night watched captain america civil war 2016 had a superb time    this marvel film is not just great or wonderful but in least praiseworthy i would say is wow yes the marvel studios managed to pull this off by high packed of action lots of humor drama including more super heroes than avengers films and multiple interesting scenes to watch    i have literally fallen in love with this film whenever we watch a film based on marvel comics we say its hard for marvel able to make a better film than this but to what it seems they able to surprise us with another awesome film one after the another we think after watching the previous marvel film its a challenge for them to make a better film than this but almost every time they execute it    yesterday late night while watching captain america civil war you would notice that the team behind the making of the film did justice with every main  supporting character they showed onscreen the introduction of new super heroes was properly done not in hasty behavior new peter parker aka spiderman character was not only amazingly handled but the actor tom holland did a great job in portraying the character audience at the cinema hall gave a huge cheer and a round of applause when new spiderman makes his first appearance in the film    the actor who played the super hero character of black panther showed the viewers that he is tough cookie which is not be taken lightly general thunderbolt ross character from the film the incredible hulk played by actor william hurt is cleverly handled he is the only character made an appearance in marvel cinematic universe from that film    no matter how much you loved having new spidey in the film who is most closely related from the comics antman i believe did the best job in making audience laugh every time he was shown during the fight sequence of great civil war of super heroes and like always our loveable archer hawkeye fight moves are way too cunning for any super heroes to take him lightly in the first place    helmut zemo character is introduced as main villain is not an average villain you would see onscreen his character development is slowly revealed as the film progress cross bones character is secondary villain to appear in the film who actually fights his 2nd round with captain america in the film as his other hidden alias but his 1st round as cross bones all fight sequences are wonderfully executed through out film    there is further character development shown of agent 13 sharon carter recurring character from previous sequel of captain america in this film although there was no as such need for villains to be included since most of film run time is based on super heroes conflict with each other but like i said before everything and everyone were given utter importance and effectively done so i dont feel anyone would think of complaining we able to see brief details of tony stark parents death a great screen time shared by actor robert downey jr who has played vital role of iron man and his on  off going conflict with captain america through out film till the end is has been handled excellently black widow character played by actress scarlet johnson was no surprise as she played her part in one of the most impressive manner    only two super heroes who are not included in the film which is btw not a spoiler since this was already mentioned well before the film was in the production level yes there are deaths of some characters whether they are of main or supporting you need to watch it and know on your own    i never reveal spoilers in my film reviews one has to watch on his own to know them well this is what my review is about on the film yes i would definitely recommend you all to go to cinema and watch it i loved it and believe so would you the only people who i heard didnt liked the film at all are the die hard fans of dc comics yup after the failure of batman v superman dawn of justice 2016 making an impressive mark in front of critics and half of public alike earning less than what they anticipated at the box office  yes there would jealousy of competition with their arch rivals in the market    i believe this film captain america civil war 2016 is better than the avengers film this is how felt after watching the film i do think many people would also agree with me    rated 50  50 stars
May 7 2016,positive,fantastic crowd pleasing action sequences   check  but thats not a big surprise these days  where this movie really shines is the time it takes in setting up the characters  in a movie so big there is a risk of blowing the load too quickly but the russo brothers have shown great restraint in unfolding the drama slow and steady right up until the last scene  every laugh  every applause is well earned and not just nerdgasms    a very smart movie    thought provoking comic book film  who knew  
May 7 2016,positive,captain america civil war  loy machedos movie review     after batman versus superman which i personally felt was a disaster i was pretty skeptical about captain america civil war especially given the trend most studios were taking  showing you a trailer with all the best parts of the movie being exposed explicitly just to draw a crowd and collect the maximum collection on the opening day     i mean what happened to the days where they would intrigue you with a trailer that left you wondering  what may happen in this movie lets go watch and find out    remember avengers age of ultron where they exposed the hulk versus ironman hulkbuster     so when captain america civil wars trailer was out  i was like  okayso here is the movie with its best parts out what more is left to watch     however i was proved wrong this time  and i was glad that i was wrong     the movie is around 147 minutes  the longest time taken for any avengers release and the entire 147 minutes is worth every penny and second you spend     directors anthony russo  joe russo juggle all the different personalities and characters so effectively and flawless that you are left spell bound  best of all it achieves genuine pathos while still being enormously funny     civil war finds the avengers disassembled the cumulative human cost of their adventures plus a botched mission in this movie resulting in still more loss of life has the world demanding the team submit to united nations oversight     as the person most responsible for creating ultron tony iron man stark the hero most traumatized by their battles has good reason to believe that their powers are too dangerous to remain unchecked and therefore thinks its the right move to submit to a higher power so to speak     however captain steve rogers whose experience working under authorities had always ended up with him having to fight against the undercurrent of hidden selfish agendas of political hierarchies believes the world will be safer if its guardians remain autonomous     and because screenwriters christopher markus and stephen mcfeely and star chris evans have developed the character so beautifully over the past five years emotionally our hearts are with blue eyed blonde haired cute faced captain america even though the elder father figure the elder brother stance taken by tony starks position is clearly the rational one    things get more dire when bucky the winter soldier barnes sebastian stan becomes a suspect in an assassination that puts the enigmatic new hero black panther on his trail and that is where the actual storyline goes in even deeper     just to give you the number of characters which directors anthony russo  joe russo had to juggle with    chris evans as steve rogers  captain america  robert downey jr as tony star  ironman  scarlett johansson as natasha romanoff  black widow  sebastian stan as bucky barnes  winter solider  anthony mackie as sam wilson  falcon  don cheadle as james rhodes  war machine  jeremy renner as clint barton  hawkeye  chadwick boseman as tchalla  black panther  paul bettany as vision  elizabeth olsen as wanda maimoff  scarlet witch  paul rudd as scott lang  antman  emily vancamp as sharon carter  tom holland as peter parket  spiderman  daniel brühl as zemo    what makes this movie so magical is the seriousness the evolution and fullness of each character that is brilliantly shown on screen what i loved even more was how the filmmakers approached the problem of how each superhero would approach and fight each other without anyone overpowering the other or destroying each other  at the same time leaving marvel fans wanting for more and where the icing on the cake came in was when the seriousness the unpredictability and the humor all laced in together to form a seamless thread of fantastic storytelling at its best     the humor and inexperience of the amazing spiderman along with the antman brought in a sense of freshness  excitement that this dark storyline badly needed     tom holland is an incredibly energetic and fasttalking spiderman who still has a lot to learn but is still superbly impressive as is hes genuinely ecstatic over things like captain americas shield falcons wings and the winter soldiers arm hes like a fanboy freaking out over comic book related things that have been brought to life hes basically the audience thrown into a superhero suit with a wicked sense of humor    paul rudd returning as antman offers another layer of comedic relief and even has a few new surprises up his sleeve as antman and the unpredictability by which he uses his powers  makes it for a very interesting watch     chadwick boseman as the black panther is driven by revenge in the film but hes also amazingly intelligent and agile the chase sequences involving black panther are some of the best in the film bosemans performance is so engaging it leaves you waiting for his solo adventure when it will be released in 2018     and most importantly lets not forget the main villain     when you have an ordinary mortal who has to battle extraordinary humanbeing with superpowers  one can only imagine how can he do this     daniel bruhls performance as zemo takes the story home he is a broken man who has lost everything he holds dear and he carries this cool calm composed and complicated persona right up to the very end of the movie his villainous mind with his ingenious master plan is the very glue that holds this story together    and all these elements added together along with the twist in the plot  right at the end  is what makes this movie an absolute masterpiece     loy machedos moment of truth  a perfect thriller that leaves you captivated  spellbound right up to the very end of the movie the years best blockbuster and a must watch movie for all diehard fans of action  comics     loy machedos final ratings  a perfect 10 out of 10     loy machedo  personal branding strategist  loymachedocom  whoisloymachedocom
May 7 2016,positive,i seen it twice unlike bvs civil war has looking forward to more i cant wait to own this movie its part of a collection of must see movies that grows every year  long gone are the days where i would break out the star wars trilogy as the only go to collection of sit and chill entertainment  marvel is giving us movies that hold up and can be shared with others over the years        evans and downey have built something great here with the help of everyone else in the cast and the rosso brothers everyone gets to shine at least a little bit  i cant believe i ever complained that  a movie had too many characters       unlike bvs none of the characters feel shoe horned in  i was entertained at hour 2 just as much as i was in the opening of the movie     the actorscharacters didnt have me wondering or questioning what was going on during the movie or after the way i felt  with bvs  i didnt have to pick out things that worked for me because the movie works        while this movie feels more like the avengers i walked away feeling that this was a cap movie that had the avengers in it evans and cap are treated with respect as downeys ironman is a great add and not a thief   this is a team movie everyone did a great job
May 7 2016,positive,folks this is about as good as it gets after the ultron disappointment my faith in marvel is restored here is a movie with the requisite amount of action and dialogue with a good chunk of emotional gravitas and comic relief thrown in for good measure peter parker is great as is paul lang and everyone else pretty much shines its a movie that leaves you wanting more enjoy
May 7 2016,neutral,i really liked black panther thats about it honestly spiderman was cool albeit a little forced the dialogue felt lazy and there were so many plotholes not bad just very underwhelming
May 7 2016,positive,great movie very entertaining i loved the action story and just the way how the movie was presented i do feel like the movie was a little long but it wouldnt be the great movie it is if it wasnt as it is
May 7 2016,negative,seriously am i watching the same movie as everyone else boring with so many sub plots going on nothing much good to say about it at all tony starks worst movie to date captain america is second to all the funny characters in his own movie the baddie is the worst baddie of all time and boring as hell bored of the whole comic thing now as my young daughter said even spider mans costume looks fake i am no sheep
May 7 2016,negative,civil war my ass nothing like the civil war comic book at all
May 7 2016,positive,was fortunate to watch this one of the best movie ever  kudos marvel you never let me down 
May 7 2016,negative,over hyped new spiderman wasnt that great black panther was cool nothing new to offer
May 7 2016,positive,the greatest movie i have ever seen this is unbelievably great with great heroes such as the new editions spiderman and black panther and a villain so great and as good loki
May 7 2016,positive,awesome do you stand with the collective or do you stand with freedom choose one 
May 7 2016,positive,amazing i loved it nothing more to say
May 7 2016,positive,captain america civil war gets so intense that i basically had a couple of panic attacks watching it the only issues i have are that they sort of threw the villains away for the sake of dealing with the internal conflict of the heroes which i totally understand overall i am extremely satisfied with spiderman and black panther being the biggest highlights the airport scene in leipzig is the best action scene in any marvel film to date and makes me excited for whats coming next in terms of action for the next two avengers movies do not miss this film if you love marvel you will regret it
May 7 2016,positive,outstanding entertaining could be the best marvel movie of all time
May 7 2016,negative,this was straight up garbage of a movie  the story made no sense why are tony stark and captain crunch fighting i thought they were buttbuddies the hulk looked so cgi like he took steroids too much action not enough character building too many plot holes and buttholes why is ironman killing bad guys and why are there so many dumb jokes was this supposed to be comedy  not once did i feel that cap and ironman had legitimate reason for fighting each other ironman was seconds from killing cap but then decided that he was   too cute to die the make up and make out super gay save yourself the time and money by not watching this shitty overhyped movie     go stick an enema up your butt and cleanse your colon that would be a better way to spend your friday night than watching this shitty attempt of a comic book movie
May 7 2016,positive,action packed and overstuffed with all the fixings with a pretty solid plotline
May 7 2016,positive,so the 17orso minute airport fight scene in captain america civil war that everybodys talking about does in fact live up to the hype that sequence alone is worth the price of admission the rest of the films 2plushour run time hits a consistent if notquiteasspectacular fun spot i very much liked but was not overly wowed by pretty much everything exciting action scenes solid character moments interesting philosophical arguments about independence vs control  all good stuff upon reflection though i feel the picture does consciously avoid some of the pitfalls in other marvel movies and even does the extra work to smooth a few past ones over for example using just a few lines of dialog this is the most hawkeyelike that hawkeye has ever been in a marvel movie comic fans will know what i mean by that and its impressive to me black panther and spiderman are introduced here perfectly another huge plus unlike a few things in winter soldier no glaring inconsistencies or moments of questionable logic immediately come to mind this could be a film that ill like even more after i stew on it a while maybe watch it a few more times
May 7 2016,positive,i felt this was a cartoonish plot and tried be made more of a comedy than the actual action movie it was  and action it surely had mcu has done well with keeping fight scenes to a minimum but not in this movie far too much mindless raging action    back to the discussion on the story    without giving spoilers i felt it was not a powerful enough storyline it was pretty much revenge revenge revenge for about 60 of the characters in this film and it seemed to go all over the place it did not know what direction to stay in  good against the good good with the good good against the good ill add repetition to mindless raging also there were a few things that just seemed to fall into place without explanation just so the movie could have its story work well it did not work for me i need all pieces of the puzzle given in order to vision what has been put together    i did however feel they did well in introducing spidey so that the audience can get a feel for him before his upcoming movie yet another spidey movie hits theaters in the near future at the same time though i do not honestly feel it was necessary for him to be in this movie and i feel his introduction was the only reason for his appearance for other than that he really had no part ant man as well he was in the movie for pretty much one scene and as mentioned before an attempt at comedy    black panther however i feel they did not do as well with introducing him to the audience i mean many people know spideys story more than his yet they spent a good ten or so minutes on a scene with peter parker and really nothing on black panthers intro yes i know they are releasing his own movie and will surely explain more in it but again spidey is getting his own as well    so pretty much i feel this to be the least favorable captain america movie even though iron man was featured in this one cap was selfish arrogant and honestly just annoying at times different than what he has been in the other movies we have seen him in oh and i know it was the attempt of the whole civil war thing but too many players were on the field in this one another unnecessary casting just to name one other out of a few actually was hawkeye i am sure he was glad ant man was there only because ant man became more of the nobody and least known hero based on mcu this time around     i will say it was better than batman vs superman but what wasnt except maybe last years fantastic four blah
May 7 2016,positive,wow civil war is the best of the 3 cap movies
May 7 2016,positive,kind of misnamed it is really avengers civil war but quite entertaining  the fight sequences are sometimes long and the movie feels very long because of it  ironman is definitely the most interesting character and spiderman was great      and props to marvel  12 movies with a plot line that stills moves forward and no random rebooting     also  nice costumes on the lady heros  how nice to see that you can be a super heroine and not wear super insane and impractical revealing costumes
May 7 2016,positive,this might be my favorite marvel movie yet
May 7 2016,positive,civil war was a fun more dark and depth sequel to the marvel cinematic universe with great action sequences great dialogue between the main characters the story and the funny second act makes captain american civil war the most entertaining film this year so far 9210
May 7 2016,positive,civil war doesnt hit the highs that the winter soldier had for a captain america movie in the end im judging this as a third installment in a trilogy not a continuation of an expanded universe story    as a conclusion to the captain america movies civil war does a fine job at strangely tying up loose ends and giving an openended conclusion there are elements in such third movie where it feels more forced to cater to other star players but the film still benefits the captain america crew making this ultimately work kudos to the russo brothers for finding a perfect niche in telling essentially three stories in one    three stories in one yep theres a captain america sequel a spiderman version 3 prequel and a black panther prequel in here heres the thing though where so many other movies have struggled to find their footing in setting up movies within movies civil war accomplishes this feat flawlessly spiderman and black panther are integrated into the plot that makes the narrative that much more interesting    in the end the ultimate villain makes for an anticlimactic ending its as if the pitch for the movie demanded a struggle amongst the heroes we lovebut the toy sales demanded that they all were still heroes in the end i like the idea of no character being really correctbut thats looking too deep into a movie thats meant for a huge audience this is the triumph movie that will probably ultimately be the best summer movie of this year its worth onetwoor three watches
May 7 2016,positive,more or less the movie the mcu has been building up to the most at this point captain america civil war is possibly the first film in the franchise that feels like its the product of serialization with past films and character growth finally having a strong input on the overall storyline aside from this marketing material though civil war is a damn good summer movie filled with witty banter gorgeous setpieces and enough nerdout moments to make the comiccon crowd yell best movie ever its also possibly the first genre film to juggle so many characters and story lines and make it work as well as this its not precisely tight and marvel still struggles to gives us a compelling villain but civil war is technically their most impressive and satisfying film yet
May 7 2016,positive,better than it had any right to be  lots of fun and action with some challenging themes
May 7 2016,positive,nearly flawless this is how its done balance pacing beauty forged by story and relevant gravitas
May 7 2016,positive,as a huge marvel fan i walked into the first showing of civil war on thursday night with very high expectations for the film sky high expectations but marvel and the russo brothers fail to disappoint despite the high expectations it still managed to surpass them beautifully kudos to the russo brothers who did such an amazing job brining to life some of our favorite heroes to the big screen and doing it in such an exquisite way with a running time of over 2 hours this marvel film does an amazing job entertaining you and keeping you 100 occupied and focused that those 2 hours seem to fly by quickly which many films have a hard time succeeding and only cause boredom and desire for a film to finish but the complete opposite comes from civil war you will be occupied watching this film and it will cause not even wanting to blink once cause you can miss an amazing moment of the great action sequences that our favorite heroes perform i would recommend everyone to see this film whether or not youre a marvel fan failing to do so would make you i dont know a bit ignorant
May 7 2016,positive,wonderful just perfect i wish ant man had few more scenes though
May 7 2016,positive,best of the marvel saga thus far great action and great story hero vs hero done right
May 7 2016,positive,action packed fun very entertaining
May 7 2016,positive,awesome movie well made onto ragnarok next    to all negative ratings      know your comics history of ca civil war before you speak negativity the books has so much information and so little time to crunch them into a single movie appreciate things the right way
May 7 2016,positive,simply put this is one of the best comic book films ever made with a more serious and darker tone than most marvel movies captain america civil war manages to deliver incredible action and intrigue
May 7 2016,positive,at this point you pretty much know what youre getting captain america civil war has great action sequences interesting interactions between characters and excels in the  management of tone and atmosphere it also lacks what many of the movies in this franchise lack like formal identity depth of themes and has the same problems in the character saturation and overall sense of safeness in its narrative construction and decisions yes it is as solid as these films get but by now the sense of wonder has faded a little bit and the people behind marvel seem like theyre not going anywhere that strays from the formula
May 6 2016,positive,freaking loved it going to see it again tomorrow 
May 6 2016,positive,joe  anthony russo once again give us a great marvel film captain america civil war or what i like to call it avengers 25 delivers what we would have liked to see with avengers age of ultron at times the film could get a little repetitive especially with the characters making jokes which could sometimes get annoying but makes up for it with the great action sequences and the intense moments in the film when this film gets serious it does once again this film also made me very happy with all the characters that were included especially spiderman surprisingly i actually like tom holland as peter parker and do see potential for him in the next marvel films chris evans does a great job with his portrayal as captain america as so does robert downey jr as iron man a very fun movie which you will enjoy and makes me even more excited to see what the russo brothers have in store for avengers infinity war     i give captain america civil war 4 stars
May 6 2016,positive,excellent movie without a doubt the best marvel movie so far great story dealing with so many superheroes but they have sufficient time on the screen
May 6 2016,neutral,after captain america 2 this is bullshit there was no point to this movie at all i was well written and beautifully shot but at the end of the day it was just more set up i didnt feel like it needed to be made here and i thought batman v superman was bad this is just sad it was just fun thats it but i didnt leave the movie feeling like it had a message or made me feel good i was probably just expecting more honestly but for what it is i mean its watchable
May 6 2016,positive,am i the only one who found this movie mediocre tom holland spiderman and downey steal the show  i love it for the tech and for the bringing everybody together but the plot like spoilers why captan freakin america lied to his friend and defended a rogue agent against his own team who he knows is tryng hard to do the literal most just thing also understanding and having a movie stand alone is really important something which this movie doesnt do very well granted it is part of a larger us verse but that doesnt mean im freaking exhausted i just got fired from my job my gf broke up with me and ive had 9 jobs in to years and 3 gf i cant seem to hold onto anything and i just saw this movie with my now ex and another ex it was fine i guess but my attention was divided between them because i am alone and a powerless person who needs the approval of ogres to exist  lonely so maybe im just not in the mood to rate this move alone and drunk in my room while listening to alan watts speeches about nothingness and i also found out my other ex is dating a younger hotter richer guy than meso shut up
May 6 2016,positive,meh  it was as good as batman v superman  spider man stole the show the 15 mins he was in it black panther was great the last 40 mins of the movie was great first half really dragged
May 6 2016,negative,batman v superman was better
May 6 2016,positive,best one of the series
May 6 2016,positive,so many good things about this movie  antman and spiderman are the stand outs
May 6 2016,positive,marvel proves yet again that they are able to give the fans what they live about their cinematic universe while incorporating new ideas and characters    as a die hard marvel comics fan i will say that i was a tad disappointed in some of the changes they needed to make to one of my favorite story lines but it makes sense when you consider that they still dont own the rights to xmen or fantastic four    the introduction of black panther left us satisfied while still wanting more a rare balance and we finally get the perfect spiderman peter parker combo
May 6 2016,positive,great movie good story and tons of action people actually cheered during the movie
May 6 2016,negative,horrible boring clichã
May 6 2016,positive,movie was fucking amazing will have to watch a few more times to really soak the amazingness of this movie i have so much on my mind and this is all i can utter right now
May 6 2016,positive,65 civil war is the best mcu movie by far in terms of action and intelligence but what makes this a great  movie is the truth and conviction of the performances and its highly emotional bordering on heartbreaking stakes bring tissues
May 6 2016,negative,talking talking talking overall the action is below the expectation
May 6 2016,positive,had its moments its a really detailed story recommend seeing it during the day
May 6 2016,positive,i am not lying when i say this movie is the exact definition of perfection
May 6 2016,positive,my new favorite movie ever
May 6 2016,positive,this movie was okay it was not that great but i enjoyed watching all of the fighting scenes and the conflict between both sides overall it was a good movie
May 6 2016,positive,this movie lives up to the hype and goes beyond it this is probably the best marvel film to date and possibly the greatest comic book movie of all time the airport scene alone is worth the price of admission any worries you had going into this film just forget about them the only problem that could be had with this film is the main villains arc but he isnt in the movie enough for it to take you out of the film i could on and on about how awesome this movie is but ill just end this by sayinggo watch this movie
May 6 2016,positive,marvels signature wit and allure are on full display here giving us yet another stellar installment into their cinematic behemoth while also doing their best to convey as much weight as they can to their drama without actually conjuring up another cookiecutter evil creton
May 6 2016,positive,this was awesome  spiderman and antman were the biggest highlights for me
May 6 2016,positive,the best avengers movie and its not even an avengers movie
May 6 2016,positive,better than batman v superman
May 6 2016,positive,they call marvel the house of ideas for a reason they stay reinvention the superhero genre
May 6 2016,positive,good movie a lot of fun with typical amazing stunts and action as well as great well timed humor the 3d wasnt great even in imax winter soldier and the avengers are still the best but this worth seeing a couple of times
May 6 2016,positive,great movie great action awesome characters and development and good plot
May 6 2016,positive,beginning of the film  me want any twizzlers dom   dom i only eat licorice     during avengers fight  dom pass me some of those twizzlers  me not as good as batman vs superman huh  dom nope  10 mins later dom is asleep  sums up my review redbox   no fanboyism
May 6 2016,positive,think you were disappointed by last summers avengers age of ultron the pressurepacked experience broke writerdirector joss whedon who swore off being the creative shepherd of the marvel cinematic universe mcu enter the russo brothers a pair who were widely known for their work in eclectic tv comedies like community and arrested development before blowing away all modest expectations with 2014s captain america winter soldier i can say that the russos are more than capable for the challenge my simplistic blurb for captain america civil war is thus everything batman vs superman did wrong this movie does right    after the cataclysmic events of multiple movie climaxes the world governments are wary of the power wielded by the avengers secretary ross william hurt the lone returning element from 2008s incredible hulk is pushing the superheroes to sign the sokovia accords which would put them under the control of a un joint panel this panel would decide when and where to deploy the avengers captain america aka steve rogers chris evans is worried about a group of people taking away their choice iron man aka tony stark robert downey jr believes that they need to accept limitations and that agreeing to these terms staves off something worse later this division becomes even more pronounced when rogers old friend the winter soldier aka bucky barnes sebastian stan reappears as the chief suspect in a un bombing black panther aka tchalla chadwick boseman swears vengeance against barnes for the bombing as the assembly of heroes squares off over the fate of the winter soldier baron zemo daniel bruhl is tracking down classified hydra documents to uncover pertinent information that will topple an empire     while i dont want to turn every new film review as an opportunity to beat a dead horse i cannot help but draw immediate and stark comparisons between civil war and the earlier titanic superhero slugfest batman vs superman dawn of justice lets take this case point by point so there is no reasonable doubt left for the jury of ticketbuyers    batman vs superman doesnt set up its conflicts with enough time to develop them and it lacks real emotional stakes    with bvs im saving my fingertips some drudgery we hadnt known these characters for more than one movie at best and in the case of bruce wayne less than one when they fought there wasnt any real stakes despite the apoplectic marketing because we hadnt built relationships with these characters in the case of henry cavills superman many were turned off entirely by the guy not necessarily by cavills physique though did anyone really care who won the filmmakers relied on the audience to supply their pop culture good will for the characters instead of proper characterization and development in the case of civil war were dealing with the cumulative effect of having twelve movies to build up storylines and character relationships were invested in these characters and their friendships so when they fight it actually does matter you feel for both sides and multiple characters and the movie does a good job of providing each side a credible motivation its a political thorny issue but its kept very streamlined focusing more on the characters if the mcu has had one nagging problem throughout its history it has been a dearth of good villains theres loki and loki one solution is to just pit the heroes against each other that produce as many fistbumps as winces my audience was gasping at reveal and twists and turns they werent doing that with bvs and wouldnt you know civil war actually has a climax thats more than just an increasing series of punches and kicks though plenty of those are featured the climax is an emotionally grounded confrontation that cuts to the core of the group the events of this movie matter and while obviously it cant follow its divisions to an irrevocable end i appreciated that not everything is resolved these storylines and the conflicts between characters will carry onward when we pick up the pieces in 2018    batman vs superman is too burdened with setting up an array of other film franchises that it loses badly needed focus and momentum    to be fair this charge can also be laid at the feet of age of ultron which buckled under the heavy weight of setting up multiple other future movies rather than telling a completely satisfying movie in its own right once the franchises gave birth to megafranchises the wheels within wheels of moneymaking now the studios require a lot of heavy lifting from our entertainment theyre investments in futures and if done improperly can easily crumble under the failed execution like the amazing spiderman series rip 20122014 miraculously civil war finds ways to involve every member of large ensemble cast into the story in ways that matter the movie finds small character moments that make them feel better rounded like vision paul bettany and scarlet witch elizabeth olsen and it introduces featured supporting players with great black panther is a terrific addition and brings a quieter intensity that contrasts nicely with the more colorful characters hawkeye introduces himself and black panther curtly says i dont care and goes back to fighting boseman ageless i tell you is smooth and magnetic then theres everyones favorite neighborhood spiderman tom holland or whom im already referring to my pals as best spiderman its another incarnation of peter parker but the first that feels like an actual teenager a bundle of adolescent energy and excitement hes the voice of the fans and during the big battle he cant help but gush that he gets to be involved alongside the big names spideys a fanboy too he also has a few choice meta oneliners that had me cackling holland the impossible makes an immediate impact and unlike bvs finds new ways to make us care im genuinely excited for solo black panther and spiderman adventures with these characters even the more traditional villain of civil war with baron zemo is handled in a way that provides an emotional motivation for his character that is handled with sincerity rather than mustachetwirling villainy in a lot of ways this feels like a third avengers film just with the size and scope alone the dozen characters are juggled skillfully but the emphasis is always on rogers and stark and their significant personal conflicts    batman vs supermans action sequences are repetitive joyless and dank    i challenge some enterprising soul to even try and decipher what is happening during the climactic threeonone monster battle in bvs i was sitting in the theater and just gave up i wasnt having any fun and i couldnt even literally tell what was happening onscreen with all the confusing cgi obfuscation the action droned on and on with little variation and was at pains to include certain members and storylines lois maybe dont get so hasty with that kryptonite spear it was all just one big overwrought mess that made you question whether anybody on that film production actually liked these superheroes with civil war the action sequences are smartly conceived and choreographed making excellent use of geography and adding organic complications the standout is the 20minute superheroonsuperhero brawl at the leipzig airport it is nothing short of nerd nirvana the characters use their powers together in exciting ways and it further helps them feel like an actual team taking proper advantage of their resources its the culmination of a childs imagination at play the living embodiment of smashing action figures against one another and flying around the room i was thrilled that the russo brothers found ways to incorporate all the heroes into the action the specific powers are taken advantage of in fun and surprising ways the action changes as the stakes keep getting more complicated as more heroes enter the fray its a set piece that will become legendary within film geek circles and it provides payoff after glorious payoff     batman vs superman is devoid of all fun and takes itself far too seriously you feel beaten down exhausted and punished by films end    the marvel movies have earned a reputation for their brisk and breezy nature which has unfairly been labeled as weightless and silly i challenge someone to watch civil war and tell me just how weightless and silly civil war is the russo brothers and the screenwriters take these characters seriously and their care shows while there can be plenty of rapidfire quips and oneliners the movies sense of humor does not detract from the emotional weight of its dramatic shifts there are political and thematic overtones mostly the costs of vengeance and culpability that provide extra depth to the onscreen derringdo however civil war understands that an audience wants to be entertained as well with their heavyhanded messianic imagery there are payoffs galore in this movie some are several movies deep from set up it all comes together to make a thrilling and highly enjoyable movie experience that plays to its audience in the best way possible its an expert summer blockbuster that packs its own punch theres a reason i have already seen civil war three times already there is so much to enjoy and its so tightly packed and structured that you can jump right in and go for the ride this is the movie fans were hoping for this is the movie that washes out the bad taste of the dreadful bvs if one of my lasting disappointments with bvs was how it made me lose hope for future dc movies civil war has cemented my anticipation the future creative direction of the mcu is in good hands with the russo brothers this is the movie that reminds you just how damn good superhero movies can be when theyre at the top of their game id place civil war right up there at the top of the mcu though at this time im still holding guardians of the galaxy as the apex theyre still achieving this high level of quality after a dozen movies people i would not have thought that captain america would become the gold standard of the mcu but there it is i felt beaten down by the merciless end of bvs i felt the elation of an adrenalinerush from civil war     ill conclude this unorthodox film review with my in summary blurb everything batman vs superman did wrong captain america civil war does right do yourself a favor and start the healing process from bvs and enjoy marvels latest cinematic gift to its fans     nates grade a
May 6 2016,positive,this movie is pretty much exactly what weve all come to expect from marvel movies  theres little surprises here and there but nothing monumental  its simply really good from beginning to end  i was actually afraid that with so many characters involved that it would sort of turn into a mess age of ultron had that problem at the end but its put together well enough that everybody gets exactly the amount of screen time they need and nobody gets in anyones way  if i have any criticism about it its the fact that very little is resolved at the end  it doesnt exactly just run out of steam but its really sort of an empire strikes back ending  the team is shattered friendships are broken some heroes are captured some are at large  the whole thing just sort of ends on a down note  its not bad enough to ruin the movie by any stretch but i still would have liked to have seen a bit more resolution to the main conflict than they gave us if even on a personal level    the standout of the movie is definitely black panther who is one of the best comictomovie transitions ive seen since downey jrs original ironman  hes perfect and while i went into this one rather ambivalent about his solo movie i came out pretty excited about it  and then theres spiderman  while his presence does feel a bit shoehorned in he still works really well  the new guy captures the young peter parkerspiderman dynamic beautifully and his scenes are totally fun  with 5 previous spiderman movies behind us they didnt really give us anything particularly new with the character but they certainly gave us the spiderman we all love and expect    in a way that sums up civil war pretty well  its everything we love and expect from marvel studios but doesnt offer anything really new  for the most part though thats pretty okay  marvel really shouldnt be trying to wow us anymore they should just be trying to entertain us and theyre doing that quite well    captain america civil war gets a buy it on bluray on talons movie scale  duh
May 6 2016,positive,as disappointing as it is satisfying   okayatbest type of movie
May 6 2016,positive,great for friends great for a good time with your girl even a great mothers day gift civil war is great on so many levels long live the mcu
May 6 2016,positive,thats three down and two more to go    unless youve been living under a rock you know that superhero movies rule the summer box office as fox timewarner and disney with sony more on that in a bit tear into a threeway dogfight for supremacy    deadpool shocked and offended the world this february en route to a recordsetting box office run making it the highestgrossing rrated film of all time and even surpassing its own flagship series when it overtook the box office haul of days of future past    dawn of justice arrived with a bang but went out with a whimper meeting universal critical derision and only slightlylessuniversal rejection by fans it boggles the mind that a movie could make nearly a billion dollars yet still be considered a boxoffice failure yet there we have it    this week saw the domestic release of disneymarvels biggest gun for the year in captain america civil war looselybased on the infamous event 2006 event series this is the film that everyone going into the year predicted would be the superhero movie of the year relegating all the rest to also rans of course no one anticipated the stunning critical audience and financial success of deadpool so anything can still happen xmen apocalypse and marvels own doctor strange have yet to bow however with a weeks head start in foreign markets civil war has already neared the 300 million mark before it even released in the united states    but now its here what follows are my personal thoughts spoilers ahead so if youve yet to see the film yourself i suggest you turn away    like now    im warning you    are you still here    ok if youre still reading and you havent seen the movie yet im not going to be held responsible for the consequences    civil war is very loosely based on the 2006 marvel event of the same name though rather than the superhero registration act that was the impetus in the comics instead we see the world reacting to the destruction that follows in the wake of the avengers fed up by the lack of accountability the united nations has decided that the avengers need oversight because that totally worked out when shield was still active thus the central conflict of the film as captain america and iron man find themselves on opposing sides stark agrees that they need limits while steve fears what might happen if theyre unable to act because of politics    manipulating the conflict is baron zemo a man with a hidden agenda who wants to see the avengers tear themselves apart    if this is sounding kind of familiar youre not the only one who hears it civil war hits a lot of the same story beats as batman v superman the difference is that marvels effort succeeds in most of the areas where bvs failed the film is tightlyplotted and wellpaced and never feels like it drags or allows itself to be weighed down by its subject matter its a far more concise polished and cohesive spin on the same story bvs meandered through    the heart of the film is steves friendship with bucky  now the exsoviet assassin winter soldier  who finds himself framed for a crime he didnt commit this is where the central conflict comes into play as steve ignores the sokovia accords intended to handcuff the avengers and heads off to clear buckys name this in turn brings stark into play and sets the stage for the films setpiece a colossal battle between the avengers andthe rest of the avengers however this is where civil war falls into the same trap as bvs    civil war introduces two key features for the mcu going forward the first and most relevant to the plot is tchalla king of wakanda and the superhero known as black panther tchalla is very nicely worked into the plot when his father and predecessor as king becomes a victim of the villains machinations his personal desire for vengeance against the innocent bucky drives nearly as much of the conflict as the fight between cap and stark over the sokovia accords and he plays a key role at several points in the story this was a wonderful introduction to a character that is much lessknown among general audiences and this is one of the things marvel usually does well    the second character and the one that caused the most buzz was spiderman its been known since around the time age of ultron wrapped that spidey would be joining the mcu after sony made a deal with disneymarvel to share the film rights with sony focusing on the characters solo adventures while marvel gets to play with him in the mcu marvel decided to use civil war as the vehicle for introducing him to the franchise rather than wait for the reboot of his solo franchise unfortunately thats all his inclusion felt like while the scenes between parker and stark were endearing and enjoyable  and stark hitting on aunt may played in this version by marisa tomei and who could blame him its marisa tomei was quite amusing ultimately spidey felt like he was just shoehorned into the movie just so they could say hey look spiderman is officially in the mcu    most of the rest of the cast felt like they were just there to fill a roster spot in the airport fight ok ill be fair and say that black widow and falcon played a few important roles but ultimately the story was for steve buck and stark and anyone not in that trio was more or less done by the time the third act started scarlet witch and vision had a cute scene together but so much more could have been done with the subplot surrounding wandas regrets over her actions the responsibility she felt for the incident that led to the sokovia accords essentially taking speedballs place from the comics version and her feelings of alienation over being locked away in the avengers base for the safety of the public hawkeye and antman rounded out team cap with war machine filling out tonys side clint and lang had a few nice moments during the airport fight but that more or less covers their contribution to the film rhodey got a little more to do having the chance to be one of the voices debating the accords acting as tonys enforcer in the initial attempt to capture bucky and to get fridged as part of tonys motivation leading into the third act the film also saw the conclusion of peggy carters role in the films at least those set in the presentday but though the film finally confirmed that sharon agent 13 carter was her niece sharon didnt get much to do besides slipping steve some information and a bit of tongue    this was one of the films biggest problems theres a big cast of characters and not enough time to develop all the subplots its the same problem that bvs ran into with mercy graves almost being an afterthought and wonder woman being woefully underdeveloped    as for the villain weve probably spent less screen time with zemo than we have any other mcu villain to date not named thanos one of the mcus biggest weaknesses has been its villains with most of them being lackluster at best or utterly forgettable im looking at you malekith at worst zemo i find may be one of their most effective todate we get tantalizing hints about his background throughout the film but his goals and motivations are never truly revealed until the final act making it quite enjoyable to piece together along with the heroes he also effectively wins his entire goal was to tear the avengers apart and thats exactly what happens    unfortunately that leads us to the other big weakness in the film the final conflict between stevebucky and stark relies on a major retcon an incredibly contrived coincidence and a tremendous leap of logic to make it work considering how well the conflict was built up throughout the rest of the movie it was incredibly disappointing that the finale had to be forced along in that manner its not at all helped that the entire two and a half hours ultimately felt pointless after the first stinger all the effort cap expended on buckys behalf is rendered moot when buck decides to go back into suspended animation because he cant trust himself not to have his winter soldier programming reactivated    captain america civil war is the movie age of ultron ought to have been although marketed as cap it was much more an avengers movie even if most of the rest of the cast didnt get much in the way of development although its being hailed by some critics as the best superhero movie ever this overlooks several key flaws nonetheless its definitely a film worth seeing in the theaters
May 6 2016,positive,the story is one of marvels best all the characters flow so nicely and the tension between iron man and bucky is one of the things that make the movie
May 6 2016,positive,i have seen this movie this morning and it is awesome it rolls out nice and smooth you are even given a bad guy who is not cap or iron man beating on one another this movie has it all plot action adventure and it all works masterfully
May 6 2016,positive,totally awesome way better than ultron
May 6 2016,positive,civil war may be officially now the best marvel film to date along with the first avengers this year we also got batman v superman sounds like a court case but no its also about 2 superheroes who may or may not fight and kill each other and guess what its actually about that enough dc okay fine the reason for being a great film is not about having those usual cliches in a decent superhero flick bad villains good ending not in the case here this is not your typical avengers or any kind of film yes its avengers 3 or iron man 4 or ant man 2 or black panther prequel or spiderman rereboot but it dont feel like it and thats even a good thing its also i think had some of the most spectacular and entertaining action fight scenes ever to put on film of course combining the gizmos and powers of the heroes here when they fight some others theres this climactic battle at the end not the ending but by the airport its a feast to watch these heroes collide and show what they can show the introduction of black panther here is priceless hes just a hatred human being vow to avenge someone he lost and truly believe the spirit of fighting the rival spidermans introduction is also a surprisingly smile in the face moment this time not tobey or andrew but a tom who is still a kid and pretty much loves to talk while fighting crime in a humorous way there also goes antman who makes a very prolific personality who shrinks and yes believe me became a giant and of course the rest of the gang also gave some of their better roles than the previous avengers films also what makes this film special is what made bvs wrong is about characters who we learn here that they can be hurt and feel sad based on their actions and characteristics to each other and many people would probably asked me about what i thought of daniel bruhls character zemo if hes a better or a worse villain i think hes no villain nor a hero hes also a person who had lost someone that wants vengeance so finally having to say this is a relief for good its the best film of 2016 so far
May 6 2016,positive,wow totally amazing
May 6 2016,positive,this movie is so awesome plenty of nods to the original story line and the story was well told i want to see it again
May 6 2016,positive,its a dynamic movie everything perfection emotionalepicawesomeactionpackedfunny
May 6 2016,positive,this was the greatest most epic film i have ever seen in my entire life go see it
May 6 2016,positive,loved it and cant wait to see it again
May 6 2016,positive,this movie is very different than the comic book but its very driven for the characters like iron man captain america and more the russo brothers did a job for this film clearly this became the 1 marvel cinematic film so far
May 6 2016,positive,i really really really enjoyed this movie its not the same epic scope as the story was in the books but they still hit a few of the same beats story wise favorite things about the movie have to be spiderman  and ant man  they finally found the perfect parker and spiderman  third times the charm i guess  ill write more about the movie later in my blog but i had a blast and you should too
May 6 2016,positive,wow  a thrill ride basically from start to finish some twists some turns great lines some new characters  love this cant wait to see it again
May 6 2016,positive,just amazing its easy my favorite next to guardians and man spiderman was just perfect
May 6 2016,positive,phenomenal everything in this movie is super well done infinity war is in good hands
May 6 2016,positive,best marvel movie yet
May 6 2016,negative,it was ok kinda lame you would think after saving the world together you would be better friends
May 6 2016,positive,the best marvel movie ever
May 6 2016,neutral,without spiderman and ant man this movie would be a dumpster fire massively disappointed amazingly its a complete rip off plot wise even with a why did you say that name moment daddy and mommy issues and villain masterminding the heroes fight only difference was this movie actually lived up to all the criticisms bvs got i cant believe people are honestly saying this movie is great its meh its watchable and considering how incredible winter soldier was meh does not cut it did disney brainwash everyone into thinking civil war was bvs because this is the movie that deserves that 2829 score dissapointed almost angry over how disappointed in this movie i am
May 6 2016,positive,easily my new favorite marvel movie after a few more viewings i may be able to decide if its my favorite superhero movie which its definitely top three the writing and directing makes this movie the brilliant masterpiece the ability to give every character a particular motivation and story arc that made you care about each one no matter how much or how little screen time they got was beyond impressive the story was tense amusing sad emotional and perfectly paced i cant say enough about the acting from everyone on screen robert downey jr as always putting out a stellar performance tom holland in his first scene easily won me over and is definitely the best peter parkerspiderman weve had on screen yet chadwick boseman does a fantastic job introducing moviegoers to black panther i cannot wait for his solo movie now also really happy with the character development of scarlett witch elizabeth olsen really helped improve her story i could write paragraphs on every actoractress performances the action scenes were all done great but the airport scene in particular is probably the best action scene ive seen in any movie and definitely the best one in any superhero film i cant say enough good things about this movie but marvel knocked this one out of the park highly recommended go see it  psstay for the very end of the credits we get two aftercredits scenes ppsstan lees cameo is one of his best ever
May 6 2016,positive,wow just wow that was a fun ride the whole way the scene at the airport was already amazing and the rest of the movie put this over the top tchalla and spidey were awesome looking forward to their films the interactions between falcon and bucky were great cap could have gotten lost in all of this but instead he still manages to keep the spotlight through it
May 6 2016,positive,video review not a written review civil war was a film that ive been looking forward to since the first avengers came out in 2012 it has been a long wait and finally it has come i thought the movie was above average but i also did notice a couple of issues with it if you want to check out my video review click to the link down below   
May 6 2016,positive,incrediblesimply incredible
May 6 2016,positive,more please that pretty much sums it up notice by the title that this is a captain america movie and not an avengers flick you wouldnt know it by watching it the tone is dead perfect especially compared to another recent capes and crusaders adventure that shall not be named all characters being introduced into the expanding avengers universe are done well special note goes to paul rudd as antman and tom holland as spiderman the marvel writers are generous enough to spread humor around but rudd and holland really server up great comic relief holland is possibly the best on screen spiderman todate although that may be a side effect of limited screen time leaving us wanting what more please
May 6 2016,positive,good movie decent story line with good plot twist lots of action  better than superman vs batman marvel still got it
May 6 2016,negative,it was a good movie but definitely a big no no for spiderman  overall was a teenager movie
May 6 2016,positive,captain america civil war    marvel goes dark    captain america civil war is the third standalone captain america movie from marvel studios it could also be looked at as avengers 2 12 with the inclusion of such characters as iron man scarlet witch vision black widow hawkeye antman falcon winter soldier war machine and with introductions of black panther and marvels newest iteration of spiderman captain america civil war is a lot of things but bad certainly aint one of them    civil war is one of the darker more compelling offerings that marvel has given us since 2014s cap 2 and its only fitting that it was directed by the same team of joe and anthony russo who no doubt know how these movies are supposed to be when the tone calls for it the captain america films in particular are very interesting because theyre the only movies in the mcu that follow a continuous arch and while captain americassteve rogers story is far from over obviously because of infinity war in two years civil war brings the standalone captain america trilogy to satisfying conclusion    civil war addresses a major issue most people have with superheroes these days it was also an issues touched on my batman v superman earlier this year the issue being to what extent are superheroes useful if they get the job done but leave miles and miles of destruction and death in their path the aftermath of the sokovia attack by ultron in the previous avengers movie has left the team scarred particularly tony starkiron man and after a recent incident in wakanda where the team was dispatched to apprehend a few terrorists people ended up dead on their watch once again this leads to the united nations proposing a superhuman registration act similar to that of the superhero relocation program in disney pixars the incredibles in which the superheros acts are monitored by the government to ensure there are no more casualties in their missions to come this new law doesnt sit well with steve rogerscaptain america who believes that the avengers should be free to save the world without supervision by the united nations tony starkiron man however believes they need to be put in check and so a civil war breaks out among the marvel heroes and their conflicting ideologies make up the emotional core of this movie    marvel movies have a lot of things going for them one of which is sheer entertainment value these movies dont need to have these huge complex storylines ie batman v superman to be good they work perfectly well as popcorn flicks but more than every once in a while marvel breaks the mold and gives us a movie that is both entertaining and thoughtprovoking civil war is one of those movies they way they juggle the different views of stark and rogers and their various teams is brilliantly realized you cant really choose a side here and right when you think youve figured out whos in the right the other side states their side of the story and soon youre not sure who to root for easily the most compelling storytelling since the winter soldier    of course my favorite part of any movie is the acting so ill talk about that for a bit there isnt a weak performance in this movie everyone does their part brilliantly robert downey jr  shows sides of tony stark weve never seen before in his previous five performances as does chris evans as steve rogerscap of course theres the rest of the epic cast which rivals that of the first and second avengers movies put together scarlet johansson is back as natasha romanovblack widow and kicking a as usual elizabeth olsen is brilliant and gorgeous as wanda maximofscarlet witch paul bettany brings unexpected bouts of great humor as vision paul rudd returns as scott langantman and nails it particularly in one laughoutloud scene we also have sebastian stan as bucky barneswinter soldier don cheadle as james rhodeswar machine jeremy renner as clint barton hawkeye and anthony mackie as sam wilsonfalcon but thats not all no if you thought that was it we still have chadwick bosemans breakout role as the vengeful black panther and of course tom holland as the greatest version of peter parkerspiderman ive seen since the first sam raimi film or from what little memory i have of the nineties cartoon i expect great things from all these characters in the future im particularly interested in what marvel has planned for their new spiderman because this one is definitely a keeper    all in all captain america civil war is a pretty great movie i personally prefer winter soldier for various reasons but i would certainly rank both films in my top five marvel films or even top three definitely a worthy addition to the mcu    12
May 6 2016,positive,mehhh the movie was good but i expected more as always i think captain america is the worst avenger just because chris even is a shitty actor hes a complete faggot which fucked the movie up a bit but otherwise the rest of the characters were awsome but other than that movie was good
May 6 2016,positive,    ah yes marvel movies ive mentioned many times before that ive grown tired of the spitting out of marvel films i mean fuck the last film ive seen from marvel looking through their filmography is 2013s thor the dark world i know i know i still havent bothered watching any of the past 3 years of  avengers type films or guardians of the galaxy watching deadpool wouldnt help i think im just an xmen guy however how would i fare with captain america civil war lets see    so i needed a lot of backstory that may have been a problem coming in no winter soldier but thankfully my bf is able to fill me in on whats gone on in the past three years of this universe and i want to be interested but its tough for me to get into it so i try to get into the movie based on whats on screen alone and what the fuck i fall asleep yep the characters just dont interest me enough and then theres political agendas to be met when were pulling a man of steel with holy shit these heroes could get out of control regulate their actions i guess this is the thought provoking themes some critics talked about but honestly it was a conversation that ive had in my head multiple times and nothing new was offered    but then the movie was saved when we introduced spider man holy shit tom holland saved this movie for me ive been a spider man fan since sam raimis movies and spidie woke me up i also never thought i would say that the hottest part of this movie was aunt may holy shit okay moving on then it picked up and needless to say i then started having a lot more fun with it marvel humor was starting to hit and the intensity started picking up my favorite characters that im most interested looking at for future reference is iron man spider man black panther and ant man fuck paul rudd has come a long way since being phoebes boo     slow in areas and exciting toward its conclusion captain america civil war pulled through at the end i will wholeheartedly admit that i have bias against the marvel universe hell this review may not be very helpful however spider man alone wants me to get back at it oh and did i mention aunt may
May 6 2016,positive,one of the best marvel films yet
May 6 2016,positive,solid story this time best capt america movie by far best super hero action scene ever
May 6 2016,positive,have to say best comic book movie to date the story is well adapted and the directors deliver yet again a movie that will be remembered for many years to come keep it going marvel
May 6 2016,positive,i want to see that movie
May 6 2016,positive,with these big studio movies some people will think just about anything can be a spoiler so im going to just warn about spoilers from the outset and not waste time deciding when ive gone too far  my nonspoiler opinion though is that civil war is a good movie with some flaws  ill be anxious to watch it more in the future and solidify just where i would rank it among the other marvel films    civil war is a movie where there are extremely spectacular moments that mostly outweigh the negatives  ordinarily these flaws would bother me a lot more but in this movie they feel more like minor stumbles  repeat viewings will tell if the missteps stand out more or disappear so lets review the negatives first and then spend some time heaping more praise on the movie    problem 1 the story takes a long time to set up i realize that the story is kind of intricate and the complex motivations need proper explanation but i kind of felt like i could see myself fastforwarding to the good stuff now that ive seen all the slow parts once    problem 2 its kind of frustrating when you find out the villains master plan and you cant trace back how he could have possibly arranged things to occur as perfectly as they did in the film i definitely see that he was taking smart steps in order to create discord amongst the avengers but i dont see how he planned on and arranged to get bucky cap and tony all in that bunker at the end     problem 3 i dont know why but the first two action scenes are loaded with the handheldshakycamwithrapidcuts crap that marvel is usually good about avoiding i was dizzy and utterly irritated that i couldnt really follow what was happening luckily they dropped that junk as the movie progressed    problem 4 they did a very poor job of making it clear why cap and his cohorts were so opposed to the accords all they needed was cap to verbalize the fact that licensing a persons existence is not the same as licensing inanimate objects like the weapons that tony keeps mentioning unfortunately it came across more as a personal issue that hinged on saving his friend bucky when we got home my wife who did enjoy the movie said she hated captain america not what i think they were going for but even i was leaning towards iron mans side by the end    so those are the primary issues i struggled with in the movie im leaving out the fact that the ending was not exactly happy which i wouldnt normally like because i was impressed they had the guts to not resolve everything as the audience expected some of my issues were more noticeable than others but they were dwarfed by the following great things    awesome 1 marvel continues its amazing streak of movies that cover dark and emotional topics yet maintain a level of lightness and humor it seems cliche at this point to say it but marvel continues to crush dc because their films are actually fun to watch i did not expect to laugh as much in this movie but i did    awesome 2 everyones going to say it but thats because its true the fight sequence in the middle of the movie at the airport is just stellar i followed the whole thing everybody had their moment and i never wanted it to end    awesome 3 the entire plot aside from the one glitch i mentioned about the villains iffy plan was constructed brilliantly the movie transcended simple action sequences and had deeper emotional stakes that will last for some time in the mcu the film even caught me by surprise with the little twist about tonys parents at the end that moment hit me hard because i didnt see it coming and it was set up perfectly to earn the ensuing fight sequence    awesome 4 for my entire life ive always been an avid spiderfan hes been my favorite super hero over all others since i was a little kid watching spiderman cartoons and this rendition of spiderman is the best ever brought to film every second he was there i loved it and the moment he left i wanted him back in the story my wife even told me this is the first spiderman i ever genuinely liked    there was certainly more but i dont want to walk through the whole movie here its an interesting film that didnt feel like any of the other mcu films civil war has its own style and should impress most moviegoers its definitely one of the better marvel films
May 6 2016,positive,amazing film this movie clearly divides the superheroes and its the type of film thats meant to be debated with i love this movie the movie does a good job showing both sides however im more team iron man myself but i can see where people who are team cap are coming from
May 6 2016,positive,why wasnt this just an avengers movie there were more than enough superherosvillains for 3 movies
May 6 2016,positive,a movie that had it all and put it together well a pleasure to watch and no martha
May 6 2016,positive,good solid chapter to the marvel story  although there are lots of characters to juggle it feels like they all blended well and made the most of their screen time  fun
May 6 2016,positive,wow talk about overcoming expectations the fact that critics have been accused of taking bribes from marvel to write positive reviews about their movies seems to be a desperate attempt to flatter dc movies and make them feel better about their obvious lack of sales at the box office marvel clearly knows how to write a story while giving their fandom what they want at the same time civil war is a blatant example of just that    you really cannot help but go crazy over seeing how these characters have grown over the course of all of these movies the action is spectacular without drowning out the other elements of fun it put its focus on a single idea and even when you thought it was going to trail away from that idea it surprises you by going right back to it the sideplots do not out stay their welcome in fact some of the sideplots are very welcome every character was incorporated well even though it made the movie runtime go on for a bit long it did not make the movie drag     in the first few scenes yes the pacing was a little off this was when everything needed to be set up and after it was set up the entire movie took off running and the action was glorious     it was not a perfect movie but any real complaints to be had are nothing more than nitpicks it is a perfect addition to the marvel collection and a great movie all around yes you need to watch the rest of the avengers and captain america movies to know what is really going on but thats the price of being a third sequel as third movies go this one is among the very greatest of its kind
May 6 2016,negative,the zemo story line didnt make sense the secret video in siberia was absurd even for a super hero movie
May 6 2016,positive,probably one of the most solid movies in the avengers lineup i was pleasantly surprised to see that plot character development and ingenuity did not take a back seat to the humor all in all i left the theater satisfied and i hope the other marvel movies follow civil wars standard of quality
May 6 2016,negative,because of all the idiots that are giving it 5 stars im giving civil wars a 12 star though in reality all it deserves is 2 stars it was hard sitting through this fluff and ill conceived movie
May 6 2016,positive,wow civil war was fantastic gonna see it again
May 6 2016,positive,i wont spoil this movie for anyone by giving a good review that tells what the movie is about and how it plays out all i will say is if you think you have anything figured out from the previews your wrong i couldnt find any plot holes or anything terrible about the characters i dont think they went far enough into the origin of zemo but maybe they will fix that in the next movie along with crossbones other than that go see this movie awesome in my opinion much better than bvs maybe the best of the mcu so far
May 6 2016,positive,just simple the best marvel movie ever not words to describe how good it wasnt
May 6 2016,positive,the fight sequences in this film are amazing particularly the airport scene definitely one of marvels best movies yet
May 6 2016,positive,the russo brothers did a wonderful job of inputting a story from a different perspective from the comics i love introducing new characters in the marvel cinematics i understand marvel studios is moving towards a older views but it still brings a that hope amazement that you made as a child when watching saturday morning cartoons
May 6 2016,positive,if a good story driven by character development and interpersonal conflict with a heavy helping of epic action where literally every character shines then this movie will give you what you seek its cast is massive but it did not bog down the story see this movie
May 6 2016,positive,one of if not the best comicbook movie of all time its so well done that its just a great film in general the russo brothers did a fantastic job balancing everything in the movie from action to emotional scenes every performance is the best so far in the franchise chris evans once again proves hes the perfect captain america and rdj brings back what make him so great in iron man my favorite cbm so far cant wait for what marveldisney gives us next
May 6 2016,positive,a good enough addition to the mcu that has a lot of action throughout and a lot of show stealing characters such as spiderman and black panther i just wish there was a better ending dont want to spoil the movies for those who havent seen it so i wont go into detail about the ending
May 6 2016,positive,best superhero movie yet
May 6 2016,positive,a well made movie with a solid coherent storythe new spidey rocks and rdj showsoff his acting chops by displaying a wide range of emotions all characters are well done falls short of dark knight in terms of being onceinatimespecial and not as fun as deadpool for me still it ranks among the top mcu movies
May 6 2016,negative,no risks same formula cheap jokes marvel keeps doing the same thing over and over this movie had a chance to make a real change but it failed the movie should be called captain america buckys romance
May 6 2016,positive,i dont know what to say anymore when it comes to these beyond overrated disneymarvel films this film was just ok winter solider is still easily the best marvel film to date
May 6 2016,negative,almost nothing like the comic books  like seriously the only thing that seemed similar is the law they wanted to pass  even then it didnt seem similar to the comics it also should have been called avengers civil war  not captain america
May 6 2016,positive,this movie was all i was hoping for and more  in many ways it is the antibatman v superman a great summer popcorn flick with heart that is not afraid to inject some humor while also telling an interesting story in a cohesive fashion  the russo brothers are at the top of their game and once again reveal themselves to be master storytellers drawing upon prior story arcs from the mcu and bringing them to their conclusions  robert downey jr is incredible and gives a wonderfully emotional performance  a pity that the academy will probably turn their noses up at this film because it is a comic book movie
May 6 2016,positive,good film it delivers what it says it will some flaws but those are easily forgotten in the film
May 6 2016,positive,absolutely what a big mess of a superhero is supposed to be at the end of the movie im all sad because i just wanted tony and steve to stop fighting i loved it
May 6 2016,positive,a great movie    one sentence describes captain america civil war a brilliantly crafted beautifully executed and superb work of both comic book and cinematic  entertainment should you see this film i think youd know the answer already
May 6 2016,positive,for the first time in marvel history a serious movie all of the buildup has paid off in a film completely about character development
May 6 2016,positive,one word amazing spectacular emotional exciting epicok more than one word  this film is everything that i couldve hoped for and more it works because the story isnt about setting up future films  although it does that the story is about friendship and how it can be broken by misunderstandings and secrets add to that all the comic book stuff and its marvelous we also care about these characters because were invested and that makes the film all the more powerful i cant wait to see it again
May 6 2016,positive,this movie had it flaws but overall it was a good movie i still liked guardian of the galaxy and the winter soldier more but i just got a question for all the critics out there who hated bvs but liked civil war why do yall liked civil war but hated bvs they both had the same flaws civil war to me seemed like a marvels version of bvs with different characters tbh so i dont get whats with all the hate for bvs when they all loved civil war i liked both movies but i actually enjoyed batman v superman a bit more
May 6 2016,positive,black panther was ãâãâãâãâãâ he honestly steels the movie for me and i am so excited for his solo spiderman is portrayed to perfectly tom holland and this may be my favorite iron man movie ever but this isnt my favorite captain america movie that still goes to winter soldier this movie tackles very mature themes and actually puts real emotional drama especially  in third act issues with the movie are minimal the one liner problem is no where near as apparent as age of ultrons was but they are still there and can take you out of the movie at times part of the reason i loved panther was he was serious to a t and at times intimidating this is the darkest tony stark ever and i love it the movie makes you struggle with who is right between cap and tony and i love that the villain is actually interesting at least more interesting that malikith thats for sure go see this movie you will not regret it
May 6 2016,positive,wow best avengers movie so far and nice twist on the story from the comic book story
May 6 2016,positive,must watch   too good could be better  but overall a very very good movie   bvs and dc should seriously learn something from the marvel studio 
May 6 2016,positive,after the first hour and a half it was great
May 6 2016,positive,absolutely phenomenal superhero movie went there for a regular superhero flick came out sadhappy and everything in between very satisfying movie so many great characters lots of action ridiculous amounts of awesome
May 6 2016,positive,cap is probably my least favorite super hero in mcu but his last two movies are the strongest of em all glad we finally got the spidey we deserve kick ass movie
May 6 2016,positive,this would have to be the best super hero movie i have seen in stone time
May 6 2016,positive,civil war has awesome avenger action strong character interactions spidey and black panther were definitely the highlights of the film crossbones looked great but was wasted potential zemo another underdeveloped villain
May 6 2016,positive,perhaps the greatest super hero movie ever made  great story telling great fight scenes black panther  spiderman were amazing
May 6 2016,positive,wow this was just as amazing as the trailers portray it as new characters epic fight scenes and everything else youve come to expect from the mcu it is a bit long as theres a ton of backstory to get through and the introductions of various new characters i thought spideys intro scene was more fan service than anything else not knocking it or anything as this versionnow the third one was good but i felt like it killed the pace of the movie that would probably be one of the two things about civil war that i think make this a little less than perfect the other being helmut zemos characterwho sets up the whole conflict to begin with as i just didnt find him all that interesting of a villain the airport scene was one hell of an orgy of superhero action loved loved loved it and bringing in antman black panther and spiderman into the mix more than made up for the absence of thor and hulk the climatic battle was also great and memorable great movie even though it kinda felt like half of it was avengers 25 and the other half is an actual captain america sequel good job marvel
May 6 2016,positive,while this is not the best marvel film ever made in my opinion it still has all the qualities of a great summer blockbuster and one of the most actionpacked and hilarious action sequences i have seen in a long time
May 6 2016,positive,a lot of characters but the script holds up through it all this is definitely captain americas movie and chris evans does his job well at 25 hours long the pace slowed approaching the half point but things pick after all the character introductions
May 6 2016,positive,is it better than winter soldier no but it comes damn close    whereas winter soldier was a more focused and ultimately better and more intriguing story about captain america and his place in the modern world civil war is about how captain america and the rest of the avengers deals with the modern world how can superheroes be heroes when they often leave destruction in their wake how can superheroes make the world a better place when it is often their very nature that invites conflict as one of the characters excellently put it why do superheroes even bother being superheroes when the world itself often rejects them    these are questions that civil war raises and manages to answer satisfactory without being pretentious or heavy handed all the while still managing to succeed as a superhero film in fact the russos have managed to craft two movies so far that can stand as excellent films by themselves    yes at times it feels that it is juggling one too character set ups but the execution is so damn spot on that what was once distracting turns out to be worthwhile the film is bursting with fan service but none of it feels gratuitous or empty it is fun and in the end that is what matters fun this is the most fun i have had in cinemas in a long time and the bar is again raised for what superhero films can be they can be dark they can be serious they can be even gritty but they can still be fun    in the end civil war is a fantastic film and has me fully convinced that the avengers infinity war movies are in great hands
May 6 2016,positive,it was great movie had lots of action laughs and sides were taken its going to be such and big movie it was fantastic and fun and all the superheros were great even the new ones what side did you take i choose ironman is my superhero of choice go and see for sure and enjoy the ride
May 6 2016,negative,sleepy time enough said
May 6 2016,positive,at the top of their game true believer make mine marvel
May 6 2016,positive,the russos did so well making sure each character had their moment to shine but also telling a story that focuses on cap they also do a fantastic job at showing both sides of the conflict so when asked which side im on its difficult to choose because both sides are right and wrong oh and it also has one of the best fights ever shown in a superhero film i know i say this a lot about most of marvels films but this one for sure was something special best movie ever
May 6 2016,negative,must say my brother though he didnt love it liked it as for me give me liberty or give me death i prefer liberation from the marvel machine cranking out average children fodder which comic nerds devour im warning you bamboozled public save your money and spend it on something good and be happy
May 6 2016,positive,the movie was a good addition to the series it jumped around often the inclusion of spiderman was a bit much captain america 2 was better the theme of the internal struggles of the characters was well done
May 6 2016,positive,this movie was fantastic recaptures the feeling from the first avengers movie and maybe even better than guardians of the galaxy cant wait to see it again
May 6 2016,positive,a war about ideals that leads to wounding revelations too deep for even a superhero to ignore
May 6 2016,positive,captain america civil war makes great use of the copious amount of heroes in the film with a plot that challenges the audience moreso than previous marvel entries the film asks the audience to choose sides which creates interesting bits of tension the titular hero and iron man lead the film while black panther and spiderman add some fun to the mix however marvel is once again plagued by dutiful obligation sometimes these films become unable to stand on their own due the sheer amount of backstory amongst the several thousand sequels and other mcu films while hugely enjoyable and containing themes that stand out civil war never does anything groundbreaking in execution rating 74
May 6 2016,positive,really really good just more spiderman
May 6 2016,positive,another superhero behemoth that risks it all with multiple egos storylines and battles yet the russos hit a new record by stretching the limits of the genre without ripping the film apart it might not be innovative or convincingly answer its own ethical issues or offer an ending that lives up to its grandiose title but for the most part civil war is an ambitious and notable example of the everlasting power of the cinema of attractions
May 6 2016,positive,synder take lessons from this movie this is how superman vs batman should have been the continuation of the universe matures and blossoms brighter
May 6 2016,positive,its actually a lot of fun expect some twists and turns that look like they dont make sense but are still worked out and quite enjoyable
May 6 2016,positive,though it has its own problems like batman v superman captain america civil war pleasantly kills your time and offers an interesting premise and villain
May 6 2016,positive,it was alright had a lot of action but the story was ok not great i like the spiderman and black panther appearances
May 6 2016,positive,this movie blows away batman v superman hope youre listening dc this is how you make a real movie
May 6 2016,positive,just saw it its very good for what we expect from marvel funny predictable great management of so many characters and this spiderman is almost as good as toby mcguire almost loved black panther great fight scenes would i see it again nope will i watch batman v superman for the 9th time yes
May 6 2016,negative,i dont know if anybody was paying attention but this movie was a subliminal message about how the soldiers have post traumatic stress how some of them were forced to do things they dont want to do by the government gives these orders and then take the orders back and then twists it on them  this movie was a reality a what are us soldiers go through i wonder if anyone else picked up on that
May 6 2016,positive,fucking amazing     what else really needs to be said
May 6 2016,positive,probably the most serious of all the marvel films and maybe the best one yet
May 6 2016,positive,complex emotional treats its characters and audiences like adults and by the way awesome action
May 6 2016,positive,one of the better superhero films in recent memory with at least one great new character introduction and a decent plot  the primary driver of the story is character versus character rather than character versus cgi so i found that the film held my attention better than a lot of the big screen citysmashfests that have been plaguing theaters in the last decade    the fight choreography was a little frustrating due to excessive use of increased film speed but otherwise it was a decent superhero movie
May 6 2016,positive,so wellbalanced every character gets their moments and they dont feel crammed in or out of place and yet it still feels like a captain america movie because his viewpoint is front and center and fun take note dc
May 6 2016,neutral,just left a bad taste in my mouth
May 6 2016,positive,figured id mention that this is 10 times more interesting than dawn of justice the good guy vs good guy fight is just what i wanted and its another good step for the mcu
May 6 2016,positive,an awesome solid avenger movie  full review  
May 6 2016,neutral,good movie but nothing that you havent seen before still entertaining and keeps you engaged though    marvel has followed a simple plot line lately just make the biggest opponent the avengers facethemselves genius wow    look i get that it works but this movie didnt bring anything new to the table yet again we have someone pulling the strings and pitting these guys against each other like loki and ultron before them but with a different reasoning sure there is more explanation behind it more characters clear sidesbut apart from all that it was simply just entertaining and thats what marvel does well even if its just recycled and presented differently    i love captain america he did pretty much lead the role obviously because it is his movie technically but this movie pretty much was building on other smaller characters like widow antman vision and panther while introducing spidey to balance out the serious dark tone the film tried to capture    sure it sets up future films but why praise this movie for doing the exact same thing bvs did at a smaller scale two months ago but apparently was too much everything some people hated about bvs was even worse in this onebut we are giving marvel a pass just because its not dc come on    marvel did do a good job dont get me wrongbut they didnt take any risks or freedoms with this film it had a very predictable plot and subplot that most people will eat up because they are unfamiliar with marvel comics unlike dc where everyone knows whos who before the franchise was even thought of    sure this movie does a good job as a continuation of the marvel universe but it wasnt really something that builds captain america role like winter solider did but again was really just building the smaller characters
May 6 2016,positive,took my mom out for mothers day to see this an early gift to her and good lord it was amazing dont know how marvel is going to beat this and dc sure as hell has a huge deck stacked against them
May 6 2016,positive,a superhero movie that is so good it barely even needs villains sure it has them but when iron man and cap go at it well everyones favorite parts of team comic books is when the heroes get to fight each other this has that in spades the movie gives you a lot to think about too which side am i on am i even on a side     it is paced extremely well everyone gets great moments there are no cameos the heroes introduced or reintroduced are a big part of the movie nothing feels tacked on watch this dc and learn how to make something interesting wow just wow    there are a few articles out there that do compare this with batman vs superman they are correct in that there are some similarities the government doesnt trust super powered folks anymore the super powered folks are at odds with each other about it but that is where it ends there is nothing brain dead about this movie unlike batman vs superman which was clearly written backwards from plot point 1 batman and superman fight this had great build up and wonderful twists that made the big fight make sense about why it was happening you could feel the anger pain and love across both teams even as it happened it was like a large family having a huge back yard bbq brawl you know they love each other but most of them have some pretty deep rooted issues and this just cant be avoided anymore    go see this movie
May 6 2016,positive,1010 the best superhero movie ive seen since the first avengers movie the story doesnt follow the graphic novel but is still amazing with a great twist at the end and has some of the best action scenes ive seen in years i highly recommend this movie marvel has really nailed the dark and gritty feel without over doing  it
May 6 2016,positive,wow and wow  somehow marvel made each captain america  better than the previous one  usually its the opposite  this one was is in my top 5 of marvel movies cant really say a lot without giving up spoilers so i will just say definitely go see this movie i was afraid that their might be too many characters in this movie man was i wrong the fight scene at the airport has to be one of the best superhero fight scene to date  seeing black panther and spider man on the big screen was amazing this movie hits on all cylinders and goes beyond that  oh and there are 2 credits scenes at the end
May 6 2016,positive,captain america civil war is very close to being a masterpiece of its genre  from this writers perspective that is not hyperbole  the movie is at times both resonant and rousing both funny and gutwrenching and it showcases perhaps the ultimate summation of what the marvel cinematic universe is all about  it is nothing less than grand and thrilling popcorn cinema     following a collateral damageladen confrontation the avengers  led by steve rogerscaptain america chris evans  find themselves under intense scrutiny from the global community which results in the sokovia accords governing documents designed to bring the avengers under the sway of an oversight body  when cap refuses to play along  both for reasons of conscience and because hes hot on the trail of his old brainwashed friend bucky barnes sebastian stan aka the winter soldier  a divide grows with tony starkiron man robert downey jr  it quickly escalates into a fullon conflict which ensnares not just the avengers themselves but also a few new players such as black panther chadwick boseman and a young lad named peter parker tom holland a budding crime fighter who goes by the alias spiderman     the movies greatest achievement is the way it balances and does right by the huge number of characters  yes avengers age of ultron had a giant cast list and mostly made it work but civil war takes it to a whole other level  look at this roster captain america iron man spiderman black panther falcon black widow vision war machine antman hawkeye scarlet witch winter soldier these are monumental iconic heroes fully capable of headlining their own standalone films and yet they are woven together here with total dexterity and effortless ease by the filmmakers  each gets big amazing moments to shine and contribute and they each serve a function in the narrative theyre not just tossed in for the sake of it theyre involved for a reason and fans of the characters will not feel shortchanged by how they are utilized  and those are just the heroes  there are still even more key characters like thunderbolt ross crossbones sharon carter everett ross and the sinister zemo who seems to be pulling some strings from the shadows and whose ultimate motivations are genuinely compelling  it could have been so easy for the movie to feel overstuffed in the extreme but it never even comes close to that  the balance of characters is organic never forced and actually serves to underline the important position that captain america serves in the marvel cinematic universe this isnt just another avengers movie with a different title its caps story all the way well most of the way as the movie also gives tony stark his most compelling arc thus far too and everything is  in one way or another  filtered through him    captain america civil war represents nothing less than an extraordinary payoff to eight years of storytelling that began with iron man back in 2008 the film is emotionally resonant because it respects its characters respects their points of view and wants us  the audience  to feel the weight of their conflict and its repercussions  if you look at where tony stark was when we first met him or where steve rogers was you will see a pair of amazing character arcs that have led them to where we find them in this film  the reasons for their conflict make sense the compositions of their respective teams make sense and the movie goes to great lengths to justify  at every turn  everybodys actions on both philosophical and personalemotional levels     the movie also dares to suggest the possibility that steve rogers  until now the paragon of virtue and judgment  might not necessarily be as obviously in the right  he was surrounded by grey area in captain america the winter soldier but this time hes in that grey area making choices that are fully understandable but not necessarily ones that are immune to criticism  the film is balanced by tony starks position and the beauty of the thing is that both men are basically right in what they believe  just because the movie has the words captain america in the title doesnt mean that by default theyve turned tony into the antagonist which is refreshing  these are two characters who are grappling with the concept of responsibility and though theyre coming at it from different angles none of the characters are vilified or shown to be anything less than the heroes we know they are  heading into the third act the movie had me in an amazing place where i was rooting for both steve and tony but for different reasons which is a testament to the strength of the writing    not only does the film payoff everything thats been established about the characters of steve rogers and tony stark but it also delivers the spectacle youd expect from this genre it also sets up black panther and the new spiderman as compelling and exciting heroes going forward and it also continues the process of building towards the upcoming infinity war films which will bring together literally all the characters in the mcu and does so in ways that feel significantly less forced than in avengers age of ultron for example  a quick word about that action  there is a setpiece in here the big battle between all the heroes at an airport which has been teased a bit in the trailers that is absolutely stunning  its a legitimately astonishing sequence crammed full of both humor and intense drama and it is perhaps the purest expression of the promise of cinematic superhero action weve seen so far  not only is the choreography and staging of the action exemplary but it all lands with such impact because were invested in the characters on a deep level by this point      chris evans continues to find new and complex layers to explore with cap and his performance here is marked by the sense that hes carrying an enormous burden at almost all times  evans is excellent but it is robert downey jr who gets the storys real dramatic meat on which to chew and it represents his best work to date as tony stark he still brings the snark but  particularly towards the second half  theres a real wounded sensitivity that starts to creep in and when the movies most emotionally wrenching scene arrives downey absolutely kills it  and everybody else is great too  there are literally too many characters to just go down the line and list off all the actors but it can certainly be said that nobody comes anywhere close to phoning it in they all balance the sense of fun with the weight of the stakes  the major newcomers boseman and holland are instant home runs with their respective characters and i suspect most audiences will be excited at the prospect of their upcoming solo adventures     if a person wanted to nitpick stuff in the movie there are things that could be found but im not inclined to indulge that  captain america civil war is spectacularly entertaining top to bottom and it is the best marvel movie made to date
May 6 2016,positive,one of the best action packed funny movies ive seen in quite awhile
May 6 2016,negative,not horrible but not good a whole lot of praise over a whole lot of nothing very disappointed
May 6 2016,positive,loved l o v e d captain america civil war  heres the cliff notes version   dear batman vs superman while i didnt hate you and actually found you to be a much better film than critical response led me to believe civil war absolutely owned you in establishing a dramatically powerful confrontation between superpowered individuals dc take notes and adjust as necessary before the justice league rolls around   we finally have our absolutely perfect cinematic spiderman his appearance  which is substantial  is one of the highlights of the entire film spidey is was and always will be my favorite comic book hero i was literally giddy with joy during the airport set piece im super psyched and cant wait to see this incarnation of the webslinger in his first solo film   the aforementioned airport set piece is the greatest scene in any comic book film ever the standards have now been dialed up to eleven go watch it then come back and tell me with a straight face that statement is hyperbole   im so so happy the russos are helming the next avengers film civil war was everything age of ultron should have been but wasnt   this is not the avengers 3 the avengers are key to the plot and tony stark is a lead character but it is still first and foremost a captain america movie one that wonderfully calls back to not just winter soldier but ca the first avenger as well   civil war is better than winter soldier i never thought id write that about any comic book film   black panther  in and out of the costume  steals the movie every time hes on screen   don cheadle is still awesome   the russos are actually better at the rapid fire humor than joss whedon the writing in this movie is superb  five stars two big thumbs up go see it captain america civil war is fantastic
May 6 2016,positive,similar to the previous captain america movies this one did not disappoint its full of action and political intrigue this time it delves into a darker realm of the psyche regarding loss and regret the main questions seem to be what do you hold dear and what are you willing to lose     i knew it had achieved something great when i saw the distraught look on my wifes face during one scene late in the movie it made us laugh it made us sad it made us yearn for resolution  all the makings of a great movie
May 6 2016,positive,this is it the first 5 star superhero movie since the dark knight if you want gritty crimethriller awesomeness tdk remains the best of all time however as far as a marvel film goes this is the top incredible action deep thought and maturity bursts of absolute hilarity  this movie has it all the big action sequence is incredible to behold and everyone gets to shine without this movie feeling overstuffed there are some tiny gripes hawkeye and spiderman feel kind of stuffed in for example however in terms of the latter this had the same effect as days of future past did that i know a guy moment that seems a bit random yet that guy is amazing and hilarious there isnt one gripe that could even remove half a star off of my review this movie is pure joy
May 6 2016,positive,dare i say it  best comic book movie ever great action and humor great story new characters totally awesome by the way great take on spiderman smokin hot aunt may a must see in the theaters
May 6 2016,positive,this movie was amazing i was even sad it had ended
May 6 2016,positive,civil war delivered on its promise of course there are some issues but the overall package was nearly perfect  quite possibly the best superhero flick yet
May 6 2016,positive,i dont undestand what was so special about this movie honestly weve seen the story where the bad guy tries to split the team up from within loki already did it i personally thought the movie would have been better without the need to try to cram a bad guy into it somewhere the movie jumps around a lot and kind of expects you to know a lot about the black panther its amazing to me how this movie is getting praised while batman v superman got destroyed and its basically the exact same movie its a good movie dont get me wrong its just not anywhere near the best marvel movie or the best captain america movie
May 6 2016,positive,its good but the reasoning behind everything is so stupid cant balance between humor and emotion and a majority of the action sequences suffers from the extreme shaky camera constant cuts and the most insulting thing is 0 risk taken you can find everything a mile away and no character is really put in danger the only good thing out of this movie is spiderman
May 6 2016,positive,it was better than i expected i guess it wasnt as terrible as antman or age of ultron but as a film its really not much more than a showcase of the characters and set pieces the plot is still pretty contrived and i didnt really feel that the motivations of the characters were genuine seeing as most of them just change their minds on the whole killing each other thing whenever the script says they have to    but as far as showcases go civil war did have some pretty good scenes the fights were pretty coherent this time around even though they were big and flashy which i guess we can thank the russo bros for because they seem to be good at that shit i guess i liked spiderman ok even though hes so absurdly out of place in this movie and the entire thing was just a big advertisement for new spidey    most of the characters in the movie really didnt need to be there and case in point most of them seriously show up in time for the big airport fightaka the scene the movie was made for and then exit about as gracefully as they entered and the big mastermind plot of the film is honestly secondary to the whole superhero fight thing to the point where zemo might as well have not even been in it     on top of all that the interaction between the characters really felt wooden for most of the film they kept trying to do the trademark marvel humor thing in the middle of scenes where it didnt fit and as a result most of the humor fell completely flat not only to me but even the rest of the people in the theater didnt seem to laugh at the designated spots however unlike say antman where i cant remember a single genuine laugh civil war did eventually manage to deliver some true comedy with the can you move your seat up line so its not completely hopeless    overall its a pretty stupid movie but its a pretty damn competently made stupid movie i dont feel like my time was wasted on it but it still suffers from marvels escalation fetish wherein each new movie has to be bigger and more epic and feature more characters than it truly needs i thought this movie would be the one to overdo it but it managed to stay just shy of being bloated
May 6 2016,positive,truly amazing movie  one i will see multiple times  perfect movie
May 6 2016,positive,i thought the movie was pretty good and i grade it a b unfortunately i read too many reviews in advance so i was expecting this to be better than it was that made it a little disappointing for me this was the exact opposite effect of bvs i saw so many horrible reviews i was expecting that to suck so i was pleasantly surprised when i liked it a lot     the problem with civil war was i feel like ive seen this movie before its conflicts go back to the first avengers movie so whereas the fights between the protagonists in that movie were awesome the fights in this movie were nothing new just extra heroes     on the positive side captain america is always one of my favorites from when i was a kid he was really good falcon was much more interesting than i thought he would be the sbarky downey quips were kept down which is good since that is getting played out for once black widow didnt have any sexual tension with one of her male teammates she and hawkeye and falcon were  excellent black panther was interesting and his appearance didnt  feel forced  i liked seeing spiderman but the way that was handled was both a positive because spidey is always awesome and a negative see below    on the negative side the action sequences were just okay they werent great or even really good they were okay the airport fight scene was not as good as it was cracked up to be though it had its moments spiderman and ant man were kind of shoehorned into the story they were both kind of like the flash scene from batman v superman in that they were forced into the plot for sake of expanding the character frame of the movie however since marvel wasnt trying to kick start a franchise the resulting roughness was a little less necessary but spidey is still awesome     my kids liked it pretty well and the general consensus was an 8 or 9 out of 10    in comparison to other superhero movies it was about as good as spider man 2 ant man batman batman returns batman forever captain america the winter soldier the amazing spiderman it was better than spiderman 3 avengers age of ultron captain america 1 the incredible hulk hulk any thor movie iron man 2 or 3 superman iii and iv amazing spiderman 2 any xmen movie and batman and robin it was not as good as superman 1 or 2 any nolan batman movie spiderman 1 or avengers    to compare it to the recent dc universe movies it was almost but not quite as good to me as batman v superman it did not have the rough hewn edges of the batman v superman movie and it was better in character development but the action sequences were a little off i go see these movies to watch superheroes using superpowers so i want the action to be excellent and it wasnt it wasnt terrible but it wasnt great either i would say man of steel which i really liked was better than this but not by a huge margin i think i just prefer the more serious tone of the dc movies and the lighthearted marvel tone is wearing thin for me     in other words like i said i always feel like i have seen the marvel movies before it was still entertaining it was pretty good i was not blown away but that is not necessary to make a movie worth seeing your kids will like it
May 6 2016,positive,awesome in every way love it sorry ironman but its team cap for me all the way
May 6 2016,positive,i could probably watch this movie 20 million times and id love it even more each time i am just so proud of the film and i didnt make it i want to buy the bluray already please yeah ok i know i need to wait 
May 6 2016,positive,the absolute best and most inspired part of the captain america trilogy that puts a fitting bookend to one of the better marvel multiparty sagas and only makes one shudder with anticipation what the next avengers sequel will have to offer
May 6 2016,positive,incredible marvel knows how to make a great superhero movie and did it again
May 6 2016,negative,good visuals and fight scenes iron man was an ass both cap and iron man petty most concerned with their friends or their mamma what the hell turned our heroes into wussies
May 6 2016,positive,incredible movie marvel continues to thrive with their films frequently outdoing themselves believe all of the hype definitely one of the best comic book movies of all time fantastic story well written charactersdialogue and tons of fan service
May 6 2016,positive,easily the best movie of the mcu and maybe even the best comic book movie ever made
May 6 2016,positive,after a lackluster initial installment in the franchise captain america surprisingly set the standard for marvel super hero movies with the winter soldier civil war ups the ante once again raising the standard not just for the marvel cinematic universe but the super hero genre as a whole its fun fast energetic and full of all the action and welltimed comedy that we love about comic book movies
May 6 2016,negative,the worst line isi can do this all day
May 6 2016,positive,best marvel movie so farlooking forward to black panther movie
May 6 2016,positive,the best mcu movie yet and that is saying a lot
May 6 2016,positive,this should have been avengers 2 though it couldnt have happened without the events of that movie occuring and they finally get spiderman right
May 6 2016,positive,i rarely give a 5 star rating but this movie exceeded my expectations   good story good characters new characters and it was not all comical and silly like past avengers movies  hope you see it and more important hope you enjoy watching it
May 6 2016,positive,i felt that this movie was exceptional and has definitely proven marvel knows what it takes to make a superhero movie i didnt think they could top let alone keep up to par with the winter soldier and they proved me wrong im glad they finally have spiderman in their universe spiderman was portrayed as he should be and black panther outdone my expectations i loved it to the end and want disappointed i will be going to see this film again and be just as happy and excited as i was the first time
May 6 2016,positive,can marvel do no wrong the russo brothers nail it again
May 6 2016,positive,i wont call it greatest superhero movie ive ever seen but again marvel does a great job of storytelling and giving each character the right lines and space for you to appreciate their space on the screen  very excited about the role black panther plays in this movie and the spiderman addition is beautifulso is aunt may flipped the script on that one  still couldnt give it 4stars on first viewing in regular imax maybe i feel differently in 3d you tell me  overall 2 thumbs up
May 6 2016,positive,perfect comic book movie
May 6 2016,negative,i love the marvel movies and this movie is absolutely the only one that i wish i hadnt seen  it seems to be well liked by other reviewers i dont see how  my ten year old son who is usually riveted to the screen was bored an hour in and asking how much longer until it was over  in spite of its nearly two and a half hours it was only fractionally as funny and half as entertaining as other marvel productions  spiderman i believe played the part of the shark and this movie jumped right over him  we usually have a great discussion in the car about and in anticipation of the next movie  this time nobody really cared what happens next  the old proven formula was much better
May 6 2016,positive,lots of fun did a great job w many characters and surprisingly it never really felt like too much
May 6 2016,positive,marvel shows dc how it should be done
May 6 2016,positive,extremely well written directed and performed  dramatic emotional and action packed a thrill ride for all
May 6 2016,positive,this was such an emotionally dramatic movie that also had its well written humor the russo brothers really know how to handle all this different characters with different agendas and beliefs all i gotta say is that this is a fantastic movie favorite marvel movie for me with winter soldier a close second
May 6 2016,negative,too many eye rolling really moments ruined the suspended disbelief for me
May 6 2016,positive,which side will you be on as team cap goes against team iron man in this amazing flick vibranium no vibration in this next mcu chapter as it continues to set the standard
May 6 2016,positive,oooo its good  im team cap
May 6 2016,positive,soooooo good see wb and dc this is how you have two iconic heroes battle it out
May 6 2016,negative,it was action action action little or no plot why did they bring in a new baby spiderman didnt make sense not a very good ending either too long for what it was
May 6 2016,positive,you just need to see the freakin movie thats all i gotta say
May 6 2016,positive,awesome just what youd hope for and more
May 6 2016,positive,this was the best marvel film ive ever seen the action and fight scenes  are exciting and second to none  great storyline  i was incredibly surprised with this installment five stars
May 6 2016,positive,its really awesome   based to the expected core heeds us with spideys action and antmans tricky
May 6 2016,negative,the title civil war is simply a suggestion the film is nowhere near as emotionally gripping as the comics however the ending was very emotional
May 6 2016,positive,civil war reminds us its ok to enjoy a few laughs even while diabolical villains plot doom outraged citizens demand accountability and your best pal mistrusts you
May 6 2016,positive,i saw it was goodplain 910 but being a fan i thought they could have done more didnt really feel like big marvel movie compared to others and after that ending i feel like the next couple of marvel movies might not make their expectations due to this downward slope i can see
May 6 2016,positive,civil war is the best marvel movie in the mcu yet it is the most emotional p thrilling exciting exhilarating marvel movie yet loads and blasts of exciting action and one of the best stories that plays effects of the past movies  97
May 6 2016,positive,very probably the best superhero film yet made  this one will have great legs
May 6 2016,positive,my problem with civil war is the third act the villain even has an interesting motivation but is told in a too expository and the final which only proves how disney put his finger on this film not to mention that all the political discussion of the saga that is very well suited in the first act is lost in the course of the film and he had seen only a blockbuster the fact is that the film is extremely fun the characters are well developed the action sequences are innovative and have excellent introductions to this universe that marvel built the black panther is certainly the best arch there and the spiderman its all i as a big fan of the character wanted to see hes young hes funny he has a nice uniform and is still responsible best character adapted to theaters today overall i was a little disappointed but nothing like age of ultron or the unpardonable iron man 3 i just think it should have been less ambitious and have made a movie just the captain to close the bow with bucky for what reasons captain america 2 is the best marvel because it is innovative and you just do not expect anything from him then he gives you that punch in the belly and you to finish the film is thinking i continued but civil war enters the top 5 of marvel but not the best studio my note to civil war is 8
May 6 2016,positive,great movie it did a wonderful job setting up the future of more marvel films and felt like a complete story on its own unlike batman v superman
May 6 2016,positive,truly awesome tough this is how you do it dc
May 6 2016,positive,a spectacular and sensational superhero film in every sense of the word
May 6 2016,positive,more of a full on avengers movie rather than a standalone captain america movie and it was pretty darn good i found myself torn between team cap and team iron man but in the end i kinda think captain america is kind of a douche for sticking up for bucky barnes
May 6 2016,positive,perfection from start to finish the story special effects and action sequences were all firing on every cylinder better than any of the other recent marvel movies it even manages to cram lots of characters in without feeling forced everything seems to flow so naturally and effortlessly that i wonder if subsequent marvel movies will feel like a letdown it even manages to be emotionally involving    id like to imagine zack snyder sitting in the audience and saying to himself oh i see what i did wrong now
May 6 2016,positive,team spidey team spidey eek
May 6 2016,positive,amazing exceeds all expectations 
May 6 2016,positive,it was watchable good cg and action not a blockbuster but ok
May 6 2016,positive,solid liked that it was grittierless glib than the last one  dragged a little in the middle  i liked batman vs superman better but still it was worth seeing
May 6 2016,positive,makes up for the disappointing age of ultron the airport scene is fantastic might just be my favourite marvel movie and definitely the best in the captain america trilogy spidey was my fave 
May 6 2016,positive,was even better than i thought it would be the cap movies have not disappointed
May 6 2016,positive,awesome flick just over 2 hours but moves so fast it feels like 45 minutes teamironman
May 6 2016,positive,awesome fun movie great reason to have stark and cap go toe to toe spidey antman and black panther stole the show when they were in it  the villain was also amazing quite possibly their best one yetand simply because he was written wellexcept for one issue i had      the only reason this wasnt 5 stars to me was the plot holeparadox to the villains plan  i wont post any spoilers but lets just say he had no reason to search for the specific thing he was searching for without already knowing what it waswhich in turn made it pointless that he search for it
May 6 2016,neutral,very perplexing  i saw this opening night with high expectations knowing the civil war comic storyline  there was certainly a lot of action but very little substance despite what i was reading from other reviews  there were way to many characters vying for screen time and the new spiderman was just obnoxious  at the end of the movie i realized that after two and a half hours nothing really happened  it is always a pleasure to see stan lee in his cameo though  as a fan of superhero movies id give this a b with very little repeat viewability  it would be hard to sit through again
May 6 2016,negative,all the action was there but the logic and the heart was not had some good moments and characters but the movie came off as formulaic and unsatisfying fluff
May 6 2016,positive,as usual marvel is just more evolved with how to tell super hero stories this is a excellent film thats setting up a theme that will last for a few more avenger movies
May 6 2016,positive,marvel just totally ripped out dcs balls like for good and the dbox motherfucker
May 6 2016,positive,saw it in xd 3d and was great   spiderman and black panther worked very well in their intros   airport battle best ever  go see it
May 6 2016,positive,this was a cap movie that didnt loose much from its sequel which was youre belief in the cap the only doubts i had was who was playing spiderman and the costume only thing about the spidy story wrong was his over attractive aunt thinking about it you feel a lot of wrong with that a let down in it is the villains plan all in all the movie itself was worth watching
May 6 2016,positive,amazing one hell of a ride
May 6 2016,positive,marvel and the russo brothers have perfected the right formula for a superhero movie dc comics needs just pack it in and go home
May 6 2016,positive,at times feeling more like avengers 25 captain america civil war is a funfilled ride through the mcu  the russo bros have done an amazing job at the helm deftly managing so many characters while keeping us tightly focused on the story  its hard to do a nonspoilers review so i will settle for  see this movie
May 6 2016,positive,this is a perfect movie go see it
May 6 2016,positive,one of the best marvel movies ive seen
May 6 2016,positive,i thought  it was pretty good with some new characters in the fold
May 6 2016,positive,great movie very entertaining with a good and convoluted plot this is more than your average super hero movie where emotions and humor are not forgotten
May 6 2016,positive,hands down one of the best marvel movies to come out
May 6 2016,positive,just wow i loved how all the heroes got so serious and just made one think deeper than they ever have before for a film of this genre the new addition of black panther was a standout if this is the next gen of how to make a superhero film they have my theatergoing dollar
May 6 2016,positive,the marvel cinematic universe has given me new life bruh
May 6 2016,positive,this movie was good fun and i cared about the characters all of them fight scenes awesome  no stupid batman issues
May 6 2016,positive,most fun in a movie in a long time washed foul taste of bvs out of my system
May 6 2016,positive,the russo brothers have brought a merely perfect movie that brings all the elements of drama and action that mcu fans want to see with amazing performances from rdj and chris evans there is nothing wrong with this movie
May 6 2016,positive,marvel proves yet again why so many people love these films    im a huge tobey maguire fan but i gotta say the new spidey did a great job and im excited for his solo film    overall you cant help but to be at the edge of your seat with so many essential characters from marvel incredible performance 5 stars hands down
May 6 2016,positive,amazing movie i enjoyed the dialogue and complexity to the storyline just as much as all the action this is an incredibly smart thoughtprovoking and intense piece of cinema showing just how good the writers directors and producers of this series are
May 6 2016,positive,had action comedy and dramaloved it
May 6 2016,positive,mcu phase 3 kicks off with the heroes at loggerheads over government interference into their activities without spoiling too much it was a very satisfying continuation of the storylines from both winter soldier and age of ultron  you may get a bit lost if you havent seen those films prior hard for me to pick this one over winter soldier or the original avengers but no doubt that it deserves to be mentioned in the same breath my favourite moment antman vs spiderman  nuff said
May 6 2016,positive,kind of a jumbled up mess not nearly as good as the winter soldier  the whole premise is a pretty weak justification to have meaningless fight sequences
May 6 2016,positive,a supremely satisfying superheroes movie the central conflict of the film is refreshing the villains motive and method of sabotage is interesting there are no generic minions dispatching as climax and perhaps most importantly it wasnt completely idiotic like guardians of the galaxy
May 6 2016,positive,greatt moovie wow moovie of the year i think
May 6 2016,positive,thrilling exciting kinetic funny surprising and at times heartbreaking all this adds up to what is imho the best mcu movie yet while this is the third captain america movie it plays out much like an avengers film and yet keeps cap front and center alongside chris evans robert downey jr gives his best performance as tiny starkiron man in fact everyone is awesome in this movie it may seem that there are too many characters but everyone gets their shining moment no one gets shafted the two newest additions black panther and spiderman fits in like a glove regarding the latter tom holland killed it as peter parkerspiderman and is probably my favorite portrayal of the character on the big screen    the civil war part of the movie feels earned as everything that has built up over the course of the past 8 years finally comes to a head i was firmly on team cap going in but found myself flip flopping as both sides had valid points should the avengers answer to governing bodies that may have their own hidden agendas or should the remain autonomous with no oversight the movie gives no definitive answer but it does change the dynamics of the team moving forward    in the end captain america civil war continues marvel studios winning streak by giving us a crowd pleaser that also elicits a wide range of emotions and leaves us looking forward to see what happens next    oh as with all marvel studios films there are 2 end credit scenes one mid credits and one post credits both are worth staying for
May 6 2016,positive,the characters are well integrated into the movie and believably motivated and the action sequences are amazing spiderman steals his scenes still its painful to watch your heroes beat each other bloody cap ii was the better movie
May 6 2016,positive,hands down best captain america movie best avengers movie best marvel movie and just overall one of the best movies ive ever seen it does everything it tries to do perfectly everything come beautifully together at the end in an epic welldirected actionpacked finale it is just that good  rating 1110 no serious go watch this movie now
May 6 2016,positive,would have been 5 stars if it wasnt for aunt may
May 6 2016,positive,great movie a must see whether youre a fan or not you will enjoy this movie
May 6 2016,positive,this story is particularly good and interesting these characters are all well developed by now and they have built this commodore that it almost makes you feel its unbreakable and they are the ultimate heroes the writers did a great job in weaving a tale that delved into much more depth of each characters personal journey conflicts and struggles that will eventually pit them against each other having seen all the previous movies will definitely make it easier to follow as their stories are intertwined in one way or another they also introduced a new character  the black panther i believe he will make a great stand alone series in the future a refreshed and younger spiderman was also introduced aside from comic relieve i didnt feel he was really necessary but it is scheduled to be the next franchise in line so it made sense that they included the character as with all the other marvel movies the special effects and sequences makes it worth while to see it on the big screen
May 6 2016,positive,best marvel film yet teamcap
May 6 2016,positive,hands down best marvel movie since the 1st avengers may even be better than that one go see it
May 6 2016,positive,i admit im not a big fan of the heroes fighting each other  i dont need internal drama and struggle  just give me a big bad to fight and good verses evil  that said the comic this film was inspired by was still entertaining and they do a great job translating it to the big screen  paul rudd as usual steals the movie and theres a great intro to a new character to the marvel film universe  i do have one major problem though it seems with each marvel film we have to up the profanity  my 8year old is dying to see this but hell have to wait a couple of years for something that could have easily been avoided
May 6 2016,positive,captain americacivil war is an amazing film with minor flaws throughout i strongly recommend seeing this movie it is the best of the mcu so far
May 6 2016,positive,outrageously good movie 2nd best superhero movie i saw story was good action was off the chain  a lot of it
May 6 2016,negative,am i missing something 2 12 hours that i will never get back do yourselves a favour and take a book so you at least get some kind of story
May 6 2016,positive,best way to summarize this is that its like a very yummy buffet in vegas  its not quite the fine dining artsy movies and its not a quick drive thru type of movie  everything tastes pretty good but there are some things that are a bit drawn out and some things that makes you wonder if the writers stuck that scene in just for that extra ooommphf but in the end you are satisfied and you will come back for seconds later on because it was just an overload of comic book kickassery      comparison to another movie  empire strikes back  sometimes literally    best scene  non  spoiler best group fight scene since lord of the rings return of the king  it was epic    lots of emotion lots of heart you feel for the characters and appreciate the gravity of all of it  something that another movie tried to encompass with a martha scene and that didnt work too well
May 6 2016,positive,great action cuts fantastic direction marvel is finally headed towards
May 6 2016,positive,absolutely fantastic movie  its action from start to finish and every character entertains  its more an avengers movie than a captain america onebut who cares
May 6 2016,positive,there isnt a grade scale with a number that reaches high enough to be given to this movie sublime in every form
May 6 2016,positive,i loved it  this is what a superhero flick should be  dc take note
May 6 2016,positive,definitely one of the best if not the best superhero movies i have ever seen
May 6 2016,positive,superb addition to the mcu id almost say flawless apart from a tiny dodgy cgi moment but thats easily ignored when you take everything else into the equation
May 6 2016,neutral,yes yes its all very spectacular but there are stella artois adverts with more plot fun but running on empty apart from the spidey gags which worked quite well a 250m budget and might as well be straighttodvd
May 6 2016,positive,i dare someone to change my mind i instantly wanted to watch it again spiderman has never been so damn perfect d
May 6 2016,positive,captain america civil war is that uncommon superhero film that doesnt pound you down with constant activity or more regrettable yet the standard tedious procession of savvy ass wisecracksso dont forget to watch the super heroesand you can watch here the full movie
May 6 2016,positive,watched it on thu nightits one of the best movies from marvel action sequences are too goodspiderman is really goodblack panther awesome
May 6 2016,positive,better then both avengers films combined enjoyed the new spiderman and black panther but thats about it no real villain here like always for  marvel would have been a great time to bring back red skull but oh well bvs was way better
May 6 2016,positive,greatest movie ever
May 6 2016,positive,awesomeness written all over it 
May 6 2016,positive,loved the movie black panther is sick
May 6 2016,positive,well done movie i recommend highly
May 6 2016,positive,this mightjust mightbe my new favourite mcu movie
May 6 2016,negative,saw it this afternoon best way to sum it up is that halfway through the movie people began talking about other things the three college aged guys in front of me were talking about the nba playoffs  why  the movie is boring it is blah a typical story of late by marvel  not much of one and bad special effects after reading the reviews thought this was the best ever  sorry you will be bored too much screen time for too many characters that you dont care about marvel has lost its way since avengers 1
May 6 2016,positive,full of action special effects and deep character development downey is great
May 6 2016,positive,when i first heard about this movie i assumed it would be stupid when i saw the most recent preview i became interested plus i can never leave a movie like this unseen i can say that this movie had some good action scenes and was a good movie all in all it certainly made up for the last avengers movie anyone who has seen any of the avengers captain america and iron man movies should see this
May 6 2016,positive,captain america civil war is what dc probably was hoping for when they thought up the idea to have batman face superman luckily ironman vs captain america wasnt resolved by having their mothers share the same name oh man does that scene still has me laughing hint it wasnt supposed to be a funny scene civil war instead has the heros face off in a political thriller that brings back fan favorites while also introducing new characters and reintroduces spiderman and his not so old aunt may that had to be tony starks idea civil war will please any fan of the marvel universe unless your personal favorites are thor and hulk in that case youre just out of luck for the rest of us civil war is the perfect way to cap off the captain america trilogy
May 6 2016,positive,when the actions of the avengers in the previous films have gone too far governments decide that the team needs to be put in check they propose that all super heroes register for an act that will restrict them from going into action unless they are called upon this splits the team up and an all out war begins stark leads one side while rogers leads the other       the story is far from a by the number comic book film because of the conflicting ideas between both rogers and stark this is a major strength because i dont know whos idea of how the team should operate is better they both bring an excellent point to the table rogers believes that the avengers should be allowed to operate freely while stark thinks that they should be held accountable for their actions and under government regulation       the acting is also very good everyone from the previous films takes the experience they gained and use it to put on an energized thrill ride filled with breath taking action that will leave you wanting more and wondering whats next tom holland is easily the best spiderman while toby maguire was a great spiderman he was a dull peter parker with andrew garfield being the complete opposite holland is thankfully the best of both       when a movie has as many characters as civil war it runs the risk of being unfocused its a good thing that marvel has experience dealing with this potential problem and its applied to civil war with all of these characters in the same movie civil war does an excellent job at staying focused and giving each character a chance to shine it also remembers to make sure that captain america gets more of that than the rest but most films with this many characters forget to develop at least one or two and civil war is no exception frustratingly in this case its the main villain he appears throughout the film but he is poorly developed and it feels like he is just there because its a super hero film       action is a difficult genre to film you need a dedicated and talented team civil war has exactly that in the directing of brothers anthony and joe ruso every shot is perfectly framed and lit editing is also key when filming action and civil war is a textbook example on how to do it the film only goes from one shot to the next whenever there is a better shot and most of the time there is       despite the poorly developed villain captain america civil war is everything that batman v superman should have been the story is excellent the acting is very good the film remains focused the editing is great and the action is amazing it is easy to say that civil war is this years best comic book movie and marvels phase 3 is off to an excellent start
May 6 2016,positive,amazing i thought with such a large ensemble it would be too crowded of a story but it wasnt people tend to forget how amazing the graphics are because they are so spoiled  so good ant man and spider man where great and very comical 25 hrs and it was entertaining the whole ride black panther was also pretty awesome marvel is killing it right now
May 6 2016,positive,captain america civil war 3d  the dynamically illustrated pages of the comic books from my youth were fully realized on the big screen in this superhero flick better than ever personally i didnt feel this was a better movie than batman v superman dawn of justice it was different but marvelous in its own way it had humor clever actions sequences surprising plot twists and a bit of a rebellious edge to it even though i think this film was great it actually made me appreciate batman v superman even more although captain america had enthralling action set pieces with tricky camera moves batmans cinematography focused more on artistic visual design with color and light captain americas crowdpleasing characters ague about the politics of a government justice system while batmans downbeat characters battle over the philosophy of what it means to be a just citizen the quieter moments of dialogue in captain america were peppered with humorous jabs at each others egos while the conversations in batman were peppered with witty dialogue loaded with social commentary different but not better than its rival less cerebral but more fun for sure
May 6 2016,positive,disneymarvel brings captain america civil war to theatres with a tremendous amount of star power marketing and expectations in the wake of the critical fumble of another comic bookbased squabble movie as well as coming off the successes of the winter soldier and avengers age of ultron captain america and company have some mighty big shoes to fill     as televised the film is everything a summer blockbuster should be but to add to this the film is also one that is intelligently crafted and narrated in a voice that is mature insightful and honest the russo brothers retain their knack for balanced storytelling by throwing in truly emotional weight into a script that is engaging and exciting virtually all of the characters receive a fair bit of shine in civil war as was the case in the avengers even the newcomers to the mcu black panther spiderman are treated to a reasonable amount of depth and backstory to justify their involvement in the conflict marvels flare for wholesome laughter and humour does not take away from the significance of the conflict at hand it breaks the tension when there is tension to be broken detractors of marvels style of cinematic experience forget that the jokes and punch lines dont come at inopportune moments theyre there to enhance the fun of going to the theatre     with a running time of 147 minutes civil war is just as long as the aforementioned batman v superman but without the dead space and lulls that made bvs feel long as a movie that pushes 25 hours the story takes many turns and focuses and refocuses on varying standpoints which can make it a bit jarring and difficult to perceive the larger picture some have criticized the title for its emphasis on captain america when the film is the obvious successor to avengers age of ultron but does that preclude the fact that at its core the film continuously encircles the decisions of captain america to guide its narrative yes tony stark is the other half of the civil war coin yes many of the characters introduced and made relevant in age of ultron are now front and centre in this film yes spiderman is kind of shuttled in unnecessarily and then proceeds steals away with the sequence in which he is featured but cap is everpresent throughout this tale and it is his relationship with both james bucky barnes and tony stark that gives rise to the story and its eventual conclusion the russo brothers have come up with a true sequel to the winter soldier while not discrediting or neglecting the events of age of ultron this rather large task needed to be handled skillfully otherwise it would have ended up as another avengers movie and it can be confidently stated that they did just that they told a captain america story with essentially the largest supporting case of any superhero film    though the film is not without its minor flaws it does give moviegoers a glimpse of what may be possible in terms of bringing together a large cast of characters portrayed by equally large hollywood names all the while backed by one of the largest media conglomerates in the world the film is a spectacle and a rollercoaster in every sense of that metaphor the ups and downs come in the form of rising and falling action emotional engagement and playful vs serious tones i believe hollywood will be hardpressed to produce another summer blockbuster this year that overall is as gratifying as captain america civil war
May 6 2016,positive,packed theater with adults at the end of the movie these adults were children clapping and cheering    the movie was a blast i had a great time watching it i have to admit it is not what i expected good and bad dont get me wrong i had a blast with this flick but there are a few things that frustrated me very minor things but the only major one is where is the villain zemo was a joke of a character if this movie had a real baron zemo i would had come out of that theater with the need to change my underoos but the lack of a real villain took away some of the edge and purpose of the conflict so they just fight because they disagree on the toppings they want on their pizza the movie is inspired by the comics but it is not like the comics reason im complaining why not make this more of a larger scheme were the avengers fighting is just part of a major evil plan by zemo still the problems between captain america and iron man are deep rooted and the last twist at the end gives the whole fight an edge and meaning not to mention the whole movie is pretty dramatic for a comic book movie this could be the best superhero movie ever made    i was delighted by all the characters cap and iron man were my favorites people say spidey and panther were the best nah i never cared much for tony stark before but in this movie i definitely enjoyed his character 100 and understand his point of view on everything im still with cap all the way but tonys choices now make sense to me strangely this is the first time i saw stark as a human being and not as a rich asshole with the world at his finger tips he even appears to be like a father to some steve rogers is a simple yet complex character he thinks like a military man and has a heart of gold this creates so much chaos in his life i love cap because i can relate to him of all characters spiderman was great at first when he appears i was like where is his bottle and bib but in seconds he won me best spidey ever put on the screen hands down im very excited to see homecoming im guessing im not as impressed as others by spidey because he is so young and i cannot relate to him it is like watching a little nephew or brother get into adventures unlike the other characters that are all around my age black panther bucky scarlet witch antman and hawkeye were great falcon was so cool my least favorite would be vision he is meh he is too powerful for this plot and unbalanced in the whole dilemma the airport scene oh god reminded me of playing with my action figures when i was little it was phenomenal    i cant say more about the movie because i would get into spoilers and you guys aint here for that see it im watching it again in a few days grin emoticon the people that would not enjoy this movie are the hardcore dc fanatics jealous because this is how you do a versus movie or people who are dead inside and dont care for superheroes on the screen    best superhero trilogy
May 6 2016,positive,civilwar is a great movie with a great cast with a story exactly like the one from bvs    however other than the action scenes it is virtually everywhere when it comes to directing and about 90 removed from the actual civil war story arc marvel made a great movie about great characters played by a great cast and decided to dump the comic book in the trash    if you didnt like batman vs superman there is no logical reason to like civil war more im going to take a line from all of the bvs reviews and call this movies attempt at a comic book humorless bland and uninspired  marvel had the opportunity to take one of my favorite marvel comic arcs second only to world war hulk and make it come to life instead they took the title and flushed the subject matter down the toilet    baron zemo though acted well was a completely different character from his comic book alter ego and people will love him even though they hated eisenbergs luthor for the same exact thing    i was really hoping that the trailers werent giving us the full picture but unfortunately they did what was a global conflict in the comics is degraded to a parking lot brawl in the movie and most of the most memorable characters from the conflict arent even featured at all    as far as technical arguments go some of the cgi was deeply frustrating and honestly unacceptable which is a small problem i had with batman vs superman as well but what occured in bvs only once occurs pretty much every time spiderman or falcon are on the screen in civil war  chris evans and rdj are still the best parts of the mcu outside of ruffalos hulk but guess where hes at    not in this movie    marvel made a good popcorn movie but as a comic book movie they fell flat on their faces if you are a fan of the mcu you will fall for this movie hook line and sinker if you are a reader of the subject material you will walk out shaking your head    however ultimately everything everyone hated about bvs they will love about this movie and i guess that is just the world we live in    6510    ps peter parker was literally perfect literally
May 6 2016,positive,okay i saw captain america or was that the avengers seemed more like an avengers movie anyways it was an awesome movie it kind of worries me because when the new avengers movie comes out they have to top this movie it will be interesting if it could be done
May 6 2016,positive,i caught this movie last night and this might be one of best marvel movies so far i will definitely will be going back to catch again i love spiderman but i have to admit the antman stole the show
May 6 2016,positive,phase three of the marvel cinematic universe kicks off with a bang    ive been a big fan of the marvel cinematic universe ever since its inception and have stuck with it seeing almost all of them in theaters the movies themselves have their ups and downs teetertottering between genuine character developing storylines and mindnumbing summer popcorn action this movie im glad to say focuses on the mcus character development and is an improvement on the semidisappointing avengers age of ultron    the positives one big positive i had with the movie was the introduction to the new characters specifically the two new heroes black panther and spiderman i felt as if both black panther and spiderman were great additions to the universe and did not feel shoehorned in at all tom holland absolutely killed it as spiderman im extremely excited to see his standalone movie because he already has me rethinking my favorite spiderman portrayal another positive i had with this movie was its fight scenes the russos focused in on more sticktotheground handtohand combat much like they did for the winter soldier rather than big cgi explosionfests the airport scene which is shown pretty heavily in the trailers but doesnt spoil any of the good parts is probably my favorite scene in the movie i geeked out pretty hard when each side had 6 team members and they both started slowly walking up to each other then started running towards each other and finally it was an all out brawl it was just such a fun nerdout scene of probably 1520 minutes of action finally my last positive i want to talk about is the final twist in the movie i dont want to spoil anything in the movie but two characters have a certain connection that the audience doesnt know about and neither does one of the other characters this leads to the last fight scene in the movie it was one of the few times the mcu has truly shocked me im glad they included this    the negatives one kind of severe gripe i had about this movie was the first act holy crap was it bloated there was just way too much going on in the first act there was a flashback from the 90s about the winter soldier an avengers mission which included crossbones backlash because of the mission tony stark talking at mit tonys relationship with pepper is rocky a hydra subplot and eventually the main plot of the movie which is the mixed feelings about the avengers being controlled by the un although a lot of what i mentioned that happens in the first act eventually makes sense and is fine by the end of the story it was just a lot to take in for the first third of the movie    verdict its a great mcu movie definitely in the top 4 i highly recommend seeing this movie if you love the marvel brand or comic book movies in general dont be afraid to geek out in the theaters folks
May 6 2016,positive,one of the finest films marvel has put out thus far the stakes actually feel real in this one its a massive film that juggles all sorts of characters tones and thoughts but its all brought together nicely the addition of spiderman and ant man brings a much needed lightness to this dark story of broken ties
May 6 2016,positive,amazing this movie makes bvs look like one of those cheap knockoff redbox rentals the fights actually make sense and propel a cognitive story forward
May 6 2016,positive,hands down the best marvel movie to date
May 6 2016,positive,it was a great balance of action with a complete story line cant wait to see what they come up next
May 6 2016,positive,the rare marvel movie that got me sold  sold me big time
May 6 2016,positive,another awesome marvel installment just enough back story and great plot ties in the new characters perfectly best spiderman ever finally caught the whimsical side of the character stay through the credits two post scenes
May 6 2016,positive,alot less useless dialogue really nice fight scenes wish black panther movies came out tomorrow  omg great debut for one of my favorite characters
May 6 2016,positive,this movie was good in the beginning but as the movie progressed i was very very disappointed if i were any one i would wait for x men or sucide squad
May 6 2016,positive,russo brothers deliver a heartwrenching tragic comedy filled with the best action scenes ever in what is the final act of arguably the greatest superhero trilogy
May 6 2016,positive,i really liked the introduction of spiderman and black panther but the last 20 minutes just didnt work for me
May 6 2016,positive,both avengers movies directed by joss wheddon were so campy in an awful way that civil war saying people died on those films feels like a retcon and thats a major disadvantage civil war suffers being a sequel to 2 poorly made comedies films now spiderman and antman dont know why the fck the fight was about and what should have been a dramatic fight scene plays like friend playing smash bros to make matters worse the trigger that causes the final cap vs ironman fight is not the opposing ideologies instead is a forced plot development which sort of just exists so the fight can happen which majorly cheapens the whole enterprise now the spiderman  ironman setup i utterly hate it no w winter soldier being mind controlled also cheapens the character and its motivations as it fully reedems and absolves the character from all sins the villian is an improvement over previous marvel cinematic universe villians marvel cinematic universe has many of the worst developed villians of all time they might be super developed on comcs i really dont know as i dont read them but their film counterparts are usually  terribly onedimensional thankfully civil war does better also why title the film civil war othe than marketing purposes if theres no war at all and also no one dies bring back jhon favrea
May 6 2016,positive,truly  an amazing movie  and amazing  end credit scenes
May 6 2016,positive,just pure entertainment right here not quite as good as winter soldier but still damn fun to watch seeing the bigger roster of heroes together is a sight to behold especially adding spidey i think marvel is going to bring the best version of him yet and tom holland plays him to a t for the few minutes hes here  really great storytelling as to where all the films are leading greatly excited for more from the mcu
May 6 2016,positive,there is real conflict here this is one of the best marvel movies
May 6 2016,positive,all i can say is excellent excellent  excellent 3d in affect and definitely a must see
May 6 2016,positive,excellent well done  didnt care for the star wars reference that began with this old movie and i cant see marisa tomei as aunt may
May 6 2016,negative,what i expected which was disappointing another weak villain in baron zemo as the avengers fight each other spiderman looked and acted so pathetic you dont really get a sense of any avengers being in grave danger because its a family movie and of course they arent going to do anything drastic knowing disney now that i wasted my time and money looking forward to xmen apocalypse
May 6 2016,positive,theres nothing i can say about civil war that more eloquent and prominent critics wont cover first  all i can say is that like its predecessors the captain america films continue to be the height of the marvel franchise    i went into this film with several reservations already in place and i have to sayi ate all the negative words id said about this film leading up to the release any concerns id had about characterization  gone  all my worries about hokiness and pandering  gone  this was a well crafted film that both payed homage to the comic book arc it was loosely based on and made the story new and interesting enough not to bore an audience that already knew the story going in    my only complaints stem from the expected places  antman and spiderman really had no purpose in this film  they were amusing  i enjoyed them  their scenes were very fun  but they did nothing really to add to the plot beyond adding more names to big heavyweight fight roster  they could have been cut from the film entirely and there wouldnt have been much of a difference all in all    my absolute favorite aspect of this film  how they handled natasha  i was very concerned leading up to this based on the fact that she was on tonys side something that put her opposite both steve and clint a situation that i found to be hugely out of character and difficult to understand  how they handled it both made sense and was brilliantly in character for her and leads me yet again to echo the masses and ask where is my black widow movie    this film was definitely a return to the goodness marvel had to offer that was sorely lacking in its recent films like dark world and ultron  it gives me high hopes for the lead up to infinity wars and i can only hope they dont lose this momentum
May 6 2016,positive,fantastic movie that really sets the mood for the rest of phase 3
May 6 2016,positive,amazing movie high action fight scenes that actuall lasted a while unlike some movies had a nice simple easy to follow plot and only story was the avengers no origins unlike some movies and tom hollands spiderman was amazing glad marvel has spidey back the only thing i had an issue with was antman was a bit to clingy its one thing to be a fan but the writers way over did it
May 6 2016,positive,kids today will take this movie for granted but for those who have been waiting for the last 30odd years know that each shot in this movie is worth every single day of your life that you waited for a movie like this to happen so spiderman civil war is a worthy sequel to the avengers
May 6 2016,positive,loved it best comic movie ever made
May 6 2016,negative,what the hell its not even in the top five of the superhero genre
May 6 2016,positive,wow finally the best marvel movie ever title is captain america but it was like avengers 3 unbelievably dynamic thrilling exciting emotional and really really funny imax 3d was unbelievably fantastic actors were great so many super heroes fought each other story was smart and nice jaw dropping special effects anthony and joe russo directed it really funny and wonderful joss whedon couldnt make avengers 1  2 like this so many surprises and shockes it was 146 minutes but i didnt feel and i didnt want to end see it in imax 3d oh so many people didnt leave until movies end because extra bonus scene was after the long end credits yes they knew it fantastic
May 6 2016,positive,i found this movie to be entertaining with a lot of cool action  however it went way long  i dont think spiderman brought a lot to the film and if about 25 minutes could have been cut out it would have flowed much better    thinking it is setting itself up for the next couple movies  but see it in the theater  worth it
May 6 2016,positive,simply putcaptain america civil war is a masterpiece
May 6 2016,negative,i suppose you could show cow manure and say its from marvel and all the marvelites would go crazy and say god darn its the best movie since citizen kane i see where a fanboy begged for all the comic nerds to rate high so civil war wont go under 92 crazy man it makes me really dislike fanboys marvel dc darkhorse etc to the general public its not a great flick or a horrible one its an average movie i rate it half a star cos of the lunatic fanboys skip it
May 6 2016,positive,captain america civil war review    ok so i saw captain america civil war last night the movie was great marvel started off phase 3 both a bang the russos are back and theyve adidas a few new characters first and foremost this is a captain america movie i know there was a lot of hesitation with everyone minus hulk and thor showing up most of the avengers are cameos the additions of black panther and spiderman to the mcu had me overjoyed to see my favorite webhead in the same scene as iron man and captain america had me overjoyed ive said it since i heard the news and from previous recasting a but marvel makes the best versions of their characterssorry sony and black panther is a badass hes  great fighter and a fast runner the airport sequence was great i wont go as far to say best action scene ever like so many others have but i will say best action sequences in a comic book movie this 20 minute set piece had me drooling in my chair at all of the mayhem that was going down with heroes fighting heroes and the scene doesnt disappoint     this movie isnt perfectwhich was disappointing for me with all of the hype surrounding this film i expected to absolutely love it it which may be showing my cards a bit but lets talk some of my problems the cgi we are in 2016 and they cant get iron man with rdjs head to look right it looked like a poor photoshop job and it took me out every time he  took off the helmet it looked better in the iron man movies 8 years ago but the big problem and a lot of people have already stated this in their reviews but the villain was unnecessary to this film zemo was a waste and im a defender of the marvel villains now daniel bruhl was great with the role he had but zemowho was only zemo in name only should not have been here now sort of minor spoilers i guess but he is the cause for the civil war and what he does to cause it is great but they keep cutting back to him and it feels his story and the main civil war are two separate storys until the end there is a twist in this film which spoilers is connected to the opening sequence i wont say what it is but unlike my whole family i knew what the reveal was and waited for confirmation the whole time i got half of it right     the performances were great all around the board from evans to rdj whos was especially heartbreaking with what he went through in this movie chadwick boseman was perfect as black panther and i already stated tom holland is the perfect spiderman nice little cameo by stan lee the score by henry jackman who by the way is my favorite composer working today made an outstanding score there is one scene where captain america and sharon spoilers carter meet up and bucky and sam are in the car and their back and forth was just too funny     this movie isnt as good as the first avengers or the winter soldier not even as good as the first iron man and maybe thats what disappointed me ive shared all the love i had with this movie but it was disappointing that it wasnt the best or even second best mcu film its 4th in my opinion im gonna give captain america because it is his move civil war a 910 its a great movie and i want to make that clear its a great movie and a great comic book movie but its not the best and thats where my disappointment lies     rating 910
May 6 2016,positive,most people disagree with me on this movie but mainly with me disappointment it couldve been way more epic and its kind of a nonserious thing and if its so serious to fight over it then why would they laugh and be jokey and happy during battle mcu knows they will make a ton of money so they dont care if its legendary however like every mcu movie its enjoyable its funny its highbudget its well scripted well made but it lacked what it needed intensity and we have to look at what they got the story from the comic miniseries civil war 2007 im okay when a movie changes it from the book when they make it better but they didnt at all it was epic it was way more serious both sides felt more pastionate about their side this wasnt as great as everyone says but it was 710 but get your on opinionif you havent already and you decide
May 6 2016,positive,almost five stars from me  one of marvels best movies  and its not just captain america but the whole gangs here  even ant man and spiderman show up  its a great 2 12 hour escape
May 6 2016,positive,this is one of the best action adventure superhero movies to date marvel has done it again they make going to movies fun and again wow and wow 
May 6 2016,positive,great movie to seespiderman is awesome
May 6 2016,positive,as a characters driven story and an action flick civil war is an awesome and rewarding  movie you cant definitively go wrong with it especially you superheroes comics book admirers the central story with its underlying tone of revenge and redemption is first and foremost  at its core a human story and why we love the movie so muchand while the original conflict is far from irrelevant it is a showcase to present us something deeper about guilt regrets and redemption and while this might seem heavy we have it all with captain america  civil warthere is emotionlaughsopposition throughout the entire movie  and yes from a story line perspectivethe villain and is motivation are underdeveloped and some essential plot point  are way too convenient but it works nonetheless because as said above it is a characters driven story where the plot without being superficialfar from that is above all a set up for a mans confrontation of the most meaningful kind beside the russo brothers successfully manage to put inn to the film a great balance and basic coherence that make it regardless of its flaws a great ridei could sincerely not recommend this movie enough it is without a doubt one of the best marvel movie to date certainly one of the very bets super heroes movie ever made and an awesome kick ass blockbuster to start your summerin one word go see it
May 6 2016,positive,absolutely awesome 
May 6 2016,positive,the best superhero film so far marvel really kicks dcs ass with this from start to finish just pure awesomeness i love the new character black panther and how they handled spider man a mustsee
May 6 2016,positive,by far one of the best marvel movies made
May 6 2016,positive,this movie exceeds expectations on all accounts i will be seeing this movie a 2nd time this opening weekend cause its money well spent you will only leave the theater wanting more
May 6 2016,positive,best superhero movie yet amazing i rarely see a movie twice in theaters i may go see this one 3 times or more spiderman and black panther are great be additions to the mcu
May 6 2016,negative,to be honest if i were a fan these movies would be fun and great to watch as they really play up the fantastic visual effects and they know exactly what the fans want to see the guy sitting next to me was openly expressing his cheers for any reveals during the movie kept saying oh no under his breath during the sad moments and even yelled a hell yeah at one point i can see the investment he has and it doesnt matter whether or not the movie as a whole is of quality because its fun and hes having a great time so he will continue to support these films with hopes to see more produced in the future its like an event each time a superhero movie releases and is something to look forward to so im not going to knock those that enjoy superhero movies but rather offer an unbiased opinion on how this movie added up for me i know and realize im not the target demographic as im not a comic book fan and i have zero investment in any superheroes going into a movie such as this i usually go with a group of friends so im doing this review as a person who loves film and without a predisposition to enjoy these superhero blockbusters i find these films becoming and acting as just a fan service and borders on pandering at points these movies are catering to being episodic with no real end goal in sight this is probably the reason i find myself feeling more and more distant from them    i believe a movie should be able to stand on its own but some sequels rely heavily on the viewer having seen the previous movies this one not only relied heavily on having seen the first two captain america movies but the marvel cinematic universe as a whole having not seen all of them the inclusion of some characters felt random and without much given reason or explanation of who they are and this goes back to the idea that i should know who they are but since im not a fan i am left assuming their roles and guessing at their preestablished connections with the other characters     the action in this movie followed the same three big battle setup scenarios seen in most action movies but that isnt the reason i had a problem with it the fights in civil war seemed more like play fighting considering all the characters are basically invulnerable when they do go flying across a building and hit something with great force or falling from ridiculous heights theyre fine its very similar to a rag doll physics and youre always wondering how some of the not so super human characters are able to walk away from the fights without so much as a scratch and the banter is heavy during the fights to the point where its hard to take them seriously i never felt like the characters were ever in any kind of danger or that there was a threat to be concerned with it was more of showing off how cool each characters abilities were without doing any damage or harm to the ones they were actually fighting it felt silly like it was meant more for a childrens cartoon show but it was meant to be a serious division of once great friends i really couldnt see it that way    lastly the story falls somewhere between a daytime soap opera and an arc from television wrestling  none of the conflicts felt substantial and half the time characters were forgiving each other right after their play fighting for having temporary outbursts there were even a few you killed my family im angry and now want to kill you motivator cliches to help the characters justify their actions its littered with convenient and coincidental timings that were more on the cheesy side but this could also once again be catering towards the fans wanting to see something flashy over something logical it has a cool flair to it and the visual effects are undeniable     the soundtrack and score throughout was forgettable and often times just used as an overextended filler for times that were unnecessary     and although this movie was meant to focus on captain america and iron man it was clear to see that spiderman was the true character that stole the show he was light hearted avoided the messy unnecessary drama and seemed to have fun with the situation the villain was the weakest to date and thankfully for him the situation played out in the end exactly how he somehow knew it would to set the final battle in motion between the main characters it was the final eyeroll of many given during the movie     usually i dont review superhero movies as i know im not of popular opinion but the industry is so heavily focused on continuing to produce more of the same and seem to release each year on a quarterly basis if not more as someone exhausted seeing the same recycled content playing on loop i think its time to see a shift in a new direction for subject matter or at least give some breathing room in between each to allow other movies and genres to share the limelight
May 6 2016,positive,spiderman     do i have to say more
May 6 2016,positive,a treat to all superhero fans who were disappointed after batman vs superman a plot of political differences among the avengers causes a battle among them which is the highlight of the movie where tom holland as spidey captures your attention the most captain america and iron man stand out in the movie with amazing performances from chris evans  robert downey jr all in all a great multiplex experience and worth the long duration of the movie
May 6 2016,positive,fun action packed thoughtful and actually balances a ton of characters really well im now super excited for the new spiderman movie and black panther one of the best
May 6 2016,positive,dont get me started on how much i love this movie loved all the characters
May 6 2016,positive,drama suspense spies friends foes action and the kitchen sink i loved it as good maybe even better than winter soldier must be seen in the theater
May 6 2016,positive,another homerun for marvel
May 6 2016,positive,wow see it just see it marvel hits another home run and dc is left farther behind than ever
May 6 2016,positive,this movie is fantastic it does with flourish what batman vs superman failed to do explore mature themes while also entertaining the viewer with humor and jaw dropping action despite what some have said it actually does explore new ground for marvel it is not your stereotypical bad guy trying to take over the world and superheroes need to stop him movie instead the main bad guy has almost justifiable  reason to do what he does dont wanna spoil anything so thats all im gonna say but go see this film
May 6 2016,positive,absolutely fantastic in my top 2 of any of the mcu flicks to date
May 6 2016,positive,amazing superhero film personally i thought it was as good as avengers simply due to the novelty of spiderman being in the mcu however objectively the only thing that sets avengers above this film is simply because avengers did it first other than that i personally think this was the mcus best written film so far
May 6 2016,positive,it does everything it needs to do to move the mcu story along lots of callbacks lots of foreshadowing lots of character development lots of action lots of pathos and lots of humor
May 6 2016,positive,man there was a lot in this movie how is it that marvel can create a film featuring over a dozen super heroes fighting each other and its well calculated well paced and even punches you right in the emotions meanwhile dc holds three of the most iconic superheroes hostage in a film critics completely slammed just when you think this film doesnt live up to its civil war gimmick by the time the credits roll you tip your cap no pun intended another solid marvel film being partial to the cap ill say it still isnt as great as his first film and favoriting dc comic characters over marvel this movie kills me we get it marvel you make good movies using otherwise forgotten characters quit showing off
May 6 2016,positive,civil war was pretty bad and not only because of all the plot holes and lack of character growth  the pacing was so bad  i almost fell asleep 3 times and thats never happened in theaters before it seemed like the only way the plot could be moved along was action sequences between very very slow dialogueheavy sequences overall this made the first half of the movie very jarring as it was dragged along from action sequence to action sequence  the only character with significant character development was tchalla  tony was particularly bad especially his unashamed manipulation of peter parker and hypocritical actions in the final scene i kept rolling my eyes so hard  one of steves famous dialogues was taken from him and given to peggy which was okay except itll probably be wrongly attributed to sharon nowthey couldnt establish her character any other way  the plot holes absolutely disgust me marvel must think their audiences are idiots  especially with those stupid location overlays as if no one can identify famous landmarks or follow dialogue let me tell you as someone who has entered government facilities  they check id also a dangerous criminal would never be left alone with a civilian without armed guard thats ridiculous and there were more beyond this im not even going into detail on  also everything literally ended up as steve said it would not being able to respond to something they should being called in for a job they dont want to and tony even ended up on his side in the final scene so in the end it seemed like the whole movie was pretty much pointless
May 6 2016,positive,movie was full of all the things i love from marvel not super keen on the new spiderman though
May 6 2016,positive,i was suffering from superhero fatigue but ive got to give it to the russo brothers this movie is well executed fun and god damn wasnt spiderman cool
May 6 2016,positive,well thought out a tribute to both fans of the comics and the cinematics its deep jaw dropping action packed and fun a must see
May 6 2016,positive,this movie does an amazing job of juggling its components introducing black panther and spiderman giving each of the avengers moments in the spotlight and still giving focus to the main story it starts with an action opening and has several other big action setpieces including what is easily the best superpowered slugfest in film history ita a movie i will absolutely need to see in theaters a second time i cant say for certain if its better than winter soldier but both are so good its really irrelevant not perfect but immensely entertaining
May 6 2016,neutral,not sure what everyone is rating this movie so highly for i endured this movie last night and found it tedious of course it is visually stunning and has great fight scenes  and then another fight scene  and then of course there are the fight scenes  but the plot is weak and many of the links to other characters are tenuous     a very average film to say the least
May 6 2016,positive,action spectacular
May 6 2016,positive,stunning visuals incredible dialogue and a story that keeps you engaged from start to finish you feel for the characters and it actually pulls you between the two sides and makes the issue at the heart of the movie a blurred line between right and wrong
May 6 2016,positive,loved it  was very good  i really liked black panther and spiderman  both were very well portrayed and really tough
May 6 2016,positive,civil war was incredibly entertaining at ever corner funny clever and filled with culture references that you have to pay attention to catch it may have been a little long in the end but it needed extra time to fill in missing plot holes the new spiderman was young and funny black panther is a great addition and antman is just constantly entertaining definitely my favorite marvel thus far but cant wait till guardians get integrated with this team
May 6 2016,positive,it does a fantastic job of building relationships and tension between a giant cast with several new characters too everyone gets adequate screen time and nothing feels rushed its super long but never boring so it doesnt feel long and unlike bvs they have a legitimate reason to be fighting 1110 go see it right meow
May 6 2016,positive,greatest comic movie ever
May 6 2016,positive,this flick is amazing marvel studios has knocked it out of the park again
May 6 2016,positive,one of the best marvel movies yet
May 6 2016,positive,it started a little slow but once the main conflict is presented to both tony stark and steve rogers we start to see both sides of the problem in a very smart witty and engaging way quite possibly the best marvel movie to date great character depth internal conflicts and blank panther and spiderman fit right in to the ever expanding universe paul rudd and tom holland are my comedic standouts with close runner ups anthony mackie and jeremy renner right behind them not to mention another great villain that is at the main focal point of the story no spoilers overall whether you come in standing with team cap or team iron man you will walk out with a clear idea of who is doing the right thing and who must learn from their mistakes action aside its the quick paced dialogue and politics between the superheroes turned foes that keep you on the edge of your seat
May 6 2016,negative,this movie will make a billion and a 12 because its marvel but i wont watch another avengers movie as long as i live im so angry for falling for the hype train
May 6 2016,positive,wow exceeded all my expectations best marvel movie to date loved everything about it the incredible storytelling with all the twists and turns the characters the actionâ so good
May 6 2016,positive,highly impressed in how they handled black panther costume the actor his skills everything of course spiderman is my favorite part of the movie they introduced him perfectly they used him perfectly the cg the humor everything about the character was done perfectly i was very skeptical of tom holland having never seen him in anything and hating the idea of a teen spidey but he did a good job in and out of the costume really looking forward to the solo movie i was also glad to see that scarlett johannson grew her hair out again for widow she killed it as usual ant man was used well enough but the way he picked sides felt a little contrived scarlet witch was handled well too same with vision the rest of the crew were about as good as youd expect having seen them in several others already so not much to say there     not a perfect movie but very solid
May 6 2016,positive,man some of the very best comic battles ive ever seen i thought this would be the end all of marvel films its notbut thats not a negative reflection sprinkled with solid humor throughout spider man is amazing pun intended spidey n antman stole the show why is hawkeye there mostly meaning j renner def go to the theatre
May 6 2016,positive,captain america civil war is the third and final film of the captain america trilogy starring most of the avengers from the previous mcu films except thor and hulk originally the film was supposed to come out around the same time as batman v superman in march but marvel delay the film to a may released date in order to avoid competition with dc since it follows a similar plot about two superheroes fighting against each other now that civil war is released in theaters is it the marvel movie that we all been waiting for or does it have its similar flaws with batman v superman   after going to an early screening of the film last night i have to admit not only is this the best captain america film but this is the best marvel movie i have seen since guardians of the galaxy captain america civil war is the avengers movie that i have always wanted to see since this is based on the civil war comics that came out in 2006 the story is set after age of ultron where captain america is leading his newly establish avengers team fighting against crossbones for stealing biological weapons an accident occurs during the fight causing the united nation to call the avengers to sign the sokovia accords which will establish a governing body to take control of the avengers this cause the team to divide as tony agrees to be put under check while cap disagrees believing that it will take away their privilege to go somewhere that the government would not allow them to go while thats going on bucky barns aka the winter solider is framed for killing king tchaka of wakanda causing tchalla aka black panther to seek revenge against bucky now its up to cap to find the man who framed bucky while fighting against the team he was once apart of the story in civil war is well written that you start to understand the reasons why each of these character are doing on what they think is right instead of the whole justice cliche the film manage to be both an avengers film and a captain america film at the same time and it actually works the film knows when it needs to be funny and when it needs to be serious marvel has been doing a great job on balancing those types of moments that the film needs to be each character in civil war is given a perfect amount of screening time including your friendly neighborhood spiderman who is the highlight of civil wartom holland did a great job portraying the web slinger without giving an origin story that we all heard before from the previous spiderman films but this is the best spiderman we have gotten since the sam rami trilogy black panther was also cool to see in this movie and was given the amount of character that he as supposed to be given since hes gonna have his own solo movie in 2017 the introduction to paul rudds portrayal of ant man was hilarious and fun to watch besides spiderman for being the highlight of civil war the fight scene at the airport is amazing forget about the big fight scenes from the previous two avengers movie this was awesome to watch every superhero manage to have an awesome fight with one another if i had to nitpick one thing with captain america civil war is that this is a long movie probably the longest in the mcu                   this doesnt mean its a big flaw but their are probably one or two scenes where the film could fell a little slow overall captain america civil war is marvels best besides deapool but thats owned by fox i highly recommend viewing this film as a standalone movie but its best to watch the other mcu if you want to know more about these characters besides deadpool this is one of my favorite films of 2016 so far which is why im giving it a 9410
May 6 2016,positive,great movie my favorite super flick so far finally get to see super teams fighting now if marvel would only give me a superhero team fighting a villain team
May 6 2016,positive,civil war is emotionally brutal and exhausting i left the theater feeling worn out and definitely need some time to recuperate before seeing it again and writing a review much like the winter soldier the strength of this movie is in its personal relationship my favorite part of tws was the friendship component of the movie particularly the bond and trust developed quickly yet believably between steve rogers and sam wilson cw takes every friendship and team dynamic felt and strains them all to the limit some of it is subtle and understated some of it is right in your face and obvious with so much going on the characters have real depth and dimension to them    the action sequences are flat out awesome critics have praised the airport scene as possibly the best comic book action put on film and they arent wrong its worth the price of admission on its own the fighting in the third act is just punishing the choreography is as good as you would expect but large parts of me just wanted them to stop because of how invested id become in the characters the punches feel real and carry consequence     while captain america is the much more sympathetic of the two de facto leaders of the conflict the motivations of both are believable and with merit theres logic to both sides and while caps appears to be more emotionally rooted than starks you could argue its really the other way around this might be rdjs best performance as iron man the ego and quick wit are still there but you see a man wound really tight as guilt and other unresolved issues are pushing him near a breaking point     tchalla is a complete badass chadwick boseman really was the perfect choice for the role he manages to be both kingly and fierce at the same time im looking forward to his solo outing much more after seeing civil war spiderman is the best version of spiderman weve seen and its great hes finally part of the mcu    i liked zemo as the villain quite a bit his part was a slow burn and very subtle one of the mcus problems has been lack of memorable villains and zemo will get criticism for this as well its possible his arc may play to the long game much more than we realize and this could be the foundation for something much bigger    the massive amount of characters was handled deftly by the russos with each of them getting the chance to develop and weigh in on the picture as a whole some of it was front and center and some was very subtle planting seeds you want to see grow in future movies in particular both vision and scarlet witch hold a ton of potential for continued development    its going to be interesting to see the fallout of this movie down the line im most curious about how antman and the wasp is handled with how this movie went     a couple of minor complaints spidermans inclusion was a bit forced and it was obvious he was a late addition to the script the shakycam was overdone in one of the sequences but part of that was due to seeing it in imax it will look a lot better on a smaller screen i wish sharon carter had a little bigger role but i suspect theres more to her story coming down the road     on a scale of 1 to 10 im struggling to give it a rating nine seems ridiculously high but eight doesnt seem to do the movie justice lets go 875 its my scale after all and say this is right up there with iron man as one of the best ever on the downside 2018s infinity war is way too far away now after what the russos did here and how epic the close of phase 3 is supposed to be the bar is set really high
May 6 2016,positive,one of the best marvel films to date
May 6 2016,positive,for the noncomic book fan who is starting to get tired of the avengers franchise and all its spinoffs this movie singlebionic handedly drags you back in gripping from beginning to end great action more subtle humour than usual and thoroughly entertaining
May 6 2016,positive,pert near a perfect marvelavengers adventure
May 6 2016,positive,from the start of a hydra symbol to the mission in lagos against crossbones this movie fills in the spaces where its counterpart batman superman dc and all its characters fail itching is perfect but this is as close to perfect as it gets james bond films are the only other films that pays attention to story and action the way marvel does black widow is as great of a fighter as capt or ironman black panther is just as powerful and great of a fighter spoiler alert  spiderman is still the most quick and acrobatic of them all though  lets start here the creation start of storylines with black panther and spidey are perfect and with the introduction of both characters they were beyond perfect where dc clutters the story and kills character origin or needing to see them on the big screen  they need to stick with tv so they have a long enough time to tell their story   marvel can explain a character in only 1015 min where dc is that long drawn out lecture we hate the grievance in this story makes sense where we know superman vs batman didnt not giving away this movie in words i choose to state that these characters are believed in their suits even the xmen try to compete with the avengers but come up short this story comes down to the pain that the avengers can inflict on the innocent when not trying to and accidentally happening due to cause and effect is ion sums up the story here in his definition of whats at hand and the truth  not only see this movie but see it at least twice spidey and spoiler alert ant man steal the show here and show why these characters are believable as real people  until next time only the bad shall fear my name
May 6 2016,negative,i max showing paid for my man and my younger sister a pretty penny and one that wasnt well spent i am so upset it was a snooze fest for all of us my sister kept blaming the fanboys but i blame the critics do yourself a favor and safe your money a stinker
May 6 2016,positive,this is the avengers sequel we should have gotten there are a lot of comparisons to be made with batman v superman because there are a lot of similarities right down to a complaint i had about about bvs where these guys taking notes from each other when you see it youre going to be like lex and zemo know each other i enjoyed this movie a lot more though the events of this movie were earned is it a perfect movie no even the dark knight which i consider to be one of the greatest movies ever has flaws everything that has happened since iron man in 2008 is paid off here if youve followed these movies you see the progression of steve rogers and iron man they end up at different places than from where they began at the start of their stories people say that when you watch it you will see that it is a captain america movie i have to disagree this is an avengers movie cap and iron man and the main characters not a single thing is wrong with that though
May 6 2016,positive,to put it simply this movie was on pointthe russo brothers know what they are doing and how to make a solid movie this takes the greatness that was capt 2 winter soldier and elevates it to an entire other level i literally cant think of any real complaints about it which is unheard of for me with a comic movie there are always things i wish were at least slightly different this movie nailed the civil war concept and kept us surprised at what exactly would happen in the coming scenes it also did a fantastic job at hitting and revealing the personalities of every character which is quite impressive when dealing with a dozen or more main characters this is a movie that will be easy to watch again and again
May 6 2016,negative,maybe if i had gone in with lower expectations but i read where a critic said oscar nominations its laughable there are at least eight movies ive seen this year that are far better ive got to stop reading fanboy stuff its losing me money go see another movie or dont go at all
May 6 2016,negative,disney super hero check list please mind control  check team bickering  check team fights  check wasted major villains  check     spiderman was fantastic character  i do look forward to seeing him more but he was wasted in this movie relegated to ironmans robin spiderman is nobodys robin he was such a major player in civil war books but here  you could have switched him out with anyone else in the mcu and it would have made no difference what so ever that really sucked    the whole premise for the civil war which really was useless seeing how the avengers were originally a government team when ny happened but that is never mentioned gets lost  replaced with a revenge story out of left field because mind control again and none of it is wrapped up     on to apocalypse  hopefully a good movie this one is forgettable
May 6 2016,positive,marvel delivers again with this incredible summer blockbuster
May 6 2016,negative,went with my boyfriend to see the avengers movie last night because it was his time to choose he said he heard it was one of the best movies of the year  high expectations for both of us too high a yawner but on the positive side the food at nanitas was excellent texmex food is fantastic
May 6 2016,negative,i dont write much reviews but i had to take the time to write this one civil war was not better or as good as winter soldier the story was not that good only the visual effects and the choreography scenes the expectation was to high due to trailers and word of mouth that was good  thank you movie critics fanboys and marketing production for ruining what could had been the movie of the year
May 6 2016,positive,better than the avengers movies prolly the best from the avengers cast side of movies
May 6 2016,positive,awesome enough said
May 6 2016,positive,where to begin definitely one of the best if not the best superhero movies yet usually too many characters is a weakness for the superhero genre but this one managed to somehow give every superhero their own story within the larger story the casting is impeccable including newcomers chadwick boseman as black panther and tom holland as spiderman who immediately became my favorite spiderman in just a few minutes and the fight scenes great action scenes i have ever seen in a movie the battle between the two sides is absolutely perfect and full of fun surprises cant wait to see it again
May 6 2016,positive,i found it very entertaininglots of actions and spiderman hahaha
May 6 2016,positive,so now we come to marvels turn to pit to big heroes against each other while i still liked batman v superman this is definitely the better movie it has way fewer plot problems like bvs also they dealt with the superhero accountability issue in a more realistic way iron man never wanted to go to war with cap he tries to reason they at least had conversations before fighting unlike batman and superman while i can see where iron man was coming from i had to be on caps side if the avengers did nothing in all the attacks that are mentioned thousands would have died and when theres a bomb thats gonna explode in a crowded square in 10 seconds theres no way people arent going to die and that shouldnt be the avengers fault   anyways the new spider man was good everyone is raving that hes like the second coming of christ i wasnt blown away like that but he did a good job ant man had some solid laughs vision and scarlet witch have a bond that i didnt see coming but i found effective lotta people are shitting on zemo while i admit his character is the least interesting he wasnt unnecessary or pointless he served a role and actually his plan made sense or at least more than past villains you wanna talk pointless thoughmartin freeman is on screen for like a minute and doesnt really contribute anything despite being such a big star  look for the stair car from arrested development in the airport fight scene i thought that was cool  overall another solid entry in the marvel cannon it was cool to see even more new characters get introduced and interact with each other
May 6 2016,positive,the best marvel movie till date what a film marvel again showed its charm it was no where close to its comic story civil war but writers did a fantastic job to make it perfect one of the most perfect superhero movie ever made all the charecters were more upto their potential they are just speechless new addition of black panther and spider man were the best decision from disney i think this changes the whole marvel movie concept of the phase three great combination of story awesome climax more complexity in stories and more comedy from its predecessor just speechless hats off to russo brothers they have done it again
May 6 2016,positive,its better than the trailers that you have seen already its worth it
May 6 2016,positive,i saw it last night and the movie did not disappoint in this day and age many movies deliver fan service to the super fans of their ip but few tell a satisfying story with character arcs and satisfying narrative twists and turns i found the portrayal of each character to be both satisfying and substantial i particularly loved the way spiderman black panther antman and captain america were used
May 6 2016,positive,what a movie marvel have some great characters here and build them into the story perfectly this new style of bringing every major character into one film is really working im also excited to see the development of the new spiderman because i didnt even bother seeing the andrew garfield versions
May 6 2016,positive,see zack snyder this is how you do a superhero movie  wow what a ride this was  the avengers are literally split down the middle in this which is kinda funny when you think about it because this is not an avengers movie its a captain america movieah whatever theyre all the same movie but nonetheless this was amazing  all the actors are in top form here and just look like they are having a lot of fun  chris evans is still very strong as steve rogerscaptain america and robert downey jr has got to be sick of playing tony starkiron man by now but he is still great at it even if hes more miserable than usual here scarlett johansson is always great and great to look at to and all the supporting characters are good as well  the new spiderman makes his 1st appearance here to and although he is awesome i do have to wonder about the actor playing him tom holland he seems a little young but well see when his movie comes out if he can carry it for 2 hours  the 1 downfall in this was that the villain was kind of weak he didnt have any special powers or anything his whole agenda was to destroy the avengers by making them destroy each other kinda of lackluster motive as well but whatever every movie has to have some kind of flaw  i really dont know how many more of these there will be group of movies i mean not just captain america because there are a lot of characters and i just dont know if they are just going to be all together like this or if they will each get their own movies  i still say scarlett johanssons character still needs her own movie but i dont know if that will happen  still definitely worth multiple viewings  highly recommended for the plethera of action scenes and for paul rudd for the few scenes hes in
May 6 2016,positive,it had some great fight scenes but it wasnt as funny as the other big marvel films it also lacked the character development of the origin films iron man captain america etc
May 6 2016,positive,great movie but ultimately forgettable need to see it again for i decide just how much i really like it
May 6 2016,positive,civil war was perfect absolutely everything it needed to be so happy with what the russo brothers were able to accomplish
May 6 2016,positive,my favorite mcu movie by far awesome story and action marvel does a great job of introducing the new characters while further developing the older ones cant wait to see it again
May 6 2016,positive,theres enough great acting and action jollies in this movie for three lifetimes  a lot of surprises and just enough complicated plotlines to make those surprises stick  long live the avengers
May 6 2016,positive,sooo freaking good
May 6 2016,positive,the ending wasnt where i expected it to go and itll be interesting to see how they solve some of the unresolved problems in future movies but as a standalone it is one of marvels best
May 6 2016,negative,this movie is all about fan service but to me that is a huge problem is fan service and nothing more spiderman antman and others were ridiculously shoehorned for the airport fight by the way a fight with no tension thanks to the continuous jokes the script was all over the place a complete mess and like you said poor cgi and horrible shaky camera  but to me the biggest problem is that like the majority of the marvel movies in the end nothing really happens there is no stake no one dies there is no consequences and because of that there is no tension you can watch a marvel film knowing that everything will remain the same every movie is just a set up for the next one
May 6 2016,positive,great movie loads of fun and very entertaining i will see this a few times
May 6 2016,positive,one of the more mature marvel films that successfully juggles multiple tones and characters a great forward for the marvel cinematic universe well done russo bros mcfeely  markus
May 6 2016,positive,epic ill be seeing this many times
May 6 2016,positive,phenomenal everyone brings their agame
May 6 2016,positive,this is by far the best marvel movie to date and i may even say that it is the best superhero movie to date rbj did an amazing acting job and definitely made me feel for that character and the reasons behind his actions     spiderman antman and black panther stole the movie as well lastly i want to say that the airport battle scene was so entertaining and i can honestly say that all superhero franchises including marvel itself will have a hard time beating it   thank you to the russo brothers and the writers of this movie you did an amazing job     at least on my list it has knocked down guardians of the galaxy and winter soldier down a peg to make captain america civil war my favorite mcu movie
May 6 2016,positive,this is probably the best marvel movie made the storytelling and action scenes are top notched
May 6 2016,positive,iron man 4 the winter soldier 2 is a fast paced comic book movie that continues the trend of upping the ante for the marvel cinematic universe there are the fight scenes that are punctuated with quippy moments of levity theres the obligatory underlying theme of the role of power on the global stage and how that intersects with the characters relationships and responsibilities black panther is cool war machine is still unnecessary spiderman gets a dignified and organic extroduction from foxs production company who continually underwhelm with the character the film is selfaware enough to both pander and surprise the audience whether they be hardcore fans or disinterested filmgoers the action set pieces are a lot of fun but if you are expecting anything more than a comic book movie i guess you get out what you put in to it if you are looking for a nuanced critique of the role of american interventionism in policing and protecting the world sorry  this is just more militaryindustrial masturbation
May 6 2016,positive,the russo brothers are indeed the kings of comic book films they scored huge with winter soldier and with civil war they hit a grand slam the script was phenomenal by capturing scenes from the comics but also putting in their own original ideas and making them work within the mcu storyline the best mcu cast since the avengers every actor fit their roles perfectly not just on paper but in live action huge high praises for chadwick boseman as black panther and tom holland as spiderman but what really made this film was the emotional scenes some over the top but still worked and the action scenes especially the airport scene super epic if i have to give one criticism about this film it would have to be baron zemos screen time although daniel bruel did a good job as zemo and his motivation is better than most mcu villains but he was only in the film for a very short time overall captain america civil war was spectacular and epic from beginning to end i defintely rank this film a 9510 stars and it is indeed my new favorite mcu film maybe even my favorite comic book film period
May 6 2016,positive,if you like marvel this one is good
May 6 2016,positive,civil war was everything a blockbuster superhero movie should be
May 6 2016,positive,amazing movie great cast good tempo and great jokes at the right time like how all the heroes were used just enough
May 6 2016,positive,absolutely loved it marvel delivers another great time at the movies this time adding new depth to each of its characters and giving us their best story yet
May 6 2016,positive,marvel studios continues to amaze the comic book fans from old to the new and so far disney is letting them do their thing without giving away too much this movie was fun and yet had the tone of winter soldier which of course the directing duo did its not a perfect movie by all means but i cannot wait for others to follow strong 4 stars out of 5
May 6 2016,positive,i hate to admit it but this was actually pretty good the action insnt overlong or overwhelming the comedic timing is impeccable and the use of cgi is timely and appropriate civil war is by far the most mature and wellcrafted marvel movie of the cannon and it never hurts to bring on board the directors of many eps of arrested development and community
May 6 2016,positive,spectacular worth the ticket price
May 6 2016,positive,i didnt expect to love this movie more than winter soldier but the russo brothers delivered on a new level with the most emotional movie in the mcu the huge cast didnt make the movie feel bloated like one would expect and the new characters were added in so naturally and flawlessly the final 30 minutes of this movie had me on the edge of my seat the villain actually wasnt awful either i cant find a flaw in this movie and believe me i tried
May 6 2016,negative,i saw civil war last night i like action movies im not a superhero fan per se so im not a comic book nerd as a matter of fact ive never bought a comic book in my life all i can say is wow and i say that in a negative way  this is an average movie i saw the first two avengers movies and thought the first was okay and the second one terrible and i thought i was done with the avengers but all the hype sold me what a mistake enough im so upset at all the comic book nerds that will accept mediocrity  and theres many in the media  that they go on a euphoric blitz and sale garbage no more im done a couple of my friends that are comic nerds thought it was good but the rest who arent comic fans were disappointed do not waste your money this is more of the same a big bore cgi is horrible ive seen better fight scenes in other none superhero movies the wisecracks suck and seem out of place who cares about spiderman ive seen enough of him to last me a lifetime and his wisecracks were embarrassing there is nothing special about this flick i understand fanboys liking this very very average movie but please give yourself some distance sit for awhile with all your praise and then see if your delirious opinions are still valid i love action flicks but they have to be good civil war gets two thumbs way down now if i could only get my and my friends money back that would be great
May 6 2016,positive,totally inexplicably and insanely awesome  several whoah did they really do that moments from the comics  def seeing again blows bvs out the water
May 6 2016,positive,this movie is fantastic i went into it with high expectations being a huge captain america fan and was not disappointed i would consider this my favorite superhero movie to date even in the over saturated genre that is super hero movies my only critique is the bad cg for cross bones face in the beginning but other than that the film is full of amazing special effects action comedy to break the tension and great story whats not to love if you were disappointed with last superhero mash up films this one will not disappoint i definitely recommend this to comic book fans and movie viewers alike
May 6 2016,positive,corrects the wrongs of age of ultron and expands the mcu in a way that makes you truly excited for the next 100 years of marvel movies  plus we get the best cinematic representation of spiderman  ever  also chadwick boseman was born to play the black panther  i cant wait for his solo flick
May 6 2016,positive,so much fun watching this film i believed in the conflict and the drama  airport scene is truly the best action fight scene of all time  best marvel film made surpasses all of marvels work  spider man  ant man are only in for two scenes but they are one of the best parts of the film  black panther is amazing  the conflict between iron man  captain america is smart believable and understandable  great film  1010
May 6 2016,positive,stunning set pieces sand brilliant storytelling
May 6 2016,positive,this was what a superhero move is supposed to be
May 6 2016,positive,this movie easily met my already high expectations and i cannot wait to see it again
May 6 2016,positive,loved it well paced nice balance of all characters some amazing and original action scenes
May 6 2016,positive,sorta emotional and torn me apart from all sides and i was 100 rooting for cap but after seeing tony struggles and what hes been going through and the position hes in they both have me sold
May 6 2016,positive,ive never been a fan of the action  adventure genre in cinema but captain america civil war was something i very much enjoyed filled with riveting action scenes beautiful special effects sharp wit and hilarious oneliners this is by far one of the best marvel films made to date
May 6 2016,positive,terrific  unlike bvs i wasnt bored for one single second  it was the best marvel movie made to date  the russos are the best
May 6 2016,negative,wow critics are giving this movie so much praise and for what being marvel biased as they just literally want dc to fail like seriously the entire box office of bvs was shut down because of these rotten critics
May 6 2016,positive,amazing movieall characters are extremely well developed and all the characters have compelling motivationsthis movie is in no way biased to one side or anotherthere are both lawful and emotional conflicts in this moviethe only parts of this movie i dont like are   aas we know crossbones works for hydrahence the battle armor and hydra just evaporates throughout the rest of the moviethis couldve been easily solved by cap simple delivering one ten second line sayinghydra has gone into hiding or anything like that  bbaron von zemo was a somewhat compelling villain though we have seen the same motivationsdead parents from the   maximoffs whiplash tony later in the movie the policewoman at the start of the moviethat part was extremely shoehorned in and numerous other characters  cthe action of the movie did get a bit shaky and sometimes even when something falls there were several shots of a single thingthough this doesnt compromise the whole of the action  all in all this movie is grounded down to earth and one of the only dark and gritty and serious movies in the mcu other than the winter soldierwhich was a great movie  this movie absolutely deserves an a     as a side note this movie also juggles with setting up showing explaining the civil war setting up black panther and spiderman origin stories starting phase three all while juggling with building character and making you feel empathy  for characters while providing amazing action scenes     and with all of these restrictions and expectations civil war juggles miniature tornadoes of power hungry lions and groom all of their hair while keeping its own better that ever
May 6 2016,positive,this is how a versus film is done the russo brothers did a great job juggling all these characters into one film there are some minor issues i had with the film but over all this is the movie was fantastic
May 6 2016,positive,the russo brothers have spoken about their distaste for vacuous action and i believe that this sentiment is clearly showcased in whats now my favourite mcu film captain america civil war the film is packed tight from beginning to end with wondrous set pieces and action scenes that are a delight to the casual movie goer and pure cinema gold to those who are fans of the franchise the airport scene briefly shown in the trailers certainly doesnt disappoint and is better than you could have ever imagined the russo brothers present each sides of the argument clearly and each character is given their own reason for joining their side the movie balances its darker and more political tone perfectly with the humour that were accustomed to with marvel as newcomers such as antman and spiderman provide the audience with some levity on that note this is arguably the most accurate and most enjoyable reincarnation of peter parker and black panther is a character that he audience can quickly get behind as both tom holland and chadwick boseman give stellar performances the dynamic between cap and bucky tugs on the heartstrings and is pulled off by both actors which makes for one of the most shocking and emotional final fights in comic book history robert downey jrs near perfect incarnation of iron man    overall captain america civil is an excellent and forward thinking addition to the mcu that earns its emotional scenes and provides us with an exciting avengers ensemble cast whilst still very much being a continuation of the winter soldier every actor pulls their weight and the 13th entry into kevin feiges cinematic universe has only only solidified my trust in whats to come
May 6 2016,positive,great humor great conflict great characters the new ones rock theres never been a more enjoyable likable spider man portrayal the black panther is so cool and tough the writing may not have been perfect but it wasnt lazy no one involved in this movie settled for the status quo i had a great time watching it
May 6 2016,positive,in what is perhaps marvels most mature and wellbalanced release to date captain america civil war begins phase three of the mcu series with a much darker and mature tone while still being a massive exciting blockbuster featuring much more grounded and honest performances from its entire cast as well as sophisticated and intricate writing from christopher markus and stephen mcfeely civil war will hopefully be the torchbearer for this wave of the mcu franchise with nine more films to come in this phase    final grade a
May 6 2016,positive,best marvel movie to date justice league had better be a home run after the svb flop
May 6 2016,positive,i watched this movie and this is was so great great and wonderful movie i ever watched 200 times better than b vs s this movie has all the ingredients to make this movie a massive hit they split but they really care for each other they understand the problem then again they combine   at last they all wants to remain in team they dont want to split the power of avengers  awaiting for the next marvel movie
May 6 2016,positive,official seal of approval  words can not express the feels i had during this incredible new marvel installment much like caps last outing thewintersoldier this film works on so many levels the story was extremely engaging the characters were amazing and endless and just when i thought they couldnt give me any more oh shit moments with the action they blow me away with some of the best effects ive ever seen therussobrothers are crushing it with this series â³ïgoâ³ï and â³ïgoâ³ï again arguably the best one yet    insta gonogomoviereviews
May 6 2016,positive,super hero movies as we know them today must walk the difficult line of being somewhat grounded in a reality audiences can relate to while at the same time embracing not just accepting but embracing the inherent goofiness of the facts of the matter in a broad scope this is about guys and girls in colorful suits with silly nicknames duking it out with what tends to be at least in the marvel cinematic universe a flavor of the week villain that does just enough to further the arc of what remains to be built in this ongoing series what grounds these colorful characters sporting strange labels is the repercussions of their actions the avengers can shut down an entire alien race while destroying new york in the process and widely be regarded as the heroes of the scenario but the fact of the matter is that if this were to happen in our reality there would be thousands upon thousands dead and even more injured with the third captain america film civil war marvel has found it the necessary time to begin giving their heroes more heady spaces to wander sure there is still a bigger antagonist than either steve rogers chris evans or tony stark robert downey jr in civil war that leads to the plot being more run of the mill than i was hoping things might go but there is enough justification and perspective to this villains plan that we go with what were being offered perspective is a key word here not only in the driving force that puts the team at odds over the still brewing conflict concerning the winter soldier sebastian stan but for these superior beings to take into account the consequences of their actions and come face to face with their shortcomingsthe film more or less exploring how they deal with such realizations when theyre brought up as potential charges captain america is a firm believer in consequentialism in that his goals are morally important enough that any method of achieving them are acceptable with the understanding of the unfortunate caveat that he will never be able to save everyone it is in exploring such territory and being bold enough to bring their heroes face to face with such a reality that marvel exceeds in walking that difficult line captain america civil war is very much a marvel movie in that it is full of bright colors genuinely funny quips and some solid action set pieces but bringing these characters and these performers into more interesting dynamics with one another notches up the reality factor with the result being an admirable balancing act that deserves to be applauded    read the whole review at 
May 6 2016,positive,every moment was amazing
May 6 2016,positive,another masterpiece from marvel very action packed cgi is amazing thrilling awesome acting by an ass kicking group of actors intelligent plot with thoughtprovoking themes    leagues better than batman vs superman
May 6 2016,positive,with amazing character development from both sides of the argument a plot that stands out from the standard fare of the mcu and some of the most faithful to the source storytelling the series has to offer civil war stands out as possibly the best mcu film to date
May 6 2016,positive,so so so so wonderfully made my new favorite mcu movie
May 6 2016,positive,so captain america civil war isnt the best marvel movie ever but it is the darkest in tone for sure  this is a captain america movie but you could call it avengers 3  the  fight scenes are very good and the supporting characters are all very solid accept i think ive had enough of black widow the newest hero black panther is way cooler then i ever remember in the comics  once again we see the difference between marvel and dc movies  while in batman vs superman it was hero  vs  hero  and then a nice makeup session in the end for a common good marvel isnt afraid to push the envelope a little more even if it could go farther and darker with more  at stake  i didnt think the writing was all that great in this one and the villain isnt as strong as say ultron in the last avengers movie and not by a long shot  this thing did take a while to get going as well  i get the back and forth on what captain america and iron man are standing up  for but i sat there a few times and just didnt always believe that everyone had full conviction in what they were fighting all about  nevertheless this isnt a giant setup for future marvel  movies which is also a plus and is a very good stand alone movie that will set up relationships in the marvel universe for a while  to come
May 6 2016,positive,zero spoilers      one part political thriller one part superhero showdown this movie excels at every level once again marvel comics shows why it rules superhero movies sorry dc comics though perfect balance of excellent storytelling action humor heart and insane action    civil war kicks off phase iii of the marvel movie saga and we can tell that shit is really about to get insane my only suggestion is  if you havent seen them yet  go watch antman and guardians of the galaxy marvel is about to tie every single movie into one monumental galactic crossover that has never been done in movie history and it all starts here    i wont say much else about civil war  but here are some spoiler free comments you can read without getting pissed at me lol     cap vs iron man  the entire marvel universe is balanced between these two leaders one representing old school values vs the other and his new world agenda paranoia the allegory between these two is staggering    black widow  she isnt superpowered just superskillful possibly the best handtohand combatant outside of captain america who has super serum running through his veins widow is an elite superspy who looks hot and whoops ass     scarlet witch  she is clearly the acein thehole for this entire saga she is called a witch because she has a hexlike ability to alter reality meaningher powers are off the charts  using her abilities she can basically do whatever she thinks of doing ill just leave it at that    spiderman is pitchperfect  in the middle all of this seriousness tiny teenage nerd peter parker shows up and lightens the mood literally a kid trying to hang with adults and in case you didnt know spiderman is powerful as fk     black panther  my favorite new superhero for many reasons but mainly it is always good to see another superhero of different ethnicity especially a powerful black man and not just a black man but a king the character black panther has been around in comic books since the early 1970s but not many people knows this but again this is where marvel trumps dc comics  through strong diverse characters chadwick boseman plays the african king with a strong air of royalty in every scene he is in but mainlyblack panther is a baaaaad mfer loved it    overall this movie is long and there are some seriously emotionally heavy moments but again marvel excels at balanced storytelling enjoy it for all the characters weve been introduced to over the past 6 years there are some great surprises and incredible action scenes summer blockbuster season officially starts right here
May 6 2016,positive,civil war was awesome somehow they gave everyone an appropriate amount of story and screen time antman was fantastic with the group black panther is a boss i walked out really liking falcon which is new for me and they nailed spiderman nailed it go check this out for sure i had several laugh out loud gut busting moments not sure if i was laughing because it was funny or if i was just so damn amazed and happy about what i was seeing
May 6 2016,positive,captain america civil war was awesome best spiderman on film ever not even close black panther is awesome ant man and the other guy were awesome we cant wait for his next film cap was awesome im liking scarlet witch more and more vision  awesome the falcons fight scenes are his best yet black widow  awesome great story with a good mix of humor and seriousness a very good movie experience go team cap
May 6 2016,positive,another great entry in the marvel franchise although a little serious and slow at times they still manage to take a very busy story with lots of moving pieces and make it all come together even though this was definitely a cap vs iron man movie antman of all people actually has some of the best moments definitely a must see film in 2016
May 6 2016,positive,teamcap versus teamironman  this how a superhero brawl movie should look like   serious theme some fun spots and just overall great movie
May 6 2016,positive,the best superhero ever made better than the avengers sorry
May 6 2016,negative,the avengers are not a bunch of emotional dummies about 80 of this movie is outstanding it has one of the best fight  scenes ever filmed however i dont buy into why they are fighting in the first place the last 25 minutes of the movie is pure nonsense the avenger are much smarter than how they reacted in the film and so is the audience im a huge marvel fan  i got a large screen 3d tv so i could enjoy the marvel movies at home im very shocked at my review i was hoping for something better if you can get past the writers treating the audience as stupid drones anyone would enjoy this movie
May 6 2016,positive,marvel has done it again what more needs to be said
May 6 2016,positive,the russos keep proving they actually understand these characters and know what to do with them its exciting deeply emotionally affecting and a very satisfying continuation of this universe after joss whedons hamfisted characterization in age of ultron i was very worried i and this creative team proves again that they know what the hell theyre doing daniel brühl is stunning sebastian stan brilliantly handles the complexity of buckys situation black panther makes an incredible debut with chadwick boseman at the wheel rdj handles his conflict beautifully particularly in the latter half of the movie last but not least chris evans is once again the heart of this team this world and this film seeing him dig his heels in and fight for what is essentially his family is moving satisfying and heartbreaking finally getting to witness his dark side feels like the culmination of an incredible arc mcfeely and markus never fall into the trap of writing cap as a boy scout and have diligently worked to flesh him out into a complex character whose actions are fueled by what he believes rather than what the consensus says is right weve been seeing this since the first avenger and this moving effectively tears down the mischaracterization of cap as a rule following soldier that whedon put in place in his films cap has always been a fighter more than a soldier and thats a crucial subtlety that the avengers films have failed to capture evans plays it perfectly capturing both his softness and his stubbornness his fight scenes with bucky against and in tandem with in particular are incredibly well choreographed and its so satisfying to see how they work together and complement each other worries about a cluttered film with too many characters were unfounded the russos know how to adequately use each character and when to work them in and out of the story in a way that is believable and effective i love love love this movie cant wait to see what this team does with the infinity wars
May 6 2016,positive,awesome movie  civil war is a movie that beats dcs dawn of justice in every aspect  marvel u rock
May 6 2016,positive,yo this shit was lit it was so lit i didnt even know i roasted marshmallows
May 6 2016,positive,it was a great movie just didnt really care for the plot and the end
May 6 2016,positive,captain america civil war this is why marvel is marvel the directors russo brothers have taken avengersage of ultron and improved on it in every way the story the action and the humor just keeps getting better with every movie it kinda hurts that you have chose between iron man and captain americayes it is important that you choose they fought side by side now they fight each other thats heart breaking cause one of them has to go down we know the characters from the previous movie but now we have our 2 new supers spiderman and black panther they are amazing to watch there is one thing that marvel studios cant go wrong with thats casting the right actors for the role rest you have to go watch it to know it   this is not the best marvel movie for me but definitely one of the top 3s after that whole batmanvsuperman disappointment thing this is what was needed
May 6 2016,positive,arguably the best film in the mcu captain america civil war succeeds where last years age of ultron failed  it feels more like an avengers film  also chadwick bozeman and tom holland as black panther and spiderman respectively nail their roles  holland does his two predecessors proud
May 6 2016,positive,this movie was one of the best movies ive ever seen it had a mix of comedy drama and action and was filled with clever twists making you sit on the she of your seat a very good movie
May 6 2016,positive,minor spoilers the action is this movie is a step up compared to previous marvel movies which is quite a feat considering that the past captain america movie was amazing with fightscene choreography the newest additions to the group black panther and spiderman are very well done each getting a generous portion of spotlight due their introduction however it was black widow who seems to get the most upgrade in ferocity her fighting feels even more acrobatic in fact there are a ton of acrobatic moves across all the heroes with increased coordination between arms and legs bottom line the action filmed feels the closest to a superhero film that ive seen for an action film compared to xmen which is more realistic drama    even with the spectacular display of heroism however there are similarities between captain america civil war and the avengers age of ultron again the directors oddly tried hard to work in a cohesive and relatively complex story to justify what was happening onscreen this kind of onemovie setup when involving so many superheroes has proven to be ineffective and while the weakness showed more in ultron than civil war it is nonetheless evident from the rushing to establish things like captain as relationships which puts believable emotionsreactions on the backburner and more importantly the conflicting ideologies of each hero the result is again a seemingly wellrounded movie that never breathes too long     the plot itself is slightly disappointing and underutilizes the winter soldier as a fleshedout character even though he serves as one of the storys focal points unfortunately the end of captain america winter soldier feels wasted by the end scene of civil war with the last scene of the former deceptively teasing the character direction of bucky there is a worn out undercurrent to these marvel movies too tony stark is repeatedly cast as jointantagonist to the plots and thus severely limits his character development in the 5 or so movies weve seen of ironman not much has changed with his role but a case can be made that that is changing starting with this movie    back to superhero fighting there are a few complaints to give even in this area first of all with the many array of powers and abilities there is no need for hawkeye to take up too many fight sequences also reinforced by the way he was used in age of ultron yet lo and behold there are a good number of action shots involving him which could have been given to someone more exciting like vision also the movie basically makes scarlet witch untouchable without any real confrontation she is allowed to unleash on anyone in her way which makes one question why any clash of heroes is happening at all when she could supposedly end things herself     for the most part the action in this movie far outweighs the negatives captain america civil war is a good movie yet i wonder if there is a lingering trend here that batman v superman exemplifies superhero movie titles that promise to give exactly what the audience wants when really it serves more as a backdrop to the directors artistic agenda
May 6 2016,positive,it is as awesome as batman v superman was disappointing
May 6 2016,positive,here are my thoughts on the movie  
May 6 2016,positive,this is probably one of my favorite marvel movies the action was top notch the characters are all given their time to shine the humor isnt forced the plot is well paced and makes sense and wow spidey and antman steal the show black panther definitely need more of him his portrayal was spot on
May 6 2016,positive,best marvel movie ever hands down from the cast to the graphics well done way better than batman vs superman
May 6 2016,positive,captain america civil war while entertaining for the most part is respectively a mixed bag first off it was great to see all these characters again interacting on a spectacular scale civil war features some great character moments across the board that range from dramatic to funny the action here is absolutely the best part of the movie every character has their moment and the big airport scene is something to marvel sadly the overall plot doesnt support the film as well as should and surprisingly we get another throw away villain overall its worth a watch but it was honestly somewhat boring
May 6 2016,positive,not a perfect film but pretty damn close might just be the best marvel movie loved it
May 6 2016,positive,this movie is certainly an impressive feat you could acknowledge what joss whedon achieved with the first avengers film a film that admittedly remains my favourite mcu piece to date but then he had four extremely well known central characters to put together as a team on film it sounds like a winner before you even walk into the theatre right the opposite rung true when i was reading up on what captain america civil wars plot would be they would have to build a believable and engaging conflict between two of the lead avengers whilst successfully popularizing a group of secondary characters to the general audience to successfully introduce phase four as it were seemed a difficult task for captain america winter soldier directing duo the russo brothers and thats forgetting the task of restoring the reputation of the most popular marvel hero of them all spiderman    they pretty much nailed it i had no clue what black panther is i do now and i like what im seeing antman well just wait and see spiderman bring on his standalone asap he was perfect the film has some of the greatest superhero action setpieces i have seen on screen possibly the greatest in the scene that follows that much built up airport standoff    the core confrontation is believable and is built around the premise of keeping the avengers in check as death and destruction inevitably will follow their exploits as necessary as they may well be tony stark is presented with a great reason to feel the need to sign the accord that will see the avengers placed under the direct control of the us government whilst captain america also has real reason to reject the notion i never really found myself picking a side which i suppose is a good  thing theres some solid philosophical debate in this film    the film is overly long theres no two ways about it some scenes do linger more than id like usually involving baron zemo they are probably necessary as the film reaches its climax but i feel the put the blockers on some early momentum but not too badly also martin freeman why his role is pointless and slightly irking as everyone knows hes english by now just get an american to fill this role should it even exist in the first place though im sure avid marvelites will tell me otherwise in a film as crowded as this its possible some wont like every hero involved and in my case that is true for falcon war machine and vision although they have their moments which i think shows the expert job executed by the russo brothers they seem to be the right people for the infinity wars films
May 6 2016,positive,overall a good movie  really fun to watch  the action scenes are pretty incredible  the interactions between characters feel like theyd be genuine and are at time quite moving      my complaint is the motivations in this movie felt pretty contrived  from the legislation to the reasons each hero chooses a side to the actual reasoning for these two sides to come to blows  each one of them feels forced into the movie just to get the brawl at the airportwhich i admit was incredible worth the price of admission by itself  it just feels incredibly hollow particularly the ending which feels incredibly coincidental      in the end id 100 recommend it as a movie and absolutely worth watching in the theater but it isnt a perfect movie in my opinion
May 6 2016,positive,nutshell if youre an mcu fan you know youre gonna see this but wanna know if its actually any good its better if youre not an mcu fan and wanna know if you should see it theres plenty of amazing battle scenes as well as scenes that will have you feeling all the feelings because the actions in this gutsy storyline have very real consequences  so yeah civil war can satisfy fans and nonfans what are you waiting for grade a    ive been salivating over the idea of a civil war storyline in the mcu marvel cinematic universe for folks who are still having trouble with all the acronyms ever since they announced it back in 2014  the idea that marvel would make a film about the consequences of epic superhero throwdowns and how dealing with those consequences shatter the avengers made me bounce in my seat  because lets face it as much as i love superhero movies after a while its the same old bad vs good punchfest weve seen a million times or more  adding themes of responsibility the price of freedom and what it means to be a hero  could reboot the entire franchise and civil war does just that and it might just be the best thing marvel has dropped into our lap so far    warning spoilers ahead  at least for the next paragraph  dont say i didnt warn ya    synopsis after the events in sokovia the avengers are still going out and fighting the good fight  but during a mission to stop a bad guy crossbonesbrock rumlow scarlet witch becomes distracted causing the deaths of wakandan aid workers  the un decides to ratify the sokovia accords the superhero registration act in the original civil war comic book arc with tony starkiron man supporting the idea and steve rodgerscaptain america deciding that having others telling them what to do could mean that superheroes could be prevented from doing the good they should if the powersthatbe deemed their actions unnecessary  but the building is targeted by a bomber leading to the death of king tchaka of wakanda  heroes choose sides and battle lines are drawn    civil war works on several levels  first its a knockdown dragout fight a movie that takes every kids whod kick whos ass comic book conversations and plops up up on imax  because lets face it monsteronmonster movies are the best kaiju movies hands down so of course seeing superheroes duking it out is boomtastic but knowing these superheroes after following their stories for years makes their feuding tough to watch picking a side though well thats easy youre either with captain america and his stand for freedom or youre wrong    but how can you cheer iron man black panther et al getting beat up by captain america falcon and their crew well you cant  these scenes are tough to watch because directors anthony and joe russo manage to keep the bonds these characters feel for each other front and center  they may be fighting but they still feel the pull of friendship  and while these battles are absolutely amazing  ant man in particular gets to show off his stuff in a big way  i couldnt help but wish theyd stop fighting and band together again  particularly heartwrenching  seeing bffs black widow and hawkeye on opposite sides    screenwriters christopher markus and stephen mcfeely inject plenty of humanity into the storyline from black panthers reasons for siding with iron man to the big bads reasons for being a big bad  they also add in the requisite jokes and bonhomie between comrades weve come to know and love here in the mcu yeah that mix of anger and humor doesnt sound like itd work but whipsmart editing and a cast that knows their characters inside and out civil war leads the charge into mcu phase three beautifully  not only does civil war stand on its own but the aftermath of what happens here is sure to echo through the rest of this new phase    no spoilers but the climax will break your heart  and youd better have a strong one because thats not the only time youre heart will get put into a blender on frappé  a major character we all know and love dies halfway through the film and its gutwrenching  or at least it is if you have a soul  and there are many more moments that will have you clutching your popcorn pearls or what have you  in civil war its not the story thats the thing  this is basically a whos inwhos out thing  but how they get there and why  here the why is the thing  and the behind the scenes craftsmanship along with actors giving topnotch performances make for a compelling twoplus hours    gotta say im glad to see scarlett johanssons black widownatasha romanoff and anthony mackies falconsam wilson get lead status here  you know theres more to them than what weve been given so far and getting to know them even better  especially falon and his kickass suit  is just what the movie doctor ordered  after so many marvel movies and tv shows things can feel weighted down or worse yet dull  getting each character to decide where she stands is a great way to dig into their psyche giving us heretofore unknown tidbits on who they really are  eight years into the mcu wonderland that brings new life to the franchise  bonus with getting to know these characters i didnt miss thor or hulk once  okay maybe thors abs  sue me but keep an eye out for cap biceps  seriously youll wanna catch that    heres the newbie rundown  spiderman as much as i feared this new revamp peter parker feels like the high schooler  i remember and marissa tomeis vivacious aunt may is a nice 21st century upgrade he definitely makes his presence known in civil war  everyones seen the spideywithcapsshield teaser  but petey is the bumbling newbie he was when i read the comics and sunday papers back in the day  and theres plenty left over for spiderman homecoming in 2017  black panther  this is justwonderful  chadwick boseman is absolutely amazing as tchalla aka black panther  his commanding but understated onscreen presence is powerful and i cant wait to see what he does when black panther hits theaters  plus gotta love that suit  im a sucker for retractable claws  just ask my cats  and while weve seen vision and scarlet witch in ultron its good to see their characters fleshed out a bit more here as they bond after all both witch and vision are hyperpowerful beings and choose sides    as for the usual multiplex addons definitely go imax 3d isnt necessary but if you need it for your imax  thang do it you really wanna see this on the biggest screen possible let it all come at you large and in charge  youre welcome    sneaks after the film  most definitely  there are the usual midcredits  post credits sneaks the aftercredits song left hand free is a groovy way to pass the time between the two oh and dont forget to keep an eye out for uncle stan  i think this is my favorite cameo of his to date ranks right up there with caps language
May 6 2016,positive,almost perfect  if not for the extremely predictable story line still loads of fun though
May 6 2016,positive,the darkest marvel studios film youll ever see  you may not like it but i think this could be an oscartriggering motive  marvel imo is striving to be the most cautious movie maker the industry have known
May 6 2016,positive,the most impressive thing about captain america civil war isnt the wellfilmed action the surprising amounts of humor that works or the great new characters including one of the best spiderman portrayals by tom holland and chadwick bosemans super cool black panther but its the balance pretty much every avenger shows gets stuffed in the movie but as you watch you are still focused on cap bucky and iron man except when spiderman shows up then i just wanted more of him the movie isnt perfect some portions of it felt rushed especially the random romance and marisa tomei is way too young to play aunt may in my mind she does a fine job for her 5 minutes of screentime but i cant put her in that role at all also i hate the textonscreen that reveals the setting its weirdly big and the font is really pointy and it bothered me for some odd reason besides those minor critiques this was an incredible comic book movie all of the actors give great performances and it was really nice to see sebastian stan back as bucky barnes after a 2 year absencethe action sequences are pure comic book fun the super cameos are great it balances fun with the more serious storyline and while it feels a little long it was definitely worth the 25  hours is it one of the best comic book movies time will have to tell but as of right now it could be up there
May 6 2016,negative,cgi smorgasborg so boring in the first hour and a half spiderman and antman were the only good parts its a copy of batman vs superman with terrorist bombs and superhero mommies and daddies being catalysts
May 6 2016,positive,a wonderful movie the russo brothers did a great job showing off all the different superheroes in the movie the fighting scenes were amazing and the they were also funny overall a wonderful movie that if you have kept up with all the marvel movies you will love this one
May 6 2016,positive,this movie was better than a movie has a right to be omg so good
May 6 2016,positive,this is the marvel movie ive been waiting for since the avengers a small personal conflict that puts emphasis on emotional stakes rather than worldly stakes the russo brothers christopher markus stephen mcfeely and kevin feige have crafted what could possibly be the best comic book movie of all time     from the moment the question of whether or not the avengers should be governed by world governments is poised each avenger has a sensical interesting and unique stance on whether or not they should comply characters opposing ideologies bouncing off each other with the perfect dose of their comic book personalities made for an engaging and well thought out argument for each side of the issue all of this build up gave the action sequences depth and meaning as opposed to just fighting or fightings sake     each new character is introduced so eloquently especially black panthers introduction to the mcu his arc was woven so well into the overarching story but did not weigh the film down with a lengthy origin spidermans introduction could almost feel like it was tacked on to the story but the dialogue was so well written and the scenes were so well executed by the actors that it worked beyond belief     the final confrontation takes the emotional weight of the first two acts and expands on it exponentially while again making it a much more personal conflict you understand exactly where each party is coming from each has their rights and their wrongs but you still root for both of them pretty equally     to paraphrase cap i could watch this all day this movie is simultaneously the best captain america film iron man film avengers film and quite possibly the best comic book film of all time this is how you make a film that pits superheroes against each other bravo marvel studios well done
May 6 2016,positive,you go see this movie because you are invested in the mcu and it doesnt disappoint the set pieces are big and the new players are fantastic spidermanholland and black pantherboseman are spectacular while spiderman pretty much steals the show like everyone was hoping for the wait for homecoming will border on unbearable after his scenes because they were just that good  evans and downey play their roles flawlessly and really just seem like they embody everything about their characters the one liners as expected are spot on funny and really add an extra dimension that bvs wasnt able to capitalize on the action scene at the airport is everything it was billed to be and more the russo brothers never stop hitting you with great action scene after scene and the dialogue is just spot on as you would expect it is definitely is a top tier offering from marvel and it is one of their best for me it is just not as focused as winter solider which is my favorite mcu movie there is a lot going on and im sure my second viewing will allow me to take it all in better dont wait go see this movie you wont regret it
May 6 2016,positive,one of the best marvel movies yet its very difference from the civil war comic but every bit as good
May 6 2016,positive,yes spiderman is the best part of the movie a solid followup to the winter soldier but ultimately does not live up
May 6 2016,positive,amazing marvel is at the top of their craft they do almost everything perfectly
May 6 2016,positive,the movie had its interesting moments but tends to get long and redonedant the surprise character of spiderman turned out to look more like an unexperienced overly eager kid did nothing really to convince me he was a superhero this movie can easily be watched on dvd so no rush to spend your money at the theater
May 6 2016,positive,great movie exceeds all expectations
May 6 2016,positive,for everyone who said that age of ultron was just a rehash of the first avengers film this is for you character development motives that make sense the perfect balance of screen time for all heroes every action scene was amazing all the humor resonated this is the best avengers film to date well worth the watch
May 6 2016,positive,the russo brothers do it again  
May 6 2016,positive,amazing thats all i have to say
May 6 2016,positive,super nice just enough humor great action introduction of black panther was very well done gave just enough to have fans asking for more
May 6 2016,positive,a little slow in the beginning but the airport battle scene definitely makes up for it
May 6 2016,negative,ridiculous plot one of the worst marvel movies i have seen
May 6 2016,positive,honestly wonderful so much happening in this movie but they are able to make it all feel so natural i loved it the introduction of the new characters couldnt have been done better cant wait to see it again
May 6 2016,positive,hands down the best the mcu has to offer by pitting our heroes against each other 100100
May 6 2016,positive,united we stand divided we fall  this is my first time writing a review for a movie reviewing this movie as the first time i ever review a movie its an honor now i will not compare this to batman v superman even if i want to as a person who loves marvel but also respects dc captain america civil war is my favorite mcu film since captain america the winter soldier i gotta say that captain america is the only marvel franchise or even superhero movie franchise where the sequels get better hands down to the russo brothers they understand how to direct action and in which direction it needs to go what i liked about this movie in particular is that it didnt rely on too much backstory just 1 or 2 minutes to reinforce somebodys backstory it relies on the other mcu movies for backstory even the newcomer to the mcu black panther played by chadwick boseman who was pretty awesome the new batman of the mcu doesnt get a backstory but you can understand why he is involved and why he is on the side that he is in spiderman also doesnt rely on backstory because everybody knows who is spiderman played by tom holland just your friendly neighborhood and tom holland was my favorite spiderman that i have ever seen i dont want to say that he is the best because not everybody has seen this movie but the majority of people would agree with me i am positive everybody is complaining that tom holland looks young and he sounds like every kid on call of duty and i must say that theres some truth in that but peter parker is 16 yearsold in this universe  even though this movie looks like an avengers movie it is more of a captain america sequel in the sense that the civil war part doesnt come until the second half but again this is a positive not a negative as this movie is well balanced  now the first half of the movie was all about the drama and about what is happening with the government and these superheroes and i would say that the first half kind of drags because it isnt all action although there are some pretty neat and polished action sequences and that is what i love about the russo brothers that they can definitely do action so well and you know that if youve seen the previous captain america i gotta give a round of applause to the stunts team because they did a pretty great job i walked in this movie being teamironman but then i was shifting sides as both tony stark and steve rogers kept bringing up great points another reason i loved this movie is that the audience who have picked sides have inner conflicts so points of view shift all the time as i stated earlier this is ultimately a captain america sequel so this half focuses on finding bucky because he was framed for committing a terrorist act and the authorities are after him  the second half of the movie is where the civil war stuff happens iron man has had enough of disobedience by cap and his team this is my favorite half because it has the greatest superhero throwdown ever and that is the airport scene from the trailers where it is just packed with as many superheroes as marvel could afford which i am not mad about because most of the characters there we had previous movies made to care about them and then theres spiderman one of my favorite characters in the movie paul rudd as antman was hilarious and was great standing toetotoe with spidey what i loved about this action seen is did not focus too much on cap and iron man that is a later sequence  everybody had their time to shine and spidey acts like such a geek in this movie i couldnt help but clap at tom hollands portrayal of the wallcrawler  now for the negative which isnt much marvel spends too much time in making the superheroes great that they forget about the villains which are played by actors that i really like the villain is played by daniel brühl who i like and i must say he wasnt bad in the thing but the villain didnt play well into this story but i can understand his motivations like everyone else in the film and earlier i said how the first half kind of drags but thats pretty much it for the bad stuff  i truly recommend this movie to pretty much everybody i guarantee that even if youre not a superhero movie fan but just a fan of good movies with a little bit of welltimed humor youre gonna like this movie and i would rate civil war a 10 out of 10 shields this was the best way for marvel to kickstart phase three of the mcu and i would recommend watching it on cinemas especially for the airport scene   i am sorry if i was being confusing again this is my first review ever and thanks for reading this have a good day everyone
May 6 2016,negative,i felt like my money was wasted visually stunning but i felt as though there was something left out if you want to see characters fight and little story line this is the film for you
May 6 2016,positive,enjoyed the movie
May 6 2016,positive,the russo brothers has done what i thought to be an arduous task of bringing in action and emotion into a film with umpteen characters the direction is impeccable  well paced and walks the fine line between perspective changes the most important thing that worked for me in this film is the ability to bring in different  perspectives into the picture and keeping all of them intact this didnt just chose sides at the end but showed all of them  it is just incredible that they could be extremely subtle with the line the script is brilliantly written for the most part  it is well staged and dialogue really flows  the drama provides a perfect padding and boosting to the action sequences and vice versa with the exception of certain plot holes in the handling of its villain  the script was compact and provided overall arcs to all of its characters the characters are brilliantly portrayed  robert downey jr as tony stark has pulled the single greatest performance in comic book genre along with heath ledger in the dark knight  sebastian stan as bucky gave a formidable winter soldier and i thought the writer and the director really played this character well  i felt they showed here how power the character was and his ability to provide a clear motivation in morality  chris evans as steve rogers was at par with tony stark and i must give credit to the russos for taking bold steps with the characters that could have gone disastrous in the hands of other directors the story took captain to literally the edge of the line to generate the maximum emotional response the overall story shows a complex dynamic between these three characters and the spine of the script  the debut of black panther in the mcu was impeccable and provides the third perspective to the movie  i felt black panther plays the more introspective view of the audience and the neutral side probably the one the audience would feel as well when all the known characters side up against each other he is well written and brilliantly played by chadwick boseman  the film doesnt go much into the background of the character but gave us enough to help the cause of this storyline   bosemans portrayal with a distinctive accent  a fighting style and movement draws parallel with andy serkis as gollum from the lord of the rings in terms of creating a new personality through rigorous method  his relation with the pictures leads is the foundation on which events transpire other characters like antony mackies falcon and elizabeth olsens scarlet witch has been significantly improved from the previous films  there are other dynamics at play here between tony stark and the debutant tom hollands spiderman  paul bettanys vision and olsens witch many would argue that this portrayal of spiderman is the definitive one  the character doesnt go into any origins story but feeds on the previous tales  tom hollands portrayal of teenage angst and nuances along with his extremely hilarious interaction with robert downey jr provided a layer that the character never had before  it makes it more rounded and i am surprised how the russos used them in the movie  at times i was feeling why would spiderman go into a civil war specially being so young but i felt the script handled it well and stopped when it required bettanys and olsens dynamics was ingenuous and unpredictable at the same time  after the age of ultron  we are offered more insight into the personalities and i thought it really layered the film  the script really did a remarkable job of binding characters together  coming to the action  probably one of the best action sequence is cinema history is within civil war first of all the movie has a lot of action set pieces in between the drama but the emotion and motivation that underlines the action bolsters it to a great effect every action set piece has a specific purpose and it sticks to it  the introductory action set piece has a very james bond opening sequence appeal to it with lots of handheld camera movements it provided as a brilliant setup for establishing character moments that alone would have been a highlight of any other movie  but the sequences in the middle section and the one specifically at the end the airport sequence will make the history books  its an extravaganza that will bring forth repeated viewings  i have never seen such an array of lead characters being played out in such style in front of the screen  every character had a moment in that action sequence with adequate and appropriate humour and signature stunt traits the suits looked amazing  the visuals were top notch and the set piece was brilliantly staged it certainly feels a lot of work has been put into it  it felt more like a war and not just as a dispute  for those that loves the colorful pages of the comic books coming to life  the airport sequence will be the zenith of it   marvel has really upped the game  there are some negatives especially in the form of plot holes when it comes to the main antagonist and the first fart of the film might be a little slow to few also marvel has the tendency to under emphasize the use of original score  but the negatives dont stand up to the huge emotional and adrenaline response it generates   honestly this film would have been one of the best without any villain  this is a film of heroes vs heroes  overall it is a brilliant piece of storytelling and one of the best superhero film if not the best  it is tonally exquisite and would ensure large number of repeated viewings all over the world  as a person leaving the theatre  one cant help but feel slightly torn and cant wait for the next array of movies to see which direction the mcu takes   some enthusiasts may feel like nostalgic since iron man 2008  and even before   at the end though  one can safely say  wow  that was a movie worth going  it was a journey worth taking
May 6 2016,positive,what can i say   1010 for action  1010 for entertainment  marvel does it again
May 6 2016,positive,even though its 25 hours long theres never any down time its great from start to finish absolutely amazing marvel and  the russo brothers once again prove why they are on top of the box office best marvel movie to date
May 6 2016,positive,the movie was very entertaining to say the least who wouldnt want to see spiderman and black panther viewing this movie three times i had focus on three aspects of the movie first was the entertainment which exceeded my already high expectations with added humor that was a bit too much in certain sequences which didnt ruin the movie experience with already established comedic based characters in my second viewing i focused on the plot the motives of the characters which was clear there is a villian that felt like he was was a bit rushed which was a bit disappointing givin the fact that hes such a great actor  the plotholes that were clearly visible in my third viewing finally i focused on the portayal the convincing emotions that the actors brought was simply just not that impressive in other words not convincing enough to the plot excluding robert downey jr who was as always great with his acting but the rest wasnt that convincing overall i thoroughly enjoyed my viewing im pretty sure you will best comicbook movie ever no but thats for another discussion
May 6 2016,positive,absolutely phenomenalhands down marvels best movie yet arguably the best super hero movie in creation up to this point
May 6 2016,positive,one of the best mcu films to date and one of the best comic book movies ever marvel studios once again delivers great characters in incredible action within a well guided story civil war is a game changer in many ways from the impact of the events to the mcu going forward and how comic book movies will be handled overall it balances so much on its plate to perfection while you never feel any character has drawn the short straw the introductions of both spiderman and black panther were off the charts
May 6 2016,positive,a good entertaining movie while it was kinda of a mindless battle in the airport it was visually spectacular the plot was intriguing throughout until the end where it fell flat for me nonetheless this was to me the best avengers movie to date also spiderman was awesome
May 6 2016,positive,great movie wonderfully done  for the critics that said the story was poor  like kyle smith of the ny post shame on you if you watch any of the other movies youd know the story great and connects all the pieces together even ties into the last scene from antman the movie is a fun ride and enjoyable from the time it starts only flaw spoiler alert is that a maria tomei should not be playing aunt may sorry aunt wasnt hot she was a nice old lady this is the movie we wanted back when the age of ultron came out def worth seeing
May 6 2016,positive,a true legitimate contender for the best or one of the best films in the marvel cinematic universe by marvel studios
May 6 2016,positive,captain america civil war one of the best marvel movies to date
May 6 2016,positive,i have been a fan of captain america since i was a kid and read all the comics this movie brings a lot of comic history together introduces the civil war series and has a few hidden gems for comic readers and non readers  this movie is likely the 3rd best work done yet  you will not be disappointed
May 6 2016,positive,loved it  love the plot the acting the actors just love
May 6 2016,positive,while probably not my favorite movie of the mcu that would still be tws or gotg civil war will go down as one of the best super hero movies of all time this is a nice adaptation that is pretty far from the comics but makes sense in the universe we currently have spiderman and antman really steal the show when on screen as well as black panther and falcon loved it
May 6 2016,negative,crap typical tooty fruity coloured cheese
May 6 2016,positive,every time i walk into a marvel movie its with a mixture of overwhelming excitement and a tinge of fear will this be the movie when they finally let me down captain america civil war had the highest potential to do so cramming a roster of a dozen super heroes into a fight against not only a bunch of bad guys but each other    and yet a movie could not have been put in more capable hands the russo brothers veterans of working with ensemble casts community arrested development and marvel cinematic alumni writers markus and mcfeely together manage to do what might seem an impossible task throw a ton of bigplayers on the screen and still give each of them a unique voice and a moment to shine without feeling like a haphazard decoupage of suits and powers    still the movie is very anchored into its staples steve rogers and tony stark each of them so thoroughly explored that this movie very much feels like the melding of winter soldier 2 and ironman 4 rather than avengers 3 civil war manages to bring more character development to these two players than marvel has been able to accomplish since the first ironman but its fantastic that at the same time it manages to lay the foundation so well for two brandnew heroes to the mcu that already have heart and coolfactor off the charts this movie generates tons of excitement for the next avengers films but not because it has to throw so much screen time at doing so but because it affirms that those movies are in such capable hands with its creative team    captain america civil war is not only a nearperfect super hero movie its an amazingly and surprisingly grounded characterdriven film that while very different could go down in history among the ranks of the dark knight
May 6 2016,positive,this is one of the better marvel films  it bites off a lot of items  continuing the winter soldier plot introducing black panther introducing spiderman continuing the avengers plot bring antman into the greater fold  but without succumbing to the too many plot lines issue that buries so many comic book sequels  it even manages to work in a climax that does not involve blue light shining up into the sky and all the heroes fighting hordes of enemies  its not as good as the previous captain america film and nowhere near as refreshing as guardians of the galaxy but it delivers what a film like this should and it does it well
May 6 2016,positive,where do all the really good villains go
May 6 2016,positive,lots of bromoments throughout the movie  black panther kicked ass  spiderman was a good addition  this version has potential aunt may got hotter  too bad one of the fight scenes towards the end was too dark
May 6 2016,positive,ridiculously good best avengers movie yet
May 6 2016,positive,this movie was incredible every superhero has their own part in this movie
May 6 2016,positive,definitely worth the hype and rushing to theaters on the first day action packed and wow moments throughout marvel got it right on this one like few others in the past if not all
May 6 2016,positive,much better than bvs
May 6 2016,positive,i will see this film again and again audience reactions are awesome specially with this kind of epicness i was seriously in awe for a major moment of the film
May 6 2016,positive,my favorite superhero film in the current age of the everexpanding marvelverse  other than the delightfully irreverent variants like antman deadpool and guardians of the galaxy  has been captain america the winter soldier in that movie the fantastical comicbook elements that normally numb the brain through ceaseless and expanding repetition were for once grounded in details relevant to the world in which we live suddenly the titular character was fighting for a cause in which the stakes were high  preventing an nsalike entity from excessive datamining  yet comprehensible in human terms and therefore meaningful in both avengers films  the second one even more so than the first  extraterrestrial and dimensional forces threatened our world with domination and destruction how many times can global disaster be averted before it feels boring rather than frightening in that sense though the final dark knight film was a bit tiresome as well christopher nolans series was to me more palatable as the director kept the stakes earthbound unlike this years batman v superman if every time its the end of the world and we know it then i dont feel that fine in cinematic terms anyway    this is the age of the tentpole franchise what can you do stop going to the movies thats an option but if the reason you go to the multiplex is for spectacle then captain america civil war delivers the goods as well as could be hoped in fact to be fair its better than most of the competition and in imax 3d to boot it has a decent cast and a compelling enough story unless one is just exhausted by all the mayhem what it is not however is a film solely about captain america that squarejawed genetically modified refugee from a time gone by frozen in ice at the end of his first adventure and then defrosted in our modern era at the start of his second though this new film is directed by the same brothers anthony and joe russo who gave us winter soldier and though captain americas particular moral dilemma is the one that mostly drives the plot this is really avengers 3 battle of the brawn one wonders if perhaps the russos were not working out their personal demons as the plot pits spiritual brother against brother and one sister as the fate of  yes the world  hangs in the balance    the movie begins with an avengers mission that leaves many civilians dead this time the governments of the planet decide that the collateral damage is not acceptable and heads of state gather to formulate a series of accords to check the use of power and might by these superpowered agents of ostensible good the civil war refers to the fact that not all erstwhile partners agree on whether to sign these accords or not into this mix comes bucky barnes  aka the winter soldier of the previous film  captain americas childhood friend whom our hero tried to deprogram last time around buckys in hiding but when he supposedly carries out a terrorist attack the avengers have one more issue that tears them further apart since some think him guilty while others support the cap along the way there are some attempts at weighty dialogue about the nature of good and evil and shades in between as well as some philosophizing about how power should be used responsibly the movie works best in some of its action sequences however  the simpler ones like a brilliant car chase in bucharest  than when it tries too hard to be consequential since ultimately it sheds any relevance to our actual world when it morphs into a slugfest between former friends    chris evans is back as captain americasteve rogers joined by robert downey jr as iron mantony stark scarlett johansson as black widownatasha romanoff and most of the rest of the gang from previous avengers films but not thor and not the hulk we do get a new superhero black panther played by chadwick boseman 42  very good  and a new spiderman played by tom holland in the heart of the sea who is not bad except that he is the third iteration of that character in the last 15 years talk about repetition paul rudd shows up once more as antman in my favorite cameo of the movie and the list goes on its a cornucopia of superriches and if thats your thing then this is your movie and even if this is no longer really my thing the movie was by no means unentertaining call that a very qualified recommendation then and go throw your dollars at the screen to ensure that we never escape from marvel martyrdom
May 6 2016,positive,this was a roller coaster of a movie  this is what batman v superman wishes it was    1 star because disney
May 6 2016,positive,in my humble opinionthis is one of the top 3 best superhero movies ever made this movie was everything i could have asked for really so many of these giant blockbuster movies are action and spectacle first and while this movie has without a doubt the best superhero action scenes ever this is about the characters first you care more about these characters in this movie than any other mcu installment by a mile and its wonderful im so glad that the russo brothers are in charge of directing the biggest movies going forward im going to go see this at least 2 more times
May 6 2016,positive,awesome extremely well done what batman v superman could have been
May 6 2016,positive,good story line great action and laugh out loud funny   what these superhero movies are supposed to 
May 6 2016,positive,emotion and conflict are what drives this marvel staple from beginning to end along with some of the best action youll ever see in these movies
May 6 2016,positive,the is one of my favorite comic book films the movie had the best action sequence in any comic book movie to date  the cast story and cinematography was amazing kudos to the russo brothers
May 6 2016,positive,marvel is the best there is at what they do and what they do is epic cinematic experience civil war is 1010
May 6 2016,positive,awesome movie from start to the end
May 6 2016,positive,i loved black panther spidey and ant manstory could have been worked a bit more i felt they were trying too hard to make the action too intense by speeding the frames up didnt allow you to process what was happening but all in all i still enjoyed it
May 6 2016,positive,it was amazing you have to see it best one to date
May 6 2016,positive,to me the greatest super hero movie so far
May 6 2016,positive,amazing movie  done  the story build up as phenomenal and it keeps doing it  love it
May 6 2016,positive,so so good an absolute must see best mcu film yet and black panther is incredible as is spidey
May 6 2016,positive,this film is an example of what happens when studios actually care about their blockbuster characters
May 6 2016,positive,very well put together
May 6 2016,positive,entertaining enough after a slow start and just about manage to contain all the different characters and make them relevant

May 6 2016,positive,wayyy better than age of ultron
May 6 2016,positive,so many spoilers spoilers    marvel made some great films like guardians of the galaxythe avengersiron manwinter soldier and antman but they also made some mediocre ones like thor the dark worldiron man 23 and the incredible hulk and also the disappointing film avengersweak of ultron so civil war where do i need to put this in the great category of coursethis by far marvels strongest film better than the winter soldieryeah i said itsome people may prefer winter soldier but for me is better than that    the charactersthey are all greatthey where given enough time to shine especially spiderman you wont be disappointed with black panther cause he is also greatthe new characters are great and i like to see them their upcoming filmsiron mantony stark is amazingit felt like iron man 1he regrets everything that he has done and thats why they need to put in checkcaptain america is the same boy scout that you know and chris evans still nails it as the guy who dress up as a flagand again the other avengers where given the time to shinethe real villain zemo is the first villain in the mcu that is just some guy who has a plan to tear the avengers apart and put some layers of the character but the villain is forgettablei hope they use him and set him up as bigger threat in in some of the future marvel films cause he is not yet deadhe almost try to kill himself but black panther saved him    the action scenes are fantastic well some of the scenes felt too shaky but that was just one scene where buckyblack panther and captain america chase scenethe best fight for me was cap vs iron man scene in the final action scene in the filmwhere iron man founds the truth that the winter soldier killed his parents and cap tries to save bucky from tonythe fight was amazing and i love to see it againthe second one was the airport fight sequenceit was the best part of the film where the superhero vs superhero fight happenedthe fight sequences where handled pretty well and they give emphasis of the heroes abilities and spidermans quipslet me go on fanboying about spidermanhe is great and tom holland is the best spidermanpeter parker better than the tobey and andrews versionhe is given time and makes me smile when he appears in the airport fight sequencehe is also talkative and throw a lot of quips and i like itmy other favorite characterantman grows big like in the comics first time on screenso the action sequences are great and the russo brothers really knows to do action    the different ideologies between cap and iron man are handle wellthe sokovia accords thing where they need to be under the eyes of the government and the avengers id not anymore a private agency was handled wellthe setup of why cap and tony fight was handled greatly and they take time to emphasize their different ideologiesthe 2nd major one was buckybuck is huge in the conflicthe was framed by zemo and make tchalla thinks that bucky killed his father with a bomb while in the united nationsthe whole government think of thatcap founds out about zemo and wants to find him to know the truth and making them split in to two groups teamcap and teamiron man leading up to the airport fightwhere they know where zemo is heading and all of team cap was there to go with him but team iron man founds them and the fight begins okay i am now explaining the plot but seriously it was handled greatly and make sense cause we know why they fight and why they where splityou will be confused of which side are you on cause both men are right in their respective ideologiesmarvel did a great job between the punisher and daredevils ideologies and why not do a great one in civil war    so captain americacivil war is marvels strongest film with a plot that workscharacters that we love emphasizes their abilities and powers and stay lovable action sequences that was fun to watchit destroys age of ultron and is the best movie in the caps trilogythis is a fun summer moviei recommend this
May 6 2016,positive,i just saw cap vs iron man in civil war and dc should crawl under a rock never to return very different from the comic version in fact i used to be on caps side in the comics because lets face it the superhuman registration act was a racial law but on tonys side in the movie because caps position was bullshit feel free to call me out on that aside for that and a couple of characters clearly shoehorned in it was an excellent movie with a good plot if a bit convoluted where you mostly cant tell whats going to happen one scene to the next the captain america series is proving to be the strongest in the marvel lineup go watch it
May 6 2016,positive,fun times at the movies marvel keeps hittingem out of the park good luck dc youre definitely going to need it
May 6 2016,positive,cap civil war is by far and away the best of the marvel saga so far heavy realistic emotional addresses difficult subjects with grace and beauty and yet still be able to make you laugh beyond incredible beautiful and utterly faultless
May 6 2016,positive,another home run by marvel or more like a grand slam  definitely go see this
May 6 2016,positive,maybe it was the timing released after bvs i might have been desensitized from all the superhero action scenes that i had enough braincells to pay attention to the story which i thought was not that tightnot bad but not all that a tad clumsy pehaps  the handtohand combat has levelled up spiderman and antman added some icing on the cake downey delivers as expected but here his brilliance was released albeit brieflyl still good fun though so i recommend it
May 6 2016,positive,fun and amazing movie
May 6 2016,positive,different in the best ways possible really enjoyed it
May 6 2016,positive,airport fight scene is one of the best ive seen ever
May 6 2016,positive,what a story to be told
May 6 2016,positive,one of the best movie of marvelspidey and blakpanther are amazingboth after and post credit scene are amazing
May 6 2016,negative,its was okay ill see it again bvs was a more realistic better movie imo
May 6 2016,positive,great a must watch
May 6 2016,positive,marvel sure has things figured out which is a statement likely made in recent years by many a movie fan  and the folks at dc  with a few expletives thrown in for emphasis if there were any lingering doubt it has certainly been erased by captain america civil war pg13 226 while the dc extended universe has had moderate success with their early films featuring and bringing together their stable of comic book characters the marvel cinematic universe began phase three of its grand plan with civil war the 13th mcu movie and is making money almost faster than the government can print it while the first two avengers movies sit comfortably in the top 10 on the list of alltime box office champs worldwide dcs batman v superman dawn of justice doesnt even make the top 40 civil war made over 250 million worldwide before its first full day in us theaters  and even before opening in huge countries like china and india the films opening week receipts in several countries is second alltime only to avengers age of ultron and its trailer is second only to star wars the force awakens in online views but does this captain america film deserve such attention and success    captain america civil war is the third and planned to be the final captain america feature but also feels a lot like a third avengers movie with its many characters  and its plot which continues storylines from the most recent installment of each of those film series this film picks up about a year after the avengers defeated a populicidal sentient computer program which tony stark accidentally unleashed in avengers age of ultron captain america  steve rogers chris evans black widow scarlett johansson falcon anthony mackie and scarlet witch elizabeth olsen are in lagos nigeria trying to stop brock rumlow frank grillo from stealing and making off with a dangerous biological weapon in the ensuing melee one of the avengers trying to save the life of one of the others accidentally causes the deaths of several foreign aid workers     after all the death and destruction inadvertently caused the last time that the avengers were out saving the world from ultron lagos proves to be the proverbial last straw for worried world leaders and their planned remedy bitterly divides the avengers the us secretary of state thaddeus ross william hurt presents the group with an ultimatum  sign the newlynegotiated sokovia accords putting the avengers under the control of the united nations  or retire as they discuss their options this disparate group of superheroes quickly divides into opposing camps tony stark  iron man robert downey jr speaks for lieutenant rhodes don cheadle and others who believe they should submit themselves to this international oversight cap speaks for falcon anthony mackie and those who believe that they can only effectively protect people when they can operate unfettered so the battle lines are drawn    almost 200 nations and some of the avengers sign the agreement but its quickly put to the test when a bombing compels some of the avengers to act the accused terrorist is none other than caps old very old friend bucky barnes aka the winter soldier sebastian stan cap wants to bring bucky in safely before any of buckys triggerhappy pursuers catch up to him cap gets just enough help to accomplish his goal but it turns out that bucky is merely a pawn in a much larger game run by baron zemo daniel brühl as the plot unfolds the avengers duke it out with both old friends and new ones joining the fray    captain america civil war is an exciting and very satisfying entry into the marvel cinematic universe the movie has plenty of highstakes globetrotting heroonhero action and it also has a lot of heart if you think back to the first individual mcu films with iron man and captain america it may seem counterintuitive for stark to support restrictions on the avengers while cap refuses to be a good soldier and get with the program but we see that each of them have very clear and very personal motivations for taking the positions that they take the same is true for the other frenemy combatants some of which elicited cheers from the audience when they first appeared on screen of course if you paid attention to the films ubiquitous trailers andor took a good look at its posters you know which avengers are present which are missing and which are new but just in case you dont know i wont spoil it all ill say is that marvel has cast and established all of these characters exceptionally well    the action acting and directing are all top notch but this films main strength is its smart script the characters personalities powers and previous activities are remarkably consistent in their presentation and are seamlessly blended in a big but simple story which makes sense and gives each character his or her due the dialog is a great combination of insightful fun and funny the movie seems to borrow from the bourne movies certain revenge flicks and escape plan while the story is similar to dcs 2016 heroagainsthero film batman v superman dawn of justice but captain america civil war does it better and has a dynamic and tone all its own itll entertain fanboys and average movie fans alike a
May 6 2016,positive,simply put epic everything you want from a comic book movie marveldoesitagain
May 6 2016,positive,aunt may for the win my only complaint was the title of the movie but other than that perfect
May 6 2016,positive,thought provoking action pack and absolutely by far the best marvel film to date everything viewers begged for was delivered ten fold eye popping special effects along with a great script made this avengers spin off the platform for how a film which promises over a dozen exciting cameo can also tell a story that doesnt reach beyond the viewers grasp each moment civil war unveils kept my full attention thank goodness for once the depiction of spiderman was spot on this is a must see and im looking for an excuse to watch it again my most anticipated film of 2016 delivers the goods and fans and newcomers alike will be dying for more
May 6 2016,positive,absolutely masterful
May 6 2016,positive,every single hero gets to shine on this one plus one of the best filmed  action packed and interesting fight scenes i have ever seen in a monie let alone a super hero movie maresi tomei as aunt may umm welli like her as an actress and all but maybe a future love interest for tony stark is my bet
May 6 2016,negative,spiderman was the best part  tons of plot holes repetitive fight scenes def not better than winter soldier   so done with buckys storyline  done  also end credit scenes yyyaaawwnnn  lol 
May 6 2016,positive,yes this may be my favorite marvel movie ever
May 6 2016,positive,damn great comic movie  these captain america movies are getting better each time
May 6 2016,positive,i wouldnt call it the best marvel movie so far but it did exceed my expectentions a lot 1010
May 6 2016,positive,just as good  in some ways better than winter soldier with solid dramatic themes it is easy to identity with either side so choosing and staying with one wont be easy    some unnecessary shakycam  closeup scenes but the action was very tight  well choreographed although it can feel a little disjointed at times it does juggle in the new characters well  with plenty of humor at times     it will help to revisit captain america winter soldier  avengers age of ultron if its been a while since youve seen them    this definitely ranks in the top 5 best superhero movies ever
May 6 2016,positive,spoilers ahead      okay should you see this movie yes should you see it on the big screen yeswas it perfect no    civil war had an amazing story it has amazing acting but it has one of my biggest hates of movies today and that is a camera that shakes now i get that it makes you feel like youre there but being a guy with poor eyesight and dyslexia it makes the movie hard to watch at parts does it kill the movie no    all of the characters were written great except antman and the bad guy antman was funny at parts but it really felt forced on me to be funny i dont blame the writers because it hard to write a comedic hero with all these mostly serious heros did he kill the movie not at all just some lines were questionable now the bad guy on the other hand we didnt know anything about him till about the end and why he hates the avengers i dont remember his name but some how a building killed his family and the avengers are to blame for that also maybe its just me but i couldnt remember who the bad guy was there are many different people in this movie who could have been him but i couldnt keep it right did it kill the movie no but it didnt make the movie    over all i think this was a great movie with another great one on the way
May 6 2016,positive,i honestly dont think i could have enjoyed this movie more  it was a fun ride that had you questioning who to root for  im team iron man but it was a difficult choice at times  i was lucky enough to enjoy it with an audience full of huge marvel fans which made it extra fun with the loud reactions from the audience
May 6 2016,positive,if ive ever enjoyed a movie more thoroughly than this one i dont remember when simultaneously the most complex and actionpacked superhero movie yet
May 6 2016,positive,not only the best in the marvel cinematic series this is one of the best superhero movies of all time
May 6 2016,positive,fans are delighted im more interested about the small steps forward concerning balance between aesthetics and technics mainly in the first scenes of the movie as simple as beautifully choreographed
May 6 2016,positive,masterful very impressive such a deep movie with so many opportunities for failure  but it hits on every opportunity with resounding success  the best marvel movie to date
May 6 2016,positive,boasting a cast the size of china civil war achieves the impossible task of keeping the focus where it should be not the size of its heroes but their hearts complex in all the right ways dark when it needs to be and tragic everywhere in between handled with such care and love that not only shows an incredible understanding of who these heroes are  but a real commitment to make them exactly who they are under the suits     every player gives it their all and it shows however its the new recruits who threaten to steal the film panther succeeds in being something the audience hasnt seen before while being a impressive and awe inspiring force and lets just say that tom holland is closing in on the best live action spider man were ever going to get hollands iteration of the web slinger brings a wonderful levity to the move as a youthful wise cracking teenager but again its his heart that makes him a stand out    while not as well paced as its predecessor and having another weak villain civil war achieves something different when these mighty heroes clash its an amazing spectacle for sure but it isnt something easy to watch nor root for because under the guise of a superhero film captain america 3 is a story about friendship vengeance and standing up for what you think is right no matter what
May 6 2016,positive,if the hulk was everything bad about marvel put into a movie this is everything good about marvel put into a movie  it successfully accomplishes three tasks be funny action packed and morally sophisticated  i cannot think of a movie that accomplishes all three so well  oh and if i may bring up another poor movie to compare this movie to remember spiderman 3  i watched that thinking that this is why you cant have a movie with too many characters  it gets confusing and you cant develop each character given the limited screen time and story scope  this movie proved that idea wrong given that there are 12 avengers in the big battle and somehow this movie effectively deals with all of them  long story short well done stan lee well done
May 6 2016,positive,not much to say but that it is spectacular if there is anything you can nitpick about this movie you might need to rethink your life and relax because it is flawless
May 6 2016,positive,this movie epitomizes why at least for now marvel is dominating the comic book franchise war thats not to say at all that dc puts out crappy movies they are two different companies that pair with different studios and have different visions for their movies however to get my point across ill at least give a reason behind my point     at the end of the day dc movies seem more like the overly serious buff guy at the gym flexing his muscles in the mirror movies like batman vs superman seem to flex their muscles to impress people but ultimately lose their wow factor by losing their intelligence and what feels like storytelling that is not as passionate where marvel movies feel more like the outgoing fun guy at the office who can get down to business but also knows how to have fun when its appropriate captain america is the prime example of this theory its serious when it needs to be and trust me shit gets so serious you probably couldnt cut the tension with a 2 ton knife on the other hand though the movie can be very light hearted and funny and never takes itself entirely too seriously which leaves for a lot of laughs and fun scenes the audience can chew on    1010 i absolutely recommend seeing this movie as soon as possible
May 6 2016,neutral,blah blah blahtoo much time talking about why they are on different sides best parts were with spiderman and antman they provided some much needed comic relief  the story dragged on too long and the action scenes were totally predictable and repetitive
May 6 2016,positive,civil war is so freakin spectacular i cant even explain it couldnt get any better than this definitely became one of my top 5 favorites film of alltime
May 6 2016,positive,omg thats all i have to say
May 6 2016,positive,part avengers and part winter soldier the only draw back to civil war is that all of its surprises were spoiled by the promotional trailers
May 6 2016,positive,just got back watching captain america civil war with the familia  it was awesome  best marvel movie other than deadpool all i can say is spiderman  antman is so funny
May 6 2016,positive,amazing movie entertaining to the max with a good story great characters fun comedy and unbelievable action my first time watching i was blown away not just because of the action and comedy but it just all felt so perfect and i didnt have any issues with the movie it had a great story and good debates and conflicts i think this is easily the best fun superhero popcorn flick and my second favorite if you are taking the movie seriously after the dark knight trilogy    the action omg it had every kind that you want chase scenes gun fights hand to hand combat super powers everything it was so exciting and intense creative and ridiculously well done so many stunning scenes and moments like how did they do that or make it look that real     its really amazing that we live in an age where we can have a movie with all these different superheroes in it and not only does it look real but its also really good 8 viewings      spoilers      this movie has three of my all time favorite action sequences the apartment escapestreet running the airport scene and the final battle all jawdropping    and what a great completely unexpected twistish reveal at the end with tonys parents such a great moment an omg its about to go down moment    i really liked how the movie went in directions that i wasnt expecting after the big battle i thought they were going to make up and be friends again to team up against the other 5 winter soldiers but the bad guys plan was way better restarted the civil war and had the movie end with them still at odds setting up future movie conflicts and resolutions    while i was watching it i was wondering who would be on which side and the only ones i thought i knew were iron man and captain america but they ended up being on the opposite side of what i expected but they both made perfect sense captain america went through the same stuff with hydra and shield it makes sense that he doesnt trust bureaucrats and politicians to make decisions and iron mans side makes sense given past movies and how he feels guilty and responsible for so much it may not have been addressed a lot in this movie but it has been in previous movies    so many good characters and i dont just mean awesome superheroes i mean the actual characters and their development and arcs    i really liked everything about the introduction of spiderman including the actor i am now super excited to see the new movie and it was reaffirmed to me that spiderman is my favorite superhero because i was just so excited to see him even over all these other awesome superheroes would have been amazing if i didnt know he was in it but i didnt know about anyone other than cap iron man spiderman i was guessing it would have falcon and war machine i didnt know it had everyone else especially black panther and antman black panther is badass and antman was hilarious
May 6 2016,positive,really good but almost too much
May 6 2016,negative,please stop making these movies
May 6 2016,neutral,there was so much hype for this movie but i guess i let it get to me because i was kinda let down it was a good action flick but not as grand as i hoped you could take spiderman out of it and it wouldnt affect the story at all i feel he was put in there just for fan service and to build up his solo film it was a decent portrayal of him though but i really wish we could not have teenage spidey for once i wish he was as old as he was in the cw comic he acted like a kid in a toy store you have a metal arm thats so cool he just got kind of annoying to me after a while and i know it doesnt make since he annoyed me but i wish he was in it longer at least long enough to feel conflicted about which side hes fighting for the stuff with rhodey was lame the trailers make you think hes dead instead hes paralyzed which is fine i didnt want him to die but he never struggles with his paralysis he seems totally fine with the fact he has to use robotic leg enhancements to walk now and i think stuff like that was my biggest issue with it there was never any real danger never a moment where it made you think it could go south really quick it was the standard straightforward marvel movie someone shouldve died rdj i think gave the best performance in it he was top notch i wouldnt put it passed him to sleep with aunt may either haha vision they pretty much turned into a dad for the avengers dadsweaters and all i think it wouldve been more beneficial to have saved civil war as a standalone film when there could be more characters a fully fleshed out spiderman that will get his iron spider suit limiting this film to just being a cap film i think hurt it i know im going to get flamed for this minireview especially since my name is batmandrew even though i see all marvel films in theaters and enjoy them but whatever this was my honest takeaway from it ill probably see it again with some friends and maybe pick up stuff that i missed but itll be a matinee
May 6 2016,positive,that was an awesome movie
May 6 2016,negative,very boring stupid plot terrible ending
May 6 2016,neutral,saw the movie yesterdaysadly it is worse than the winter soldier for me at least too many inconsistencies sometimes boring there a lot of things that are not well explained i liked antman but wasnt impressed with spiderman even if the actor is ok thoughoverall my feeling is that the directors wanted to do a lot of things but didnt have enough time to and theyve missed the important part of choosing a charismatic bad guy
May 6 2016,positive,this is what a comic book movie should be like time effort and love for their characters was put into one amazing looking blockbuster that might even end up as one of the most iconic comic book movies of all time
May 6 2016,positive,amazingly badass  better than avengers 2 and winter soldier do not leave for both credit scenes
May 6 2016,positive,must see this again before the weekend is over what did i just watch 
May 5 2016,positive,when i first read marvels 2006 civil war comic book event i hated it i hate it even today the reason why is because mark millar who wrote the comic gave the characters such absolutist motivations there was very little subtlety and suddenly you had all these characters doing things that seemed so unlike their character but the biggest offense was that the motivations were so absolutist that killing each other just seemed like it was okay the comic book event turned me off to marvel entirely until marvel studios released iron man in 2008    when they first announced this film i was a little fearful for all the reasons ive mentioned but thankfully marvel studios did not disappoint i was amazed that they had so many characters to juggle but still showcased all their abilities while giving them each a motivation as to why they are on the side they are on i was so glad to actually understand why tony stark would support the accords whereas cap would oppose them neither is right or wrong and i also like the nonabsolutist motivations they are a team who are very close that find themselves in a situation where the world wants to hold the avengers accountable for several catastrophic events its not all black and white theres lots of shades of grey and while i went into the movie being all team cap all the time i could understand why somebody would be team iron man    add to this the stellar debuts of both black panther and spiderman both of whom are spotlighted quite well as is the guest appearance of antman who has honed his skills since his own movie last year each of the characters really get to use their powers in cool ways    and while this movie does have all these avengers in it it really is a captain america movie at its heart its also on some levels an iron man movie but it does feel like a natural transition from winter soldier to civil war captain america civil war is fun and joyous but also has a sense of emotional heaviness as well its a great movie and i cant wait to see it again
May 5 2016,positive,i dont ever give perfect scores because i believe nothing can ever be perfect but this movie is as close to perfect as you can get spidermanid watch that movie over again just to see his scenes he was that good great story telling so happy
May 5 2016,positive,takes a while toget going but once it does it is fun story kinda weak though good laughs and action nice to see a spiderman that actually is a teenager even though he is still too old to be in high school fun movie with the kids
May 5 2016,positive,captain america civil war is less of a captain america movie and more of an avengers movie with the addition of ton stark and company the result is a satisfying action blockbuster with a huge swelling cast of literally almost everyone in the mcu so far  with eyepopping action sequences the only complaints i had is that the camera was a bit too shaky for the opening sequence and tunnel chase and ultimately the movie is too comedic at points for its own good characters make quips and one liners and it really ruins the tension of some of the fight scenes i do liked the addition of so many characters and overall fans of the mcu will enjoy i just wish they would have not tied up things so nice in a bow by films end and perhaps used another plot point that seemed important but then wasnt
May 5 2016,positive,marvel promoted this as a clash of superheroes and it is that  but what it comes down to in the end is human emotion often from unexpected sources yes there are cool explosions but its the characters grief anger and regret that drive the final showdown  that grounding in individual relationships has always been the mcus greatest strength especially where cap and tony are concerned i dont know how they pulled this off but they took a cast of thousands and a really ridiculous explosives budget and somehow turned out a comicbook movie that hits you right in the feels in the best possible way ill be seeing it again and again and again and again you should too
May 5 2016,positive,5 out of 5 hands down the best hero vs hero ever made and yes way better than batman v superman and pretty much the best superhero flick in my opinion
May 5 2016,positive,great movie  marvel has done it again
May 5 2016,positive,best captain america movie by far
May 5 2016,positive,captain america and his team was unbelievable everything you could possibly imagine plus a few surprise guests a mustsee over and over and over again
May 5 2016,positive,perfect 1010 welcome back peter this is how you make a superhero movie take note warner bros before you destroy the dc universe even more
May 5 2016,positive,best marvel movie made yet in my opinion great tone great performances great new characters best on screen spiderman ever awesome action and my favorite movie of the year so far
May 5 2016,positive,it was awesome  stay for 2 clips afterwards 
May 5 2016,positive,captain america civil war really captures the look of what might be one of the best superhero films of all time
May 5 2016,positive,marvel once again delivers an excellent story built upon the characters and friendships weve grown with the past eight years its emotional and tragic and was inevitable its very hilarious and has incredible fight sequences spiderman and black panther were outstanding in their debuts setting up their own feature films somehow the russo brothers balanced every character and paced it to perfection you feel the hurt and feel the fun at the same time this is a perfect superhero movie infinity war is in perfect hands
May 5 2016,positive,best mcu movie ever go see it or ill punch you in the face
May 5 2016,positive,hats off to the russo bros they need to direct every movie from here on
May 5 2016,positive,loved it i definitely agree with all these reviews im seeing saying that it sets a new standard for superhero films not sure how i feel about the new spidey but black panther makes up for it 45 stars
May 5 2016,neutral,ughh so disappointed that cap nor stark died 
May 5 2016,positive,this movie cleared my skin made me lose 10 pounds and saved my life totally recommend captain america fuck iron man
May 5 2016,positive,in my opinion the best captain american mover so far great story amazing graphics and and above all packed full of action

May 5 2016,positive,in my opinion the best captain american mover so far great story amazing graphics and and above all packed full of action
May 5 2016,positive,spider senses are tingling what a ride
May 5 2016,positive,the perfect superhero movie marvel has done it they have figured out how to not only balance and improve the original source material but take a heavy storyline and still make it fun and have me glued to the edge of my seat this is everything i wanted age of ultron to be catch up on the previous movies or dont this movie is atier
May 5 2016,positive,i loved it it was everything i wanted to see the story the action character development the writing the cinematography and the visual effects was amazing directors the russo brothers didnt an incredible job directing this movie they did great with the winter soldier movie and they did it again in civil war movie every marvel characters had their moment you really understood why they wanted to go to war and you really get why tony stark was siding with the government and why steve rogers was against it and you get emotionally invested with them the humor and the drama worked perfectly it didnt feel force honestly i was going in there siding with captain america but after seeing this movie i have no idea what side im on     the airport scene where they were fighting each other was 17 minutes long and it was spectacular it was the best action scene you ever seen in any comic book movie the two great editions in this film was black panther and spiderman i thought black panther was great they did a fantastic job developing his character and understanding his motivation and setting up his standalone movie spiderman to me stole that movie in my opinion tom holland played the best version of peter parkerspiderman the moment hes on screen you instantly love him even though hes only in two scenes of the film but its fantastic and will leave you wanting him more     the one weakness of the film was the villain zemo i honestly thought he didnt need to be there he was just there to be a plot devise to further the story overall this is my favorite marvel film so far i highly recommend rushing out to see this movie i walked out of the theater with a giant smile on my face im see it again multiple times to me this became my top five greatest comic book movie of all time and their are two end credit scenes in the movie
May 5 2016,positive,captain america civil war is a tremendous feat of filmmaking it will leave you breathless it will make you laugh constantly it will make you cheer it will make you think about the positions these characters take and it may put you at odds with a hero you love
May 5 2016,positive,the funniest and most action packed marvel movie to date
May 5 2016,positive,fxxk that last fight scene
May 5 2016,positive,marvel finally delivers after years of shitty b list superhero movies they finally bring it all together pitting old favorites and new comers against each other while still maintains a compelling story the movie is action packed from beginning to end
May 5 2016,positive,i need to pee noooo i cant leave like this you guys are still fighting
May 5 2016,positive,now this is how you make a versus movie
May 5 2016,positive,too long the closeup cgi action scenes were weird and too long parts were funny and entertaining and id probably recommend people see it if they want to see the continuing avenger related movie series but really feel marvel and disney could have done a lot better
May 5 2016,positive,funny w great fight scenes the two new super heroes stole the show
May 5 2016,positive,marvel studios manages to successfully thread together disparate stories while rewriting old ones for their condensed film universe they succeed where other studios fail in that they do not alter the essential spirits of their characters spiderman may have been more himself in this movie than he has been since 2002 spoiler antman finally got big black panther was cool the battle at the airfield made it worth seeing overall it was a pretty good movie the captain america trilogy boasts the best sequels marvel studios has produced
May 5 2016,positive,the following review contains no spoilers    tldr  im not sure if civil war is a perfect movie but it is a perfect comic book movie i honestly believe that years from now this will be considered the empire strikes back of the marvel cinematic universe    bold claims above i know but this movie packs an emotional punch i really dont want to spoil anything but ill say that the state of the mcu at the end of this movie is about the same state that the rebellion is in at the end of episode v hence the reference above im still processing this movie so i dont know if i can definitively rank it with other comic book movies but it might be the best mcu movie so far and it might even be the best comic book movie of all time might like i said im still processing    being a massive comic book fan i personally consider the original civil war storyline to be one of the best stories that marvel has ever published saying that i also have to say that i was extremely satisfied with this film no it doesnt even come close to following the storyline from the comics none of the marvel movies really have but it followed the spirit of the comic perfectly both caps and tonys viewpoints have merit and i feel the story will successfully create a divide among moviegoers just like the original story divided comic book readers while the marketing for this film has been pretty good i know several people who are confused about why they are fighting that will not be the case when you watch this film lines are drawn and they are very clear and everyone will pick a side for a specific reason everyone oh and unlike a certain other superhero fight movie that came out this year cough bvs cough the title fight is a significant portion of this movie and there may be more than one round of fighting    this is marvels most serious movie to date dont get wrong there is some terrific and spoton humor it might actually some of the bestutilized humor in the mcu unlike some of the jokes in age of ultron which seemed scripted obviously they were as it was a movie but a lot of them felt very unnatural my initial reaction is to say that all of the gags in this movie felt like they would actually happen in these given situations with these specific people especially the ones from spiderman    oh yeah spidermans in this movie ive heard a lot of people say that this is the best spiderman weve ever gotten in a movie while i thought he was amaz nope spectac nope sensatio nope um really good hes only in the movie for like 1015 minutes ill need to see his full movie next year to determine whether i really regard him as the best as am i a huge and unashamed fan of the both the tobey maguire and andrew garfield iterations of spiderman but he was really good and im now even more excited for his movie next year    prior to this tangent i was talking about the seriousness of this movie as i said just as empire strikes back took a dark turn after the original star wars this movie sees most of our favorite characters go down dark paths its not as dark as say marvels own daredevil show or even something like the dark knight trilogy but this isnt your happygolucky avengers team that weve seen up until now bad stuff happens and that bad stuff has consequences much like the original comic the story goes past the point of no return and i doubt that things will ever be the same for most of these characters    speaking of characters they all get their moments to shine everyone and i mean everyone of the avengers gets their own little storyline in this movie the character that i was most surprised about getting a significant story was sharon carter however she was criminally underutilized in winter soldier and while she isnt featured in this movie quite as much as i wish shed be she is one of the best supporting character from the captain america comics it was certainly a pleasant surprise to see her as much as we did all that said the comments that this isnt an avengers movie this is a captain america movie are totally false sure almost everything that happens in this movie can be traced back to captain america but its in the same way that almost everything that happens in age of ultron can be traced back to tony if this movie needed to be called captain america civil war aou should have been called iron man age of ultron dont get me wrong this isnt a complaint i loved this movie but avengers civil war would have been a more fitting title    there is really so much more i could say the acting was great the action was mindblowingly amazing there were so many moments that made my comicbooknerd heart happy spiderman was wonderful black panther was set up extremely well for his upcoming movie there were so many great character interactions especially between members of the same teams and members of the opposite teams so pretty much all of the character interactions every character gets a moment to be cool and while i definitely have a side team cap all the way there is no clearcut choice between who it right and who is wrong    i dont feel like i need to rant any more about this movie if you havent seen this yet stop what you are doing and go to the theater right now if youve already seen this you should probably go see it again i definitely will    for more reviews please visit mckoowordpresscom
May 5 2016,positive,absolutely fantastic spiderman was hilarious the action sequences were top notch and thrilling as usual the humor is perfect
May 5 2016,positive,best marvel movie to date  the got black panther so right in this movie its ridiculous  if that wasnt enough spiderman stole every scene he was in  the last fight scene you wont even know who to root for  dont even know how they can even top this
May 5 2016,negative,dude is bvsstony stark momow cmon
May 5 2016,positive,the most grounded film in the mcu yet also does the best job at balancing such a huge cast of characters
May 5 2016,positive,even though they modified the story slightly from the civil war comics this was still everything i had hoped it would be so many characters coming together i honestly never thought i would see the day this movie would be made with a big time cast and a big budget it was absolutely incredible
May 5 2016,positive,an amazing iron man movie hidden in an ad for the marvel universe brought to you by captain america who supposedly stars in this movie but has nothing to say
May 5 2016,positive,phenomenal possibly the best mcu movie to date possibly even the best superhero movie this is on dark knight levels
May 5 2016,positive,worth every imax penny i love seeing the growth of the characters and the addition of the new blackpanther is awesome and the new spidey is fabulous cant wait to go see it again
May 5 2016,positive,it was a magnificent masterpiece
May 5 2016,positive,warning mild spoilers    some of the best action of all time  new spiderman was amazing  emotional amazing story told  new black panther was amazing  comedy was really good  trailers didnt give away the whole cough bvs cough overrated like deadpool or avengers  true all star movie  disappointing ending
May 5 2016,positive,one of the most heartbreaking superhero movies ever released captain america civil war exceeds where bvs fails its fun exhilarating and powerful seeing our favorite characters being betrayed and turned against one another is both exciting yet sad its controversial topic about family and politics will engage the audiences because thats something we can relate to these heroes are not super but human beings with souls a perfect start to marvels next wave of films
May 5 2016,positive,55  most likely the best marvel movie to date  the russo brothers deliver on this one  a conflict arises in a group of superheroes and sides are taken the characters are established well enough that you understand the motivation of both sides   grounded and solid characters simple but good plot and great action especially the airport fight scene which is simply fantastic  definitely worth watching many times
May 5 2016,positive,the best marvel movie so far but they couldve kept spiderman out of it
May 5 2016,positive,literally perfect i loved this movie in my opinion the best marvel film yet
May 5 2016,positive,great job at touching every character typical marvel quips are done ever so well especially with the inclusion of spiderman story is touching on many levels starts out a little slow but picks up quickly overall great experience
May 5 2016,positive,im going to put it this way dc vs marvel dont exist dc hava so much to learn from marvels movies capitan america civil war amazing
May 5 2016,positive,it was amazinghonestly everything i wanted from a superhero movie the only problem that i have with this movie is that its not as accessible for casual fans for example unless you have some understanding of who peggy carter is how howard stark and captain america are related who any of the other superheroes that appeared in this movie are etc this movie isnt as enjoyable a lot of my friends who disliked the movie were casual fans who didnt really invest themselves in the whole mcu experience the action sequences and the humor however were unanimously applauded
May 5 2016,positive,simplemente the best
May 5 2016,positive,best mcu movie next to avengers
May 5 2016,neutral,i really wanted them to kill off the at least one character but the whole holding hands at the end was so clichã it was an okay movie but highly disappointed
May 5 2016,positive,not only does captain america civil war round out what is arguably one of the best alltime superhero trilogies but as a stand alone film it may be one of the best alltime superhero movies period  never have so many colorful costumed characters graced the screen amidst a backdrop of such weighty and relevant issues as friendship loss vengeance and politicsall without the cartoonish banter and shallow dialogue that so many other films in the same genre are plagued with  those russo brothers sure know what the heck they are doing  ohand spiderman
May 5 2016,positive,hands down best superhero movie to date amazing cast complex emotional plot two thumbs way up
May 5 2016,positive,this was a excellent movie
May 5 2016,positive,saw it twice both times i felt pretty meh about what was happening its a good movie with good action and good acting just none of it was great
May 5 2016,positive,im pretty mixed on this film on one hand it was a solid flick on the other it felt kind of pointless it was the weakest of the 3 captain america movies if anything id say it was basically a story arch to avengers infinity war to introduce characters and get some of the filler story elements out of the way basically avengers 25 i have some nitpicks about a few scenes too its worth watching but it didnt leave me satisfied or care to ever watch it again
May 5 2016,positive,civil war is by far the best marvel movie yet
May 5 2016,positive,i have not had that much fun in a movie theater in a very long time the action was choreographed to perfection the humor was great and felt very natural every character had a purpose and received the proper amount of screen time tom holland is the spiderman i have wanted to see my entire life and steals every scene hes in i cant wait for spiderman homecoming and the black panther film
May 5 2016,positive,this movie was great lots of action
May 5 2016,positive,so i really wanted to love this movie i have loved every marvel avengers movie previously some more than others however i was extremely disappointed in the female element yes i get it is a captain america movie but black widow who has always kept the female element strong and kept the boys in line was proverbially put into a corner while what equivaled to a kids school yard thrashing match went on i was extremely disappointed that the writers forget to recognise that testosterone fuelled male pissing matches should be countered by some type of female logic making the token females weak and putting them in the corner is no way to treat the female fans it is 2016 after all
May 5 2016,positive,my 2 favs spiderman and winter soldier were perfect this is the best version of spiderman ive ever seen
May 5 2016,positive,a rolling and raucous good time at the theater  it builds up slowly but simmer at the right temp to produce a great result  the film really stands on its own but nice links the who mcu  a must see event
May 5 2016,positive,this movie is basically an avengers movie probably could have been called avengers 3 paul rudd reprising his role as ant man was very entertaining and tom hollands webslinger is the best version yet on the big screen
May 5 2016,positive,captain america civil war was amazing go see it    it was hands down the coolest mcu movie to date like i dont know how many times i said oh my gosh that is so cool    all the new kids on the block were so good i fell in love with spiderman black panther was freaking sick and antman scarlet witch and vision all got some pretty solid scenes and tons of power exploration    like agents of shield has been doing when its superpowered characters we also got to see peoples fighting tactics evolve and their powers be used in really cool and new ways    the movie was heartwrenching heartpounding and heartwarming there was just a lot of heart ok seriously though i felt like the trailers showed a lot of the movie but there was actually a ton of things i didnt see coming and the moments it did show were still super effective and emotional and the action was sick    and there was also a very surprising amount of humor and it was so so good    this film took a whole bunch of beloved characters and then made none of them heroes or villains and its really hard to process and its amazing its impossible not to compare this to batman v superman and its also impossible to say that bvs was better in any way sorry dccu i love dc characters and i grew up watching the justice league but you cant change the fact that the mcu was organic and the dccu was synthesized instead of watching people i dont know and i dont really care that much for fight for almost no reason i got to watch characters i love cap  iron man and everyone else struggle and deal some serious blows to each other for reasons that have been building literally since 2008 when the incredible hulk and iron man came out    when you watch the other mcu movies every single one builds to the spearhead of civil war except gotg i mean you can find parallels but they are thinner there are scenes in every movie building to it agents of shield agent carter daredevil and jessica jones have all built up to it jj the least but there are common themes the netflixtv shows dont get much acknowledgement or any lets be honest from the movies but they still are rounding out and building to the same underlying theme of the past 8 years the architects of players of the mcu are brilliant    go see civil war
May 5 2016,positive,the best mcu all time 
May 5 2016,neutral,the emasculation of captain america    first of all there are a million spoilers in this review pass it by if you want to be surprised     the marvel movies are for two audiences the true believers who still mourn the death of gwen stacy and the general public for the former you will not recognize anything but the barest outlines of the civil war story arc and the substitute mcucontinuity story is deeply unsatisfying for the latter its a completely confusing script with at least seven plotlines none of which make any sense     there are so many cinematic crimes on which to focus in this one shall i fume about the transparent manner in which the movie is simply a tool to set up the spinoffs the special effects which seemed to suffer from either not enough rendering time or too much ambition the somewhat random appearance of a reclaimed spiderman     no i will focus on the titular character they have somehow stripped captain america of his moral authority     in the real civil war story cap is leading a rogue band of heroes against an overreaching government act being enforced by a clearly mercenary tony stark iron man he is the moral force holding the story together civil war was a complex sweeping story told across all of marvels titles and involving more than 200 characters rising above them all was a leader a compassionate strong true hero who fought for righteousness and freedom a true patriot in the books spiderman tells him you are the country he is the towering moral epicenter of the story a compelling uncomplicated figure in a highly complex world     heres hes a guy torn a bit by the ongoing bucky storyline i have no idea why they keep so much focus on bucky hes defending his opinion his point of view but hes no more or less moral or even courageous than the billionaire industrialist tony stark theyre both just men torn a bit by friendship and deciding who is more right but the grand sweeping sense of how to define american values is shorn from this movie and like another myth loses its strength as a result     yes there are some redeeming qualities scarlett johanssen gives a nuanced performance as  natasha and kudos to a wonderfully onpoint vision as played by paul bettany     unfortunately this movies raison dexistence is to set up the storyline for the black panther antman and other followons  there will unfortunately need to be a civil war 2 youll miss a lot of explanations around those movies if you miss this one just know that youll be watching a giant addridden missed opportunity i am sad about this
May 5 2016,positive,this movie had it all  dr strange preview xmen apocalypse preview two funny nerdy guys sitting behind us  awesome awesome movie  easter egg at the end of the credits  a dark superhero vs superhero topic like superman vs batman but bright and with humor  long but fast paced and engaging unlike s vs b where you could sense your cells dying as it dragged on  another winner from marvel      plainly dc stands for doesnt comprehend    its not even movie making its predicate calculus   rocksx  rocksy  dox  doy
May 5 2016,positive,definitely the best marvel movie ive seen thus far
May 5 2016,positive,possibly the best marvel movie yet the airport fight scene alone is worth the price of admission
May 5 2016,positive,the best movie of all time
May 5 2016,positive,probably the best one so far
May 5 2016,positive,disney does it again marvel studios has me wondering every time if this is the first movie that will bomb well i am happy to say no civil war is a well written conflict that does everything bvs did wrong and made it fantastic new characters fit right in old ones are solid might be the best of the earth marvel movie guardians still 1 in my heart
May 5 2016,neutral,it was a great movie with all of the fighting scenes but i think that adding all of the other characters was unnecessary
May 5 2016,positive,so the russo brothers need to direct every marvel movie this one was spectacular they gave enough time to get invested with all the characters both ant man and spiderman steal the scenes that theyre in they couldnt have picked better actors to play both scott lang and peter parker    the only thing would be that there werent any memorable scores unlike other superhero movies but still go watch it
May 5 2016,positive,it was a fun dramabrawlerspy movie but there are many wtf moments that defy character reasoning in fact the bad guy was not interesting until right at the end and could have enacted his evil plan via email the script its meh but characters were great spiderman was amazing favorite part of the movie black panther was great also but the anticlimatic ending was a let down    i wont say more not to spoil but while watching i had a lot of funroller coaster syndrome but if you think about why characters did things it kinda starts falling apart 
May 5 2016,positive,probably the best marvel movie ive seen to date
May 5 2016,positive,boring i fell asleep beginning the camera was shaky the plot was all over
May 5 2016,positive,easily one of the best super hero films to date and it is amongst the best action films of all time
May 5 2016,positive,one of the best mcu movies by far in fact one of the best marvel movies i have ever seen
May 5 2016,positive,i had a fun time with this movie this is basically avengers 3 civil war when critics said this is the best superhero movie ever made it is very close the fight scenes brought childhood fantasies to life they brought it with this one cant for the next and how about that black panther
May 5 2016,positive,marvel just keeps on getting better and better civil war is inarguably the best movie yet
May 5 2016,positive,this film is living proof that superhero movies became more than just popcorn fun this is the most layered character driven marvel film yet
May 5 2016,positive,fantastic   filled with fantastic action sequences drama comedic zingers and a great storyline to give away your free will to fight the fights you think need fighting or let others dictate your fights  another great movie to add to the marvel collection  a definite must see
May 5 2016,positive,slow start strong finish spidey steals the show
May 5 2016,positive,the avengers that age of ultron couldnt quite get the captain america movie that inconceivably outdoes its predecessor the thriller and action film that ranks among the best of them it provides a very believable realistic government response to superhero activity ahem xmen and bvs and does so without tedious court proceedings or other boring politics bvs again iron man 2 thats not to say that there are no politics its just that theyre presented through the eyes of people not a faceless government with a forgettable puppet the conflict between everyone is believable tonycaps relationship has built since they met everyone takes a course of action completely believable and in character the title fight in the airport is beliefdriven while cap and bucky v tony is on a far more emotional personal level never a dull moment in the film action wellplaced but in many places throughout i count 6 notable fight scenes much of the rest is intriguing dialogue in which the heroes first try every last resort before coming to blows then during fights and in trying to make amends afterwards zemo the villain has a more unique approach than any other he easily hurts the avengers the most and does it without throwing a single punch he is underdeveloped but makes up for it with craftiness on the level of loki thats another thing zemo like loki is one of very few marvel villains to survive a film he doesnt get away scotfree but it does open up future opportunity spiderman was amazing easily the best to grace the screen nobody is left out not even the woman who takes the place of the stamford mom in the comic easily the best superhero film of all time
May 5 2016,positive,unfuckwitable 
May 5 2016,positive,rarely are we privileged to witness perfection in our lifetime an ascension of immaculate conception against formulas and data sets  just as tolstoy and dostoyevsky changed literature in the 19th century and picasso and matisse permanently transformed art in the 20th century so to does civil war bridge the gap between this world and infinity  i say this without hyperbole and in complete sobriety civil war is the greatest superhero movie in the history of the genre  just as the godfather provide a clear demarcation between american film history civil war as well forever splits superhero movie history    when reviewing this psychotically errorproof work of art it is difficult to comprehend the political and psychological elements at play here  like the great filmmakers of years past the russo brothers incorporate pressing issues in the american political and socioeconomic fabric of everyday life to advance their storytelling technique  for comparative examples look at our current presidential election climate and the approvalcriticism debate involving the generation sociologists have labeled millennials    to its detractors know one thing  throughout the history of american cinema creative high points of film art have been lambasted while derivative fluff of the trivial nature has been garnered with praise  likewise the cinematic storytellers of the future will an a pointless effort to capture the very nature of eternity and physical existence set the world on fire with the sights and sounds of civil war
May 5 2016,positive,put on the suit lets go a few rounds
May 5 2016,neutral,fun action underwhelming story very forgettable
May 5 2016,positive,a sucker punch to the dc frowny face marvel once again proves they understand how to make a wildly entertaining film about superheroes that are both super and heroic
May 5 2016,positive,fantastic  amazing  spider man and black panther are just wonderful and the stakes have never been higher  final grade  a
May 5 2016,neutral,if you want to go see a movie where people just fight for stupid reasons and you want to see a third avengers movie then waste your 10 the premise of the movie is extremely overplayed we simply solve the same story told several times by dc in the batman and superman movies most recently just another government trying to tell people with amazingly gifted powers to do what theyre told just is a great way to spend three hours bunch of politic telling people what to do so engaging
May 5 2016,positive,the new spiderman was amazing
May 5 2016,positive,now that is how you make a superhero film  after 12 films it seemed unlikely the marvel universe could create something so refreshing and new but civil war does just that  its impeccably paced exhilarating heartbreaking and just outright fun  captain america civil war is one of the greatest superhero films to be put to the big screen    civil war sees the return of most of the usual suspects from the marvel films with the exception of thor and hulk and sets the universe in a new direction while also honoring what came before it  the captain america trilogy should be considered the most unique trilogy of all time  although for all intents and purposes this film is essentially avengers 3  yes the story is always focused on cap and bucky but it is just as much a marvel universe film as a story about two best friends from brooklyn    the russo brothers are thankfully back after winter soldier and they pulled off the impossible with civil war  there are so many characters plotlines and things that need to be set up and its handled wonderfully  but they also direct action maybe better than anyone in hollywood right now  much like winter soldier the action in civil war always hits at just the right time  the airport scene will go down as one of the greatest superhero fight sequences of all time    newcomers black panther and spiderman were brought along and implanted seamlessly  chadwick boseman and tom holland play the two characters brilliantly and instantly get me excited to see their solo films within the next few years    each character gets their time to shine  scarlet witch is fully realized and antman falcon and vision bring the witty marvel oneliners that they have become known for  as much as this film is deeply rooted in psychological emotion and tough character choices it still retains the humor that keeps the film from ever reaching grim areas  it really puts to question how much better can superhero films get    i havent even mention hawkeye black widow or buckywinter soldier who all get incredible moments  does anybody not have confidence that the russo brothers can balance 60 something characters in infinity war in a few years  overall the marvel universe and superhero films in general have a new level of greatness to live up to  perhaps more time will give me perspective but for now civil war is my new favorite marvel film    you understand both sides of the coin    that airport scene    builds on what came before and sends the universe in a refreshing direction    still a focus on cap and bucky    black panther and spiderman steal the show    maintains the fun tone amidst an immensely emotion film    1010
May 5 2016,positive,if you enjoy marvels avengers youll definitely love this movievery enjoyable from start to finish
May 5 2016,positive,another great marvel film does a great job mixing humor action and an indepth story line that will keep you wanting more
May 5 2016,positive,hands down the best marvel movie even with so much happening the movie is still intimate and emotional it hit every target at the right spots and at the right times
May 5 2016,positive,this movie gave me a lot of things that just made my heart happy  the first half of the movie was a bit slow but the second half of the movie was probably some of the best stuff ever put into a superhero movie ever  spiderman and antman steal the show  go see this in the theater you will not regret it  overall i am very happy with this movie
May 5 2016,positive,the latest marvel film is the best marvel film
May 5 2016,negative,honestly a complete joke this movie calls itself captain america civil war when it doesnt have any relation with the marvel comics title civil war this movie should have been called winter soldier because all the plot is around that character and how the cap wants to protect his friend by doing the wrong things and fighting against the law also this movie changes completely one character from the captain america comics which es baron zemo or should i call it colonel zemo since he was a sokovia soldier and not a member from hydra as established in the comics this zemo is also just guy looking for revenge against the avengers for the dead of his family just to end this this movie was full comedy i spend most of the time laughing from all the jokes they over use literally this is no action movie this is a comedy movie with some action in between scenes
May 5 2016,positive,marvel just knows film excellent 3rd installment of captain america and even better introduction of the new faces
May 5 2016,positive,action packed  a lot of surprises  anyone who knows there stuff and loves marvel and the avengers   your in for a thrill  one of the best movies ive seen so far
May 5 2016,positive,its great the running scene though was kinda cheesy
May 5 2016,positive,ow my gosh the best movie since xmen amazing
May 5 2016,positive,captain americacivil war was everything bvs wanted to be but warner brothers didnt have the patience to let it become    its tight with a coherent narrative serious themes and real stakes its not concerned with world building because the world has already been built when heroes come into conflict we understand the ideological and sometimes personal reasons nothing is easily or even completely resolved more importantly though is the fact that weve been with these characters for 13 films now mostly with the same actors this heightens the emotional investment watching these guys come to blows actually matters because of their long relationship with each other and with us    as far as the core conflict one of the flaws in the original comics was that there was really only one side you could be on because too many crossover comics had stark crossing the moral event horizon and basically becoming a villain in this you can at least see reason in both arguments neither side is a bad guy while zemo is the ultimate villain of the film hes really just the catalyst that forces the issues that have been brewing to the surface this makes the fights that much more poignant that said i personally remain firmly team cap    for those who have read the original comics version theyve fixed the other problems that plagued it and included some awesome homage moments like hawkeye firing an arrow with antman riding the tip that was in the trailer i wont spoil the moments that werent    now for some of the fun stuff black panther was excellent the fights were epic spiderman was just right and showed he belonged on the same stage with the rest of these guys im stoked for both their upcoming solo films and damn antman is seriously cool in this movie    the russo brothers have shown that they can handle a large ensemble cast of unique characters with a sprawling story and tell it in a serious tone with just the right amount of comic relief they have my full confidence for infinity wars
May 5 2016,positive,that airport fight scene is probably the greatest comic book movie  sequence ever filmed civil war is of course a huge payoff for fans whove been following from the start but even the casual moviegoers will pick up on the fact that theres something slightly more special about this one its the most lively engaging marvel movie since guardians of the galaxy and among the very best of the whole avengers series a blockbuster among blockbusters
May 5 2016,positive,this was the best one yet action packed  a mustsee
May 5 2016,positive,one of the better movies of the franchise  well worth the high rt ratings
May 5 2016,positive,a good movie for all ages and well worth the admission price    that being said i have been at odds with movie critics in the past and i am sure i will be again in the future but disagreeing with kevin smith feels sacrilegious lol    but i have to    i would rank this among the top comic book movies of all time but by no means the greatest maybe number 6    avengers  deadpool  guardians of the galaxy  iron man  ant man  civil war    with that in mind my wife says its number 2 behind avengers
May 5 2016,positive,despite some forgivable flaws cap civil war hosts the best action fights scenes in any comic book movie to date  fine performances and a good story help entertain the audience in spite of the films length  one of the best marvels come up with
May 5 2016,positive,just the best the best of everything action heros villains  heros acting villainous story and fun so awesome
May 5 2016,positive,a true civil war is a collapse from within where brother takes up arms against brother marvel continues to impress and this is definitely one of their top films
May 5 2016,neutral,spoilers    captain america civil war is a very well made movie it has a great story and the character arcs are believable and fascinating the audience is presented with convincing arguments on both sides and are left strenuously trying to decide who to root for who is in the right it has a wonderful set up that leads on the audience to expect some very serious consequences and ramifications for what has happened    what does it do with this set up absolutely nothing     nobody is killed no relationship is broken the ones who get sent to jail are broken out just like that everyone ends up at the end in the same place they were at the beginning     ive defended the marvel cinematic universe for a long time now and i really do admire what the marvel team has been doing with these connected storylines and movies that build on each other and this movie could have done so much to create interesting conflict for infinity wars and so on    instead they copped out and left everything the same there was no point no endgame    i enjoyed the hell out of this movie and im not completely against movies that dont have a point but they need to be fun to go through this tense and complex journey that results in nothing but everyone sitting pretty why did i spend the last two hours biting my fingernails    winter soldier succeeded in creating tense situations and suspenseful sequences which concluded with shield being outed and completely corrupted even in age of ultron quicksilver sacrificed his life to help the avengers change occurred when a movie takes on darker themes and more serious subject material there need to be consequences all this movie was without consequence was a two hour long solid thriller that was only made to introduce two new heroes for future films and if thats really all the writers were going for then why would they bother setting up such a promising and interesting story disappointed
May 5 2016,positive,vengeance is a dish best served marvel
May 5 2016,positive,civil war is the avengers 2 we never got and the movie batman v superman wishes it could be like its predecessor its an evolution of the characters and their development over the course of 12 movies and believe it or not the large cast in no way makes the movie feel cluttered or bloated every character serves a purpose in the story gripping story great stunt work and action blended in with great humor
May 5 2016,positive,great movie but was hoping to see captain killed by iron man but guess i will have to wait for infinity wars for that the movie itself is fun for any fans of the marvel universe but for those new be cautious of all the overload of introductions to the team not the best marvel movie but not the worst by far go see it yourself it is worth the admittance fee
May 5 2016,negative,this was not civil war read the comics this is not how it happened tony is wrong period this was a load of crap yes it was entertaining thats why it gets half a star and rotten tomato will not let you rate it lower civil war is suppose to be about freedom not whatever this was everyone critics included need to look at the source material before giving this a good rating
May 5 2016,positive,needs to be more about captain america instead of all the avengers this movie could have been better
May 5 2016,positive,with so much going on the russo brothers did an amazing job to balance the action and drama all the while not missing a beat with every character involved especially with each relationship between each other acknowledged dont forget to stick around for the mid credits scene and end credits scene this movie definitely does not disappoint
May 5 2016,positive,black panther was great  spiderman was great  marvel just keeps on rolling
May 5 2016,positive,so my short review is this amazing  like this movie was just awesome spiderman is awesome and action was outstanding honestly probably ether number 1 or 2 top marvel movies longer review coming soon in video form lol
May 5 2016,positive,captain america delivers the signature marvel action sequences and humor but excels past previous entries by also including new unique levels of drama among the characters and providing smart social commentary
May 5 2016,positive,who says marvel cant be dark this movie had darker moments than dcs bs and still kept its classic marvel charm huge win for all fans
May 5 2016,positive,quite possibly the best movie out of the avengers slate of films best on screen portrayal of spider man finally and the black panthers adds a fresh new character to the heroes action drama comedy all done excellent 45 out out of 5 stars
May 5 2016,positive,intense thrilling and with some humor mixed in captain america civil war does not disappoint
May 5 2016,negative,first half was really boring and they tried to copy bvs plot
May 5 2016,positive,i saw it today and it was amazing the fight scenes are amazing but perhaps more importantly the emotion that all the characters give off is spectacular and it makes it hard to choose a side because the movie gives every character a legitimate reason for doing what they did and that just makes the movie better this movie is better than the avengers by far and one of if not best marvel movie of all time
May 5 2016,positive,by far the best of the marvel movies humor action drama doesnt take itself to serious like another super hero movie i can mention  spiderman is back and better then ever a few surprises in store i wont spoil them but this will be the hit of 2016
May 5 2016,positive,best mcu movie to date and one of the best comic book movies ever the russos have hit their stride
May 5 2016,positive,lives up to the hype it exceeds it batman vs superman done right absolutely marvel has plenty of gas left in the tank i dare say this is the best movie in the marvel cinematic universe and i double dog dare myself to say this is the best comic book movie ever made marvel continues to do outdo themselves after 8 years of marvel movies you think wed be sick of superhero movies by now  for me that is not the case am i still excited for the next one you bet i am  teamantony teammarvel
May 5 2016,positive,marvel hits their biggest home run yet
May 5 2016,positive,one of the best movies of the year
May 5 2016,positive,it gets five stars only because i cant give it more
May 5 2016,positive,this is my fave marvel film since guardians of the galaxy the opening action sequence was better than anything in age of ultron this was fun had some twists and turns and had a nice flow to it this may have had some of the best action out of all the marvel films the two characters i was most excited to see were black panther and spiderman and they ended up being the best part all around fantastic
May 5 2016,positive,this may seem contradictory but civil war is the best superhero movie marvel has made but not the best overall film which is still winter soldier
May 5 2016,positive,the winter soldier is the best film marvel has made and that changed once i got out of watching the best comic book film to date captain america civil war delivers on all points spiderman and black panther are both introduced perfectly into the mcu tom holland beats out toby maguire  andrew garfield as the best peter parkerspiderman im super pumped to see my favorite hero back in his solo film everyone else was great the way they all interact with each other and the airport scene is pure entertainment you havent seen nothing yet the final fight was epic and again we have a clear winner  the russo brothers know how to handle a story and i love how they adapted the civil war story they made the necessary changes and delivered on a few key points from the comics onto the big screen i already have my ticket for see it again tomorrow night at alamo drafthouse cant wait to catch all the things i might have missed i love this film it gets a 55 from me
May 5 2016,positive,this was definitely an excellent movie it actually took a few unexpected turns with its overall tone and storyline while it is much darker than its predecessors it still manages to be filled with very funny and satisfying moments that feel like a worthwhile payoff without giving away too much i personally found spiderman  to be the most entertaining character in the movie on top of that this movie also has antmans greatest moment in the entire marvel film series overall captain america civil war proves to be yet another worthy chapter within the marvel cinematic universe
May 5 2016,positive,8 outta 10  now thats how you do a versus movie captain america civil war did everything batman v superman could not ill definitely go for a 2nd viewing of cacw something i didnt say about bvs even though i shouldve    i dont think cacw was on par with winter soldier or avengers but it came pretty close     of all the mcu movies cacw had the best action so much so fast great choreography and variety not just repeated punching of each other with the best stuff involving different superpowers at different times     spiderman cant wait for more of the mcu spiderman and peter parker so glad sony relented and let marvel do their thing with spidey    black panther cant wait for his solo movie dude was straight up badass    antman lols    you feel for tony stark a testament to rdj really while you also cheer for cap    the volkswagen beetle stuff the scenes were short but lols    stank lmao    bad guy wasnt really all that menacing but he wasnt really supposed to be despite the simplicity of his motivations they were better handled and executed than lex luthors in bvs    lotsa meta stuff and easter eggs but ya gotta be a nerd to catchem all    so im mostly saying positive stuff about cacw but if i have say some negative things theyd be maybe a little too fastpaced maybe a little too much stuff in the movie maybe they shouldve called it avengers 3 instead ah well still a kickass flick
May 5 2016,positive,excellent flick long movie but well paced with no lulls mcu rises another notch with civil war the russo brothers do it again
May 5 2016,positive,best captain america yet
May 5 2016,positive,slow start but a very good movie all around characters were true to the comics and the storyline flowed well  a lot of characters but not so many that needed their own storyline best marvel movie yet imho
May 5 2016,positive,easily the most mature of the marvel movies thus far there are a lot of ways civil war couldve slacked with all the characters put in front of us but it does a great job of balancing things it explores some of the deeper repercussions of being a superhero and dealing with the collateral damage thats bound to occur when fighting big baddies in densely populated urban areas among all the clenched teeth it does remember that its a marvel movie and doesnt take itself too seriously at the right moments    all the familiar faces are there and doing the biz but the new characters fare pretty well spidey and black panther neither are shoehorned in and are given decent introductions and arent completely relegated to the sidelines spideys youthfulness serves him well as does panthers regality the action sequences are anywhere from decent to excellent and with all the craziness happening we dont get lost with all the spandex and metal flying around this aint a transformers movie    though it felt overlong by about 1520 minutes with such a large motley crew i suppose thats unavoidable marvels got a great formula going and i cant wait to see it all come together for the big bad showdown in a few years
May 5 2016,positive,spoiler alert it was awesome    thats really all you need to know specifically the russo brothers just know cap and they know how to make a movie about him make no mistake this is a captain america film no matter how many avengers they shove in front of the camera it feels like a true sequel to winter soldier rather than age of ultron although that movie is heavily referenced especially in regards to tonys ultimate motivations the atmosphere is heavier here than in either avengers film and the plot is definitely more political thriller than superhero actionfest    that airport scene tho guyz    there was nothing about this movie that i hated and only one thing i disliked but its a huge spoiler so zips mouth shut    go see it
May 5 2016,positive,before tonight i would have put captain america the winter soldier and the avengers as the best marvel films to date  civil war surpasses both of those films and succeeds in doing what batman v superman tried to accomplish and failed miserably setting up a logical premise to pit two heroes or two teams of heroes against each other      oh and this is the best onscreen version of spiderman weve ever been given  if spiderman homecoming is anywhere near as good as the small taste of spidey we were given in this film then we are in for a treat     my only complaint is the handheld camera action scenes in the beginning of the film that made it confusing to follow the action  i can only imagine the headaches this might induce seeing the film in 3d
May 5 2016,positive,wow im gobsmacked this is so thoroughly entertaining and wellconstructed that it leaves age of ultron completely in the rear view mirror  cap  tony stark are great of course but so are peter parker and antman and so many others  i say again wow
May 5 2016,positive,amazing and heartbreaking
May 5 2016,positive,dont read if you havent seen it there are spoilers you have been warned  though there were times it moved slowly i loved it  i love when films like this make me feel like a kid and there were moments i was five year old me watching this film and i got really excited  this was a great marvel film  i really liked black panther and spiderman but seeing everyone together was awesome  i always loved those super hero fights and this one knocked it out of the ball park  i havent felt this way since the first avengers film seeing all the heroes in new york but this was way more bad ass  i loved what they did with antman especially giant man  i liked the story the humor it was a great marvel film probably my forth favorite under guardians of the galaxy captain america 2 and the avengers  i loved the mental stress that being a hero can cause  i liked the relationship formed between stark and parker that i hope we see in the new spiderman film i loved black panther and what he could do and he was a really cool character i knew little about him and was skeptical but was blown away  it felt more like an avengers film then a captain america film but i am happy  its a must see geek out film
May 5 2016,positive,makes up for the mistakes in age of ultron gives each character plenty to do lots of past questions get answered civil war gives us real super hero fights and they are spectectualr especially with new comers black panther spiderman and antman
May 5 2016,positive,one of marvels best films to date basically what avengers 2 should have been
May 5 2016,positive,this movie rocked  brilliantly directed great storyline well acted the summers first blockbuster delivers and then some it was more or less a miniavengers more like the first one and just as great  must see  again and again
May 5 2016,positive,a great movie that i would recommend for anyone to see it had some good humor and the introduction of characters was great however the cg left something to be desired and some of the jokes felt a bit forced however i loved it overall
May 5 2016,positive,this is marvels the dark knight and unlike bvs although surprisingly the 2 are similarly themed civil war totally delivers lots of action but balanced nicely with a story that gives all of its many characters a chance to shine black panther  spiderman are great new additions spidey is perfect a total scene stealer
May 5 2016,positive,well better than expected better than the last avengers
May 5 2016,positive,alright disney you need to stop showing off youre making the other studios look bad  maybe the nerdiest thing ive ever heard walking out of the theater a fellow nerd comments someone better hand spiderman the fuck over  i hope sony heard that  warner bros this is how you do a superherofightingeachother movie  absolutely the best movie so far this year  the only thing that couldve made it better wouldve been more insectmen as both spidey and the ant stole the show like no one was looking and everyone was looking  although black widow was pointless as usual everything else about this movie was like hawkeyes arrows on point  although i wouldve preferred the comic book version of this storyline without being able to use the word mutant thanks to ongoing studio wars this theatrical version managed to deliver on all of ironmans cylinders  next on the menu dr strange  lets hope its as perfect as captain americas teeth
May 5 2016,positive,it was a very entertaining action movie however it lacked that one key that has been missing in all marvel movies somebody needed to die there was an emotional build up all throughout and at the climax of the film there was a moment that felt natural for the hero to die the movie stopped its train and pointed it in the opposite direction the movie wasnt the bridge we have been hoping for between now and the infinity wars
May 5 2016,positive,truly a great movie  filled in gaps  and once the sides start shaping up   wow what a ride
May 5 2016,positive,what very easily could have been an overbooked mess turned out to actually be the best and most characterdriven marvel movie yettobe made every character had a voice and reason for their presence every action had an equal and opposite reaction it built strongly after the previous movies characters new and old got time to shine build their motivations and characters and set up for later without detracting at all from the movie they were set in     most of all this was a captain america movie iron man played a large role in this movie but he and cap have coled two other movies together and the solo movie shouldnt be much different when cap is tied so closely to the avengers and the events play so public the way things go forward and things breakdown the way things end up where they do its brilliant despite the length i expect to see this multiple times in theaters and i look forward to seeing the bits and pieces i missed along the way
May 5 2016,positive,i just dont like the 2 good guys fighting each over the bad guy was lame
May 5 2016,positive,a must see movie this year
May 5 2016,positive,wow what a movie great script great writing amazing fight scenes oh and airport man airport this is the empire strikes back for the avengers and it did it almost flawlessly rating 1010
May 5 2016,positive,maybe the best superhero movie yet made  outstanding action gut wrenching ending  excellent plot great acting as a true fan of all comicsnot just a specific company go see civil war
May 5 2016,positive,awesome movie with good visuals and story
May 5 2016,positive,wow i cant say much since this just came out but i felt like i got my moneys worth in the first 15 minutes
May 5 2016,positive,nope not a misclick  last year i watched the abyss for the first time in years and for every moment that reminded me what a master filmmaker james cameron was there were as many scenes that reminded me that cameron cant write realistic dialogue for shit  the result was that it was a flat 510 as a median because everything that was great was greater than i remembered and the bad shit was almost unwatchable  civil war is that kind of movie  i knew there would be obvious didactic soapbox moments where people would speak from virtue signalling pulpits and those moments make the first half almost unwatchable despite the solid action sprinkled throughout though that action is also a bit choppy at timeshighspeed shutter trick doesnt work when the action is impeccably performed in the first place  vision is boring as fuck and will probably appeal to the very young viewers who have never heard of spock from star trek data from star trek tng robocop bender from futurama kryten from red dwarf etc  i knew bettanybot would be utter shit in followups and yeah hes unbearably precocious intoning lines that sound like they came from motivational posters from ghetto community centers  then spiderman and antman show up and civil war escalates into the movie i came to see then they go away and the plot machinations lead to the kind of drama mark millars garbage miniseries could only wetdream of reaching leading to one of the most satisfying finales in any superhero movie  but that first half
May 5 2016,positive,captain america civil war is the must see film for the mcu packed with intense and bittersweet emotion hilarity with turns from paul rudds  scott langantman and tom hollands peter parkerspiderman and edge of your seat action that truly succeeds in bring fun to life the one main thing batman v superman dawn of justice have failed to register chris evans and robert downey jr are just as best as ever as the rest of the main cast and directors anthony and joe russo once again hit another marvelous homerun of a marvel cinematic universe film highly recommended
May 5 2016,negative,cookiecutter marvel movie they really need to branch out and try something different
May 5 2016,positive,incredible  amazing  wonderful  outstanding  better then batman v superman by a landslide     mcu cant do any wrong    just wow
May 5 2016,positive,hands down the best marvel movie to date its knocking on the door to the dark knight as the greatest comic book movie of all time
May 5 2016,positive,great film that has everything youre looking for in a captain america movie as well as makes up for some of the dull moment in age of ultron
May 5 2016,positive,if you have been waiting for a comic book movie to appear that would be like taking the inky colorfully paneled pages of a silver age comic and plastering it upon a gorgeous cinematic canvas captain america civil war is your movie     i saw this movie opening night thursday at 700 in imax 3d i waited in line like all the rest of the die hard geeks patiently excited for what this next mcu film had to offer    and bam     opening scene after the timeline origin setup that most movies have this movie was a wild roller coaster but unlike a fairgrounds rickety hastily puttogether coaster that you only wouldnt allow your most hated enemy on this movie was like a smooth brilliantly laid out actionride    from beginning to end you sat on your seat desperately awaiting the next scene the next line the next frame even it was almost as if each of the actors and actresses were all puppets of the russo boys as their facial expressions movements and vocal controls were all beautifully perfect     this movie blew my overwhelmingly high expectations and i cannot wait to see it again thank you mcu thank you kevin feige and thank you russo brothers you guys knew how to make a movie something legendary    excelsior
May 5 2016,positive,pure epic awesomeness
May 5 2016,positive,so good they all brought it russo brothers hit it out of the park
May 5 2016,positive,the best marvel movie i have watched so far it is the future to many upcoming movies including black panther spiderman homecoming and avengers infinity war the action sequences are something that we havent seen in any other marvel movies spiderman was hilarious the movie is the perfect mashup of action comedy and emotion yet the movie made me cry
May 5 2016,positive,i liked it a lotjust a few things i wish they shortened the first scene where bucky escapes from his room to make more room for cap vs iron manthat scene was what a lot of people came for and while it held to the comics a lotit felt rushed
May 5 2016,positive,refreshing start of the summer after the dissapointing batman v superman the most satisfying marvel film yet with some of the best action scenes in superhero films period however you might walk away wishing you hadnt seen the endless trailers
May 5 2016,positive,marvel simply ups the ante with their latest release captain america civil war
May 5 2016,positive,the best movie i think i have ever seen since avengers
May 5 2016,positive,another fantastic political thriller to come out of marvel with some superhero action added in for good measure when will the reign of marvel end if each of there films can be half as good as this once then hopefully never and this coming from a dc comic fan i still love you superman and batman but you have some well crafted storytelling to compete with stop trying to play catchup and focus on your characters and story
May 5 2016,positive,muy buena y entretenida only one word awesome
May 5 2016,positive,i wont ruin it by giving away spoilers but i will say that this was a great comicbook movie i dont know if its better then the two avenger movies but its close the action was good the plot was good the introduction to spiderman and black panther was very strong finally they pick the right person to play spiderman as for black panther they made him look real strong so that the causal fan will now be very interested in his solo movie which done right could be great i thought the whole cast worked real hard into making this movie good so if your into comicbook movies and you were disappointed with batman vs superman civil war goes above and beyond to make your forget all about it one last side note not only did it crush batman vs superman but it also was better then deadpool as well i know fans might try to say otherwise but its simply not true
May 5 2016,positive,amazing  so much action obviously will be a another addition to this incredible movie
May 5 2016,positive,imo the best marvel movie ever made it balanced humor very well and kept characters true to their personalities while keeping screen time balanced the plot was extremely engaging and was very well paced spoiler i believe they wasted zemos potential which was the only shortcoming i could think of he was the perfect culprit but his comic background was lost to a much different character
May 5 2016,positive,best marvel film to date
May 5 2016,positive,the second best avengers movie after the first film but my third favourite captain america movie after the first avenger and the winter soldier in that order this is an avengers film nonetheless there are a lot of great action scenes in this film but most of the plot feels like a drag like an excuse for the avengers to fight each other     besides that big cool thingy at the airport there are not many surprises in civil war up until the moment when stark loses his mind that was a very interesting plot twist id equate this big reveal to the shieldhydra reveal in tws there are a couple slack villains in the film but ironman ends up getting the job marvel has a big issue in the villain department so maybe it was natural to turn up to the heroes division i found spiderman quite childish and annoying being the second reboot in less than four years i would have enjoyed a more grown upgrounded character on the other hand paul rudds ant man was a highlight and a surprise the ending was sloppy at best leaving promised conclusions frozen in cryogenics this film could have been so much more if it werent for the need to setup the next 5 years of marvel movies
May 5 2016,positive,ya i liked this a lot
May 5 2016,positive,quite good better than most well worth the price of admission
May 5 2016,positive,499999995 stars absolutely amazing
May 5 2016,positive,very good movie not my favorite in the mcu the airport fight scene is my favorite action scene ever in any movie but the beginning dragged a little i preferred bvs to be honest but wouldnt miss either spiderman was great 87 out of 100
May 5 2016,positive,the fight scene in the middle gave me a nerdgasm
May 5 2016,positive,seriously one of the best superhero movies has everything very dark and toes the line of emotional makes this universe more real much more real than other marvel movies so awesome a thrill ride must see
May 5 2016,positive,im actually growing tired of these movies by the way bucky and bullseye are insufferable
May 5 2016,positive,for the past eleven years i have maintained that batman begins is the best comic book film ever made finally something has come along to knock it into a close second civil war is the best comic book movie ever made everyone at the wb should be embarrassed that batman v superman exists
May 5 2016,positive,the acting in the latest avengers movie is remarkably good  so good that it appears wasted on a superhero movie the direction and story however leave much to be desired yes its a superhero movie and yes the viewer could read the comicbooks but still when you are introducing a character in a movie for the first time its generally a good idea to let the viewer know who the person is and what his or her powers are exactly how this is to be done is up to the director but it needs to be done on the other hand why waste time mentioning a character who is never going to be on screen even the cgi is just average  nothing like the previous movies the movie has made a lot of money because it is a superhero movie with top stars however it feels like what someone might say to break an awkward silence the studio couldnt afford to go too long before making another superhero movie so they made this one theres too much story too little action and in the end really no point it isnt about geopolitics really and it isnt quite a  feelgood movie either i hope the next one is a real movie
May 5 2016,positive,the quintessential comic book movie
May 5 2016,positive,captain america civil war is masterful it is a triumph in filmmaking by bringing great directing once again by the russo brothers great action sequences and stellar acting from some of the best casts in present cinema what is great about this film is that every character has a moment every single one has a moment to shine and they simply wont let you down because of the great directing in the hands of the russo brothers new additions like black panther and spiderman already make them a part of the family that is the marvel cinematic universe overall captain america civil war is a gargantuan epic one that doesnt let down in any way except the maybe understandable minor spoilers villain of the film baron zemo whose intentions and belongins in the marvel cinematic universe arent thoroughly explained but we shall see more from him again  minor spoilers in the next films bring on phase 3 and thank you russo brothers for bringing back great cinema in a superhero film
May 5 2016,negative,yawn  honestly its just more of the same thing weve seen over and over  im sure the film will do well but this is the beginning of of the end for the mcu
May 5 2016,positive,stop what youre doing and go see this movie really entertaining my heart was racing the whole time
May 5 2016,positive,a very good movie but way too long
May 5 2016,positive,everyone who is anyone is in here  great comic visual cgi moments but also great gaps of boringness   i give it 5 because of seeing hero vs hero  but also seeing black widow doing her best yet   ps wheres hulk
May 5 2016,negative,an extremely dull movie first 1015 minutes and its action all the way pity the next 2 hours ended up being a formulaic suck fest
May 5 2016,positive,fanboyism mostly i mean i am human aside captain america civil war is legitimately phenomenal we live in an age of the instant rewind and trailer breakdown where every plot beat is analyzed and unforgiven despite acting gracefully as a pivot to move the story forward but civil war holds the hell up even under this type of scrutiny there are too many incredible moments to recount here but i want to call out in particular the performances regardless of how long weve waited to see the culmination of these tensions and advances in their cgi animations we simply would not care as an audience if we couldnt be invested in the characters ive never been a big fan of tony stark the war hawk racist murderer but he absolutely sells it in civil war and chris evans as well as the rest of the cast is typically fantastic    well worth your time your money and emotional investment
May 5 2016,positive,one of the greatest comic book movies of all time this movie delivers in almost every aspect    1 pacing was done very well it did not feel like a long movie just about the right length  2 humor was on point  3 the fight scenes were amazing  4 spiderman and black panther crushed it loved seeing diversity among the lead characters  5 loved ant mans humor  6 really got the motivation for the final battle    all in all one of the most satisfying movie experiences from a comic book movie i have ever had people in the cinema gave it an ovation at the end
May 5 2016,positive,even better then the winter soldier and that was awesome
May 5 2016,positive,loved it fun movie
May 5 2016,positive,avengers 3 gives all characters good screen time and theres a few surprises and of course a few jokes time flys by and the fact there isnt really a main villain doesnt effect the films enjoyment
May 5 2016,negative,what a jokethis movie is about heroes or bunch of drama queen
May 5 2016,positive,lives up to all the hype 
May 5 2016,positive,what b v s shouldve been
May 5 2016,positive,still a fan of the first one more than anything always up for noir    great movie but felt more like it shouldve been an avengers filmif ever a film at all     while i enjoyed black panther the new spiderman and giant man the most i thought this entire premise was pretty silly  their treatment of the scarlet witch the killing of quicksilver and no mention of their father has bothered me from the start  i also felt wanda got over the death of her twin brother too quickly    with respect to the original story i get that its necessary for what theyre leading up to ive just always thought these subplots revolving around personal issues between friends are boring and the result of the writer watching too many rockychuck norris films  most of these plots in the 80s should have come packaged with an eye of the tiger single theyre no more progressive than jackass episodes or backyard wrestlingyet theyve spent entire events devoted to these scenariosalso another reason bvs dawn of justice was just so pointless    overall fun filmbut not one of the best     its time to get cosmic
May 5 2016,positive,probably the second best avengers film its not a cap film
May 5 2016,negative,typical marvel disney eye candy happy go lucky feature  it strays as far from the source material as possible while keeping the title was very disappointed but as always the ratings are high because everyone loves a good action flick for typical viewer who wants to see heroes punch each other sure it passes the eye test for someone who grew up reading and loving these characters i couldnt be more let down the same folks who say this is the best ever are the same who said bvs from dc was awful  for sticking to the comics we are all entitled to an opinion but im tired of the marvel mcu of everything works out and everyone has a happy ever after ending
May 5 2016,negative,im done with this mickey mousetier soap opera drama it doesnt help either that all the fight scenes look like they have been edited by a teenager as if they want to distract the audience from how shoddy everything looks by waving a flashlight on their face i couldnt give a damn about any of these sterile excuses for characters during the airport scene all the artificiallyinflated conflict devolved into a child playing with one toy in each hand and bashing them together  its riddled with sophomoric and shallow pseudopolitical ponderings that are thrown out the window when the quiptastic action starts they completely disregard for the umpteenth time the collateral damage while theyre having fun showcasing their flashy abilities  the third act pretends to get serious when in reality it turns into a cheap heartstring manipulation revolving around why didnt you tell me cap waaa  this part completely disregards the fact that stark knows all too well that brainwashing and mental manipulation is a thing lets not forget that he has witnessed it firsthand with banner theres no excuse for him to have such a sudden change of heart other than to extend the conflict for another 15 minutes of mindless violence and leave the manchildren with the impression that theyve just witnessed an intricate revenge tragedy  all smoke and mirrors the constant quipping is an effective tool to cloud a fanboys mind and judgement  finally whats left is an entire team of worldclass heroes that got fooled by a man wearing a bucky mask not to mention that the villains stale trope was better executed 19 years ago when scream 2 came out ironically a film satirizing this cliché  if you dont think this is cartoonish and laughable you might be too young  c
May 5 2016,negative,i give one star for the great but safe  kids friendly action  at no point did i feel there was any danger to the characters since they can still make jokes in between and even the non superpowered heroes look so invincible    no stars for the plot cos it is definitely very bad zemo ultimate plans reveals was as bad as the fake mandarin as both were build up to have some great sinister plans which end up being empty zemos plans also required 90 of external uncontrollable factors but it somehow just works    but the worst thing about the movie is the appearance of spiderman  antman in the war becos of being starstrucked spiderman is all about great responsibilities and uncle ben would definitely never teach peter to fight to impress his idol as for scott lang he tried so hard to redeem himself in his own movie to see his daughter and now he just go into trouble with the law becos of his admiration for cap     civil war is definitely as letdown compared to winter soldier as winter soldier seems to signal a change in tone for marvel but now it revert back to the kids friendly movie for the general audience
May 5 2016,negative,way over rated crap
May 5 2016,positive,movie was fantastic major sticking issue though is that the studios are really diminishing the importance of the captain america villains at least zemo got a decent level of screen time baron strucker the guy who literally runs all of hydra barely lasted 30 seconds
May 5 2016,positive,its an ok movie the first hour was lacking the build up wasnt engaging enough but the second hour was good great action but its your normal marvel movie it felt episodic and follows the same disney formula not the best marvel movie but watchable for sure
May 5 2016,positive,perfectly paced excellent action and essential performances of some of the greatest comic book characters ever tom holland as spiderman cap 3 civil war is one of the best superhero films ive seen probably since the dark knight for me personally its easily my favorite marvel film and its darker tone and chemistry between these characters makes it a terrific sequel to the winter soldier a highly recommended summer blockbuster
May 5 2016,positive,the best marvel movie great performances  awesome action a really masterpiece
May 5 2016,negative,not quite xmen 3 better than captain america 1 i guess but far from the best marvel has to offer
May 5 2016,positive,great movie for the action aspect of it but the story does seem a bit weak at times overall great characters especially the new ones with incredible fight scenes that are sure to be remembered years later some of the conflicts seem forced and theres a very strong plot point marionette feeling despite the attempts to forge each characters motivations and back story i think this is one that will grow on you the second time you watch it
May 5 2016,positive,this movie was incredible oh my god im gonna see it over and over again
May 5 2016,positive,thrilling and darker in spots than expected but ultimately inconsequential in the way it shouldve been also really terrible cgi in a few spots flawlessly introduced the new heroes raising expectations for their coming solo films
May 5 2016,positive,not only an improvement on the previous avengers movie but also on the comic its based on as neither side is portrayed to be in the wrong and the overall result is unclear the only mistep is with zemo they make a conscious effort to try and add some complexity to him but its too late in the game and hes not really involved in the action  not to mention hes nothing like his comic book counterpart at all
May 5 2016,positive,civil war review  this is spoiler free but if you are the kind of person that would be worried about spoilers then youve probably already seen this anyway its been out for like a month what the hell took me so long anyway unless you are extremely sensitive about reviews you should be good     second to deadpool civil war was easily my next most anticipated film of the year as a bit of a marvel fanboy im first to state my love for the mcu the scope of the cinematic universe within seems almost limitless at this point they could go anywhere do anything and make a lead character out of anyone i trust in marvel  but i like to think that being a fan doesnt hinder my criticism of these films i am not blinded by bias and i take into account the faults thor the dark world wasnt the best movie ive ever seen for instance in fact i personally find that entry pretty boring and even though i thoroughly enjoyed films like antman and ironman 2 i understand that its not perfect cinema     but if anything comes close in films such as the ones that fit into the mcu its films like captain america civil war    captain america civil war review  jack fitzpatrick    theres really only one appropriate way to begin this particular review and thats to tell you where my mind remained as i walked out of cw spiderman   im pretty sure i fell in love with tom hollands version of spidey we briefly see both sides of the character through peter parker as well as his superhero counterpart and neither disappoint in the slightest he was goofy and awkward with an obvious lack of experience delivered the right level of humour without going too far and briefly presented us with what he was capable of in terms of you know kicking ass i very much look forward to the characters upcoming solo film homecoming     but hey in all honesty we all know that this wasnt a spiderman movie and whether he is your favourite part or not whether you love him or hate him spiderman isnt the focus of this story  as you may have guessed the film loosely follows the storyline titled civil war as an adaption there are glaring differences between the film and original comic and i think that thats a good thing the film focuses mostly on the characters that we already know and how the events affect them and so differing from the comics is an absence of characters from teams like the fantastic 4 and the xmen as well as many brate marvel characters the story has been moulded perfectly to suit the mcu as we get a mix of light hearted quips and gags for fans of other marvel films like guardians of the galaxy and ironman 3 among a much more mature story following closer in tone to the previous captain america film the winter soldier  as a third movie in the captain america series thus far i would say that this film succeeds in fulfilling the trend of being grander in scale as well as more established and comfortable with itself the films arent afraid to be serious when they need to be however do not drown out audiences in dreariness as well as keeping up with humour and personality throughout its a balance like this which separates films like this and deadpool from films like batman v superman which yes i still will say i didnt think it was as bad as others have said and the fantastic four    if there is one thing that makes these films so lovable its undeniably the characters and there is no short on characters in this film well i mean excluding thor and hulk  the film successfully presents us with an extravagant balancing of characters and their subsequent screen time everybody has at least a small part to play from antman being one of a few characters of comic relief to black panthers surprisingly involved role in the film they all get a chance to shine the introduction to this fairly unknown character in form of black panther was remarkably seamless too prior to the film i was personally unfamiliar with the character and i have to admit he has potential im curious to see whats to come from him    the performances enhance the emotional and moral lines that the film rests on throughout robert downey junior and chris evans of course do fantastic jobs however i dont think anybody was in doubt anyway these characters have evolved and yet have stayed consistent and the same throughout the franchise in a believable way tony stark remains a quick talking smartass however we see that he is also in many ways not the same man he was at the beginning of the first ironman movie steve rogers arguably is more or less the same however this makes the character so charming and noble he just wants to be the good guy this is where the characters arc lies as the morals of the mcu begin to blur grey the two characters remain heroes however are clearly divided by something which could be considered arguably bigger than they are or pointless depending on your interpretation of their conflict  the characters interaction and relationships are truly the heart of these film and civil war brings this up to a whole new level in terms of complexity a difference of opinion is enough to split our heroes apart and what follows comes a what may surprise some an intelligent political thriller  with no shortage of explosions superpowers and action set pieces to fill the gaps    speaking of the action i was happy to witness a good balance of fantastical battles of epic proportions as well as a few much more grounded sequences involving some great choreography in handtohand combat    the airport scene is nothing short of insane not to use such a generic cliché however the scene really felt like it was ripped out of a comic book a grand treat of visual glory had me sitting in pure astonishment who would have thought that wed ever see something like this 10 years ago yes admittedly the scene in context of the film may feel a little unnecessary and obviously set up for the audience to enjoy the film would have made sense without it however would we ever want the film without it with striking visuals quick and consistent jokes and a grand scale the airport scene has already become iconic    however the movie also works to deliver on a smaller scale a particular fight scene taking place on a stairwell for instance is just as impressive  if not more so  as the at this point iconic airport sequence its moments like these that show us that this film is not just brainless and flashy explosions and cgi but rather a more nuanced and passionate project    i wouldnt believe in that slightest that the people behind these movies do not care and are looking to get it all done as easily and lazily as possible while this movie will make all the money id argue that its worthy its a spectacle worth seeing whether you are a hardcore fan who owns every special edition bluray available and are there to see these movies opening day or are a more casual fan    that being said  this movie may be hard for somebody who isnt familiar with the characters or fictional universe to watch if you know nothing at all about these films i could see somebody getting confused so if you are the type of person who doesnt understand why batman and ironman will never be in the same movie i would recommend watching at the very least the avengers age of ultron as well as the previous captain america film the winter soldier prior to seeing this one we are after all 10 films into this franchise however its not absolutely necessary and with some attention to detail im sure a new viewer would be able to follow along    the film is also quite unpredictable when considering that its part of the superhero genre it doesnt resort to laziness and the movie certainly resists from falling in to the generic structure of a superhero film   there are no 45minute origin stories to be seen here as well as a clear lack of any giant cgi monster villains that want to take down cities the villain that is present has been gaining some mixed reception comes in form of the villain i will not spoil too much however i will say that i was personally quite the fan of him he was quite simply just a man and this was fitting a sympathetic and human villain was refreshing in contrast to another big ugly blue guy who wants to take over the world or something like that no he wasnt the most threatening villain weve seen and he may not have even been the most present however id argue that he was the most interesting that weve seen thus far in the mcu    the apocalypse was not upon us the world wasnt going to explode the film was much more grounded in a way that the stakes were personal the clash between characters were not made by enemies but allies and in the end the beauty of the film is that for many it can be hard to take a side   personally im probably more on ironmans side  at least initially so make of that what you will maybe this whole review abruptly became moot to you by that information because what crazy person wouldnt be on caps side well to that i say  i dunno im literally wearing a captain america hoodie right now as i write this so i clearly love them both    in the end civil war was an impressive feat in action and special effects as well as humour a morally grey story and with enough originality along with a delivery of fan service to please us all the russo brothers have truly made their mark on the mcu and it has been far from disappointing civil war is a fresh take on the superhero genre despite being the 13th film in the franchise it never feels like weve seen this all before at least not for me a faithful  yet different adaption to the comic civil war succeeds greatly    i dont really think that i could have enjoyed this movie any more than i did    1010
May 5 2016,positive,if there was only one marvel movie to see this would be the one although you would need to know just a hint of things from previous movies from the series this movie is well worth the money 1010 
May 5 2016,positive,some parts where entertaining but the plot was kinda boring the reason for the russian to start all this was so dull
May 5 2016,positive,a few years ago some of the greatest characters in marvel history opened a new world to us thanks to the creative and production team behind 2008s iron man nobody thought the film would have the impact like it did now we are in 2016 and we have reached the thirteenth film of the marvel cinematic universe mcu and as everyone had guessed it boasts the most characters in a marvel film is one of the best films in the entire marvel franchise and also contains some of greatest action scenes in comic book film history now i absolutely loved batman v superman i am sorry for bringing this film up but it is an important point but one thing lacking in the film was the depth to establish the characters agendas here we speaking in terms of the general audience understand why they are fighting each other and it makes sense more importantly directors russo brothers handled the inclusion of many characters in the same film with different ideas effectively this was a vital strong and one reason why i felt this film was so good i think another special aspect of this film was that despite my initial worries its not an avengers film yes it features most of the beloved characters minus thor and hulk but it is a story about two friends in the face of adversary caught up in a world they dont belong in but have inadvertently become so deeply involved in the film is not mistakenly titled because it still is in all important aspects a captain america movie its just that he isnt alone the sheer size of this potential billiondollar movie calls for an equally mammoth effort from sibling directors anthony and joe russo who also both helmed caps previous film winter soldier their deft maneuver results in a beautifully crafted cinematic piece whose towering bravura bestows the entire proceedings with striking depth and sentimentality which may not be the first for the genre but enough to make it marvels best film to date it really is a good idea to watch both captain america films before and notice the detail put in to incorporate these stories captain america aka steve roger has been my favorite avenger and seeing the character develop in all these three films is really amazing this movie has a whole new flavor and thats exactly what was needed from marvel films and it looks like they have topped themselves again based on the comic book event of 20062007 following the events of avengers age of ulton 2015 and captain america the winter soldier 2014 the current team of avengers consisting falcon anthony mackie black widow scarlett johansson scarlett witch elizabeth olsen and captain america chris evans reach lagos nigeria to stop brock rumlow  crossbones frank grillo from stealing a bio weapon the altercation leads to the death of several wakandan relief workers the result of which the international community responds with alarm and distrust of the avengers thaddeus thunderbolt ross william hurt reprising his role from the incredible hulk immediately ordered a conference to bring together to acclaimed heroes after showing the dramatic and terrible consequences of their actions it opens way for the culprit of this civil war  sokovia accords established by the united nations that treaty aims to put each of the actions and missions of the avengers in the hands of the united nations taking into account that it will be them who decide if the heroes can act or not while humbled by the guilt of his previous failures from previous films tony stark as iron man robert downey jr is in favor of the proposal rogers ruffled by his intimate experience of governmental corruption from previous films is suspicious but might have agreed to compromise if not for the involvement of his lifelong friend turned former soviet sleeper assassin winter soldier aka bucky barnes sebastian stan barnes has been framed for a terrorist bombing in south africa and rogers is alone in defending his innocence with the help of a mystery malefactor daniel bruhl the rift between heroes grows as the remaining heroes choose their sides leading into a civil war this was exactly the perfect vehicle to deliver a film to advance the character of captain america but also give tony stark a perfect finishing arc what makes both steve and tony interesting arent their abilities or weapons but the men themselves steves moral code and man out of time elements are tested in this film but not in a way anyone saw coming the viewer that normally would trust that cap is doing whats right can look at his actions in a different light he is still coming to terms with a past that is long gone and he is still longing for a better more decent era putting bucky back in the mix clouds his judgment dealing with the shades of grey of the modern era and being part of any controlling organization after the events of the winter soldier movie has changed him its exactly like all the epic events and decisions tony stark has made over five films has changed the character of iron man the resulting conflict between the two is as epic as can be the spy theme is pretty constant throughout the film with for example a hunt for a terrorist through several countries there is also focus on terror acts which feels both modern and disturbing considering todays world situation the other thing that the film does really well is balancing the characters the film contains a lot of superheroes and it is at times hard to keep track on everyone but with finesse and a prioritized focus they choose which ones will run the story and which ones will figure as background characters very smart and thoughtout with most focus on captain america and then iron man they succeed much better than the previous avenger films and most of all the latest batman v superman the film also facilitates the solid introduction of chad bosemans black panther whose standalone film is due in 2018 an heir to the throne full of hatred and pain perfect for his own movie and with a fresh and innovative appearance but perhaps as most people whove seen it will say the entry of the amazing webslinger is the films most anticipated highlight tom hollands spiderman is a breath of fresh air and it delivers some hope for the characters looming third big screen incarnation next year his comic timing may have been at par with that of paul rudds antman who shares one of the most genuine fanboy moments in the movie it also benefits from good twists this time its not an alien force or robot invasion but a real rift between the members a more depth than previously done eventually they end up in small and large skirmishes alike theres ample choreography to enhance the fights the ones who rely on their fists are treated with amazing intense scuffle while the others are done with good deal of cg the two elements work wonderfully together shifting between them with ease and fluid transition each character has their own style their signature which translates well into the humor they trade punches and banters with equal measure the movie has reached the balanced between cracking jokes and presenting a riveting story the real villain zemo is the first villain in the mcu that is just some guy who has a plan to tear the avengers apart due to some personal vendetta not any world domination scenarios for once i think marvel nailed it zemo is a great villain with clear believable motivations whose convoluted plan is probably makes just as much sense as the joker from the dark knight frank grillos crossbones looked awesome and would have been a great villain but he is sadly wasted in the film the chemistry between chris evans and robert downey jr is phenomenal and although they are both the stars of the film as it were the best performances of the movie come from sebastian stan chadwick boseman and much to everybodys delight tom holland when i first heard that holland would be taking up the iconic role i wasnt sure i had grown up with tobey maguire as spiderman followed by andrew garfield and i thought that he would be irreplaceable for the rest of time but tom holland knocked it out of the park and he truly made the role his own during his short time on screen jeremy renner anthony mackie don cheadle paul bettany elizabeth olsen scarlett johansson martin freeman emily vancamp and william hurt play their parts very well i could go on forever about how good all of the performances were honorable mentions must go to daniel bruhl and paul rudd with a run time of 146 minutes there was a lot to cram in but in the end as a marvel film this one is the best by far on the whole captain america civil war isnt just one of the best superhero films it is an outstanding film outside of the genre it is emotional hilarious and most importantly awesome i cannot recommend the film enough watch it twice
May 5 2016,positive,basically a perfect comic book movie highlights  spidey has arrived and is better then ever and who cant love black panther amazed how they managed to hold movie structure with so many characters and made it work unlike bat vs sup marvel wins
May 5 2016,neutral,pros   spider man  ant man  stan lees cameo  some cool action scenes  cons   no real conclusion  weak bare villain  not as compelling and gripping as the winter  soldier  overall 2 12 okay  some things civil war does well but others like the villain zemo not so
May 5 2016,positive,3 words i want more
May 5 2016,positive,a slick movie with loads of special effects thrilling actionscenes and the likes yet eventually all the cgi effects and computer animations are starting to get boring and you start longing back for a deeper story with more eye for detail
May 5 2016,positive,im not 100 convinced that captain america civil war is the best film the marvel cinematic universe has produced but its by far the best example of why it was worth constructing in the first place and why its not going anywhere anytime soon
May 5 2016,positive,captain america civil war is a lot of fun this film expertly juggles action drama humor and multiple character storylines in a way that almost makes you almost forget that this is the longest marvel movie to date the plot is compelling and the actors play well off of each other the ending isnt as satisfying as i had hoped it would be and you have to have seen at least captain america the winter soldier and avengers age of ultron to fully understand what is going on but overall this is one of the best movies in the marvel cinematic universe
May 5 2016,positive,a great mixture of comedy drama and action really impressive this is where the cumulative effect on characters relationship and storyline from the previous movies is seen and makes the movie main conflicts really engaging and emotional conclusion favorite mcu movie so far hands down
May 5 2016,positive,that captain america and iron man fight scene got me right in the feels
May 5 2016,neutral,its pretty much the same thing as the other superhero vs superhero film we saw earlier this year except more characters and no villain but other than that it was good i liked it
May 5 2016,positive,funny witty impactful emotional marvel movie with solid story behind it sort of weak villian
May 5 2016,positive,one of the best movies this year not just comic book movies but movies in general a movie with lots of thrills  drama action fast pacing  good editing and the performances are all great  from start to finish and did a mention that spiderman is in it 
May 5 2016,positive,a great mix of fun and seriousness to make this on of marvels best yet excellent script
May 5 2016,positive,an excellent ensemble film and yet another triumph for marvel full review at  
May 5 2016,positive,this movie is good great fight scenes it has a lot of superheroes in it spiderman and black panther are a revelation but sometimes you feel is too long probably everything could have been ended in less than 2 hours
May 5 2016,positive,no spoilers absolutely spectacular  must see in 3d  stick around until after all of  the credits not just the first one
May 5 2016,positive,by far the best of marvel movies
May 5 2016,negative,capt america civil warit is what you expect a marvel movie to be  but for me thats just not enough anymore  i feel like marvel is the nickleback of movies  ya theyre catchy and popular but its the same thing over and over again and its spoon feeding things to you and were just lapping it up  you want spidey you get himnever mind that he serves zero purpose  the reason for them all facing off seems unearned and yes i am comparing this to bvs which got ripped apart for tackling the exact same issues in a way that i feel makes way more sense in bvs than it ever does in civil war and say what you will about eisenberg as lex but he for sure is memorable where as yet again marvel has a completely forgettable villain    cgi was i guess mostly fine but at times seemed over used and at others times just somehow off  theres a trailer with bucky and cap beating on iron man  i never felt like that was a good scene it looked off to me like the speed and movement was wrong or something and that issue happened a few times for me in the movie  like but not as bad as matrix 2 where human movement is just off and they appear more like gumby than human    it will do well and people will love it and i get it  and among all marvel movies it may be 3rd or 4th best to me  i just think  ive had my fill of paintbynumbers movie making
May 5 2016,positive,excellent great good very good and amazingly y d
May 5 2016,positive,i wanted so much to like this film more than i actually did marvel s civil war storyline was an epic that impacted every heros storyline the film is far from awful but various aspects of this adaptation failed to reach the potenti  al of what could had been the best marvel film this decade sadly i am left with a mix of joy and disappointment the lows  the motivations of the avengers vs those of the original plotlines the battle is far less epic due to it being centred around the avengers being regulated rather than the originals motivations being about the registration act this leaves to many questions to why the non avengers would even want to risk their lives over various personal gripes and some stringent rules some complaints over the films pacing repetition and under use of black panther and spidey who were the films high points films good points  charismatic strong character of black panther who never bored me in any scene he was in even the weaker ones loved the ant man and spidey scenes the casting of the new spiderman was a masterstroke and the actor captured peter parkers nerdy teen perfectly i cannot fault any scene he was in the film as a whole can be redeemed for its slacking off story wise by simply changing the films title its an internal battle not a civil war and it feels far removed from the original story arc the graphic novels was epic and far grander because hit further than just the avengers cutting of a few scenes adding of some new and of course a new name would make this into a far superior film than three one i just saw today did i enjoy the film sometimes yes other times during the movie no more good than bad but it the weakest of all the captain america films thus far i am in the minority as the film is getting plenty of positive reviews on rotten tomatoes this is just one opinion a film can not please everyone glad i saw it nonetheless for ant man black panther and spidey alone but this is one marvel film that i wont be buying on dvd
May 5 2016,positive,what batman v superman should have been  plenty of fun and humorous moments but isnt scared to go into deep debatable aspects with heart  action is awesome tense creative and all the characters have plenty to contribute with plenty of variety  definitely recommended to anyone
May 5 2016,positive,captain america civil war is marvel at its peak offering a plethora of interesting characters all of whom are superbly portrayed bolstered by an engaging and coherent narrative in short civil war is a breath of fresh air in the superhero genre    full review 
May 5 2016,positive,saw it for second time and it is still the best superhero movie they have ever made
May 5 2016,positive,got my tickets already
May 5 2016,neutral,entertaining fights nothing else the story sucked
May 5 2016,positive,action from start to finish best captain america film to date  great effects for a young robert downey jr
May 5 2016,positive,watch should anyone who wants to see the solo films about the new characters  honored 88 balls thanks joe russo 2 hours of happiness in my life 
May 5 2016,positive,crazy fun the directors love for the marvel universe is clear and the reason it works so well this is going to kill in the box office and not just because of marketing and brand recognition delivers the goods
May 5 2016,positive,the cumshot of super hero movies all youve been waiting for just hit climax
May 5 2016,positive,fantastic  really good fight scenes without being edited to a blur  great story although not quite a 911 level event to start the war of course the addition of spidey was excellent especially since the main war scene was filmed in imax and was incredible
May 5 2016,positive,it was amazing the number one captain america movie wich to me was the marvels best i love it and it its written perfectly it doesnt follow the comic much but the idea behind it comes through you know the spirit of the comic is there and well the directors have already proven to be good so no need to praise them its just a good movie with awesome fight scenes
May 5 2016,positive,best mcu film  this was a very anticipated movie and well exceeded my expectations people who are looking for a comic book copy will be disappointed but if they were too true to the comics the continuity of the other mcu films wouldnt have made sense many people are saying this studio copied the plot from batman v superman um no they didnt the marvel civil war predates that idea other than that cant wait to see what the studio that can do no wrong brings us this november
May 5 2016,positive,a must see movie action packed
May 5 2016,positive,standout performance for sebastian stan really great as bucky barnestom holland is hilarious as spiderman    you must see this film  at the beginning is a little to slow but it covers up later with terrific action scenes 
May 5 2016,positive,cool enough story fun action movie pretty much as good as the first captain america movie so its a good bet youll like this if you liked that
May 5 2016,positive,a definite breath of fresh air after such an okay 2015 for the mcu civil war manages to evoke the charm that made this franchise so lovable back in 2008
May 5 2016,positive,lets be honest its not epic not crap just meh
May 5 2016,positive,probably the best marvel movie since the first iron man sets the bar high for future superhero movies and solidifies marvels domination of the  superhero movie genre
May 5 2016,positive,hands down this is the best film marvel has done yet  i really thought it would be difficult to beat the original avengers iron man and cap winter soldier but civil war does it  not only is the action some of the best yet the story script and actor performances are also top notch  marvel is doing what fox  wb isnt doing getting quality stories and scripts and injecting superheroes into them  this is the way marvel will keep their films going while other studios may see superhero fatigue suffered first
May 5 2016,negative,the movie is  boring the storyline is very slow and the action scenes in general were not wow it was great how each character was used in the main fight never the less put the main fight aside the rest is about captain america and his best bro i was hoping to see more about the other characters and less about bucky    and honestly the reason why all this happened is really really really stupid      i was really hoping to see a better movie
May 5 2016,positive,boasting one of the biggest lineups in superhero cinematic history the balance between plot development character development and action would always be in question fortunately for the russo brothers and marvel studios theyve seemed to get the balancing spoton civil war has just enough mystery and complexity to keep you guessing until hell breaks loose antman spidey and black panther steal the show daniel bruhl is such a compelling bad guy you almost want him to succeed almost unfortunately there are some problems gaping plot holes and some silly action sequences that are thrown in to the mix that because this bigger picture is taking place might fly right over your head there is also a very seemingly forced love interest wrapped into this sort of awkward tension that you think because its so awkwardly put together might not be happening however come the beginning of the third act we find out it is very much happening simply put it wasnt needed to further the plot or any characters development seeing all these heroes who would normally sit back seat in a major picture really shine is what makes this film stick out from the rest it seems as if new fighting moves and sequences were written for the second fiddle heroes and the larger heroes were simply kept to that safe marvel formula this was odd but very effective overall if you can look past the plot holes and the awkwardly romantic cringeworthy sexual tension civil war is a pretty mint action flick if you cant get past that stuff its still pretty damn fun to watch
May 5 2016,positive,while i was tentative about this movies effectiveness given my knowledge of the source material i can safely say that they created an independent work that is worth the price of admission excellent story telling and gripping fightaction sequences    marvel ftw
May 5 2016,positive,8 years of storytelling comes together in this one film and it pays off big time 
May 5 2016,positive,another amazing addition into the mcu film lore this movie is packed with incredible action and it does set the stage for more upcoming movies
May 5 2016,positive,civil war brings closure to the captainbucky story and opens up the mcu phase 3 in a very different place than we have seen our heroes the action is top notch and the story keeps you glued to the screen in this summers biggest blockbuster
May 5 2016,negative,thats the beauty of living in thailand we often preview movies before the states  dont waste your time unless you just need an air conditioned room with stale popcorn and overpriced sugar water horrible confusing  plot one fight scene where because of this plot you cant make out who is supposed to be fighting who and a conclusion better to chew tinfoil than see this sad attempt at stealing your hard earned dollars
May 5 2016,positive,this feels like  marvel is patting themselves on the back and celebrating their cinematic universe with civil war everything you could want as a comic book fan spiderman and antman make great appearances as well
May 5 2016,positive,i used to say that never one superhero movie could beat the dark knight so this day has come
May 5 2016,positive,one of the best movies ive ever seen its so good and complex to the point you might want to see it twice in one day
May 5 2016,positive,great movie spiderman and antman steal the movie wish they were in it more or teamed up for their own movie movie was long but didnt slow downso no time for bathroom break i believe this the best of all the avengeriron mancaptain america etc movies well done
May 5 2016,positive,winter soldier had great emotion between rogers and bucky this movie successfully puts all the avengers together seamlessly and flawlessly i couldnt believe how smooth this flick was great plot great moments of psychological torture not seen in marvel yet i believe this flick is the overall best that i have seen the conflict of stark and rogers is 1000x more belivable than the conflict in bat v superman go see this flick its solid
May 5 2016,positive,although not an absolute thrill ride its a  decent film with some satisfying moments
May 5 2016,negative,shit this movie is sucks
May 5 2016,positive,thats how you make a superhero v superhero movie
May 5 2016,positive,i love it definitely one of the best marvel movies the only problem i found and that is why i give it 4 stars is that the script is kind of confusing at sometimes during the movie also the first 2 thirds of the movie is slow like the pacing is moving to slow and there is no action but after that the action begins and everything is amazing the new spiderman is a very god actor hope to see the stand alone movie
May 5 2016,positive,probably the most human marvel film i have seen probably a tab long and not quite a satisfying conclusion a brilliant interwoven story and balance of characters and tone
May 5 2016,positive,although it felt as though i knew too much about this film headed in there were enough surprises to keep it enjoyable and with some pretty powerful emotions that are not often found in superhero movies another wonder from marvel
May 5 2016,positive,i would buy this in blue ray
May 5 2016,positive,at first before you walked into the cinema all you could think about is whom youll support captain america or iron man    thats what happened to me too    but once you sit there in front of the screen and let the storyline flow as you let yourself into it you slowly changed your mind now all your concern is not about who will win between the two team or who is wrong who is right    this is the movie where you can see those superheroes are also human and has their ego which is also relatable to our daily life where every big problems come from persistency and selfishness     in this case you couldnt hate steve because you know hes just trying to do what is right you cant either hate tony because you realize he is just trying to keep the team away from problem and just feel emotional of things that happened    absolutely the best marvel movie so far which all you see is not superheroes kicking bad guy ass but that sometimes even the mightiest force on earth can also have the emotional tension between them     this movie is so thrilling exciting yet emotional the russos has done an incredible job bringing the other team member featuring the movie yet it still taste as captain americas movie just like how the title said     standing applause
May 5 2016,positive,what a movie thank you tottent 
May 5 2016,positive,this movie was the perfect example of how you take an overcrowded cast and make it work the directors focused on only the important people of the movie sure there were a lot of characters but each was given the perfect amount of screen time baring daniels brühls character zemo which ill get to the fight sequences were probably the most improved area of the this film in the past its been very difficult to follow an action sequence but since the russo brothers took tips from john wick directors the improvements perfectly displayed in this movie   daniel brühls zemo was such a great villain darker than the usual marvel villains his performance shown very well he was chilling yet cool and calm and the idea behind his motivation is brilliant the one nitpick i have is that his character wasnt as fleshed out as it could have been but ill get to that soon i think thats due to the running time of the movie chadwick boseman was the perfect choice for the prince or rather king tchalla the black panther he left me wanting to get to his solo movie sooner the fact that his story for this movie focuses on the monarchy of wakanda passing to him and how he is both warrior and king just sounds freaking awesome finally tom holland as spiderman was the shining jewel of the movie his performance was faultless the way he stuttering when he was introduced to robert downey juniors iron man was a barrel of laughs also the fact that he was very chatty during fight scenes with anthony mackies falcon and sebastian stans bucky the winter solider  to the point where falcon points out that theres usually not a lot of talking just shows you marvels class when it comes to casting in saying all this there were a couple things that didnt seem to fit for me but these are king of nitpicks chadwick bosemans accent as king tchalla wasnt as refined as it could have been some of his lines showed cracks in his accent hopefully he changes it for the solo movie the next nitpick is the scene in which scarlet johannsens black widow incapacitated the black panther by shooting in a nonlethal way him with electric taser type thing i thought that was a little pis considering jeremy renners hawkeye had claimed in the previous scene that i dont miss and then proceeded to miss two shots when confronting black panther  what im trying to say is that if anyone in the whole entire marvel universe could hit the black panther its hawkeye so if hawkeye misses then black widow shouldnt do any better the fact that the black widow shot him 3 times i think it was and he didnt seem to take an evasive action like he did against hawkeye smelled of pis big time i can feel the feminist trying kill me with voodoo dolls its not anything to do with the fact that shes a woman in fact shes shows her particular skills in hand to hand combat with the heavy weights of the film crossbones the winter solider hawkeye which shows she is more than capable of beating any man or woman up its just that her character in previous films is shown to be a spyhand to hand combat specialist and nothing but those skills no expert marksmen skills mentioned in any of the mcu movies so when she displays perfect aim that she previously has not and incapacitates someone black panther who is is fresh off beating the greatest marksmen hawkeye in the mcu its safe to conclude that this part of the movie was pis at its finest the next nitpick is the scene that takes place when buckythe winter solider is awaking with his arm in a vice with the captain standing in front of him he captain america says which bucky am i talking to bucky responds by saying something that only those two remember the captain then deems him sane and they head off to the next part of their mission this scene is a problem because before that scene bucky had just had his memory reset by the zemo the villain of the movie meaning he is the full on russian speaking winter solider again plus he had just decimated an entire room of heros baring the black panther which include his allies falcon and chris evans captain america and nearly murders the captain again  the problem is simple in one scene hes the evil winter solider and in the next hes bucky the good guy this could have worked if it was explained but it wasnt there was zero explanation as to how he becomes the good old bucky again the next nitpick is daniel brühls zemo i loved his performance but his character wasnt as fleshed out as it could have been the whole movie was building him up to be someone with a secret mission with his focus on finding out what mission report 1991it leads the audience to believe that he wants something to do with the winter solider program but we are corrected when murders the rest of the winter solider unit this leads to the scene where he explains to the black panther that everything he did in the movie because he lost his family in the sokovian incident when i heard him say that line i was bewildered if the director could have had a scene during the film in which we see maybe a sokovain family grieving or something of that nature without making it obvious that this is the motivation behind the villains actions then it would have held more weight and emotion when he revealed this to black panther it would have been a shocking reveal but it just wasnt done right dont get me wrong i loved the idea that they built him up to be a man with an evil agenda when really he was just a man grieving for his familys loss thats a great idea it just could have been polished is all im saying i know they hinted that concept when the viewers repeatedly saw him listening and relistening to an audio message left in his inbox but thats why its a nitpick the final nitpick is the final conflict between iron man and the duo of captain america and bucky in all the films shown iron man has been seen duking it out with thor and handling blows form the magic hammer mjolnir not that kind of hammer as well as surviving tank blasts to the face with nothing but a scratch he also has technology that can destroy tanks with a single missile fly as fast as or sometimes faster than any human piloted jet plus that beam in his chest is enough to blast back thor and destroy robots like ultron if pushed to its upper limits and this is all from the films so you could imagine that a fight even with to enhanced soldiers would be a piece of cake sure cap has his shield but iron had in previous scene revealed a weak spot in captain americas fighting style simply titled go for his legs so iron man should be able to take these two easy however this being a captain america movie i expected them to depower iron man in some way so that they could emerge victorious and so as predicted they cap and buckyemerged victorious execept yet again there is no explanation as to why iron man hasnt used his bombs or chest beam  or why he didnt analyse the captains fight patterns which hes uses far too late into the conflict which is weird considering iron man is a bloody genius plus he knows that cap is superior when it comes to hand to hand combat i mean he had just seen a video of winter solider bucky killing his parents  so he had all the motivation to kill bucky so why didnt he just bomb him thats where pis comes into play again and we are forced to watch iron man with the entire previously listed skills struggle against two enhanced soldiers which doesnt seem right without an explanation other than those nitpicks the movie was everything batman vs superman should have been in terms of story line action sequences is a different matter the director pieced this story together perfectly and as previously stated only focused on the important roles of the movie which is the two leads in chris evans and robert downey junior with minor threads here and there placed perfectly throughout the movie the inclusion of spiderman was justified and explained enough as he didnt play a huge roll in the movie  and of course the humour in this movie shows that marvel is solid when it comes to family friendly movies all in all great watch
May 5 2016,positive,this movie has a great plot and its easy to understand the most i like from this movie is the plot twist that make better story than the conflict one
May 5 2016,positive,the best marvel movie ive seen yet and the best cbm ive seen in general
May 5 2016,positive,i was pretty underwhelmed by the last entry that winter soldier bobbins despite the high praise  i was also a little put off by the eye watering number of  superheroes theyve shoehorned into this entryyou know what though this is fun  the plot is actually semi serious and wont have grown ups bored andor cringing behind their hands  the additional characters are actually fun and add some much needed light relief despite myself im now actually looking forward to the new spiderman film  it all moves along at a nice clip as well  its not the best film youve ever seen it doesnt move you like the new star wars film  it is an enjoyable popcorn munching multiplex offering though
May 5 2016,positive,i love the part when after fighting with black panther for a while cap says here kitty kitty when looking for him lol
May 5 2016,positive,this installment of the marvel universe is the best by far from beginning to end i was filled with excitement and greatly entertained disney has the winning superhero movie formula and they should be raking in the dough as i see this one challenging even star wars the force awakens in the box office totals i cannot wait to see whats next with this story because the bar has been raised the tone has been set and it doesnt get any better than this action packed and hilarious movie for the whole family so get your tickets quick this will be sold out at every show
May 5 2016,positive,an absolutely amazing movie  action pack  great story  all around good movie  good job
May 5 2016,positive,great with every sides  i mean caps
May 5 2016,positive,ill just cut to the chase directly i didnt like civil war im too filled up of the emotions after watching the movie that i dont care about properly editing this post and make it look good    spoiler alert  spoilers ahead    problem with civil war is that the actual reason that they wanted to show that resulted in forming two groups among avengers got sidelined it started with registration act which shouldve been the actual reason but then it got lost somewhere captain america and iron man were fighting against each other because of the winter soldier whos captains best friend he got framed for an attack and in order to save him captain america got against shield and iron man thats one fine reason and i can understand why falcon was supporting captain as hes always on his side    but then suddenly captain americas team recruited two new members  hawkeye and antman i dont understand what was driving them to fight with captain america against shield and tony stark the reason of registration act was not mentioned again ever and it became a revenge story for tony stark to avenge his parents death also spidermans cameo is awesome and fun but again hes just trusting tony stark and fighting against one of the most famous and disciplined hero  captain america without any reason    what would have been better was to keep the registration act the focus of the movie and thus the two groups as was in the comics story line whats strange is there were people who didnt like the reason for which superman fought batman in batman vs superman ie because his mother was taken hostage but then same set of people justify the reason of saving ones best friends from shield as a valid reason    well i didnt like civil war much and i am really shocked that on the one hand this movie has a score of over 90 on rotten tomatoes and on the other hand batman vs superman dawn of justice is sitting at 26 rotten not even this civil war currently is in imdb top 250 list number 88
May 4 2016,positive,despite being overstuffed with superfluous characters and story lines civil war manages to be one of the more entertaining marvel films thanks to some fantastic action sequenceshigher personal stakes and an exuberant amount of fan service
May 4 2016,negative,it was such a disappointment i fell sleep during this movie after waiting that long it was just waste of time and money
May 4 2016,positive,this has an excellent story an astounding cast amazing visual effect and exceptional direction
May 4 2016,positive,as a fan of films comic books and comic book films i loved this movie the characterisation of every character was perfect in my opinion and the fight choreography in some scenes was very impressive the only quarrel i have with this film is yet another underutilized villain in baron helmut zemo with him being used only as a plot device more than a well developed character however this was remedied by the strong introduction of both spiderman and black panther overall one of my favourite mcu films to date
May 4 2016,positive,at first i had mixed emotions towards this film although the action sequences were great the story seemed a little discombobulated at times in the beginning a lot things were happening at once and they seem to not have the ability to pin point the main conflict but as the story goes on the film gets better and better the action scenes were euphoric the dialogues were clever and the story became rather personal and darker towards the end but my biggest issue with this film is that at times i feel rather disconnected with some characters like black widow hawkeye and falcon nonetheless this is still a very fun and great action film to watch
May 4 2016,positive,mind officially blown
May 4 2016,positive,best marvel movie its a orgasum of comic book goodness
May 4 2016,positive,just finished the prescreening and loved it may adjust my score tomorrow after another round
May 4 2016,positive,great movie outstanding fight scene script acting and spider man was not some stupid hipster comic and super hero fans will enjoy this movie highly recommend to watch it in 3d
May 4 2016,positive,saw the premier i can honestly say that this is what batman v superman should have been intense powerful with a strong message and actionpacked throughout come on dc get your act together
May 4 2016,positive,not gonna lie its been about two hours since i got out of seeing captain america civil war and my natural instinct upon thinking about it is to stand up and applaud as the 13th film of the marvel cinematic universe it does something borderline miraculous  it keeps things interesting after twelve films of origin stories teamups and intergalactic villains the writers and directors of this latest adventure found a way to break the mold and keep things fresh in what is essentially the best avengers film even though its officially a captain america film    i could probably writes pages and pages about why this flick stands out as marvels best film yet but i want to get you into theater seats as fast as possible so lets run through the baseline reasons faster than the dearly departed quicksilver    1 variations on the comic book movie plot       nine times out of ten a comic book movies plot is about as complex as the hero fighting against a new villain to save either the world or himself from certain destruction this trope has slowly fallen out of favor in recent years and civil war goes a long way to shattering it further by delivering a wellcrafted plot that believably pits close friends against each other this politicallycharged change in storyline is loaded with thoughtprovoking parallels to our real world and now it just seems hard to imagine a good oldfashioned stop the villain plot being as entertaining anymore  2 focus on the story at hand    one of my complaints about recent comic book movies is the trend toward spending an inordinate amount of screentime building up and teasing plotlines of future movies and while there is certainly a little bit of that going on in civil war the main story never takes a backseat to it and as a result those little teases are shockingly welcome instead of being a distracting time filler  3 a worthwhile villain   theres no denying the fact that the marvel cinematic universe has featured a bevy of relatively lackluster and forgettable villains loki excluded but this is one instance where the villain shines through as the mysterious colonel zemo daniel brühl weaves an intricate web that turns our favorite heroes against each other without exotic makeup or flashy powers proves once again that theres nothing wrong with a little intelligent simplicity every now and then  4 a wellbalanced screenplay       there are a lot of components and characters at play in civil war and it would have been easy for all of it to spin wildly out of control but major props must be given to screenwriters christopher markus and stephen mcfeely for keeping it all tight they keenly juggle the complex mix of characters with a blend of seriousness humor and suspense without the film ever feeling like a mess the effort is borderline award worthy   5 solid acting    comic book movies rarely receive acclaim for the performances of their actors but dammit theres some really solid work here from everyone involved chris evans and robert downey jr in particular give their best efforts yet as these characters and when these two pals violently come to blows you genuinely feel every punch  6 fastpaced direction   major kudos also need to be thrown in the direction of joe and anthony russo who after showing surprisingly deft skills with the winter soldier prove they were born to direct comic book movies despite being jampacked with characters and subplots these crafty brothers keep things moving at lightning speed without ever losing focus or clarity i honestly cant wait to see what they do with the avengers infinity war  7 humor   a movie about good friends and allies being turned against one another and actually coming to blows would seemingly be a depressing and humorless affair but holy hell  this movie is funny sure there are painful moments but a good laugh is always around the corner to relieve the tension and keep things light and while i dont believe that every comic book movie needs to have this much comic relief they really hit the nail on the head with it here and deliver a perfectly wellrounded film  8 spiderman   i mention humor above and hands down one of the big sources of that is from none other than everyones favorite webslinger with the most recent attempt at a spiderman film franchise running into the ground sony pictures has wisely thrown a hail mary and teamed up with marvel studios to deliver what appears to be the definitive onscreen version of the character tom holland absolutely nails the role of peter parkerspiderman with a percussive wit and loads of charm those out there who groaned at the prospect of yet another reboot of the character will find themselves panting with anticipation for spiderman homecoming to be released next year  9 black panther   civil war boasts not one but two character introductions that are about to blow audiences away with significantly more screentime than spiderman we have chadwick boseman as black panther a royal prince from the african nation of wakanda who is thrown into the mix of the story on the hunt for revenge but ends up choosing sides in the war amongst the avengers seeing black panther in action is an absolute thrill and i cant wait to see even more   10 the airport fight       lets get one thing very clear if youve ever giggled with glee at a superhero action sequence on screen there is a scene in civil war that will put you over the edge into a void pure joy i will simply refer to this as the airport fight trust me youll know it when you see and it is bonkers it is where things truly come to a head with the entire cast of the movie and everyone gets at least one completely geektastic moment and if you never thought much of antman before i promise you hes going to leave a big impression    so what are you waiting for get your ass to the theater
May 4 2016,negative,movie was ok but not great the villain sucked like always tired of waiting for a good villain
May 4 2016,positive,captain amãrica films are always the best
May 4 2016,positive,iron man is so pity  this movie makes me sad   i want to see story about captain america
May 4 2016,positive,i really wanna see this
May 4 2016,positive,see batman v superman marvel did what you tried to do but it did it even better and schooled you in the process it is possible to do a superheroesatoddswitheachother movie without having it be too grim too convoluted or too draggy and you can still introduce new characters for the sake of fan service as long as you integrate them into the plot in a smart way that doesnt seem like a desperately shoehorned footnote this more than made up for the earlier disappointment that was bvs and ended up being one of my favorite entries in the marvel cinematic universe so far
May 4 2016,positive,in the renewed battle between studio superhero film franchises marvel defeats dc in another round with their hardest punch yet captain america civil war extending their win streak begun with captain america the winter solider directing duo joe and anthony russo raise the stakes in the marvel cinematic universe once again crafting a serious story darker in tone than their first film and less political placing the key conflict between captain america chris evans and tony stark robert downey jr in a global fight to define the true purpose of the avengers as a unit    marvels smartest move in unleashing this civil war the film is not an excuse to feed audiences more avenger battles for sheer destruction sake like some superhero king kong vs godzilla    or batman v superman dawn of justice this civil war is a reckoning the contentious summary of dynamic hit marvel films and character arcs leading up to it marvel has now matured in its art and purpose far beyond zach snyders dark fumblings that have laid waste to metropolis with directorial ennui and dramatic emptiness    in this third captain america chapter our supers are still paying the price for the moral and material destruction following the avengers new york battle with lokis alien army in an increasingly unstable world extending beyond hydras attempt to hijack shield and the avengers in winter soldier and elevated above the internal avenger bickering in age of ultron civil war forces the avengers to confront the reality of an earth society now suspicious about the avengers unregulated power to inflict as much harm as they accomplish heroic good    the avengers  and scarlet witch elizabeth olsen in particular  are put on the spot from the opening scenes in which such a mission of mercy in lagos takes a tragic wrong turn the us secretary of state thaddeus ross played by william hurt reprising his role from 2008s the incredible hulk as a tiein from the predisney marvel universe slaps the sokovia accords on the table which demands the avengers operate only under united nations orders and jurisdiction a superhero civil war among the avengers begins will they sign the accord and accept un authority or refuse and exist as international outlaws    avoiding spoilers its safe to say thanks to the films posters that captain america and stark land on opposite sides of this question and alliances among the remaining avengers form along these internal battle lines do the avengers accept government authority and risk being corrupted by the political machinations evidenced in winter soldiers intrigues or does the team refuse world government oversight and take on personal responsibility for their combined actions the beauty of the avengers answer fought out over the bulk of the film is that both choices have logical justification and practical faults in their effect further complicating the fight is the stilltroubling presence of bucky buchanan sebastian stan glitching out in his winter soldier mode dividing and testing avenger loyalties and causes simultaneously this civil war is one treacherous layer cake that is as delicious to the eyes as the minds of its audience    returning franchise screenwriters christopher markus and stephen mcfeely wisely prevent the heroes from quickly accepting one choice over the other allowing this moral dilemma to play out in tense drama and gripping action between the avengers as they fight for their beliefs drawn into this battle for the soul of the avengers team are black widow scarlett johansson rhodeswar machine don cheadle the enigmatic vision paul bettany and sam wilsonfalcon anthony mackie all adding their characters specific viewpoints to this difficult choice adding more depth and complexity to the story    just as wisely markus and mcfeely remember to inject moments of marvel brand humor into the mix with a brilliant tiein from antman including a hilarious applauseinducing effort by scott lang paul rudd in his updated supersuit as youve seen from the trailer peter parker returns to the disneyled marvel franchise in the form of tom holland playing a youngyetestablished spiderman eager to join the avengers just as theyre falling apart thank simon and kirby the writers ignored spideys overtold origin story streamlining both his development as a disneymcu character and hero that has parkers alterego ready for new and hopefully improved adventures ahead while a supporting character in the context of civil war this might be spidermans best feature film incarnation to date with due respect to sam raimis original launch in 2002    yet civil wars ultimate triumph may be its cinematic introduction of black panther deftly and powerfully played by chadwick boseman as tchalla the future king of wakanda this african nation is mcus source of vibranium of which caps invulnerable shield was originally made by howard stark both wakanda and tchallas father king tchaka john kani play an important role in the sokovia accords agreement and its political aftermath which incites the emergence of black panther onto the superhero scene spoilers avoided black panther and tchalla are well realized in civil war and fully primed to make their solo feature film debut in 2018    on that subject theres still no ignoring the disappointment that a female marvel hero wont make her solo film launch until captain marvel in 2019 once again black widow takes another one for the avengers team in the mcu despite recent entries including civil war that repeatedly tap her leadership skills and character at least captain marvel will add some much needed female perspective and participation to the marvel film pantheon when she finally arrives even if such starring presence is long overdue    captain america civil war exists spectacularly in the dramatic moment as much as it cleverly looks forward to extending the story and box office success of the mcu whereas most action films barely accomplish the first feat far more focused and disciplined than the excessive age of ultron while sacrificing none of that sequels epic global scale the russo brothers deliver fierce battles and teethgritting drama evenly and artfully lean and mean but not without some organic laughs that befit the films tone captain america civil war fulfills marvels ongoing contract to deliver top notch superhero entertainment worth the price and effort of seeing it in a theater upon release if doctor strange is as smartly conceived and wellcrafted when it mesmerizes audiences this november 2016 will be a highly memorable and profitable year from marvel and disney    filmedge rates captain america civil war 45 stars out of 5
May 4 2016,positive,this movie is a difficult movie to rate at no point during the movie was i ever in an outrage but i went in open minded i knew this would not be the same plot as the legendary comic book series however i couldnt help but think how amazing it could have been further down the line
May 4 2016,positive,airport scene alone gives it a 4 star from me otherwise itd be a 3 star
May 4 2016,positive,captain america civil war makes a great effort in trying to make a lifechanging experience for the marvel cinematic universe making another more serious entry but doesnt lack the fun from their formula
May 4 2016,positive,i never liked the films of the captain america ive only been to see them once normally i see movies i like 3 or 4 times especially because i never really liked bucky barnes he is too boring why he is not dead yet marvel kill great characters like harry osborn raymi or pietro age of ultrom why  i think is time that bucky die too many movies with this dude here seriously  anyway i only went to see this movie because iron man hes so perfect and great really i never thought i would love an superhero like him so much but the actor fascinated me from the first movie with their confidence and overwhelming security since then i never miss iron man films so relatively broke my heart watching him suffer for his parents and all this seriously just bucky deserves to die kill bucky    spiderman on the other hand he was so perfect thank god anyone have idea how much i detest the movie amazing spider man this guyi does not even remember his name but tom holland here he did incredible and i have faith on a restart with him he is awesome and conveys very well the funny point of his script was one of the highlights of the movie everyone was cool with their movements and laughed when he spoke really impressive the same with black panter  dont know how he does whether it will be the actor or the director of cameras but seeing him actually makes you feel that you are in front of a king very good and the ant guy is too great xd i went to see his movie 3 times its just that i had never read his comics so i cant remember his name anyway his girlfriend is a female character whose personality seems much stronger and more serious than the black widow  is a remarkable woman    vision has great charisma and yes  i was very close to hate wanda so  vision is perfect never change a vision vision is the best lol  anyway why  captain america kiss a random girl it was necessary without that kiss i would have given 5 stars to the movie but as always dont know why everybody think that we like to see romance in a movie of super heroes but fool yourselves the new generation really hate the romance in the superhero movies that takes away all the seriousness of this someone saw batman vs superman  well many of my friends only gave it 3 stars and some didnt like at all just because superboy was  the entire film fooling around this girl  lane  lol  anyway civil war was a very good movie  if we remove this and that random girl spiderman was greattony was great vision was great  but bucky deserves to die seriously just kill buckyl xdd    and as for the romance the antguy  he is right with his girlfriend they are the only couple so far of the entire marvel universe that i really liked was horrible to see the whole mess with xmen old movies and wolverine i didnt know that xmen was a novel until i saw them fortunately brian singer did a good job with first class dof and hopefully it stays well in apocalypse    so really no more romance for the superheroes movies please at least they will a super badass couple like in the antman
May 4 2016,positive,awesome captain badass
May 4 2016,neutral,well the action sequences are fantastic other than that its an average movie with a predictable plot
May 4 2016,positive,this is the best superhero film since the dark knight now im just laughing my ass off at all the people who thought tom holland as spiderman was a bad casting choice black panther was a very pleasant surprise
May 4 2016,positive,captain america civil war possesses some genuinely emotional moments the conflict between cap and iron man is compelling and engrossing and seeing the former friends come to brutal blows makes for exciting dramatic cinema yet theres a hollowness at work here thats hard to shake sure rogers and stark are beating the crap out of each other but we know it cant and wont really last after all there are more avengers sequels to come  how long can these guys really stay mad at each other there are no real stakes here and this is a problem that is prevalent through all the mcu output had captain america civil war focused more on the character conflicts  delved further into steve rogers stubborn commitment to his beliefs and spent less time on zemo and his dumb bad guy scheme this might have ended up being the best marvel film to date instead it falls somewhere in the middle its entertaining but so what captain america civil war shouldve changed the very fabric of the mcu instead its just more of the same this is a cinematic universe long overdue for a new direction    captain america civil war possesses some genuinely emotional moments the conflict between cap and iron man is compelling and engrossing and seeing the former friends come to brutal blows makes for exciting dramatic cinema yet theres a hollowness at work here thats hard to shake sure rogers and stark are beating the crap out of each other but we know it cant and wont really last after all there are more avengers sequels to come  how long can these guys really stay mad at each other there are no real stakes here and this is a problem that is prevalent through all the mcu output had captain america civil war focused more on the character conflicts  delved further into steve rogers stubborn commitment to his beliefs and spent less time on zemo and his dumb bad guy scheme this might have ended up being the best marvel film to date instead it falls somewhere in the middle its entertaining but so what captain america civil war shouldve changed the very fabric of the mcu instead its just more of the same this is a cinematic universe long overdue for a new direction    
May 4 2016,positive,unbelievable i dont know how they pulled it off but they did fantastic movie and bring on the black panther solo films
May 4 2016,positive,spiderman was a bit much cgi wasnt great but i liked the shifting tensions
May 4 2016,negative,who doesnt like to see their favorite superheroes on the big screen unfortunately marvel has many fans so they can put out an average movie and have the fanboys in a delirium this is what has happened with civil wars a below average avengers movie receiving rave reviews from the fanboys in the media and the general public for you folks that just enjoy a good flick forget it this one is bad and boring   snooze feat i think i have avengers overload check out another movie this is junk
May 4 2016,negative,i was very disappointed in this film too many plot holes terrible villain i am a fan of all comics but honestly enjoyed bvs much more the heroes faced real consequences and death was a way better film this movie is slightly better than age of ultron maybe they should quite while ahead
May 4 2016,positive,one of the best movies of marvel cinematic universe great developing of the history amazing adaptation of the comic book great ending good way to present new characters simply perfect
May 4 2016,positive,amazing although the title is misleading they shouldve just made it another avengers amazing though really solid and extremely funny how could it not be with paul rudd as antman kids and adults alike would love it i would recommend this movie for all ages
May 4 2016,positive,thoroughly enjoyable blockbuster superhero fest with a stellar cast and some good one liners an intriguing and welcome twist on the relationships between the avengers probably 20 minutes too long but what film isnt these days
May 4 2016,positive,smoothly paced smartly written and filled with exciting set pieces captain america civil war proves to be one of marvels best films to date and foreshadows an exciting future for the mcu
May 4 2016,positive,the film was good enjoyable a couple of really great scenes however sometimes it felt like we were just waiting for the next big sequence while a mediocre plot and dialogue unfolded despite all the heroes it never felt crowded it met my expectations and entertained not sure how good this would be on repeat viewings though as lots of the excitement came from seeing the characters for the first time will probably see again but not at the cinema
May 4 2016,positive,civil war remains a captain america movie continuing right where winter soldier left off but it wouldnt be an exaggeration to call it avengers 25 just like joss whedon the russo brothers manage to cram into one movie a huge ensemble of characters and give each and every one of them a place under the spotlight its remarkable how a cast of a dozen main characters each of whom could and half of them do carry their own movie work so well within a coherent story and have their own distinct personalities shine through civil war takes its time to establish their motivations making us care for them and adding drama to the action     and the action oh the action the airport scene is possibly the best superhero fight ever played on screen but thats not the only one the movie is full of incredibly visceral action scenes with physical close combat crazy combo moves and incredible stunts the action is balanced brilliantly with periods of exposition and moments of humour so the two and a half hours go very fast civil war was so good i wish it were longer
May 4 2016,positive,the thing i admire most about the directors of this movie is how they juggle an ensemble of classy actors most of whom are used to playing th main role in their individual movies to give each one enough space to give each one an important role and to do this without neither one seeming surplus to the films requirements is an achievement worthy of high praise this movie has this as well as an ideal mixture of action humor and tears none of it feels forced or cheapened by repetition of what has worked in previous movies the only fear i have is that marvel has reached its summit for it is very hard for me to imagine another movie reaching this ones height
May 4 2016,positive,spiderman was annoying with a creepy tobey maguire vibe going ondecent movie but not great
May 4 2016,positive,the movie is incredible
May 4 2016,positive,easily the best mcu movie to date
May 4 2016,positive,if your a fan its worth the view i put it slightly better then age of ultra just based on watch the heros fight each other in a great scene not much plot or justification for the characters motivations vision acts like a mindless tool with no opinion tony wouldnt be so bad if every other depiction of him in the mcu showed no remorse until now only charecter that made complete sence was black panther and di dthey really just do a 5 minute spider man origin story
May 4 2016,positive,finally a avengers movie that does not suck
May 4 2016,positive,this movie delivers everything a marvel fan and action person alike its a masterpiece   a must see definitely a step up from age of ultron all star cast
May 4 2016,positive,great action like ridiculously awesome action but the story is plain and is forced into and repetitive i tried to care about the winter soldier i dont anymore even cap seems to feel like he is over it in this movie and in the end this felt like a filler movie until the infinity war but the direction was good and the action was above average for a marvel movie but it was over dramatic and got bored at the end of the movie     anyone else feel like this movie was just here to appease fans yeah but it was still forced into my mouth like i was suppose to be amazing and all the shipped loved it but not me i thought it was good not great i want a story i can get behind
May 4 2016,negative,not good at all  i saw the movie and it was so boring and awful expect spiderman he was aweasome
May 4 2016,positive,great movie loads of fun
May 4 2016,positive,similar themes to batman v superman but far better execution
May 4 2016,positive,typical marvel movie keeps you entertained with action but the story holds it together and avoids being overly cheesy
May 4 2016,negative,cool action scenesbut i hoped to see a better main villian
May 4 2016,positive,i can review captain america civil war in three words fun funfun do the five pspark pee popcorn soda pop and park yourself in your seat for two hours and 26 minutes of movie enjoyment all of your superheros are back but not all on the same side what youll have to see for yourself this is a blockbuster i predict an opening weekend of well over 200 million bucks
May 4 2016,positive,in the top 3 best marvel movies to date absolutely amazing definitely emotional seeing friends fight each other but hey if you cant beat them join themor say fck it and do your own thing teamcaptainamerica
May 4 2016,negative,civil war isnt marvelousvery disappointed my next hope suicide squad
May 4 2016,positive,not only is this a great sequel to the winter soldier and age of ultron but as a captain america trilogy for me it goes up there as one of the best film trilogies the films got better and better somehow they weave together so much without having it seem over stuffed
May 4 2016,negative,villian does as luthor but no charisma then they force spiderman in very badly and then they add spidey as a weaker superhero than cap and weak in general also removing his spider sense complete lack of respect to a character that should have kicked caps ass or almost all of the others like winter s hawkeye antman spiderman has super strength relative to his spider and an incredible spidersense that makes him almost invincible wether he has 17 or 13 years old some of the same issues as bvs like too much stuffed not enough charm and ultimately does not impress the way people expected just like bvs but the worst was spiderman hes the best number one hero of marvel and they just made him a b hero bull
May 4 2016,positive,captain america civil war is amazing it was a very strong movie yes i know that people are saying zemo was a waste of a great actor but i loved zemo in this movie oh ye spiderman amazing in my opinion the best on screen spider of all time from just the 20 min i saw of him giantman was awesome thats why in my opinion its the best marvel movie today
May 4 2016,positive,you can find a collection of movie  tv series is updated with the best quality you can watch and download below  
May 4 2016,positive,captain america civil war  rating 45  the film opens with and delightfully continues throughout to flaunt some of the most dazzling if not dizzyinglygood fight scenes of recent superhero movies from the black widows precision acrobatics in the opening scene to the earthmoving brawn versus metal clashes between captain america and iron man this movie was chockfull of action excitement shiny metal and a bit of irrational emotion which all combined is marvelous     as expected the top crowdpleaser was the reveal of peter parkerspiderman rousing hearty applause throughout the theater tom holland is very promising  hes youthful talkative brainy and funloving  exactly what a young spidey should be almost equally thrilling was the inclusion of ant man and who doesnt love paul rudd these choices including the introduction of the black panther while somewhat of an excessive and shameless prelude to future films presented a smorgasbord to satisfy any superhero fans appetite alongside good but unsurprising scripting and a perfect balance of violence emotional tension and worthwhile laughoutloud humor making it far supersede its predecessor the infantile age of ultron     the movie is centered on the conflict which arises when the avengers are forced to address the ethics of vigilantism and their role in the loss of innocent lives while trying to save others which the king of wakanda pointed out is no heroism at all it is rare to have this issue brought up in the comic universe but while other fans may disagree i found the subtle intersection between the real world and the comic book world to be smart especially in these actual times and the changing perspectives of audiences who are more sensitive to such topics     the division among the avengers pertaining to the signing of the sokovia accords giving the un control over their work sparks a whole lot of brilliant unbridled violence which all seems pretty senseless in the end since the cap and iron man manage to make it clear that they are still buds and proves that the avengers are simply incapable of having nonviolent discourse even among themselves without delving into the matter too much i also want to side note the ironies of captain america an officer of the us army is opposed to being regulated by a governing body whereas tony stark a weaponsmanufacturing entrepreneur is suddenly onboard the idea of being regulated after spending most his life trying to keep his technologies out of the hands of government no biggie its just kind of funny    captain america civil war is not a carouselride of a movie its a high speed doublelooping rollercoaster meaning its a busy movie but not so much so that the viewer cannot be perfectly engaged follow the story and have a rockin good time this starkly compares to rival dcs longwinded batman vs superman dawn of justice bringing comic books to life on screen is a difficult task and ca cw makes a perfect effort to do so
May 4 2016,positive,saw it tonight and have to say it was very enjoyable  i will be seeing it again
May 4 2016,positive,amazing action good story and a all around super cool movie      this version of the civil war story aka captain america vs iron man deals more with the winter soldier than with the registration of all heroes captain america and his team try to stop crossbones in wakanda black panthers stomping ground and end up killing bystanders the government no longer want them to act unauthorized and with shield not in the picture they have no official status anymore general ross has ordered all members of the avengers to sign an accord to let the government decide on when the avengers should operate meanwhile the winter soldier is being held captive by an evil organization and has had his programming reactivated to assassinate steve tries to catch bucky on his own with his team but end up crossing hairs with the black panther and the government by not signing the accords and acting alone      they may have changed the civil war story up a bit but the story they used worked very well the real civil war story has soooo many players involved making to where the task of putting a movie like that in place would be almost impossible without several installments being at least 3 hours long also with the movie rights issues it took an unnecessary long time to get spiderman to finally play along with the avengers where he belongs this rights problem also includes the fantastic four xmen and quite a few others that we can only hope to see back with marvel for proper teamups    the action was top notch and superbly done the hits were hard hitting and unlike the dc vs movie that came before it the action is clear to see without alot of darkness and shadows to cover up blurry cgi the martial arts was on point and the suspense had you on the edge of your seat that being said it was soooo good to see black panther in the marvel movies finally black panther was snapping and was no joke as he should be chadwick boseman did him justice elizabeth olsen surprised me a bit with her portrayal of wanda in this because she was really good and better than she was in ultron you found yourself rooting for her a bit they did a good job showing how powerful she is and how sometimes her powers can be hard to control as well the story was easy to follow and well thoughtout to setup for the next installments for my boy black panther and the new spidey i really like the new younger teenage spidey tom holland nails the young inexperienced spiderman as he joins tonys side to fight these veteran super powered heroes the suit is very different from what we have seen but it is pretty cool i will admit he did look like a big cgi character the whole time but still everything still fit together and he held his own beautifully every character had a purpose as well you would think with all these players involved someone would be there just to have fans say cool look theres so and so but everyone had their place and had cool stuff to show off black widow did the most fighting in this than all the movies she has been in combined she was fierce chris evans as always was on point as captain america his fight scenes always get better and this was the best yet there was so much to like about this movie you have to wonder how in the world is dc going to truly get their momentum with the new dc universe they have started to give us continuity and films that are not so split when it comes to fans and general public enjoying them they are hoping to change the flow a bit with suicide squad and i wish them all the best but as we all know they have a lot of catching up to do especially with the installment of batman v superman leaving a lot of questions more than answers that you hope is explained sooner than later something really needs to give not only were the scenes visually stunning but they took enough care to give you some classic iconic scenes or images from the pages of the comic book well done      once again i say this is a great movie winter soldier was the best marvel movie we have had so far this one is even betterâ     definitely worth watching more than once or twice    highly enjoyable for the whole family
May 4 2016,positive,another clean wellexecuted installment spiderman and antman are the standouts here while bucky continues to be kind of plain bagel couldnt help but feel it was missing another dimension to it after the film acknowledges the similar destructions in every marvel movies climax this one isnt wholly different
May 4 2016,positive,thats just good  the plot is amazing   the twist twisted me  spider man in mcu   everything is great
May 4 2016,positive,i think the idea of the film was really good and overall was a very good film although i thought the film began and ended in the same position it would have also been a treat to get a few more characters in it
May 4 2016,positive,this is the best comicsmovie ever i saw civil war four times and want to see yet again
May 4 2016,positive,i im taking a guess right now have not seen yet
May 4 2016,positive,way too chatty half an hour too much frivolous and jerky fight scenes as usual anticlimax on top of anticlimax childish script addition of spiderkid and ant man dont help getting way too tired of the avengers films they should call it quits
May 4 2016,positive,awesomely superbly fantastically amazing
May 4 2016,positive,great movie i loved it
May 4 2016,positive,second best mcu movie ever made
May 4 2016,positive,i dont usually see movies about superheroes but this one got my attention
May 4 2016,positive,this episode of captain america is probably the best one so far  but that doesnt mean its a great movie  it isnt civil war has a better story than previously but is too long the acting was pretty average but thats all you need when youve got topnotch special effects and dramatic fun action sequences theres not as much humour in this one so it is a bit darker and more serious than previous episodes the problem is that it gets a bit preachy at times when it tackles some issues in an overlyobvious way when there is action it is frequently too frenetic and jumpy 3d quality is pretty good while this is not a great movie it is entertaining enough
May 4 2016,positive,this is the best marvel movie ever so many action and superheroes very very good  loved it this movie should get 100 rating
May 4 2016,positive,captain america civil war is flooded with charismatic actorsactresses supporting a renegade story that comes dangerously close to submerging everything else but the russo brothers keep it all afloat with terrific humour action and perfect sync between its many characters making mcus 13th film satisfyingly fresh and predictably entertaining on all levels
May 4 2016,negative,so boring i couldnt keep my eyes open nothing clever or imaginative about this movie and what was with the wussy portrayal of spiderman overrated to the max
May 4 2016,positive,this movie is awesome id say its even better than the first avengers
May 4 2016,positive,civil war is no doubt one of the best marvel movie ever to date
May 4 2016,positive,i dont like the movie i love the movie  it was a really interesting story script
May 4 2016,positive,amazingly marvel has found a way to outdo themselves yet again civil war has just the right mix of action drama comedy and comic lore to keep audiences entertained and eagerly awaiting the next installment i have seen all of the marvel movies and i would highly suggest that viewers watch the previous mcu outings before diving into this delicious dish of cinematic excellence civil wars storyline fits right in sync with the rest of the continuity civil war combines elements of avengers the winter solder and iron man 1 it also manages to up the ante by adding fan favorites to the growing roster of avengers black panther and the mcus version of spiderman are really going to please fans of the comics spiderman was perfect and black panther was equally impressive im definitely looking forward to seeing their solo outings     now i have to say this because i know a lot people are going to try to compare this to batman v superman and i would highly suggest that you dont bvs and civil war are vastly different and i enjoyed them both for that reason if you must compare bvs to another on screen superhero clash i would recommend that you compare it to the first half of daredevil season 2    see full review with spoilers here 
May 4 2016,positive,everything a superhero movie should be action packed thought provoking emotional and most of all fun
May 4 2016,negative,story was very poor nut the action parts of the movie were the best action parts in mcu i wanted to enjoy the movie but i just couldnt
May 4 2016,positive,a movie that has the ultimate superhero brawl or fight in history the movie itself is fun to watch and might be for some the best movie of the year
May 4 2016,positive,good movie but i kind of expected more in a way
May 4 2016,positive,captain america civil war is bold innovative and altogether refreshing impressively switching between characterdriven dialogue development alltothewall action scenes and a depth to a war and conflict that others could only dream of looking at you batman vs superman civil war is impressive because of what is at stake and what we know lies ahead it wins by building to this point thirteen episodes into its universe run and offering more for the audience to invest themselves in  there is no winners or losers or good people or bad people as such just individuals with different approaches opinions and emotions and civil war wins by accepting each of these and exploring them in thoughtprovoking and progressive ways i genuinely do not know where this avengers unit is going next and as long as marvel do not hit the reset and send everything back to being peachy keen they will have myself and many others beside them for the journey    full review     make sure you let me know what you thought of the film and share your opinions in the comment section
May 4 2016,positive,aka avengers 2  12 while calling this captain america is a bit of a cheat as it involves almost everyone from the avengers series and carries on directly dealing with the consequences from the resolution in the last avengers movie it is the style of writing and directing that put it in the same vein as the capt america strands of films more hand to hand combat less cgi explosive annihilations and the focus is more on relationships and emotional interactions between the characters  and all the better for it if the winter soldier is a 70s conspiracy film this one belongs to the someones been framed and need to prove his innocence genre the script keeps it simple and wisely do not see the need to shoehorn a new villain into the already bloated cast list there is still the problem of finding a dramatic arc no matter how small for everyone  though they manage it just about without messing up either the main narrative or stopping the movie dead on its tracks the introduction of even more characters from the mcu for future franchises is less sledgehammerlike and in fact helps elevate the darkness and solemnity the old avengers found themselves in and that lightness and joy are the key and major difference between this film and another recent superhero mashup it also makes some of the narrative contrivances bearable for this is by no means a perfect film but given both the disappointment and downright hostility the audience had for recent films from both dc and marvel anything vaguely resembling a half decently made and thought out film that is actually enjoyable and fun to spend 25 hrs with feels like a breeze of much needed fresh air blowing away the cobwebs left behind by both bats and ultrons alike
May 4 2016,positive,good fun things blow up some scenes are repeated a little too often in case you didnt get it the first time which is nice because you could literally watch this while unconscious and enjoy it slightly too long but just remember not to have to large drink and that should not dampen your enjoyment the only thing that detracted from my enjoyment at all was the blatant propaganda and the often clumsy product placement but then this is captain america propaganda is the point i suppose    critics say it explores thought provoking themes if putting your socks on in the morning is a mental challenge then this will be a thought provoking film for you enjoy    for me one of the most thought provoking parts was the airport that had exclusively airbus a340s in it theyre not even that common i like them though
May 4 2016,positive,its awesome of marvel cinematic universe of all time and this now 
May 4 2016,positive,the best movie in the mcu
May 4 2016,positive,most amazing film i have ever seen stunts actors story emotion everything was absolutely on point well done to all
May 4 2016,positive,captain america civil war knocked me off my feet just when i thought that it would be difficult for marvel to outperform itself i was pleasantly shocked not only is this the best in the captain america series i dare say this is the best of the avengersmarvel universe the screenplay directing and of course the casting takes another notch in distinction theres nothing more thought provoking than a powerful story of redemption friendship honour nobility and justice especially when principles collide the quiet runup fuels the final act which will blow you away saying more would only lead to spoilers a must watch
May 3 2016,positive,its a good movie where all the elements are in the right place tonys emotion in the final fight is mind blowing  the only thing i hated is all the action is already on the trailers teasers and tv spots so no biggie i guess but its a must watch movie
May 3 2016,positive,serious subject matter with perfect amount of humor to balance  if they would have just called this avengers 3 then it would have been the best avengers movie by a mile  they incorporated new characters without feeling like overload in ultron  they finally got spiderman right
May 3 2016,positive,this is what age of ultron should have been the russo brothers demonstrate again they are the premier marvel guys gunn has to show he can duplicate his success with their ability to juggle action large cast humour and all the other staples of a marvel film they extend their amazing fight choreography of captain america to the whole avengers team making everyone look good  even falcon they also just manage to keep it a film centred on captain america although stark comes in close second and arguably goes through more development the majoir downside is some ridiculous plotting and this years superhero obsession with not talking in this one they do but not about the obvious things that prevent a fight we have to accept that both captain america and especially stark are just being stubborn illogical douches for the feud to continue zemo could have been an interesting villain expertly played by danile bruhl if it werent for the fact that his moustache twirling plan makes no sense and relies entirely on coincidence to pan out fortunately the black panthers debut works far better and makes more sense bringing something different to superheros spidermans debut is fun but his entire presence feels tacked on probably because he was added to the film late in development he works well in a crowd and comes off genuinely young however they need to work on making him not seem like a cartoon in costume  i often felt like he was entirely cgi antman is surprisingly strong as a team player and gets some of the best action scenes all in all its the best marvel film since guardians of the galaxy and hopefully they have things back on track since age of ultron
May 3 2016,positive,very good movie spiderman peter parker is spot on and how he is introduced is even better than i thought it was going to be
May 3 2016,positive,aside from traditional fight between good and evil the modern superhero genre has been dominated by three major themes the struggle against inner selfto find true self nolans batman trilogy singers xmen antihero antagonists spiderman 2 and the philosophical question quis custodiet ipsos custodes  who will guard the guards themselves watchmen it seems that civil war tried very hard in all three aspects with not much results except for some entertaining fighting sequences and a confusing climax it really was a pity that the surprisingly deep theme of who watches the watchmen at the beginning of the film was gradually replaced with the everboring story of a pseudo struggle against ones self of the superheroes with a marvelish ending that shows the scripts lack of depth or the laziness of the writers or the disregard of the audiences intelligence or a combination of all three moreover despite its epic name civil war the film did not feel epic at all with the fight between twelve superheroes appeared to be lopsided poorly coordinated and confusingly edited the filming and editing were so confusing that civil war reminded me of the infamous fighting sequences in the transformers series where no one can understand what the hell is happening of course civil war had sequences that were very well choreographed and executed but they mostly involved a small group of characters and thus felt pretty disconnected from the bigger picture of the civil war in this respect civil war is even less impressive than the much more criticized batman vs superman where the feeling of epicness terribilità prevailed despite the poor control of the storylinethe disconnection was also apparent in the timeslot reserved for each character with iron man and captain america had so many more emotional and memorable sequences and lines that the rest of the cast seemed to just line up in the far corner of the storyline in the size of an ant man and yet if one tries to stitch those emotional moments together one will see that there is no connection between them either thus by the end the film with so many memorable scenes seemed to be so unmemorable or at least it had the audience try to remember only to miserably fail to do so  try to remember is a key song in the film all in all an entertaining yet forgettable film  a new pinnacle of the mcmarvel model spidermans muchanticipated appearance did not help either since he was as annoying as his counterpart antman was despite lengthy onscreen time
May 3 2016,positive,this is good i enjoy most of it
May 3 2016,positive,despite being a giant cosplay fight really enjoyable  better than ultron but not as good as winter solider
May 3 2016,negative,saw the movie its way over hyped infact i dont understand why every one is praising it so much air port scene is ok its good but not like u have not seen this before few say that its the best action scene they should see some action movies its no where as good as they say but yes a nice movie
May 3 2016,positive,the best movie on the mcu captain america civil war has a lot of heart and humour but its not without its darker moments and more serious themes the movie for me is as good as the dark knight and the dark knight rises
May 3 2016,positive,a really great movie that at the same time is a sequel to captain america the winter soldier and a continuation the the mcu we see more of cap and tony spiderman is great and i am waiting to see his stand alone movie black panther is wise and really great the characters are so well fleshed out in conclution this movie is a blast amazing
May 3 2016,positive,best marvel movie to date i was blown away by the plot twists and action sequences the russo brothers came through again
May 3 2016,positive,spider man saved the show
May 3 2016,positive,fun  thought provoking
May 3 2016,negative,comic book nerds are raving about this movie its nothing to rave about a big zero watch something else
May 3 2016,positive,spiderman was perfect      spoilers            giantman was perfect  great opening conflict  black panther was perfect
May 3 2016,negative,sucked enough said
May 3 2016,positive,if your a comic book of super hero fan go see this movie
May 3 2016,positive,war baby whoop whoop
May 3 2016,negative,the movie is extremely boring from the beginning to the middle add that to the stupid jokes all the time in the airport battle and we have another overrated marvel movie
May 3 2016,positive,definitely a bridge and jump movie it bridges the avengers and jumps to the next phase of marvel offerings however the captain is interesting enough to also hold his own other characters are introduced yet its mr rogers and mr stark who are the most fleshed out excellent storyline complete with trademark humour deliver an experience that feels shorter than its running time the marvel universe never ceases to amaze in both obvious and subtle detail if youve enjoyed this series of movies this is a must see for die hard comic book fans im unsure whether it will satisfy was it truly a civil war
May 3 2016,positive,civil war is everything batman vs superman wanted to be civil war is about as serious at times but more fun dc fans act like marvel is just about the one liners not when anthony russo and joe russo are involved   they tried to do a lot and accomplished a lot snyder tried to do a lot at once but made an uneven film with too many unnecessary dream sequences   the russos are much better at giving nerdgasms lol especially with the amazing antman and spiderman scenes wow snyder can just randomly throw in stuff from the comics that didnt even work in one movie but the russos are better at making everything they throw together work
May 3 2016,positive,amazing action very well balanced great comedy most is explained so dont worry you need to watch age of ultron and winter soldier in order to understand the main story and characters it is very entertaining and fun to watch this movie will make you speechless after you see it and it really does feel like a captain america movie
May 3 2016,positive,best supehero movie ever
May 3 2016,negative,if you listen to the critics youre in for a big disappointment high expectations will have you crashing believe me i know
May 3 2016,positive,its hard to believe these movies keep getting better
May 3 2016,positive,following up after winter soldier was never gonna be an easy film i felt that winter soldier was one marvels best movies ever falling short of avengers this movie does provide quite a bit of reality to it who keeps tabs on the avengers the story was well written and although the movie is a bit long knowing marvel the way we do now we know there are ramifications to the actions they take that affect the entire marvel universe there were many high points in this film with of course the being the end of the 2nd act another key factor in this movie is the trailers didnt give away the movie i gave this film 355 stars because it is another really good marvel film but isnt quite as good as the winter soldier i would have given it something a little closer to a 4 star movie if the option was available the introduction to some new heroes was great and for the first time there are questions left to be answered i would definitely recommend this movie if you havent seen it
May 3 2016,positive,awesome movie the russo brothers outdid themselves once again
May 3 2016,positive,captain america civil war is an outstanding marvel movie with a great narrative humour fabulous characters and spectacular action sequences    rating 91
May 3 2016,positive,250 pure awesome with amazing acting and incredible shades of gray    though it could have been called captain americairon man civil war    probably a bit too similar to superman vs batman though for naming conventions
May 3 2016,positive,great movie its nice when a company knows how to bring multiple char together in a cohesive movie also thank you marvel for giving us true fans a epic to wash that liver flavored dibacle bvss
May 3 2016,positive,so its ok  given the hype probably expected more  felt a little bit crowded and a pity some of the heroes had little other than cameos  captain america  steve rogers came across as very annoying and a bit of a dick  not sure about tom holland
May 3 2016,positive,o k this went on a bit but that seems par for the course these days loads of references to other parts of the overall story which i realise im not remembering but full of great stuff 
May 3 2016,positive,marvel have again created a fun kinetic and smart addition to its world of mega heroes the central fight is the most creative yet in the captainavenger series with antman stealing the show however the marvel universe has still yet to create that real sense of stake or invested empathy which ultimately leaves you less engaged in the pivotal scenes or the key players involved
May 3 2016,positive,a cracking good film tho was more of an avengers film than a captain america film had just the right blend of humour drama and action loved the new members antman fit right in as did spiderman tom holland was great and the black panther was a very cool new supe addition cant help feeling tho that if theyd just sat down at the beginning and discussed it they could have just frozen bucky straight away and saved a lot of trouble thought robert downey jnr was class in this and his emotions were very believable i was team ironman before the film and im still team ironman
May 3 2016,positive,an absolute joy to watch from beginning to end the climatic fight between iron man and captain america left me in awe
May 3 2016,positive,absolutely awesome movie the best super hero ever made
May 3 2016,positive,awesomeness  black panther was my favorite
May 3 2016,positive,very worth the time entertaining solid more than acceptable of course the movie have certain downside but not anything too damaging the the movie cant recover from
May 3 2016,positive,a righteous  worthy sequel to winter soldier best motorcycle stunt ive seen in years
May 3 2016,positive,all i can say totally awesome  although at 21749 some parts were a little slow although necessary to build the story  a very complex story that pits pretty much everyone in the avenger universe against one another  fight scenes are awesome  marvel did it right and definitely built upon the whole superhero movie genre
May 3 2016,positive,this movie is 300 times better than batman v superman which i dont recommend i also think this is the best marvel movie ever made
May 3 2016,negative,biggest load of crap going annoyed as wasted my money and time the layout is to complicated and just a jumble of overrated crap
May 3 2016,positive,good action like you would expect
May 3 2016,negative,weak ass villian like always
May 3 2016,positive,best movie in the mcu
May 3 2016,positive,best superhero movie ever
May 3 2016,positive,captain america is a fun actionpacked superhero movie with a solid plot and interesting new characters as well as old revisited characters
May 3 2016,positive,take the best parts of captain america and combine it with the best parts of avengers with a few new additions like the best spiderman to dateu get an awesome enjoyable near nonstop action movie the third installment of captain americaawesome itro to spiderman and black pantherspiderman  antman were perfectly funnyall in all an amazing movie
May 3 2016,positive,only thing i did not like was spiderman
May 3 2016,positive,the empire strikes back of the marvel universe
May 3 2016,positive,great to see all the characters interact and fight each other the introduction to some additional avengers felt a little forced and random spidermans intro was fun and great fan service but the boy was forced into a war with the adults
May 3 2016,positive,there was just about enough interest in the storyline here to make the action more than just a slug fest however there was a big irony in that whilst they disagreed about the need for accountability they all agreed about the need to reduce the collateral damage they then proceeded to wreck an airport fighting each other though i suppose it was strangely deserted so noone was hurt
May 3 2016,positive,is better than the avengers this third captain america movie is a highly entertain movie the battle of team captain america  team iron man is exciting only the plot is slightly unconvincing to prevent spoiling your viewing pleasure i will not said much about this overall is the best captain americas movie
May 3 2016,positive,very well done screen play was superb and story line rocked
May 3 2016,positive,civil war is one of the best marvel movies ever it was worth our wait it has a lot of humor in it and its filled with great and exciting action finally we saw a spider man that weve been waiting for since tobey maguire
May 3 2016,neutral,there isnt words for express my deception of this movie ridiculous villians zemo and the war never saw a real confrontation in the film spidernan was forced to appear in the movie in a kind of hi and bye in general terms the movie is good but didnt fill my expectatives
May 3 2016,positive,by far the best cap america in the series  zack snyder this what your movies are missing
May 3 2016,positive,fun movie that really brings a mature debate to the table
May 3 2016,positive,im probably one of the few that enjoyed the winter soldier more but its only cos it played with genre also it felt more like an avengers movie than a captain america one anyway this is entertaining and very busy maybe a bit too much but every character gets hisher chance to shine and you cant really ask for much more the new spiderman is so adorbs youll want to pinch his cheeks
May 3 2016,positive,i have seen this movie and to date other than the dark knight it is probably the best comic book movie made thus far
May 3 2016,positive,wonderful movie with so many complex moving parts which seem to come together perfectly plot is well thought out and deserves credit by investing you into the characters of bucky and also zemo felt daniel bruhl was very good and is not your standard villain for me antman was the stand out player in the airport battle and those who have seen the film will know why he is huge spidey is excellent combining humour with young cockiness and the relationship between vision and scarlet witch is intriguing the reason i havent given this film a five is because i felt the black panther was a little loose in terms of explaining his motives hes a king and should be above vengeance and revenge  all in all one the best marvel films to date
May 3 2016,positive,the movie is funny  manly atman and spiderman
May 3 2016,positive,civil war to me is probably marvels best movie so far i think it took its time building the confilct i never felt the movie rushed into action just for the sake of having explosions and fights which are awesome instead it built the momentumn slowly but with strong foundations every character in the film feels like theyre supposed to be there unlike again imo wonder woman or lois lane in bvs the fights are awesome so well done theres cgi whre it is needed but i didnt feel like they abused of it tons of practical fx which is refreshing the inclusion of antman is sweet black panther is kickass but above them was spidey finally a good spiderman one that ges well with the one we all know from the comic books granted aunt may is a little too young and too hot but i didnt threw me off but this spidey is great lots of smartass talking in the fight hes a kid and behaves like it they made him so agile and his movement is so much like what youd expect from him i loved it props to tom holland and finally iron man and captain america their conflict is relatable you dont get to feel wether one is wrong and the other isnt they both make their points and the conflict is great i gotta give it up to the russo brothers they nailed it fantastic movie great writing and pacing a must see
May 3 2016,positive,cap has come a long way since his modest start as the first avenger  his second outing the winter soldier was arguably one of the best marvel films to date although i still personally hold the avengers in that spot  now his third solo entry raises the bar yet again and civil war is probably the best marvel film maybeâpossibly  ah forget  all the semantics  itâs just plain awesome  the script acting tone pacing and action are all brilliant and inclusion of new heroes are handled very well  yâknow what  iâm not gonna bother saying anything more  just stop reading this and go see it
May 3 2016,positive,this movie is the equivalent of taking all your action figures and hitting them together for a while take from that what you will
May 3 2016,positive,captain america civil war is on all technical terms a solid well made movie with a great sense of pace to most anyway but is it great as every critic or casual movie goer says well no because of two unfortunate elements one comes from someone whos experienced a war like mentality so it begs the question what kind of war leaves minimum casualties and im not talking about civilians either but supporting characters as well however i will point out theres a psychological impact on characters so thats evens out and secondly which is just as important to me is the fact for a supposed movie about friendship and camaraderie there is not really anything new explored so rather then being invested in the plot is seeing events unfold because its written so in the script sure its not like we learn nothing about the key players but were never shown anything new about their relationship beyond what was established from a few movies before to summarize captain america civil war might have worked better as captain america civil conflict
May 3 2016,positive,captain america civil war  is one of the most famous movie ive ever watched in the movie theater  how nice the russo brothers 
May 3 2016,positive,as a superhero movie goes its not bad but as a movie  its storytelling is just as predictable as but as anything thats supposed to be slightly more complex for the easily impressionable american mind id say bravo
May 3 2016,negative,this movie while filled with style and action moves from action scene to action scene with little reason or thought i wasnt expecting an intelligent movie but i feel marvel has lost a lot of its magic
May 3 2016,positive,this film is everything you want to see in a comicbook movie so many good parts needs to be seen multiple times
May 3 2016,positive,ive watched captain america civil war twice already it was an experience as strong as the first avengers and overall i liked it lots phenomenal acting editing strong dialogues it never feels forced in spite of the massive character list it certainly deserves the hype but it will surely not please as much hardcore captain america the winter soldier fan though    spoilers ahead    the film is half a captain america film and half an avengers one i did want to watch a very down to earth thriller with a serious tone which it has at the beginning and at the end of the film but the middle part with the fighting scene which is awesome by itself is basically an avengers movie just sprinkled there  granted even if it is out of place it doesnt feel like it and it manages to come organically but it does take away the urgency and blurs the main theme of the film just when it needed to remain present the flaws within are what will divide and make all fall if you are not aware of them i think this has led to write off zemo as some stupid villain and i am not saying he was an evil mastermind that was the point he only had to focus the attention of the avengers to the flaws of their team mates but in an effort to build the big fight fanservice scene this plot point was made too complicated and blurry to work properly  i like to call this plot point cramming the game of thrones complex the medium falls short when you have to show so many arcs it makes the momentum of the original arc to evaporate from episode to episode in got when you first gain the momentum from a couple of arcs and in the next episode you dont follow them up and it gets lost because the attention is shifted in to different arcs with different characters both got and civil war do a decent job managing this dont get me wrong but the only way to achieve the level of intensity the winter soldier had you need to focus with captain americas story scenes and transitions can only do so much like a comic book page my analogy is when war machine hits the ground is like when ned stark loses his head in got after that you have pretty much lost the impact from the walkers plot i would rather have a story punch me in the face than pinch me like a mosquito  also like age of ultrons source of intelligence the main narrative makes no sense since the avengers were sanctioned by shield and a panel of international leaders in every event they mentioned except lagos the sokovia pact or whatever is basically what they have been doing most of the time and it was imperative for us to know whats up with furys shield after ultron to better develop the conflict in this film that was a big nono like the amazing spiderman 2s story structure  and even though all the action scenes are superb sometimes the cranklike shaky cam took away from them  i also didnt like tom holland as peter parker and his scene was the lowest point in the movie i did like him as spidey though i still prefer garfield he was just so perfectly ditko
May 3 2016,positive,this is what a super hero movie is all about amazing story telling epic cast with some good humor in the fold
May 3 2016,positive,best movie experiance  for comic book fans as well as a casual movie watchers
May 3 2016,positive,very sketchy plot line that takes you to the end wondering why you waisted so much time coming to that conclusion extremely obvious when scenes have been blended with cgi with a low frame rate and blur black panther gci had no sense of weight to it and was noticeably broader in the chest than the real life actor in costum black widow looked great though
May 3 2016,positive,simply amazing a must see
May 3 2016,negative,this is all sorts of terrible
May 3 2016,positive,probably the best marvel movie to date
May 3 2016,neutral,nothing original in civil war      all the superhero movies are getting very repetitive  first theres batman vs superman which in my opinion was way too long and a snore  now we have civil war      to be fare this is a better movie and bound to do well at the box office it appears that you really have to lay an egg to lose money as these type of movies are very hot right now  hence all the me too movies are coming out at the same time
May 3 2016,positive,best superhero movie that i ever seen
May 3 2016,positive,didnt live up to the hype predictable storyline and at times the movie was slow and boring
May 3 2016,negative,recently i have quite liked the marvel movies that i have watched sadly i did not like this movie at all the only reason that it does not get a zero or one star rating is cool special effects and a few laughs    i want my heroes to be just that heroes unfortunately this movie gets off on the wrong foot right away by not only incriminating the avengers in the eyes of dimwit politicians and putting them on surveillance of a political body but to make matters worse it is the useless black hole of taxpayers money the united nations that are supposed to surveil them that pretty much ruined the movie right away for me    when i though that it could not get any worse it actually does in true hollywood fashion the avengers start to bicker and fight among themselves    the few redeeming qualities of this movie is great special effects and a few fun comments that made me laugh from time to time even the ending is pretty crappy with the avengers remaining divided and the main bad guy feeling that he achieved what he wanted    technically there is not really anything wrong with the movie the actors are good the filming is good and as i wrote the special effects are great the story however is not my cup of tea to put it mildly i cannot express how much i despised the story in this movie
May 3 2016,positive,marvel start to shift from light hearted superhero into more emotionally involved and they succeed
May 3 2016,negative,marvel disney nuff said
May 3 2016,positive,well entertaining enough but didnt like it as the other ones
May 2 2016,positive,well worth the watch  i highly recommend it
May 2 2016,negative,meh flat flat flat there are only two scenes that got me excited thats when ant man and spiderman came out the rest of the scene was kkkkkk
May 2 2016,positive,probably one of the best marvel movie ever spiderman was the best part it makes you anticipate mcus take on spidey overall this movie doesnt even feel like an avengers movie it is a captain america movie
May 2 2016,positive,so cool it has a lot of feelings at once so good with the 3d effect recommendable  
May 2 2016,positive,nonspoiler review for captain america civil war was one of the most well put together films ive ever seen plot was so elaborate action sets incredible spiderman and black panther were perfect and nothing overtopped steves story which when the film was called captain america youd hope it not to have but i have to admit i was worried about with so many characters in  tonys character is still developing 7 films later and the similarities between him and the winter soldier are shall we say stark which really does tie your choice on the battlefield  i think i know exactly how this is going to tie into agents of shield  awesome film let the hype for those who havent seen it begin
May 2 2016,positive,great movie love it 1010
May 2 2016,neutral,it has the pitiful aspect of a video game a few good jokes breathtaking and senseless action as well as good soap opera drama in order to fool audiences
May 2 2016,positive,this movie borrows too heavily from an impotent plot line about a struggle of power and giving up control in the comic book civil war where the movie shines is when it deviates from the comic book and comes into its own
May 2 2016,positive,the best marvel movie i have seen
May 2 2016,positive,captain america civil war is a really good movie for its genere its impactating is full of action is really well done its also not a master piece but it works really well on its on way is not perfect also but it deserve watching it
May 2 2016,positive,not as good as many indicate to be very gringy with some mediocre acting the flow of the plot is deffo very good though it never gets boringdefently one of the good amrvel movies but not so highly rated as many make it to be
May 2 2016,positive,justwowi didnt think any other superhero movie will be able to top the avengers  but this movie did well actually its kind of the avengers 25 for me
May 2 2016,positive,best mcu movie so far and best comic book movie 1010 for me
May 2 2016,positive,perhaps as comedy work but as superhero movie does not really work and i find it somewhat hypocritical to say how bad it was batman v superman where are the same issues we saw in that movie trite
May 2 2016,positive,what makes this movie lovely all those superheroes were showing off their skill and the captain america really stood for being an ideal american figure stand for your right and he did well too bad the studio were to afraid and play safe by not killing any of those characters civil war but the casualties were not really that fatal for the superheroes but it does for civilian somehow they managed to minimize civilian casualties as low as possible in this movies especially with that emptyairport so they just evacuate the airport in minutes when i read the comic captain really stood for something he believe in and iron man really hit him really really hard and the casualties among superheroes are real the civil war really make everybody lost everything
May 2 2016,positive,best of the avengers
May 2 2016,positive,everything you could want to kick off the summer movie season 
May 2 2016,positive,the only bad thing its that captain america wins
May 2 2016,positive,balance  this is what this film has that most ensemble superhero movies lack  there is a balance in pacing in tone and character exposure  characters have clear motivations and i believed them  i understood why they chose the sides they are on and at the same time they stayed true to themselves
May 2 2016,positive,great writing and great introduction of the black panther
May 2 2016,positive,you have a metal arm  thats awesome dude
May 2 2016,positive,this is another one of those movies that shows me that the intellectual snobs that give their obligatory bad reviews because this is classified as an action movie are clueless    while there is a lot going on here its not overly difficult to follow even if you havent seen all the other movies  the pacing was good the dialog was efficient and the acting was well above average all around    the only reason this movie isnt going to be enjoyable for an individual is if theyve already determined it wont be before they go in
May 2 2016,positive,perfectly balanced captain americacivil war is one of the best superheroes movies by far
May 2 2016,positive,excellent very human full of arguments emotions real people with conflicts where everyone has a reason and can mediate in order to become better
May 2 2016,positive,best marvel movie ever all the captain america movies have been the best
May 2 2016,positive,very impressed with what the russo brothers did with civil waradapted the story quite well within the marvel cinematic universeas tony  steve seperateit is zemo who builds the war within our avengersin an attempt to bring them down for good action seemed to be quite prevalent in this film  chemistry exchanged between all involved was a  sheer delight to watch unfold i only anticipate now what will unfold in the upcoming infinity war
May 2 2016,negative,this movie is absolutely overrated its a short story that has been stretched out for 2 hours not much of a civil war exactly some characters are pretty much brought into the movie for no exact reason they just show up for the big fight then are gone except caps team not much of a excellent conclusion since everyone is pretty much left wondering what happens next is was sadly a waste of an amazing comic book storyline
May 2 2016,positive,best super hero movie to date
May 2 2016,positive,nothing lasts forever a sentiment that extends to the now overstuffed  and far to frequent superhero films of the modern day and where  adventures like spiderman or the team up of the avengers once felt  like a true event superhero films whether they be of marvel or dc  variety in todays climate feel increasingly uninspired and  forgettable which makes the enjoyment levels found in captain  americas third outing civil war that much more surprising    while it neither reinvents or rejigs the comic book staple that has  become so stale over recent years and while it sometimes takes itself  far too seriously for its own good winter solider helmers anthony and  joe russo successfully balance a large roster of beloved characters and  a couple of new ones in the form of a fresh faced spiderman and black  panther to make civil wars slightly overlong run time an enjoyable and  likable event    delving into the idea of an inwardly warring avengers group with larger  than life personalities like tony stark clashing with the wellmeaning  and old school like steve rodgers civil war presents us with a  collection of superheroes and super soldiers that arent all  loveydovey rather at the point of blows within a world that no longer  wants to give these creations free reign around the globe themes that  were prevalent in the recent batman v superman but explored far more  enjoyably here in this more fun focused ride    with its fair share of dialogue heavy situations and scenarios the  russos infuse civil war with a collection of highly entertaining  action set pieces filled with great moments many that involve a  teenage spiderman and paul rudds endearing interpretation of ant man  and humorous quips by its now seasoned cast members that make its  weaknesses like a largely forgettable baddie in the form of daniel  bruhls zemo and terrible payoff of bad guy motivation and plans far  more tolerable and new cast members tom holland as peter parker and 42s  chadwick boseman as tchallablack panther seem like positive additions  to an ever expanding roster of players    hard to hate and easy to enjoy civil war doesnt exactly make one feel  as though the superhero blockbuster is 100 assured heading into the  distant and not too distant future but it certainly enough to makes a  now cynic like me feel far more willingly to be a part of the crowd  pleasers for the next little while as long as they are as well played  and constructed as this energetic adventure    3 12 vision cooked dinners out of 5    
May 2 2016,positive,finally an avengers movie i was waiting for this whole time complex intelligent and exhilarating as it divides our heroes into two rival groups at war against each other  each character with compelling motivations for their choices and actions just as well as the smart villain
May 2 2016,negative,sucksssss
May 2 2016,positive,well paced with light touches where needed  dialog that is deeper than normal comic book fare with a deft handling of conflicting emotional tugs
May 2 2016,positive,just let me see it again loved it
May 2 2016,neutral,while the action is good the plot is often times unfocused and misleading building up the suspense that never truly pays off it jumps around the world a lot making it difficult to sometimes follow what is happening in which country and why    the action is good though its sometimes negated by the typical marvel humor some of the cgi is a little dated but overall the effects are decent and sometimes spectacular    the movie felt longer than it needed to be and some parts dragged on too long its also riddled with plot holes mainly stemming from the main villain the characters were mostly interesting but some felt unnecessary    overall the movie is decent but ultimately lackluster save for the big superhero showdown and a grudge match near the end
May 2 2016,positive,wonderful stuff proof that even if you have to put a ton of stuff in a movie its not an excuse for it being shit
May 2 2016,positive,this was such a brilliant film went in with lowered expectations came out blown away and once again spiralling down the chain of marvel movie addiction craving the next release
May 2 2016,positive,it is a fun crazy ride spoiled by the elephant in the room why does everyone act so stupid and impatiently
May 2 2016,negative,deadly dull  i really fail to see how this film could be rated an average of 79
May 2 2016,positive,best marvel film yet with a brilliant plot and fantastic action mind blown with how well they made it work again
May 2 2016,positive,very entertaining the russo brothers did a fantastic job of balancing all of the characters without detracting from the main plot spider man black panther and ant man were great additions
May 2 2016,positive,this is the best marvel superhero team up movie since avengers age of ultron others thinking age of ultron wasnt the best one but i thought it was pretty good i would even dare to say its better than the first avengers movie in terms of captain americas line of movies besides him involving with the avengers this captain america movie is the best its hard to pull off to top the last two with a third movie but this one just went all out and we have not yet seen avengers infinity war and thats coming out in a couple of years suffice to say we will see a lot of marvel characters in that movie but until then the marvel cinematic universe is still building up to that gigantic event every single character in the movie have their own precious screening time its as if they jam packed all the time they could put in for every character and its still a great enjoyable movie to watch were back in the world where captain america is struggling with the current events and when things gotten close to wrap up things by taking down a terrorist suddenly the unexpected happened the fight scenes with black widow has greatly improved since we last saw her fight in the winter soldier suffice to say she was also great in age of ultron but in civil war you get the feel of that umph when not just her but the characters who can tough it out like the rest and i mean pack a punch that is quite really convincing the fights overall are so awesome itll wow you until the very end even in the beginning of the movie the fun just starts right away now if you have watched the trailer then you know theyre introducing quite a few characters in this movie but there is two that really took the introduction to a whole new level comic book readers should already be familiar with this kind of moments im talking about the appearances of black panther and spiderman im not so sure but they seemed to squeeze in spiderman in this movie to introduce him as fast they can possibly could and if thats the case then they really pulled it off well marvel proper never ceased to amaze me tom holland did an amazing performance and i can not wait for the more proper solo spiderman movie chadwick boseman did an awesome job as well portraying the prince of wakanda however it is questionable as to who will he end up with in marriage when we all know in the comics he marries ororo munroe  what else is there to say about captain america and iron man these two are bros but when you have something like the superhero registration act then things get intense chris evans has never failed to perform as steve rogers and as usual he does it like i think no one can pull it off i could say the same thing for rdj he done really well portraying as tony stark and putting into so much character this time regarding current troubles that is going in the movie scarlett johansson like the rest even her character played a big part into the movie and i love every moment shes involved in the movie lets not forget the other former agent of shield clint barton aka hawkeye if anyone is hoping about that nice combo with antman then do not worry its definitely in the movie other than that jeremy renners character seems to downplay a little but lets not blame them too much about this since it is a captain america film and its more about what is going on in the story at least we he is helping out every he can obviously his scenes with scarlet witch is most definitive yet for hawkeye elizabeth olsen as scarlet witch we get to see just how powerful she is and ill tell you when you see her in action its just the tip of the iceberg well see more of her in avengers infinity war then youll understand how powerful she really is when paul rudds character appears oh man it was hilarious it was cool it was all around awesome i could not describe anymore words but just to at least say that it is awesome to see antman again and there is a quite a surprising scene from him especially when they focus the vision it was more thorough with scarlet witch and then a little bit of tony stark this overpowered being tends to take things easy even when there is a supposedly terrorist on the loose vision starts to realize the essence of things in the reality that theyre in hopefully he will take this into an account the next time we see him  zemos appearance is somewhat underplayed but i really think this is just to set up probably another captain america film im pretty sure cap has a lot more things to do even after infinity war daniel bruhl was really great though and i cant stress enough how good his performance was throughout the movie but what about crossbones heck he also even got a good amount of time in the movie that it was a blown out of epic proportions war machine has always been my favorite iron suited character and don cheadle is no doubt a perfect actor for james rhodes maybe in the future we can hope for a solo movie of war machine anthony mackie as sam wilson aka falcon who was tagging along with cap was also one of the best things in the movie the situation was more like where ever you go i go kind of thing and it started with the ending of the winter soldier searching for a long lost friend and lending a hand every way he can possibly can his fight scenes were as good as any other characters fight scenes if you think this is the best marvel movie ever then you should reconsider because we still have yet to watch avengers infinity war overall as captain america movie its the best one yet but if you think this is just another avengers movie then think again civil war can really pit you into thinking who is right and who is wrong but in the end youll soon realize that there is other important matters that needs greater attention spidermans appearance was not even a bonus but actually one of the best things that ever happened so far in the marvel cinematic universe imagine seeing characters we hope to see like the xmen and the fantastic four but until then we can only hope for the best if youre a fan of marvel or just generally like comic book characters in glorious live action this is another that you surely not want to miss
May 2 2016,positive,looks great when compared with batman v superman perfect balance of action and humour
May 2 2016,positive,the longer you think about the movie the more credit you gotta give to it being able to juggle so many characters and giving them all a number of moments to shine is no easy feat but the russos have pulled this off superbly  the action in the movie is excellent but more importantly the story holds up it does act as the glue that takes you from one action scene to the next without making you wonder why they dont continue to punch their face in  you actually care about these characters    this movie is easily among the top 5 superhero movies and depending on your personal taste it might just end up being your favorite superhero movie 
May 2 2016,positive,i myself am not a huge superhero or indeed marvel fan so when i heard of the new captain america movie being released i didnt think twice about it in fact ive only  seen the two avengers films plus winter soldier so am by no means interested even though i cant deny those movies were good  however when i saw the phenomenal reviews i was intrigued as to exactly what made this one so special over the others i entered the theatre which was packed with moderate expectations and they were simply put to shame by the quality of film that i witnessed with superbly choreographed action sequences most notably the showdown between the avengers and ironmancaptain america fight excellent script  that is more than can be said for many of this genre and actually very mature themes it is by far the best of the pack  the cast was very well handled considering how huge it was and each character got their say no matter how briefly in an exceptional spidermans case to be honest there isnt much more to be said except this qualifies as a certain recommendation to anybody totally unmissable  verdict a
May 2 2016,positive,brings humanity and world problems to the mcu
May 2 2016,positive,absolutely loved this movie saw it today and thought that it was fantastic full of action and omg moments that had me practically out of my seat
May 2 2016,positive,having loved every second of the winter soldier i eagerly awaited the next cap film the hype and hopes i had placed on this were on new levels i have never looked forward to a film so much before to my surprise it didnt disappoint i loved this more than the winter soldier and then some it has what i loved about the winter soldier political thriller and then some avenger style action sequences this film for me anyway was perfect even after multiple viewings i cant find the flaws thats not saying there isnt any but i cant see them i highly recommend captain americacivil war to anyone really its a superb film all in all and leaves the viewer satisfied
May 2 2016,positive,absolutely exceptional performances and effects amazing and loveable story
May 2 2016,positive,i so loved it buying it for sure
May 2 2016,positive,marvel hit it out of the park on this one  great combination of action and laughs like the way they added the other marvel super heros in i was concerned if that would work but it did   this is one i will be buying the dvd of
May 2 2016,negative, dont be suckered in i dont know whats going on this is not a good movie the critics must be nuts or smoking the ganja bvs was not good but civil wars is just as bad and i hate it even more cos the critics made it seemed like it was marvelous it sucks big time boring and nothing special skip it and dont waste your money
May 2 2016,positive,i know whose side im on
May 2 2016,positive,marvel knows how to do it right
May 2 2016,positive,this is what a superhero film should be like take note dc comics after your batman vs superman shenanigans
May 2 2016,positive,captain american civil war has a bit of an identity crisis on one half it wants to be a sequel to winter soldier and it is not a very interesting one but competent nonetheless its also trying to be a very condensed adaptation of the marvel comic book event known as civil war and although it does deliver in some very basic levels it misses the point of the civil war conflict      instead we get a movie that is once again all about fanfare and no consequences whatsoever which is funny for a movie that spends to much time jamming down our throats the concept of consequence for our actions     the good    spiderman is freaking amazing yes tom holland is the best screen adaptation of peter parkerspiderman    antman has some truly remarkable moments in this movie paul rudd can hold his ground easily next to evan downey and all the other big names    black panther gets enough screen time and backstory to make us want to see more of him    iron man has never been so compelling since the original movie    the movie does a wonderful job in keeping us open minded and second guessing ourselves when it comes to picking a side    the airport scene is probably the most exciting nerd moment ive witness in years    the rest of the cast is fine and they all get their moments this movie juggles all those personalities properly     the bad   the best thing about this movie are the cameo of other super heroes the actual center plot line around bucky and rodgers feels slow and devoid of logic at times    really she is her niece boy is that convenient storytelling    staging at times is very poor they are close enough to face each other and talk without yelling yet they have to run half a football field to get into a fight with each other    all this mess and fighting serves no purpose nothing has really changed or it does not appear to have and theres no consequences at all except for one character getting seriously hurt in the civil war comic series captain america dies at the end thats the a proper consequence marvel is time you kill off one of your main guys give us something to miss    it feels too long
May 2 2016,positive,might as well be called the avengers 3 there are so many characters from those movies that warrants it the hulk and thor have been replaced by spidermanantman and black panther you might think there is so much going on here but it is all well told in a coherent story with some great action serving it my favourite characters are scarlet witch spiderman and iron man this movie worked where bvs failed to
May 2 2016,positive,one of the best of 2016 chris evans does a great job of leading this film
May 2 2016,negative,superman v batman was better and thats saying something
May 2 2016,positive,a lot happens in this film yet at the end nothing has happened we dont seem any further on other than kicking off spiderman and black panther standalones  great battle sequence at the airport and chase sequence before that final fight sequence seems unnecessary  too much stark for a cap film too
May 2 2016,positive,this was phenomenal but not perfect captain america civil war does so many things right its hard to remember the wrongs every moment is skillfully crafted and acted by a stellar cast the two new heroes have a surprising amount of screen time and really add to the story while opening up many possibilities for their respective franchises the airport scene is visually stunning running nearly 18 minutes long but what this movie really does right is the character interaction and conflict within the group there is a villain outside of the two teams but marvel didnt really make him menacing choosing to focus more on the main cast overall a very enjoyable movie 810
May 2 2016,positive,proves to dcu that a serous tone goes beyond darkness but is about raising polarizing and thoughtprovoking postures perfect balance of comedy action and character development the best spiderman so far while its deepness outstands it might create some barriers for an audience looking for plain entertainment
May 2 2016,positive,omg was an awesome movie loads of great fight scenes and new moves black panther and spidy killed it cant wait for wars
May 2 2016,positive,proves to dcu that a serious tone goes beyond darkness but it is about raising polarizing and thoughtprovoking postures perfect balances comedy action and character development while its deepness outstands it might create some barriers for an audience looking for plain entertainment
May 2 2016,positive,although the film has its weaknesses such as another throwaway villain the incredible action sequences interesting story and outstanding performances especially tom hollands spiderman mean that this is a film that i can definitely recommend
May 2 2016,positive,fun but the same again
May 2 2016,positive,are there any people left on this planet who dont have superpowers
May 2 2016,positive,the best action scenes of any marvel film not so incoherent as to make you nauseous as with age of ultron but exceptionally well made especially the bucky black panther and cap chase the character development of certain stars was fantastic vision and wanda were the real stars for me but i have no idea what olsen was doing with that accent others like iron man just felt a bit repetitive a lot of the usual marvel humour was lacking but that was nearly entirely made up for by the too brief appearances of ant man and spiderman tom holland was far better than i was expecting and left me looking forward to the spiderman film i was completely cold about up there with winter soldier and a great conclusion to the cinematic cap trilogy but i dont think it should have been made before dr strange and without fantastic four as with those rights it could have been made a lot closer to the best marvel comic ever worth it just to see the spectacular set pieces everything else is a brilliant bonus
May 2 2016,positive,this movie is absolutely brilliant it  is only baron zemo that kinda disappointed me i expected more from the villain
May 2 2016,positive,amazing i really enjoyed it special effects but not overly done but a great storyline and fantastic acting this is indeed great
May 2 2016,positive,havent seen it yet but you know its going to be fucking great      update it fucking was
May 2 2016,positive,a great avengers movie
May 2 2016,positive,as good as we all expected and plenty of surprises that make it an enjoyable experience  however the flaw in the film if it can be considered a flaw is that it feels incredibly sad seeing tony stark arguably the most loved avenger defeated
May 2 2016,positive,an amazing film from start to finish the plot action and visuals were amazing and not once did i feel bored shame that the tv universe wasnt apart of this more
May 2 2016,positive,you guys must see civil war love this movie it is like winter solider times 10 b heck i will rewatch on saturday and it might be a a it is that good unlike spiderman 3 or batman v superman or the xmen movies before the reboot where you cant focus on all the characters it gave you just enough of all of them where it doesnt distract to the overall movie plot where there is too much going on     the marvel universe is simply perfect they dont make a bad movie and it is crazy that the writing is so well and all movies connected it is scary dc cant never get to this level of hit after hit and build this wonderful universe where they are all connected dc is trying and failing at an embarrassing fashion     batman v superman slammed the cameos into the movie in a laughable fashion and marvel it is very smooth which doesnt take away from the main plot it is almost like avengers 1 and a 12 but still a captain america movie at its core the battles andor rather several fights are masterpieces     marvel  job well done    and welcome home spiderman this kid is the spiderman i grew up reading about just the taste and he will top tobey mcguire spiderman cant wait for homecoming     wonderful to be living at this time to witness my childhood fandom on screen
May 2 2016,positive,this movie was awesome the best of marvel after the winter soldier of course
May 2 2016,positive,is this film really 3 times better the bvs  really critics you didnt think the plot was a little thin  yes this is a good film and i enjoyed it but there is something wrong these days with the scoring system or people  maybe thats just the dc fan in me
May 2 2016,positive,yep its nice to see everyone is fighting everybody its fun but at the end of it what do you get a story full of plot holes far worse than batman vs superman both ironmans and caps reasons for a fight lacks depth and consistency theyre like a bunch of kids who fight then kiss and make up and does it all over again even zemos evil plan is silly too illogical if zemo was in connivance with the sokovia accords to be implemented that would validated all his plans how would he know theyre going to fight each other even his final plot of bringing them to a room for the final fight but they almost killed each other in the airport whats the sense in that  of all the mcus movies this has the worst storyline its that bad that it made millars book look better and i dont even like millars civil war lol the only good thing about it is to see that classic spidey that we love onscreen talkative and funny unlike the dark one and the tobey one if they killed cap as he should be some peeps would be happier lol
May 2 2016,positive,marvel hits it out of the park once again  awesome action with humor thrown in at the perfect moments  does a great job at focusing on a constant story even while packed with charactersalso does a great job allowing you to understand both viewpoints of the opposite opinions  great introductions to black panther and spidermanvery excited to see what marvel can do with spidey especially now that ive had a taste  once again i feel like scarlet witch steals the scenes she is in  cant wait to watch this movie again
May 2 2016,positive,unlike batman vs superman this movie had the right amount of humour and heart to act as the counterweight to the drama and grit  very entertaining and a fightscene between the main heroes that is actually enjoyable rather than depressing to watch what these movie makers do  and they did it in the avengers  is make the composition of these fight scenes so visually interesting and dynamic and even funny at times
May 2 2016,positive,like all the films action from start to finish and wait to the end credits a snippet for what to come  3 hours but i even kept still so must of been good
May 2 2016,positive,best marvel movie yet its got an abundance of section and serious but also not afraid to laugh at itself
May 2 2016,positive,best marvel movie ever great job from russo brothers and what an awesome cast thanks kevin feige
May 2 2016,positive,captain america  civil war is everything batman v superman should have been but wasnt adult sophisticated themes effectively presented with relatable characters the airport scene in particular was astonishing and every moment of humor hit the target spider man and black panther nailed a perfect synthesis of the sophisticated thriller elements of winter soldier with the lighthearted irreverent tone of guardians of the galaxy hard to know how marvel can top this
May 2 2016,positive,marvels best film thus far
May 2 2016,positive,quite possibly the best superhero movie ever spiderman is annoying in just about every film ever but otherwise its flippin awesome
May 2 2016,positive,love the avenger movies lots of fun
May 2 2016,positive,captain americca civil war continues the stories of winter soldier and age of ultron and proves that marvel are head and shoulders above dc  the plot is not too dissimilar to the batman vs superman in this instance pitting iron man agaomst fellow avenger captain america  but where bvs failed in both its ability to deliver a film with coherent plot special effects and introduction of new characters civil war succeeds      after and incident in africa which kills many innocent civilians the avengers are asked to be made accountable for their actions and sign a treaty putting them under government control which divides the avengers    where bvs was a really slog to sit through this is extreamly fast paced and the actions scenes some of the best committed to film  ive already seen this twice and it was a thrill ride each time    as well as having the likes of black widow scarlett johansson and  from antman paul rudd from previous marvel movies the film also introduces two new characters in the form of black panther chadwick boseman and spiderman tom holland and they dont feel shoehorned in for the sake of it and will be hood additions to the mcu  especially spiderman who seems revitalised after the disastrous amazing spiderman outings
May 2 2016,positive,wow so good its almost as good as the winter soldier i love all the scenes with spiderman now i cant wait to see his movie
May 2 2016,positive,    hands down one of the best mcu movies ever made
May 2 2016,positive,in my opinion possibly the best marvel movie thats been released awesome fighting scenes nicely developing plot and well made overall
May 2 2016,positive,awesome movie and better than batman v superman go watch this masterpiece definitely the best movie this year incredible battle sequence bonus if you see this in imax
May 2 2016,positive,one of the best superhero movies ever
May 2 2016,positive,amazing movie highly recommend it cant wait for the other one
May 2 2016,positive,they wrote spiderman perfectly it had jokes and it got real really real i was not disappointed once again marvel makes another amazing captain america movie
May 2 2016,positive,the first mcu movie after the incredible hulk that went deeper and darker than the usual lighthearted and humorous marvel movies  the movie makes you question throughout the whole movie which one of these opposing parties is in the right  you dont have a simple evil villain that needs to be taken care of and everyone walks away laughing after the job is done  no brothers and sisters are fighting against each other  and civil war is doing a really good job at portraying how everything isnt just black and white  you see these people who fought alongside in many battles fight over their ideologies cheer and grief with them it isnt a movie in which the studio tries to make two iconic marvel characters fight each other just because of the purpose ofwellfighting each other you care about these characters and you can relate to their stance  a movie packed with emotions and probably the best action scenes a superhero movie has ever put on the big screen
May 2 2016,positive,zack snyder take note this is how a super hero should be done marvel have produced yet another hit how do they keep doing it i must admit the film took a little while to get going for me but when it did it was truly fantastic the film has many characters but it handles them all really well none of them seemed like they were shoehorned in like wonderwoman in batman v superman my only real criticism and its a small one but i felt the new spiderman looked too computer generated     you can expect to see the usual mix of great action impressive fighting and wisecracks that marvel films deliver so well this film simply blows batman v superman out of the water i look forward to what the new xmen film has to offer
May 2 2016,positive,an excellent addition to the franchise a lot of emotion involved believing in both sides of the argument and the constant thought of i just want them all to be friends again
May 2 2016,positive,capitán américa civil war it was everything i thought and a little bit more  perhaps it should have not been called civil war the brief appearence of spider man in one word was awesome iron man was way too cool again better than ever his character evolved through all the films and that was really awesome black panther insanely magnificent in some parts of the movie i was teamcap but the 80 i was teamironman i feel that steve rogers progress between movies is kind of poor and disappointing but the whole package of the movie was really entertaining it is action packed it is fun packed and like no other marvel movie before it had the courage to show us the consecuences of the heroes actions and decisions
May 2 2016,positive,i was expecting more it was a bit slow for my liking 
May 2 2016,positive,a truly epic film from marvel cant wait for the bluray
May 2 2016,positive,all the characters from the ones starring in their 6th picture to the ones making their mcu debut are well employed and organically implemented for the most part the film sets a new tone and status quo for the 3rd phase of the mcu and left me begging to see what happens next itll be a while unfortunately until we can catch up with these characters again overall a huge payoff for those following the mcu at least the earthbased characters and their adventures so far
May 2 2016,positive,avengers 25the cap narrative seems to be the one that gets better each time it holds enough heart and one of the best standoffs in cinema
May 2 2016,positive,great movie worth your money id watch it again
May 2 2016,negative,fantastic fight choreography great effects fantastic cast but seriously where was the plot would someone truly abandon their friends and comrades to rescue someone they know is a dangerous killer who they havent actually seen for 50 odd years maybe they would but i found it simplistic and unconvincing and really black widow fighting hawkeye because reasons the majority of the film felt like a 6 year old boys fantasy and lacked the witty script of previous marvel films spidermans entrance brought some mild humour but overall it felt like a cheap way to cram as many superheroes as possible into a tedious two and a half hours
May 2 2016,positive,to many things going in to be a true captain america squeal this its a avengers spinoff and it doesnt disappoint it just breaks up the main plot between cap
May 2 2016,positive,i have watched it twice its awesome
May 2 2016,positive,long review    after 3 days and 2 showings i can now finally write a hopefully objective review because yes i am a marvel fan     i couldnt decide if i liked this better than the first russo brothers film the winter soldier because after the first viewing i felt like civil wars plot had gaping holes i actually didnt like the first part of the film with the whole avengers starting in medias res once again i felt like i missed watching the first episode of a tv show winter soldiers narrative was just stronger the movie was fresh on its take as more of an espionage thriller than a superhero movie and with the surplus of superhero movie your basic viewer could easily get bored     superhero movies now have the great task of trying to think out of the box to please average film goers and at the same time cater to the dreams of every fanboy its not easy but the russo brothers have done it so i have decided that i liked winter soldiers narrative but i liked the heart and soul of civil war more     i dont really read a lot of comics but i was fortunate to have read mark millars civil war and that was one of the stories that changed my way of how i see superhero comics when they announced that theyd be doing this storyline i was actually surprised but also very happy how could they do this without all the other characters and what about the superhero registration act will it look like the incredibles on the big screen thankfully though while the russo brothers changed the storyline they were able to maintain its key elements in a stroke of genius instead of the superhero registration act we have the sokovia accords that basically confines the avengers under the rule of the united nations and the best thing is that you get the agreement you get why tony stark is for this and you get why captain americas against it now i dont want to compare it to bvs but i need to because this is the glaring difference between the two movies you cared what the characters were fighting for and youre thrown in this area of gray its very political and it is hard to choose a side    in the aspects of war theme it isnt as grandiose as the one in the comics hello no hulk and thor but boy do they have one of the best action sequences for ensemble and oneonone or oneontwo ensemble because they arent fighting villains theyre fighting amongst themselves so it was a joy to see how each character will play their strengths and weaknesses we also have new characters in black panthertchalla splendidly played by chadwick boseman spot on accent to think he has an africanamerican voice i checked his interviews and i cannot believe how out of character tchalla is for chadwick but he nailed it being a super fighter regal prince that midcredits scene is such a huge nod to his standalone movie as well antmans involvement is solid but i felt that he should have thought more on why he joined team cap but it was so awesome to see another side of antman i never expected that theyd err reveal him through antman but holy cow they did 3 fangirls    and come on the russo brothers and tom holland gave us the spiderman that the fans deserved a lot of regular viewers must be confused by now because of 3 spiderman iterations but trust me when i tell you that tom holland is peter parker he is peter parker if you watched the animated series or even the latest comics now he is that nerdy smart kid that weve all been waiting for tom has the body type the personality and the flexibility for it he is a frigging gymnast his british accent never once appeared and im sold for it i am sold he has one of the best fight scenes as well and yes benjamin buttoning aunt may is awesome theyre both awesome    can we please give a standing ovation to the stunt coordinators and visual effects team i want to give them a high five and just tell them you guys did an awesome job please give tons of recognition to these guys    though i didnt enjoy some of the cgi in this film it felt odd at some points    now why does it have full of heart because of that last dmn scene if you read civil war they actually pulled out a panel straight from the comic and right into the screen it was one of the best moments in the film and i feel like i need a poster of that scene the last scene culminates phase 2 and triggers the start of phase 3 we have divided friends and after learning about some very important fact which i cannot say goes head on and the final battle is worthy of the title civil war the movie gives weight to each characters loyalty friendship allegiance and philosophy the martha moment in bvs could have been done so much better if they saw how civil war handled theirs there is a martha moment as well in the sense we see the vulnerability and humanity of our characters and the russo brothers just played it out so beautifully with chris evans and robert downey jr at the helm go into this film with no expectations on the villain because even if we have daniel bruhl as baron zemo he isnt the one in the comics just go in and watch a family fall apart and they wear costumes and shiz it is really heartbreaking on my 2nd viewing    there is so much nod to the comic book community because there is flirtation between a supposed pair of soontobe lovers some foreshadowing on what may happen in future and yes magic is definitely in     i now am so excited for the marvel cinematic universe next up is doctor strange and i cannot wait to see how hell blend in with all of them kudos to everyone in the marvel studios for creating a franchise with such magnitude it will now be very difficult for new mcu fans because they have to watch everything in phase12 just to understand phase 3 it is awesome though for marvel fans     so a 45 would suffice for this movie i think i need to watch it another time and another for caps biceps just because just to get a real rating
May 2 2016,positive,captain america civil war  the biggest marvel movie ever made maybe but is it the best one well i dont think so civil war is an epic blockbuster movie with top class cast and also superb action scene the story itself is so enchanting the relation between characters is developed nicely despite the different side they are on but although the director can maintain the audiences mood constantly i think civil war is lacking some kind of thrill in it  overall civil war is an epic success definitely a mustwatch for fans or nonsuperhero fans and also civil war is not only a film its also a love letter contains a promise for future mcu movie
May 2 2016,positive,best marvel film yet it has started to bring together all of the stories its an action packed flick that gives us all that we want
May 2 2016,neutral,one of the most overwhelmingly mediocre blockbusters ive ever sat through in my life
May 2 2016,positive,overall disappointing two reasons firstly we know its a civil war the clues in the title so why take about an hour and a half getting to the civil war part the back story could have been covered in ten minutes secondly the most interesting parts of the movie all come with the minor characters such as vision scarlet witch etc sadly as good as their acting is theres nothing more to say about ironman or captain america and when theyre on the screen all the energy dissipates in fact the movie is saved by the entrance of spiderman  antman who bring some much needed humour and fizz not particularly looking forward to the rest of this series now not unless some real jeopardy shows up
May 1 2016,positive,civil war comes on as the perfect example how the media on its deadly viral form can shape the looks of a film as an unskipped chance to watch epicness on a movie theater civil war use a well structured script with the right montage to support well all the storylines the are settled the way conflict and the big feud is brought is compelling enough to get stuck in your chair until half of a movie with the combination of well choreographed action sequences the film pays back but in the end all promises over the film that were told at the beginning are not enough to hide the franchise business of what mcu has become leaving this so called epic movie on a position on not standing on its own and be totally forgettable in years to come mcu is founded on the perpetual delivering of new product which left past products drifting away through oblivion
May 1 2016,positive,this for me is the best marvel movie this movie did almost perfectly what batman v superman failed to do and that is to understand why both sides are fighting for ideologies different ways to handle a situation the character development is very well done too im team iron man but i understand why the cap is doing what he is doing in this movie and i respect that and you know what else spiderman is finally done right i looking forward to see him in the future films the chemistry between peter parker and tony stark is gold i wanna see more of that if you havent seen it you really should its a very enjoyable film
May 1 2016,positive,excellent movie  wud of been enjoyed more so but was so crammed in like a sardine and knee was cramping vue leamington have you heard of leg room for your standard seating
May 1 2016,positive,best superhero movie so far
May 1 2016,positive,whats really clever about this film is that everyones motives and point of view is so well portrayed for a moment you feel behind each of them even the so called villain for a moment of pity at least just when you think you expect a dc predictable ending coming its turns into something completely different what an excellent mature storyline and plot completely character driven and entertaining with wit charm and amazing visuals so people can hate on marvel as much as they want but the point is it appeals to absolutely everyone of all ages and captures imaginations this is how its done
May 1 2016,neutral,civil war delivers plenty of action with a very interesting villain who is not just evil but has legitimate rationale for his terrible crimes fans of the series or marvel fans will most likely enjoy the film the antman sequences were especially enjoyable personally though i felt that the movie lacked depth so while it does offer escapism for 25 hours  it left me little to reflect on afterwards perhaps im expecting too much from the film because of all the hype but imo the early xmen films portrayed the challenges that mutantspowered people faced much better
May 1 2016,negative,maybe have give money to marvel but hey ironman 3 did too and was one of the worse movies ever god i was tired by the end of the movie captain america is a selfish man the entire movie stark is the only one feeling like this is something very bad going on  cgi was bad they didnt finished like they should and spiderman payed the price awful over all liked the 10 last minutes of the movie forced relationships forced jokes a big title didnt sell what it is the plot is mostly about captain america trying to help his friend bucky
May 1 2016,positive,movie is the same as the other one 4 stars
May 1 2016,positive,esta a otro nivel mejor q avengers age of ultron
May 1 2016,positive,this is the must see marvel movie what makes it so in my opinion is not the endless and often funny action sequences though they are pretty fun  but rather the very real dilemma that is born from each side of a very serious issue the issue of course being oversight of enhanced human beings  and because both sides make such convincing arguments the viewer is thrust into a moral quagmire at the end of the film i still didnt know who was right and that left me very uncomfortable which is something a superhero films doesnt often do
May 1 2016,positive,this movie is like a puzzle that amazes you when is complete  there you are caring about the characters and seeing a beautiful  clash of values and visions of what is right and wrong  well done marvel
May 1 2016,positive,its really hard to justify who is right or wrong from what one truly believes in theres always something in between the plot was cleverly and delicately told its purely entertaining and effortless of watching a 25 hr film
May 1 2016,positive,as i write this this review i had just gotten back from seeing captain america civil war roughly an hour ago and whoa what a satisfied time ive had thinking about it so far not only was this film the best of all of the marvel studios films to date it is also one of the best superhero movies of all time everything in civil war is darn near perfectly executed whether it be the writing characters storytelling action and the most important for a movie like this character motivations   for the most part i perfectly understood where these characters were coming from ps it probably helps to have seen the other films in the mcu before going into this one but its not too bad without that advantage another thing about this film that caught be a bit by surprise is the serious tone it carries throughout while still managing to be funny when in needed to be and also very enjoyable throughout   the captain america franchise is a series that seems to get better and better as the movies progress which is one thing i appreciate about these films even with so much focus put on several other characters speaking of which this is the most ive liked tony stark since the first iron man it still manages to be a story based around the relationship between cap and bucky with tonys problems being blended perfectly into the mix   another note the action in this film is some of the most engaging exciting and realistic action ive ever seen and as youve probably heard many people mention the battleroyale seen at the airport is one of the best action scenes of all time as well as the lessmentioned final action scene which was one of the most engaging throwdowns between characters ive seen   i tried to keep myself from overhyping this movie but i really couldnt help it because this is a truly great movie while i do highly recommend it dont go into this movie expecting the second coming because if you do then you are most likely going to be disappointed even with that i still highly recommend this movie   9510     slight spoiler for those who have avoided the trailers  ps spiderman in this movie may be the best film version of the webslinger weve had to date tom holland really captured the essence of the character and i believe that he was a very good choice
May 1 2016,negative,this movie is for little kids predictable plot lots of punch lines explosions and weak antagonists a perfect safe movie to take your little newphews for a lovely sunday dont forget to buy your action figure
May 1 2016,positive,its just brutally  excellent  it will tear you apart everything has a reason  and those reasons might even make you question yourself on what you actually believe is right andor wrong everything was perfect it  obliterated my expectations left me wanting more get ready for one hell of a ride and yes best spider  man ever brought to life since sam raimis spiderman 1  2 you will just love it
May 1 2016,positive,this movie is perfect on every level watch the movie and you will not be disappointed surely one of the best if not the best movie marvel has ever made
May 1 2016,positive,best marvel film yet especially like the political undertones on how we should not allow terrorist to change our way of life
May 1 2016,positive,dc who marvel once again deliver the goods learn dc this is how you bring superheros together masterpiece fenomenal fantastic  pure gold box office be ready because cap is here and he is about to show you how to rule the mcu
May 1 2016,positive,not perfect but a great movie looking for the next one
May 1 2016,positive,i left feeling that ca cw was a more enjoyable film than batman versus superman     the introductions of new characters such as black panther and the new spider man were well handled even if they did seem included only to make us anticipate their new movies
May 1 2016,positive,the biggest differences between captain america civil war and other recent superhero film which i do not wish to mention the title are its more focus and cohesive i know what is going on i know why the superhero fight each other every characters have their own moment without affecting the story i love how the story gets deeper and emotional until we almost reach the end point of the film the only issue i have was certain fight scene was too shaky cant tell what hitting what to conclude well done marvel studio
May 1 2016,positive,emotional stakes and the best spiderman incarnation for the big screen
May 1 2016,positive,captain america may be one of the best films that marvel has ever made with a gripping narrative emotional story and brilliant character development it does a tremendous job of not letting any of its gigantic cast fall by the wayside while keeping it a captain america move there are no faults that i can find with a movie that tries so hard to please everyone the russo brothers have somehow topped their last captain america movie and i dont know how theyre gonna top it next time
May 1 2016,positive,it was a very emotional turn for marvel studios every scene in the film was good and the next scene topped it in every way like batman v superman but not shitty
May 1 2016,positive,was dope af spider man done right loved him in the scenes he was in love how the story flowed the must see movie of the year it will dominate the award season it is that good
May 1 2016,positive,an excellent movie a good storyline and good packed actions throughout the movie even the supposedly main villain is a case for simpathy spoiler and just when we thought the action sequel is finished but that figthing of the titular characters hasnt come up yetanother spoiler then the ending action sequence come one conclusion though the most mature and wise character by the end of the movie is not cap or tony but one of the new super heroes more spoliers an excellent work by the russos brothers two thumbs up
May 1 2016,positive,the airport scene is the best action scene ever must see movie
May 1 2016,negative,the action scenes are good but the whole thing feels empty and a waste of time at the end of the film nothing is achieved the new heroes are still poor and the franchise is still heavily driven by older cast members will not be watching any future installments theres no point
May 1 2016,positive,civil war is not only pure marvel heaven but also rises above other comic book adaptations to give true drama and depth to characters that are given time and respect to deepen with every player having their time to shine a great followup from the enjoyable age of ultron and a fantastic sequel to winter soldier the russo brothers bring action heart comedy grit and comic book fun to make another perfect superhero flick on marvels roster see it in 3d and imax if possible if not only for one action sequence thats so fun and inventive it could go down in movie history spiderman is loads of fun with tom holland showing to be a great choice while chadwick bosemans black panther is bad ass and given a great introduction to this universe having a great slice of the drama of this movie and a compelling character arc cap bucky and iron man are the strongest they have ever been with each actor bringing great emotion and seriousness to their roles doctor strange has big boots to fill while infinity war only gets more faith with these directors in charge
May 1 2016,positive,captain america civil war might be the best mcu movie to date even though marvel drops the ball yet again on the villain side of things
May 1 2016,positive,amazing action scenes great storyline and the civil war is throughout the movie and not a oh look a bigger threat kinda movie the new characters were spoton and 4dx was definitely worth it this movie is my new favourite marvel movie  this and deadpool
May 1 2016,positive,another spot on captain america film
May 1 2016,positive,i loved this movie    1  what they did with spider man was amazing  my wife who is not the biggest super hero fan and never saw the other marvel movies said the best thing in this movie was spider man  2  they way they introduce each new character made sense and was an enjoyment to watch  it felt like the new characters were needed and fit into the plot  it didnt feel forced or unnecessary  3  the action  one thing that disappointed me most about bvs was that we really didnt get the two characters fighting that much  this movie allowed us to have more than one fight and how they did the scenes was wonderful  there is one image i wont say when it is but it comes straight from the comic book  i said out loud beautiful  my wife had no clue what i meant until i explained to her the significance after the movie  when it happened it fit so well into the fight sequence as well again coming right out the original comic  4  the plot  i was expecting this to be more political than it actually was  it really wasnt  it was to some extent but the story i think ended on a less political note than i expected  not only that everything ties together so so well  the threads all connect  4  finally i really like what they did with the action scenes and story together  i felt like you got enough story to make it worth watching just for that but the way they carried the action sequences was also very well done so you werent bored  both aspects invite a second and third watch to be able to capture everything while a first watch leaves you very satisfied  both the action and story allows you to think and get into the world while still being entertained    my only problem is thisyou really need to see the other marvel movies to get the full impact of the movie  my wife hadnt watched them and would give this movie a 3 stars  she adds the 3rd for spider man
May 1 2016,positive,probably the best movie of the marvel cinematic universe with an excellent mix of action and drama packed with emotional conflict and strong performances that will make happy fans and nonfans of the comic
May 1 2016,positive,spider man is the best one yet
May 1 2016,positive,the avengers gone into overdrive story could have been more slick but lets face it its all about the action and the one liners
May 1 2016,positive,excellent movie with a very well tied plot and very clever script respecting the essence of the heroes their nobility and friendship to put the fight together as a momentary need without bizarre motivations they fought for ideals knowing they did not want to hurt each other the airport scene was epic to stay in the history of comic book movies
May 1 2016,neutral,the worst captain america ever and a shameless political bulllshit but a lot of fun inside four different movies at the same time so fuck me in the brain marvel and thank you
May 1 2016,positive,really good action in this one and some questions left unanswered which we will need to wait for the next avenger movie overall a solid movie even  if with the cast it seems it should be called avengerscivil war
May 1 2016,positive,the most recent addition to the marvel cinematic universe might just be the best one yet a wonderfully written story with breathtaking action and fantastic performances captain america civil war sets the comic book movie bar even higher
May 1 2016,positive,definitely a contender for best superhero film yet
May 1 2016,positive,i really prefer the winter soldier one please spiderman dont appear like that again after bvs  seeing this movie is like a grown up going to a kids party 
May 1 2016,positive,a amazing marvel flim the best super hero movie ever
May 1 2016,positive,you think they cant top what they already got then bam piff kapow marvel hit you right in the face with a fistful of awesome
May 1 2016,positive,very busy movie and the spiderman element felt too much of a reach the desire to market the next spidey movie was too strong good setup for the next avengers though
May 1 2016,positive,some have called it avengers 25 make no mistake this is without doubt captain america 3 read my review of captain america civil war read more    after the last captain america film the winter soldier expectations were sky high for the next installment the winter soldier was an extremely high quality film that introduced the titular character to us in a compelling way as well as cementing the relationship between cap and bucky then we moved on to the destruction of sokovia brought about because of tony stark we explored the increasing divide amongst members of the avengers team during age of ultron    this is effectively where we pick up in civil war team cap vs team iron man one team is all for an overseeing body of people to keep the avengers in check this is the iron man camp while the other team if absolutely against the idea this is the captains camp cap has already put his trust in a governing body in the shape of shield only to be betrayed and find out it was hydra all along after watching all the promos you may has chosen a side but you will constantly be changing your mind while watching this film    you may also have worried about how high could the stakes be the promos may have not convinced you but you have nothing to worry about i genuinely feared that we may lose one or two characters whether we do or not is for you to find out    i only have one negative so ill get that out of the way it is an ongoing struggle with the majority of marvel movies the token bad guy maybe it is just me but the villains agenda seemed a little convoluted he didnt really have much to do in the end it serves the plot so not too big of an issue overall after some thought i may even go as far as to say that there could have been other ways to further the story making this villain unnecessary it just means there is more time to focus on the struggle between team cap and team iron man i appreciate that neither of those camps were portrayed as right or wrong  it goes back and forth making it a constant struggle    the performances are outstanding to think that some of these actors are playing their respective characters fifth or sixth time and yet bring their a game every single time and add a layer of nuance every time is fascinating to me it just goes to show how well these actors now know their characters how comfortable they are with each other and how much fun they must have making these movies to continue to improve film after film the newcomers are very impressive too so was their introduction into the story itself it all felt organic to the story chadwick boseman brings a sense of gravitas to black panther which makes me very excited for his solo film and then theres spiderman the one people have been most excited to see i wont say much at all except that he is one of the highlights of the entire film    the other highlightan absolutely phenomenal action set piece at the airport you havent even seen a tenth of it in the promos i was filled with a pure sense of wonder and cinematic joy while watching it you will see things youve never seen before quite possibly the best action scene i have seen in a comic book film    i could continue to wax lyrical about this film but in short although it is still fresh in my mind captain america civil war is tied with avengers assemble as my favourite marvel film so far they nailed the drama they nailed the action they nailed the humour and most importantly they balanced all of that while giving all the characters their due the russo brothers and the writers christopher markus and stephen mcfeely have done a masterful job this is the 13th outing from marvel in their cinematic universe and they have absolutely knocked it out of the park surely this is unprecedented bring on infinity war    my score 910
May 1 2016,positive,wow this was impressive loved it thought about seeing it again in theatre guess i need to start my marvel movie collection
May 1 2016,positive,best  marvel movie  yet
May 1 2016,positive,the blueprint on how to make an ensemble superhero movie
May 1 2016,positive,best marvel movie if not the best super hero movie to date
May 1 2016,positive,is a good marvel formula movie
May 1 2016,positive,fantastically pulled together and exciting with the new characters
May 1 2016,positive,excellent marvel movie that makes you constantly debating with yourself whos right teamironman or teamcaptainamerica through out the entire film the villain baron zemo is a good villain but not the baron zemo from the comics however this isnt a massive complaint
May 1 2016,positive,awesome movie lots off tension great action and great entertainment
May 1 2016,positive,action and consequence is the backbone of capitan america civil war its not about the new bad guy its deeper than that the action sequences are amazing the acting is top notch a careful and steady pace and the two new heroes black panther and spiderman truly do add so much to this movie also this new onscreen version of spiderman is the best i have ever seen
May 1 2016,positive,just has good as others
May 1 2016,positive,great action and a suprisingly smart story make this a worthy member of the mcu unfortunately the over abundance of characters weighs this film down its certianly better than bvs but would i call it great no
May 1 2016,positive,the story line was a little boring at some point but the action parts were really good overall it was a decent movie
May 1 2016,positive,610 found it like a typical superhero moviewhat did it for me wasthe hype aboutspiderman he is awesome which is why it even got a 6 rather than less

May 1 2016,positive,note to dc comics this is how its done  watch this movie thoroughly and you might learn something  great entertainment
May 1 2016,positive,the second best picture of marvel studios
May 1 2016,positive,they shouldnt have called it civil war just civil disagreement when the only avenger to face death is a 90 year old shield agent you dont have a war they completely failed at using a great comic book title spidey black panther and downey jrs acting save this movie because the villains once again are forgettable and wasted this is slightly better than age of ultron but winter soldier was way better
May 1 2016,positive,captain america civil war may not have avengers in the title but the film is still able to have a huge group of characters and still have them shine while also providing the same thrilling story from winter soldier
May 1 2016,positive,there was no way more perfect and majestic to start phase three of marvel cinematic universe    this captain america civil war review contains some spoilers if you have not seen civil war film please do not read this could destroy it    a few years ago approximately five or six years marvel had in its hands one script and one proposal that possessed enough unknowns that project would receive the name of avengers the biggest concern for the owners of the company was supposed to make a film where not only a hero was the protagonist may break the story be boring and completely commercial two years later on may 4 2012 marvels the avengers landed in all movie theaters solving each and every one of those unknowns on just the first day at the box office today mayo 2016 civil war increases its number of participants to 12 heroes and 3 villains will this be the film event of the year i dont know i can only assure marvel has lost the fear and perhaps in the next few years its projects could reach total perfection avengers infinity war part1 or 2    based on the comic of 20062007 movie serves as a sequel to age of ultron and captain america the winter soldier after all the fighting and disaster in ultron the avengers return to discuss issues still more violent than in 2015 the death of innocents something very very similar to what we saw in bvs with superman and then say that they are polar opposites and the dilemma does our help really help    thaddeus thunderbolt ross william hurt reprising his role from the incredible hulk immediately ordered a conference to bring together to acclaimed heroes after showing the dramatic and terrible consequences of their actions it opens way for the culprit of this civil war sokovia accords established by the united nations that treaty aims to put each of the actions and missions of the avengers in the hands of the united nations for so take care of each human life taking into account that it will be them who decide if the heroes can act or not as expected not everyone agrees they needed something for fight here is their reason after discussions different thoughts ideologies and equations the decisions are made 36 hours two teams a objective an end and russo brothers civil war has begun    captain america iron man winter soldier falcon hawkeye black widow scarlet witch vision black panther spiderman war machine  and multiple villains  crossbones helmut zemo gen ross  transform to this in project biggest of the history cinematographic based on comics unquestionable film focuses more than in the avengers in steve rogers and bucky barne again like lokithor it is owned by cap this film the center of the chaos is bucky sign faithful of a love story between cap and him    i affirm with all security and respect that civil war has the best sequences of action of marvel films so far with sophisticated and perfect choreographies and training a true example and personally one of the best parts of the movie the fight at berlin airport the presentation of both sides literally made me cry its class its style its elegance and its  professionalism to mix and combine each of the specific abilities physical and emotional of the old and new heroes to create a scene of entertainment quality and long long fight makes that truly the public continues to support to marvel for continue curious fact directors david leitch and chad stahelski john wick are part of the second unit of the film     spiderman is the equivalent to wonder woman in civil war    special relevance has the presentation of spiderman and black panther their inclusion is appropiate the first is introduced in way more relaxed and comic who along with his fight and jokes makes this be the best performance in the peter parker story    another hero who had appointment was a black panther an heir to the throne full of hatred and pain perfect for his own movie and with a fresh and innovative appearance in addition other friends already seen previously are incorporate to the group as antman associating the world of past facts seen in the films with the present something that really strengthens and gives coherence to the marvel universe while many characters used this as a springboard for their own films spider man  black panther all boils down to the personal conflict revealed at the end between these three men it is something that goes beyond policies laws treaties or rules this is personal russo brothers take the decision after pleasing to the public with that magnificent fight they there will be no more effects flying planes cobwebs or cgi for that moment they weave meticulously a narrow path to focus on the three real protagonist of the story tony steve and bucky    and then arrive the final fight iron man vs captain america a dispute of friends the fact that bucky was defeated and they could fight each other was really fantastic this is not a trick more to win more money it is the destiny personally i felt like the final fight between batman and superman that anger but at the same time love that hate but at the same time forgiveness  it created a swirl of emotions and thoughts that ended in fatalism cw had all the unimaginable and even the enigmatic and traditional cameo appearance of stan lee    phase three has begun if marvel offers us more equal or better products that this will sound crazy but they could reach the level and love of critics and fans to star wars  goodbye to the cliche about marvel films are cheap fiction and paste sht quality exists civil war gives us a true contrast bvs but is just as tasty fruitful and exciting marvel best film so far plant bases strong and resistant to the future to come and let the brand to a more high for warner bros with suicide squad and fox and marvel new with xmen apocalypse in may and doctor strange in november
May 1 2016,positive,pretty good  i wasnt blown away by it and i have a few big problems with it but overall its a fun romp that kept my interest very well throughout      ive said this numerous times before but one of the main issues i have with superhero films is they always wreck entire cities no doubt causing countless civilian deaths in the process and knock down skyscrapers in a fashion that would make the 911 hijackers jealous and theres never any consequences  the heroes fuck everything up then they leave  ive always hated that in these movies because i cant just ignore the ridiculous destruction my fragile eyes were exposed to  in civil war the whole plot revolves around holding these people accountable to their actions which pleased me  however were marvel always going to go down this route or are they only acknowledging this because of thousands of moviegoers like me who always raise this issue  i saw batman v superman recently and its a very similar story there  although i think we all know dc only touched upon that because of negative backlash to the stupid and indulgent 911 city destruction scene in man of steel they definitely were never going to address it otherwise  so is that the same situation here  i dont know  either way i was happy my concerns were being heard and for the most part i think this plot was executed quite well      theres a lot of fun sequences here most notably the action scene at the airport where all the avengers get stuck into each other  it wasnt a dark and moody scene it was playful and humourous with some inventive set pieces such as antman turning into a 50 foot giant and spiderman tying his legs together to bring him down just like the atats in the empire strikes back which he also directly references as hes doing so that star wars purchase is really paying off eh  although speaking of antman i have no idea why he was in this film or what his personal motivation was  it seemed like they just wanted to shoehorn him in as a way of selfpromotion  i do like paul rudd a lot though and was pleased to see him but exactly why hes agreed to fight iron man with captain america isnt explained whatsoever  same goes for spiderman no motivation and clearly shoved into the film as a way of getting people ready to buy tickets for the next stand alone spidey reboot  again though they used him well and he was enjoyable to watch      one negative for me and its a negative for all these films i think the action looks so goofy  im almost certain the action scenes were sped up slightly here the characters movements didnt look natural at all  also how many times can they have someone getting punched into a wall  it really looks ridiculous to me and honestly i think the action was my least favourite part of the film and in all the others too  shoot me  this is especially annoying here because the final action scene of the movie actually has some emotional weight behind it yet instead of having a really gritty personal nonflashy altercation we have to see the characters do all that flippy shit still  it felt tonally wrong and really took away from the meaning of the conflict      lets talk about captain america as this is supposedly his film although it really isnt  hes engaged in a feud with iron man throughout most of the story and honestly i was on iron mans side all the way  i think the filmmakers had the intention of trying to make it difficult for the audience to pick a side and have their loyalties split but it was a very easy decision for me to choose iron mans team  i think the main reasons for this are 1 robert downey jr is just so charismatic in the role i find it impossible to dislike him and 2  captain america as a character is justwell boring  he is  they guy doesnt have any faults  hes so straight and narrow i cant get behind him  i need protagonists with flaws tony stark is an arrogant dick and he isnt superman  in fact iron man gets the shit kicked out of him  captain america may get a bloody nose here and there but i never feel like hes in any actual danger  give him a heroin addiction in the next one or something yeah      i also didnt like how the film ended with tony stark wistfully reading a letter from captain america and smiling ever so slightly as he does so when mr america spent the entirety of the film arguing and fighting him even going as far as protecting the man who murdered his parents because hes my friend  sorry but i wanted iron man to rip his fucking head off  i wasnt conflicted my loyalty wasnt split i was firmly in starks camp from the beginning to the end and to finish the film like that bugged me  but shit maybe im the only one who feels that way maybe the rest of you were actually conflicted who knows     overall definitely not without its problems mainly regarding tone and stupid goofy action when it isnt called for but its a fun time and wont outright offend you like batman v superman will  theres humour good character motivation for the most part and a reflective selfaware plot that i appreciated
May 1 2016,positive,lets get this out of the way right off the bat captain america civil war is everything batman v superman dawn of justice failed to be ignoring the blunt similarities between the two would be silly as civil war shares the exact same narrative beats as its 2016 rival but the former simply does it better from a filmmaking angle to a storytelling angle civil war is a well done superhero film instead of retelling the canon characters from the comic books by turning them into scowling ayn randian objectivists the russo brothers  anthony and joe  continue displaying their understanding and grasp of the characters theyve been tasked with handling delivering yet another solid entry into an otherwise overwhelming creatively stagnant marvel cinematic universe    that isnt to say civil war is a storytelling masterpiece because it isnt like every other mcu film civil war is formulaic and predictable for anyone with a functioning brain yet what sets it apart from the rest in the genre such as avengers age of ultron  and bvs  is how the nuance of the characters and impeccable direction raises it above mediocrity dealing with similar themes motivations and issues involving superheroes and the accountability of their actions civil war features equal clashes of personal belief and rhetoric with the usual nonstop face punching and destruction porn these films have come to lean on as story act segue crutches with a call to arms marketing campaign requesting fans to pick a team civil war handles the ambiguity of the winner better than how slanted it was in bvs pitting together major characters from the past twelve films  barring thor and bruce bannerthe hulk  into an actual fight rather than the easily forgotten squabbles in previous films    beyond several jarring scenes of shoddy cgi involving robert downey jrs face plastered over a computergenerated suit of armour set against a computergenerated green screen civil war is a technical achievement throwing around twelve superheroes against each other at the same time mixing the gritty handtohand martial arts choreography of captain america the winter soldier 2013 with the largerthanlife spectacle of an avengers film other than how it hits the brakes halfway through the film to veer off course in an attempt to shoehorn introduce a certain friendly neighbourhood webslinger tom holland and four minutes shorter than bvs with almost four times the number of major characters civil war in comparison is a marvel of a perfectly paced superhero film    spiritually adapting mark millars rather average core civil war storyline from the comic books and rather than mismanaging the progression of the story and characters in civil war the russo brothers creative choice in placing more emphasis on character moments  artificial and dramatic both aplenty for nearly each character  rather than composing disjointed perfect shots like visionary director xtreme zack snyder does in batman v superman is telltale of both the films overall quality and their caliber as filmmakers so much so that its embarrassing how much better a formulaic general audiencefriendly safe marvel film is than a feature film starring both the caped crusader and the man of steel for the first time in history
May 1 2016,neutral,captain americacivil war has everything weve come to expect from a good disneymarvel superhero movie in many ways it is a culmination of all the things marvel has learned works on audiences good action check a host of fun superheroes plus a some shiny new additions check great action set pieces check witty dialogue oneliners and jokes to make you laugh and ease tension check you get where im going with this cw reads like a checklist of disneymarvel movie traits and while it is is good and very enjoyable but doesnt truly bring anything new or unexpected to the table this lack of freshness keeps civil war from being a truly great film    black panther is the highlight of the film although he is a bit one note   spiderman although enjoyable was awkwardly shoved in to the proceedings so much so that he got sent off literally     the plot doesnt hold up under logical scrutiny tbh many character motivations are half baked and require a great suspension of disbelief in order to enjoy them     the airport scene is a well choreographed dance of super powers and is up there with the best avengers throw downs however you never once feel anyone is in danger cw is less civil war and more civil dispute     enjoyable time at the theatres but very formulaic and almost seemed like some scenes ripped off other hero v hero films weve seen recently  go in with tempered expectations and you should have a good time 
May 1 2016,positive,everything in this movie is just so perfectly handled we really could understand each teams motivation the introduction of spidey and black panther was so amazing
May 1 2016,positive,why the heroes fight i dont know its a full effects  fights movie but if you turn on your brain then you lose
May 1 2016,positive,its awesome 
May 1 2016,positive,civil war is not as thrilling as the winter soldier but it does bring some new characters perfectly despite it is overlong
May 1 2016,positive,at its heart this is a superhero movie about superhero conflict the strong characters and impressive action set pieces are built with genuine emotional depth if not perfect i found civil war thoroughly enjoyable
May 1 2016,positive,captain america civil war    good film though i may have just had my hopes way too high   a lot is done right like the action scenes and the dialogue filled scenes that fill the gap between them the acting from everyone was superb and the story was entertaining to see played out and the airport fight scene is absolutely fantastic    i feel that there were some weak parts to the film though  sometimes it felt like the dialogue heavy scenes were dragging on a bit whereas some scenes that could have been drawn out a little bit more were incredibly rushed   i wasnt a big fan of the ending i felt it was quite anticlimactic but again i had my hopes really high and was expecting a big cliffhanger that would maybe tease infinity war or another of the big installments in the mcu other than spider man of course     all around i feel this was a pretty good film better than ca the first avenger by far but not as good as ca the winter soldier in my honest opinion
May 1 2016,positive,fantastic moviewhere i live it came out on friday and i must say it is amazingthere are some problems but the dont change much to the storyspideyblack panther and giantman are the best partsspideys lines are perfectblack panther needs no origin story for his solo film because his origin is summed up here in about 20 minutesthe airport fight is incredibleand the midpost credits scenes are spot on and do well at what they need to dogo see this movie because it is simply fantastic and deserves the five stars i gave itspot on
May 1 2016,positive,okay could have been better
May 1 2016,positive,brilliant film a fantastic mix between action humour and drama both cap and tony make great points for both sides and its really the viewers choice to decide who to support tom holland is a funny nerdy and witty spiderman which is the best portrayal of the character we have seen as well as him being a very casual teenager not taking anything too seriously chadwick boseman portrays tchala excellently and you feel that is fued with the winter soldier to be very personal after what happened early on in the film the humour was directed excellently as there is no music in the background and it just seemed to be a one liner and the reaction of the actors characters seem very realistic the choreography was performed brilliantly as it felt thrilling and there was a variety of closeup shaky camera and also wide shots of the action as well captain america also clearly shows he did no miss a leg day at the gym the final battle does bring out a darker side to tony as she just doesnt care about what is happening anymore and he just wants to kill bucky and cap for a reason i shall not explain the 17 minute airport scene was unbelievable all the characters got their fair share screen time to show how their powers have progressed  however i think the cgi was a bit flat and rubbery on war machines iron mans suit and spidey at some points but overall the russo brothers have done an excellent job at this film i would give this film a low rated 4 and a half as i dont think it was as good as the winter soldier during the film the villain seemed underdeveloped as he doesnt say his reasoning for his actions until the end of the film during the film i was a bit disappointed that there wasnt another fight seen with black panther iron man cap and bucky teaming up against a group of 5 people who i will keep unknown and then all the avengers become friends again
May 1 2016,positive,a must see within a top 3 marvel movies iron man 1 avengers 1 and civil war
May 1 2016,positive,very good film
May 1 2016,positive,black panter is awesome but spider man stole the spotlight
May 1 2016,positive,good entertaining fun  suffers from too many heroes and is slow to start but it keeps the right balance of light hearted action and emotional stakes of the franchise  this is mostly thanks to the characters their individual reasons for being involved and their wellsuited actors  top notch special effects and exciting scenes abound but the story seems repetitive to the previous instalments at times
May 1 2016,positive,was expecting this at best to be disappointing with the last two being solid and at worst be a mess with all the characters involved and thankfully it was neither the cast is top notch with black panther being introduced who i wasnt familiar with but thoroughly enjoyed nonetheless and tom holland as spiderman really held his own was tentative about how he would go down but he impressed especially alongside all the other superheroes we already know the action was also stellar mixing in once again big spectacle and close hand to hand combat brilliantly something i find the captain america films to do better than other marvel entries and along with handling all the characters really well it deals with the themes really well too it is also highly entertaining funny and even though the characters do toil one another for screen time it isnt all that jarring for me it also didnt outstay its welcome for me some people have felt it to be too long and the score was as rousing as usual really really impressed
May 1 2016,positive,captain america civir war was the most awesome fun and thought provoking movie in the mcu ever
May 1 2016,positive,its a movie that wont let you go even for a split second i powered through my full bladder until the end credits
May 1 2016,positive,not exactly essential viewing and no real surprises but it is a solidly entertaining diversion
May 1 2016,positive,it is not likely they got the chance to learn from batman vs superman due to the fact theyve come out within a couple of weeks of each others despite that cap civil war got everything that was wrong with bsv right   except maybe for the villain as usual marvel failed yet again to build up a serious intimidating antagonist luckily the villain was not really the center of the plot but more of a means to build the real ideological conflict cap vs ironman   string this well motivated plotline with some of the best action youre going to see in a comicbook movie and cap civil war makes for a marvelous sorry blockbuster
May 1 2016,positive,definitely among the top tier of mcu which for me are cap 2 gotg and cw cant decide at the moment which i like best though all of them are perfect for me
May 1 2016,positive,a clever bold and satisfying culmination of 8 years of universe building   the russo brothers not only manage to juggle a large ensemble of characters with far more precision and passion than age of ultron but they also introduce several new characters some of whom are major players and still make it  a captain america movie the action sequences are a punchy mix of cgi spectacle and gritty grounded camerawork while some action scenes seem to try a little too hard to capture the raw intensity achieved in the winter soldier particularly with some of widows stunts the movie never strays too far into general action movie wilderness the plot though somewhat predictable at points ties together elements from the last 12 movies from marvel studios without feeling reliant on them the comedy we saw in age of ultron is still present here but vastly toned down and timed appropriately with deserving comic relief moments rather than continuous quips the introduction of two new heroes didnt feel shoehorned or forced im looking at you bvs and left enough room for both to go on and star in their individual movies to many fans the most significant aspect of this movie was the way it finally recognised the interconnected nature of the marvel cinematic universe much of the criticism of the winter soldier was regarding the apparent disappearance of iron man and the other avengers this movie managed to include even more characters than age of ultron but still feel grounded in terms of villains this movie didnt fall into the marvel villain trap and make a boring villain with motivations that werent clear the villain was not focused on too heavily and acted more as a shadow figure pulling the strings and ultimately causing the civil war in a way the villain wins in this movie setting this movie apart from all other marvel films to date a great setup for future films and a slick satisfying mesmerising culmination of events that started all the way back in 2008 with iron man
May 1 2016,positive,amazing film will see it again
May 1 2016,positive,end of the captain america story arc perhaps
May 1 2016,positive,captain america civil war is an amazing film that boasts a great story and great characters all of the heros are on top of their game particular highlights include tom holland as spiderman who steals every scene he was in and chadwick boseman as black panther the film explained every characters motivation which i enjoyed i loved how the story not only talked about the big conflict but how it developed the personal relationship between cap and bucky also the airport scene is the best scene ive ever seen in a superhero film the russo brothers directed the action very nicely and made it intense the villain in this film isnt amazing but he isnt as bad as people are saying he is he was solid but not spectacular overall this is my favorite film in the mcu and one of the best superhero movies of alltime
May 1 2016,positive,amazing movie probably the best marvel movie an incredible balance between comedy and action the introduction of spiderman and black panther is well presented and very pleasant a movie that begins and ends with action the action with all the heroes is one of the best and funniest action scenes ive ever seen it has a mass of characters but they all shine and get their spot the movie should make you feel satisfied and go home thinking about every single frame amazing
May 1 2016,positive,incredble action set pieces hardly a dull moment however the confusing menagerie of side characters shoehorned  in and weak villain lets it down a star
May 1 2016,positive,for me this is a thoroughly enjoyable movie
May 1 2016,positive,the movie is great its at same level as an avengers movie really cool i was enjoying it fully until guess what worst spiderman everrr andy garfield we miss you  this spiderman has no appeal as peter parker the costume is ugly and adds zero elemnts to the plot they could have included any other marvels character instead like wasp or spiderwoman but no they had to trash a previous saga that was going great to insert spiderman to the avengers another bad move by sony  with all and all the movie is neat and full of action i want to see it again its worth it kudos for black panther vision scarlett witch and falcon
May 1 2016,positive,the third film of steve rogers is a smart adaptation of one of the most important events of the modern era of marvel comics with a fully appropriate to its own universe own story including new characters that bring much to the table and spectacular action scenes expectations for phase 3 are high we hope not disappoint us im looking at you doctor strange
May 1 2016,positive,enthralling over the top action extension of the marvel world dont sit too close to the screen though hard to pick a fav character in this one
May 1 2016,neutral,youtubecomfilmgob    contains spoilers    political interference in the avengers activities causes a rift between former allies captain america and iron man politics rifts allies that basically sums up this take on civil war fairly well and replace war with selfish disputes theres little to sink your teeth into despite marketing omg are you team cap or team iron man the end result is team neither two and half hours of bravado and nobody dies oh except peggy carter she dies from old age shocking captain america civil war is not a captain america film fact early this week the russo bros let slip that they feel civil war was a reaction to warner bros announcing batman v superman and it shows feeling like just another product off the disney assembly line safe cookie cutter fluff considering you all tweet and post mcu related memes fan theories all year round there wasnt much point in rewatching previous marvel films before this release its everywhere we go wether we want it or not its not comic book movie fatigue im sick of this middle of the road stale marvel cinematic universe    i didnt have issues with the running time or pace at no point did the film drag i enjoyed the quiet moments that built some tension new characters are developed better spiderman black panther than others martin freeman but its typical marvel being safe and taking few risks so because of that i wont list every character and their performance because you know what to expect its more of the same for once marvel didnt con us with their trailers you get what they promised apart from seeing spiderman and giant man battling it out there are few surprises and most of whats on screen feels uninteresting    the amount of similarities with batman v superman are interesting opening with an incident in an african city camera panning up to a destroyed building with civilian deaths a chat between heroes that the world is talking and its not your fault bombing of a meeting where the future of our heroes is discussed a villain who manipulates events to force the heroes to fight and dead parents are mentioned    civil war looks more like a netflix movie with its washed out visuals and a generic almost non existent score that has no effort put into it outside of the airport battle although good in parts it felt like a training exercise than a war there isnt much to shout about why is that because theres no emotional depth weight or threat the opening fight in lagos involving crossbones and his henchmen was the russos once again trying to imitate bourne ending up more like gi joe with a touch of shaky cam and over editing right out of taken 3 a jarring visual experience that tries too hard to be exciting    one of the dumbest things nobody will pick up on or question because its such a fun movie right is tony stark asking a teenager whos only been spiderman for 6 months to help him fight one half of the avengers that also includes a wanted killer in the winter soldier sure it was great to see this peter parker young and indecisive interacting with tony stark but come on seriously is he really goinoh i forgot this is a fun movie i need to turn my brain off    the much hyped discussion for the past year or two has been whos going to die in civil war do you fanboys really think marvel is that bold to kill off any of their main characters there is no death for captain america like in the comic storyline how about bucky nope oh you thought maybe marvel would flip the script and kill tony stark wrong therefore the whole journey is rendered meaningless zemos plan of destroying an empire from within it worked for a few minutes i guess suddenly the death of starks parents is important after a zillion mcu films and bucky was responsible okay then after the dust has settled steve rogers sends a letter to apologise and explain his reasons to stark much like age of ultron ending in such a whimper a nice little package with a pretty ribbon on top    im 35 years old i grew up on comic books and movies like many kids in the early 90s i always imagined what would it be like to see my favourite superheroes on the big screen one day fast forward to today and thankfully i can say we all have bryan singers xmen 2 days of future past sam raimis spiderman 2 zack snyders man of steel joe johnstons captain america and many more these films surprised us cinematic yet straight out the comics familiar yet new after phase one i feel the mcu isnt matching the standards set marvel insist on pandering to general audiences with the movie equivalent of mcdonalds going into civil war i was ready to tune out the lame predictable humour but i was annoyed where the comic relief came from this time around quick antman wont have much screen time just shoehorn jokes that the mouth breathers will love make falcon say those lines was probably kevin feiges masterplan when i can predict what the next shotline is going to be and the audience is going to belly laugh while i sit there and cringe i need to admit defeat clearly these movies aren not targeted at me if you love cheesy jokes written for 5 year olds and fall for the wait for it wink wink approach to those scenes maybe its new to you or something and thats the form of entertainment you think is awesome    like i said earlier im 35 i dont have time to turn my brain off and lose brain cells faster than normal because marvel want to dumb down the comic book movie genre with borderline insulting efforts like this i expected more but all i got was avengers 25 civil bore
May 1 2016,positive,fr viewer every character is developped in a smart and accurate manner wich makes the clash between all these figures inevitable and at the same time joyful and painful prepare for twists revelations and heartbreaking scenes as well as incredible action scenes black panther and spiderman are the icing on an already pretty amazing cake
May 1 2016,positive,so glad that it managed to exceed expectations and be a great movie needed that
May 1 2016,positive,not a perfect movie but certainly comes very close to it it has a small amount of flaws that mainly revolve around the villain of the movie and his cause   it is packed with a lot of great characters but never for a second the movie feels too crowded the russo brothers did an excellent job keeping captain america in the center of the film  one of the most amazing marvel movies out there
May 1 2016,positive,for being a marvel movie is ok it should focus only on the civil war plot best possible spiderman
May 1 2016,positive,i left the theater with a smile i enjoyed seeing the characters in their glory with some excellent fights that managed to really showcase the powers of both cap and bucky better than previous iterations as a characterdriven film it was fantastic    on the other hand the hamfisted plot has far too many contrivances and whatif scenarios to ignore to be fair the original storyline included some of these overthetop contrivances but i believe there was plenty of room in this film for repair the movie is fun and enjoyable but dont think too long about the story or it could damage your enjoyment    i recommend the film overall as it is presented a fun comicbook blockbuster with a characterdriven angle that leaves you loving your favorites all the more
May 1 2016,positive,really looking forward to this and infinity war
May 1 2016,positive,from the first introductory to the second dark political thriller the russo brothers has surprised the audiences by transforming the entire tone of the series into a psychology based superhero film its a mini avengers reunion but more centralise on the conflicts between captain america winter soldier as well as iron man and with more grounds to cover both christopher markus and stephen mcfeely who have written the first two installments managed to ensure the wellpacing of the story without losing its sense of intentions continuing the epic traditional fighting sequences from previous episode the 13th outing of this mcu adventure offers a wide variety range of action scenes and it is evenly distributed among all the superheroes through efficient cinematography of switching without focusing much on gunshots smashing and explosions all characters are engaging thanks to the compelling character developments chris evans robert downey jr and sebastian stan deliver well as their roles respectively in term of resolving the challenge of their friendship test the other avengers perform outstanding too especially the brought in of spiderman back panther and antman have added more fun and joy which is entirely absent in dcs dawn of justice it is emotional inspiring and perfectly crafted implying that the actions chosen between the two main characters are not anything about right or wrong but more on perceptions and the outcomes while the captain america trilogy is not up to the dark knight trilogy masterpiece the decision to explore thoughtprovoking themes have made it one of the most impressive series in mcu
May 1 2016,positive,absolutely amazing film great acting bewildering effects stunning plot by far the best marvel movie ever brings back many other marvel characters from other movies the only thing to say is that you definitively should watch all the other marvel films to understand this one
May 1 2016,positive,overall it was a fun film and id see it again for the humor and spiderman which i never thought id say i wish the effort they provided to solidifying tony starks views and ideologies they provided the same for captain americas without asking people to recall upon the films of the past as something that fundamentally defines a character deserves to be shown juxtaposed to long scenes of air traffic control towers falling the consequences of the film felt empty and thus the stakes never really felt that high despite all this it was a tight enjoyable film that faltered under the weight of its own story captain americas ideals seem justified now more than ever with recent events of soap prism and a growing policy push for more governmental control but it deserves more than a sentence sometimes newer things dont make them better just like social values which are and should be critiqued equally maybe it demands an essay but equally avoids it captain america civil war is a subtly thought provoking film that chooses not to be substantive rather it is decisively enjoyable fun loving and largely entertaining to watch
May 1 2016,positive,marvel movie funny but it turns out is a copy of batman v superman and hubi a frustrated attempt to improve the script in complicated situations
May 1 2016,positive,captain america civil war was an enjoyable movie however hailing it as  the best marvel movie seems like a disservice to previous ones  as does calling it the pinnacle of interlacing various superheroes in one movie or even the best deep superhero movie superhero movie with character development whatever you want to call it    one of its missteps is indeed is its pursuit of all of the above as well as aiming to be funny and visually pretty this may be all in all genuinely impossible which is where civil war falls     warning some spoilers ahead    the russo brothers trusted on their experience of working on shows such as arrested development or community where one has to jungle multiple storylines of multiple characters and have by the end of an episode moved them to a place which suggests the slightest of personal growths in captain america civil war there is an abundance of personal growth of characters the masses are used to seeing prominently blow up stuff usually smug and arrogant tony stark battles with his conscience going deeper than he has before in terms of selfreflection about the actions he and his team or family are in any way responsible for elizabeth olsons wanda maximoff deals with the aftermath of her powers  learning about her strengths as well as her weaknesses while trying to accept the well known need to break a few eggs when trying to make an omelette the vision starts acknowledging and trying to manage  his new found humanity and everything it obtains sebastian stans best performance in the mcu yet sees his bucky barnes trying to come to terms with the fact that his body and his mind have been stolen to him that he spent seventy years being violated by a group of people with terrible fake russian accents and sent on a killing spree around the world  you get the picture    theres too many characters in captain america civil war for me to describe the growth of each one without boring anyone reading this to death or giving away spoilers theres also multiple new ones being introduced and i tip my hat off to the team behind this movie for using tom hollands peter parker and paul rudds antman as the sources of comic relief because their one line zingers or multiple line zingers in the case of spiderman who talks more during the large battle montage than the audiences are used to much to the delight of people in the cinema around me who were laughing out loud are written in a way which does a good job of capturing the core of the characters as weve known them from before this is all done exceptionally well especially given the fact that it is a super hero movie where one is more used to long panning action scenes than the personal growth of men and women stuffed into spandex    however my main disappointment in the movie comes from steve rogers it is most certainly not with the way chris evans has portrayed him because we have been truly lucky to see his impressively wide shoulders carry the persona of americas greatest hero with true authenticity and integrity this movie is meant to see him follow his heart instead of his head the ultimate peoples person finally doing something for himself and in a way we do with steve unwilling to sign the sokovia accords meant to pacify the avengers after their recent misshapes in order to go find his best friend forever james buchanan barnes and this is where my problem lies  i genuinely thought that the russos along with marvel and disney and anyone else responsible for the movie  would finally bite the bullet and give the fans what they wanted    because there is a reason behind the multiple photomontages playlists works of fan fiction drawings and embroidery and literally anything else that you can think of which is based on the morethanjustfriendly relationship between sergeant barnes and captain rogers here you have two men who grew up together who cared for each other barnes protecting and saving rogers minuscule behind in fights during preserum days here are men who fought in war together whos sense of brotherhood and loyalty is unquestionable and exceptional two men who have finally found each other after seventy years of not being fully autonomous what a nice friendship you might say discretely trying to wipe a stray tear from the corner of your eye how good that they have each other poor souls and indeed their bond is the glue in the movie the string trying to tie together all the tidbits and scenes provided by the russos however their bond could be easily seen to be something more than pure heterosexual brotherhood  barnes is the man captain america stormed into a nazi camp for in what was possibly the most suicideesque mission ever steven rogers face and voice on the other hand were enough to break seventy years worth of torture mind control and memory manipulation because it was the gloriously panned out scene at the end of captain america the winter solider which ignited a spark of recollection in the otherwise fully indoctrinated barnes    and tell me that thats not something more than platonic my disappointment lies here  the team behind this movie had the perfect opportunity to show the audiences a heart wrenching love story which would pan from hiding or pining in pre wwii brooklyn to the battlefields of the allied front to nazi camps from russia to dc to siberia to everywhere and anywhere else the ultimate love story one about loyalty and trust and pain is that not what superhero movie are always partially about think of the boxoffice champion deadpool and how wade wilsons motivations and feelings rotate mainly around his love for vanessa the snarky stripper hes fallen in love with and promised to protect yes there mightve been a lot of innuendos and dirty jokes in the movie as well but deadpool rests predominantly around his love and devotion    why i ask couldnt captain america civil war do the same the previously mentioned deadpool brought the first seemingly nonstraight superhero with wade wilson apparently identifying as pansexual and yet the only sign of his diversion from heterosexuality may be found in the closing credits where a cartoon deadpool humps a cartoon unicorn i demand more in the 21st century superheroes should be able to get with the program of civil rights movements and gradual change within society and its great that were getting more superheroes who are not male or white but how about we get one that isnt straight    instead of doing this the russos follow the amazing hear the sarcasm tradition set by joss whedon of clumsily shoving romantic subplots into the movie due to the sheer lack fo time or space or ideas to possibly occupy the characters in between shots of the characters fighting with something else this can be seen manifested as the terrible idea of shoving the black widow onto the hulk in avengers age of ultron as her romantic interest from 2012s avengers was suddenly given a family and a wife im guessing this was done in order to give jeremy renners clint barton something to do in his downtime thus steve rogers was paired with sharon carter yes there is a relation to his wartime sweetheart in what was sold as an unexpected romance this gives ms carter a sort of subplot which makes it seem like she actually does something in the movie other than look pretty a modern day bond girl if you will    many reviews i have read are critical of the visual aspect of movie but in following the tradition set by the previous captain america movies the aesthetic appeal comes from shots of the movies protagonist flexing as well as from colour coordinated leather jackets rather than the kind of action sequels that made audiences fall in love with the first avengers movie this can be forgiven as it seems to be that the movie chose to follow the previous captain america movies with putting value into emotional substance rather than exposions and it must be said that the idea of joss whedon managing bucky barnes ptsd with as much sensitivity as he did natasha romanoffs sterilisation another great example of how not to try to further a characters development is a scary one indeed    despite being funny it is no where near deadpools league the action shots fall short of the standards set in avengers and the character growth is not as immaculately handled and tied up as audiences are used to from the previous captain america movies it is a wonderful take at managing multiple figures and their own storylines while having multiple action sequences and bad goys captain america civil war manages to be wonderful in many aspects but its gunholding villainpunching fingers never quite manage to grasp the supremacy which was within its reach
May 1 2016,positive,emotional and heartbreaking russo brothers made the captain america from a comicbook figure into a great soldier onscree with humanity and telling the story between him and tony stark  unlike other films it has shaped him into an iconic figure with the great showdown in the airport is definitely the best part of the film with the tease of spiderman and black panther it tries its best to develop phase 3 of the marvel cinematic universe cant wait to watch the following marvel film avengers infinity war coming to 2018 hopefully russo brothers will make another film franchise the greatest comic book movie ever made in the moving pictures industry
May 1 2016,positive,marvel studios have done it yet again just when they appeared to be running out of steam after age of ultron and antman sat comfortably in the middle of the mcu canon they strike back with this enormously entertaining seriesbooster essentially avengers 25 this movie is crowded with so many wellknown characters its a miracle its a movie at all let alone a coherent and consistently exhilarating one when the end credits roll theres disappointment rather than relief unlike other recent superhero vs superhero efforts the plot mechanics dont completely hold up under scrutiny  especially the antagonists scheme  but it is the pitchperfect character interaction that propels the story in between the multitude of kickarse action sequences and what kickarse action sequences they are bookended with an impressively gritty bourneesque set piece and a seriously personal and intense punch up each battle is cleverly given its own spin to avoid feeling repetitive nothing tops the truly remarkable showdown amongst superhero friends though with everyone fighting everyone a webslinging newbie stealing the show and a huge surprise it confidently challenges the new york alien beatdown for mcus greatest set piece it doesnt quite reach guardians levels of humour but theres a wonderful levity maintained throughout and the quipfilled dialogue is often laughoutloud funny strongly aided by the rocksolid cast both familiar and new picking a standout amongst such an electrifyingly diverse group of players is impossible series regulars  cap evans iron man rdj black widow scarjo et al  are always excellent whilst newcomers black panther chadwick boseman and spiderman tom holland are both downright awesome somehow fresh despite having a dozen films come before it in the mcu civil war is a nearperfect popcorn flick that galvanises enthusiasm for the upcoming onslaught of marvel adventures
May 1 2016,positive,this totally removes the bad aftertaste of the second averngers movie
May 1 2016,positive,great stuff the best of the mcu tackles the idea of accountability well while also providing sufficient character development and stakes
May 1 2016,positive,watched it twice really spectacular all the characters were greatly introduced storyline is unexpected with lots of twist recommended
May 1 2016,positive,i found a bit tired of nonstop action for a two and half hour film
May 1 2016,positive,im so going to watch it again
May 1 2016,positive,slow to start but still worth it
May 1 2016,positive,its a superhero film with a heart and soul
May 1 2016,positive,never believed the hype anyway mostly meh and okay similar to ultron it was that bad dont know what the critics see in this and what are they smokin highlight was the newish heroes in this group spidey antman and black panther probably wouldve been more emotional and dramatic if they followed the comics more and killed off steve rogers in the end
May 1 2016,positive,personally my new favorite marvel movie it had the perfect balance of fun action and drama it was suspenseful enough for the first watch and entertaining enough for me to watch again the dc cinematic universe needs to learn how to balance itself with this one
May 1 2016,positive,the final battle between cap stark and bucky was so hard to watch but antman was funny and spidey and black panther were good get well soon rhodey
May 1 2016,positive,lives up to the hype
May 1 2016,positive,amazing simply amazing that a movie like this can exist in this day and age especially after how many people said it could never be done sure the avengers pulled of the improbable but this film finally pulls off the impossible a full breathing living comic book world that doesnt feel like a comic book it feels like real life and that after all is what it should be at this pointevery character treated with such respect and nuance not as comic books superheroes but real people with real believable motives in a world that feels real take note competitors and imitatorsthis is how its done
May 1 2016,positive,take the best part of the captain america films and combine that with the best part of the avengers with a few new additions including the best spiderman to date and you get this very enjoyable third installment of the captain america series  this is also the best yet with near enough nonstop action
May 1 2016,positive,the best marvel movie yet
May 1 2016,positive,a little slow at the beginning and only became enjoyable when spiderman was introduced and the action started in earnest much better than age of ultron at mixing all the characters together enjoyed antmans return to the screen as it brought some humour to what was a boring first half of the film
May 1 2016,positive,the best super hero movie in this moment
Apr 30 2016,positive,a good genre film this film had some very good ideas in the screenplay it some genuinely humourous and witty dialogue however the humour sometimes was badly timed and effected the dramatic tension it also made spiderman an annoying character generally fine on the acting front and technically a treat of visual effects however the music and cinematography wasnt standout a flawed film which has some great potential but lesser in terms of execution
Apr 30 2016,negative,too long some moments are so boring the comedy in the movie is awful
Apr 30 2016,positive,russo brothers all the way great movie and im glad that russo brothers will direct the infinity war part 1 and 2 i love the twist and i love how they team up i dont pick side cause i understand the point of view of captain america and ironman and that is what i like about this movie the directors and writers clearly shows what team cap and team ironman point of view is why they are against to each other one thing i hate about this movie is the reason behind all of this
Apr 30 2016,positive,best superero film to date the plot was amazing so was the cast and spidey
Apr 30 2016,positive,first if youre a nerd and you cant take it on its own merits dont bother even casual comic aficionados will raise an eyebrow at marvels civil war being turned into more of a petty squabble and if it does have a weak point its definitely that the convoluted scheme setting the plot into motion just doesnt stack up if you think about it too much which you probably shouldnt  that aside this entry more than keeps the franchiverse chugging along nicely  carrying on with the espionage theme of winter soldier pretty much the only reason this is a capn movie rather than an avengers movie the action sequences this time are more bond than bourne and all the better for it  most viewers biggest fear  what the hell happens when you pile on so many characters at once  turns out to be a nonissue the sprawling ensemble cast serves the story and the shifting allegiances and alliances in what is essentially a deadly game of office politics never feel less than real  the weight of numbers means that you get just enough but no more of some of the more traditionally useless members of the ensemble ahem jeremy renner and don cheadle and youre constantly surprised by where the film focuses its attention next  between the debut of the kickarse chadwick boseman and elizabeth olsens full throttle return this one also leaves you with something age of ultron didnt accomplish  confidence that marvel can go next generation without all interest disappearing when the current principle cast does
Apr 30 2016,positive,good spidey  bad cant think of anything just start using sebastian stan more hes a great actor  awesome job  main fight scene was great cant wait for spidey solo film
Apr 30 2016,positive,it was great everything i was expecting and more
Apr 30 2016,positive,it was good the fights and the new super heroes wish the story was better
Apr 30 2016,positive,briliantly crafted storyline that satisfies both sides no matter what philosophy you stand for
Apr 30 2016,positive,captain america civilwar delivers everything you hoped and dreamed for
Apr 30 2016,positive,the best movie of the mcu so far
Apr 30 2016,positive,captain america civil war  action 10 out of 10 great choreography punching and kicking felt so real law of physic is applied  cgi 8 out of 10 everything looks superb except for ironman with helmet off awful tho  story 9 out of 10 so good everything is explained and given time to digest i can understand everyone point of view and there is no right or wrong in choosing the sideunlike bvs  new character choice 10 out of 10 black panther spiderman ant man enuf said  actor 9 out of 10 everyone is doing a great job im looking forward to new black panther and spiderman movie  overall 9 out of 10
Apr 30 2016,positive,that might be the best comic book   super hero movie ever  the best on screen spiderman to date
Apr 30 2016,positive,this superheroes film gives you what you were waiting for action explosions destruction special effects
Apr 30 2016,positive,best superhero movie ever
Apr 30 2016,positive,overall grade a 98  notes marvel cinematic universes phase three is off to a marvellous start
Apr 30 2016,positive,awesomeness overload delivers on all promises although a bit longd and a lilttle slow in the first act  it executes its overall story with depth action and well timed humour and entertainment  best superhero movie to date  pretty easily other comic book studios cough dc need to take serious notes
Apr 30 2016,positive,i could watch this all day the russo brothers delivered the best marvel to date with the winter soldier and now theyve done it again captain america civil war is yet another fantastic political thrillersuperhero action movie somehow they managed to give each member of such a great large ensemble cast their time to shine while weaving together a strong thoughtprovoking plot that is likely to have you shifting back and forth from one side to the other spiderman and black panther steal every scene they are in they are amazing but the heart and soul of this film is still cap and his relationship to bucky as it should be the villain is a bit forgettableunnecessary but that doesnt really matter at all the epic action scene the movie builds to is unforgettable and probably the greatest ever put on screen i loved this movie to death and can not wait to see it again  a
Apr 30 2016,positive,marvel have found the perfect balance of fast witty action and gritty drama nothing but praise here
Apr 30 2016,positive,this movie is settingup the next franchise installments  proficient at what it does but by its nature ultimately unsatisfying
Apr 30 2016,negative,this movie is actually awful how has it rated so well    i thought about leaving the movie character motivations in this movie are ridiculous
Apr 30 2016,neutral,thought i was going to see a captain america movie not a ironman film in all the film was ok group fight scene was best of the film antman and spiderman added in the humour
Apr 30 2016,positive,captain america civil war is a little bit messy with its complex narrative and weak villain but it is still one of marvels greatest movies showcasing so many heroes on screen that it almost instantly makes you forget some of the flaws it has the airport fight scene is one of the best superhero fight scenes i have ever seen and spiderman is absolutely perfect in every way 45 stars
Apr 30 2016,positive,great result after removing several character from the comic book origin
Apr 30 2016,positive,455 teambiceps teamcap
Apr 30 2016,positive,another perfect movie setting the new standards of greatness as usual for all marvel movies      i didnt approve of the new spiderman actor thou  he is trying to act like the old spiderman and its terrible  why didnt they get the original peter parker actor from the last spider man movie or let the actor act a little bit normalhimself  just to clarify im talking about the 2007 spider man 3 tobey maguire actor as spider man  this new guy was doing a terrible job pretending to be tobey and failing hard  he should have just been himself
Apr 30 2016,positive,the marvel cinematic universe returns with its first film of phase 3 a film that had large shoes to fill due to the significance of the story arc it is based on thankfully the film subverts expectations with a thoughtprovoking story that has much more depth and many more layers than other films of the genre while keeping up the pace with excellent action scenes top notch acting from most of the cast and perfect implementation of the individual powers of each superhero and the personalities behind each character the film provides a conflict for the viewer as to which side is the side they will root for and this conflict is felt by the viewer as the movie constantly shows the pros and cons of each side keeping you as uncertain as the characters on the screen the film is not ashamed to lose itself in its goofiness and these are some of the most fantastical fight scenes yet in the series overall civil war may well be the best film yet in the marvel cinematic universe
Apr 30 2016,positive,i live in brazil and i went to the wordpremier wednesday at midnight i was showing at shops of eldorado in several screens and all were mostly or completely sold out    spiderman adaptation is through back to his origin and with iron man seeking him out he is great in the movie and so is antman the other origin short in the movie of course is black panther the movie is right there with all the avengers movies action cinematography and the best effects in the industry    what we all expect and much more well worth going our of your way for and spending your hard earned  to sell
Apr 30 2016,neutral,the action moments and the special effects are as alway flawless in this movie but by this stage we expect no less however the story is dull the movie is unnecessary long and the ideology of it all is so kinder garden way to many plot wholes
Apr 30 2016,positive,i think its hard not to compare this to batman v superman firstly because they both have very similar plots and they both involve heroes fighting each other however this movie was done 10 times better matter of fact its a must see specially the airport fight scene alone and a giant surprise     ive loved every captain america movie so far and it must be said that this movie felt more like an avengers film rather than a captain america film the main thing that connects it to captain america film is the winter soldier who im a big fan of in this film as the victim in a way     everything about this film was fun and interesting but nothing more than spiderman who they have finally made perfectly his scenes were just too good i think civil war has raised the bar high now for the next marvel films good luck dr strange
Apr 30 2016,positive,the best mcu movie a lot of good characters awesome action scenes and maybe the best scene in a superhero movie
Apr 30 2016,positive,one of the best superhero movies ive ever seen
Apr 30 2016,positive,great movie this an avengers movie in addition to a captain america movie the context is all encompassing to truly understand the context and content you really needed to have seen multiple other marvel movies the previous two captain america movies the two previous  avenger movies antman and the first 3 iron man movies having all that safely tucked that away in your cerebral cortex you are plunged into a rollicking journey of amazing visuals and amazing stunts  the effectiveness of the interesting story is enhanced by looking a the internal personal lives of two of the character particularly captain america and iron man the film is brilliant but this what you have come to expect from marvel the amazing action scenes are interspersed with humanity and humour so if you having seen the earlier movies if you can dust off the dvd player and watch all the movies mentioned earlier so you can really enjoy and understand this movie almost 2 and half hours of riveting enjoyment
Apr 30 2016,negative,saw this movie earlier this evening what a disappointment the introduction of spiderman and black panther feel forced to make bucky relevant he killed tone starks parents if you have money to waste go see it if not stay home
Apr 30 2016,neutral,the film is like kids fighting in school i didnt feel that the film has a deep dimension
Apr 30 2016,positive,great watching and amazing story telling
Apr 30 2016,positive,quite possibly the best film in the marvel cinematic universe the action is solid the characters are well written and the story is thought provoking and interesting enough to keep its viewers interested throughout the entire runtime
Apr 30 2016,positive,a huge improvement on age of ultron but caps previous solo outing is superior in every way the strengths of this film lay in the interactions and conflict between the characters and tony hasnt been this likeable since the first iron man this is also a great introduction to the new and best spiderman and black panther
Apr 30 2016,positive,gripping with high voltage action and surely the best written marvel flick
Apr 30 2016,positive,great stuff thoroughly enjoyable and hard to fault black panther in particular was spectacular and i cant wait to see it again
Apr 30 2016,neutral,its overall a decent movie jokes were thrown in places which dont need them making it less serious and less engaging guy its civil war not a sparring match pacing is a bit slow conversation was not as engaging villian motivation was good but execution was kinda poor plot was really carried out by chance and luck the movie only gets better by the 3rd act in fact u can skip the first 2 act and still get the 3rd act that is how irrelevant the first 2 act were the airport scene was not as great as everybody say it was airport scene  the star wars prequel lightsaber fight which is full of flare and stuns there was no real stake involved during that fight the fight we see in the end of the trailer involving bucky cap and ironman was great filled with raw emotion and stake involved   the final ending scene was just a turn off after what i deem as a very engaging emotional act 3 i will just leave it there   problem for me was how the film doesnt feel like a captain america film or an avenger film title this movie iron man civil war  people cannot disagree it more of a struggle in tony stark not captain america  iron man has become what wolverine was in x123 where story is revolving mostly around wolverine same goes to civil war where story does not revolve around steve instead it revolve around tony    spiderman was great but he was really shoehorned in he wasnt needed that at all but still it was great to see him    surprising how black panther was shockingly good in this film
Apr 30 2016,positive,im not really a massive fan of epic blockbuster superhero movies but perhaps i can make an exception since tom holland and paul rudd are in the house and the amazing stan lee made an appearance too stank    the story was mainly about two opposing teams led by steve on one side and tony on the other each group had a different point of view when it came to saving the world it started when a mission was recklessly carried which led to the necessity of the governments involvement after seeing the aftermaths of their actions the characters heroes had somehow formed a dramatic incompatibility of opinions resulting from their disagreements on what they believed was more humane    the russos did it again they had somehow managed to make the film so carefully exceptional so as not to fail any related installment that may have any connection to the movie  to maintain that compelling impression intact the sound and visual effects were a perfected craft of genius and creativity each superhero was highlighted with importance deliberately thought out through the writers had also kept that deftly fun light mood that most marvel movies have and almost all dc movies lack its simply an outstanding film with remarkable scenes that would leave you on the edge of your seat with eyes fixated only at the screen and an oshaped ajar mouth    the muchawaited entrance of the amazing spiderman really had made the movie more exciting than before during the casting i could really tell that tom had it in him what with his highly impressive stunt videos on instragram and his geeky charming talent that earned him awards from the impossible film such a dreamboat ling    its a truly successful actionpacked thriller with an emotional coherence that has surpassed everyones expectations i think
Apr 30 2016,positive,a well put together film with fan favourite moments and thrilling action one of marvels best films so far
Apr 30 2016,positive,the best marvel movie so far
Apr 30 2016,positive,simply put captain america civil war is the best marvel film to date combining the grit of the espionage twinged winter soldier with the balls to the wall colourful fun of avengers assemble the russo brothers have crafted marvels most mature well rounded and fun movie in their vast amassing catalogue chris evans 5th outing as captain america in his 3rd solo movie is by far his best performance and ties up the trilogy in a nice succinct way that is thematically satisfying too robert downey jr of course is perfect in what almost feels like his tailored made role as iron man however we have never seen stark so despondent and out of his element which adds an interesting twist to his otherwise 247 quirky personality but thats not all  civil war is filled to its boots with heroes hawkeye black panther black widow etc etc etc where everyone is given ample amount of time and serve every scene theyre in to the letter for example while i wasnt particularly keen on antmans solo movie as a whole paul rudd shines whenever he is on screen and provides some of the biggest laughs in the entire picture in what feels like a largely improvised performance however without giving too much away  i gotta say  tom hollands spiderman in the limited time he appears in the runtime is the most fun spiderman has been on screen in years quippy nerdy and just completely lovely hollands performance and take on the character makes me thoroughly excited to see him in his future solo outing i cant believe im excited for another new spiderman movie the pace is quick and choppy however the film never tends to feel messy and for me the 2hr and 26minute run positively flew by with all the fun of seeing heroes duke it out on screen the film never feels jarring when its juxtaposed with the espionage twistbased nature of the plot im just lbubnfjbfbdvfjd still gathering my thoughts but all i know is i want to see it again like right now so yeah get to fuck and go see it
Apr 30 2016,positive,good action  captain america vs iron man  right vs ego  all characters from the past avengers but new pop ins       ant man  brilliant in as he rips apart iron mans suit and then turns big which causes some funny fight parts     spider man  boy pops in     basic story line which creates turmoil with the avengers team     will be good to see what happens when thor arrives back
Apr 30 2016,positive,captain america civil war is the best movie from marvel i enjoyed every minute
Apr 30 2016,positive,wow wow wow all i can say is we have finally found our spiderman
Apr 30 2016,positive,this was a fantastic movie with great action and enough character building time with all the superheroes you can understand both sides and tony isnt portrayed as a villain like he was in the comics it is natural to change your opinions again and again on their argument throughout the movie the final act of the movie was emotionally gutwrenching and was the best part black panther and spidey had great introductions and robert downey jr gave his best film performance yet
Apr 30 2016,negative,first marvel movie that i dont like lots of drama good ppl die none of the guilty avengers
Apr 30 2016,negative,worst marvel movie in a while opening scenes okay then bored the shit out me for the next hour and a bit then battle between captain his pals and ironman and his pals spidermans a wee fanny boy playing him ffs whered you find him a nursery and he was absolute shit     watched avengers based movies multiple times this one seen it once thatl do another best bits in trailer movie
Apr 30 2016,positive,not my taste of movies and im not a fan of comics whatsoever but its very well made and contains an interesting plot nice twists also
Apr 30 2016,positive,ono more time nobody dies
Apr 30 2016,positive,overall i liked it but it was a bit disappointing it some areas there are good points like the new spiderman black panther  the big fight scene at the airport which is spectacular the film doesnt take many risks which is a bit disappointing considering the story if is based off the plot is a bit weak as a result  the villains are again very forgettable  largely pointless 35 out 5
Apr 30 2016,positive,great fun strong movie the best in the mcu for someone who thought the avengers where just fine and age of ultron was pretty much the same this is the perfect avengers movie plus it is a great story
Apr 30 2016,positive,most of the action scenes which drive the plot along felt quite inconsequential and failed to tug at any emotions at all the sequences are mostly spectacular but they never pose enough danger to characters for the audience to feel that they might just get hurt or die and oh there is over use of shakey cam for the punch em up scenes     maybe cinema is just over saturated with superhero movies currently for captain america civil war felt really boring the run time of two and half hours actually felt much longer than that    at least the plothole riddened bvs still somewhat tugged at raw emotions when people around the main characters die due to stupid decisions made by them   there is much talk about people getting hurt by the avengers in this movie but there is just a lack of emotional hit despite it being the cause of the storys theme    there is a huge plus point in civil war and thats the reintroduction of a school boy peter parker as spiderman his appearances offered much joy
Apr 30 2016,positive,with an agenda that transcends far beyond the juvenility of it all captain america civil war may actually be the best film of the bunch to date which also propels captain america to veer front of the marvel studios franchise
Apr 30 2016,positive,spoiler review  it finally came the film weve all been waiting for captain america civil war in this film the avengers get questioned by the world whether they should quit their jobs as the avengers or stay at the same time bucky barnes the winter soldier comes to captain america for help being a wanted vigilante and a civil war happens when the avengers fight for different rights when they realize that theyre being manipulated by helmut zemo a captain america comic book villain they bring him to prison before this movie i watched batman versus superman dawn of justice and i realized that the plot of both films almost exactly the same the premise is that the world is scared of the heroes because they destroy cities while fighting villains and that makes them question each other and start fighting each other but then they realize that theyre being manipulated by a smart psychopath and turn on him there are lots of superheroes in this movie the main characters are captain america and iron man captain americas shield strength was changed from being able to with stand the power of being hit with a hammer from a god to getting knocked back 20 meters from a metal fisted punch to going back to being able to with stand anything and not getting knocked back iron man in this movie had his powers nerfed to be overpowered by captain america while they where fighting the winter soldier was badass as usually but his metal arm changed strength over time as well the black panther appeared in this movie too to avenge the death of his father by trying to murder who he thinks is the killer bucky barnes but his characters motivation falls apart when he randomly joins the iron man team spider man ant man and hawkeye appear for an awesome and somewhat funny fight scene in middle which is probably the best part of this movie the handtohand combat in this movie was pretty hard to follow but still awesome and great as usually personally i wish there had been more of crossbows character as he was killed in the first fight because hes like the coolest looking villain since i dont know ever i walked into this movie thinking that the main villain would be crossbow but actually hes not and its baron zemos son helmut overall   captain america civil war doesnt disappoint in the action and stunts factor being great and adding humor thats sometimes cheesy but usually funny in the fights that break but the nerfing of weapons its lack of motivation and over long and sometimes boring 2 hours 30 minutes makes for a film with flaws
Apr 30 2016,positive,does what the entertainment industry intended it entertained wow just a very very  very good movie one i will watch more then a few of times
Apr 30 2016,positive,one of the best superhero movie ever made thats for sure its got everything  politics heart fights relationships humour drama and it makes you think in the best way
Apr 30 2016,positive,honestly i think this is the not only the best superhero movie i have ever watched but the best most entertaining movie i have ever watched whilst the story and narrative of the characters is no less than incredible i found the action to be the outstanding factor of this movie i had outlandishly high expectations for the 15 minute airport fight scene and the movie surpassed even those spiderman was no less than perfect i wont spoil his role in the movie so that is all i will say my only gripe with the movie is that whilst the villains end goal is cool to see his journey towards it isnt as interesting as the capiron man conflict the reason i believe this movie hasnt gotten a full 100 is because of the growing dcmarvel fan wars
Apr 30 2016,positive,that was good more like this please
Apr 30 2016,positive,great action set pieces and awesome fight scenes marred by a script that can be bogged down by some overlong and sometimes unnecessary talky scenes over all id put this is in the very good category of the mcu  on a side note antman and spiderman steal the show in the major smackdown im really hoping sony dont mess up webheads next solo film i hope they learn their lesson that too many villains spoil the broth
Apr 30 2016,positive,black widows a bitch and steve rogers a moron
Apr 30 2016,positive,is captain america civil war perfect     approaching perfection but not perfection is how i will describe it upon second viewing it is a film that is humorous exhilarating fun but still full of emotional weight it is a film that has impeccable action sequences and beautiful cgi a film that outruns the avengers age of ultron by far and is just as awesome as the second instalment of the captain america trilogy  the winter soldier     hey but what about the plot conveniences     true there are indeed plot conveniences and traces of the film makers making things happen instead of dragging out plot points logically this was indeed a flaw because truly good movies are often based on reallife sense however the difference between a movie and real life is that in a movie the unreasonable components of the plot can be tucked away in a well paced well cut film this is exactly what happened in captain america civil war the russo brothers knew how to cut the film so that tension is maintained throughout and the story never breaks all the pieces of the plot are strung together and played out step by step joining together like a jigsaw puzzle to form a big picture by making the big picture well constructed and well paced the existence of plot conveniences didnt bring the whole film down though more logical links and less plot convenience will certainly make this a better movie     youve got to admit the villain is bad though right      certainly just like the majority of other mcu villains zemo was a mediocre villain at best and a huge plot convenience at worst his plans to turn the heroes against each other was a clever one but his methods of succeeding in such a convoluted plan was never explained maybe the film did not need the villain and the civil war could happen because of iron man and captain americas difference in opinions that worked int he comics that should also work here however i do think having the villain in the movie added to certain aspects of the civil war putting the heavy fact of tonys parents death into the last fight giving it emotional weight and higher stakes     and the no stakes civil war     many people believe that disney owned projects are trying too hard to appeal to the family and put no real stakes into their movies in case it upsets the eight year old boys who is a diehard captain america fan people accuse marvel for not having enough guts to kill off or even disable characters permanently however i would argue that marvel films so far has struck a good balance between family friendly and high stakes comic book fans will know that no hero stays dead whole runs are often dedicated to superheroes coming back to life nobody ever says there are no stakes in all comic books every right why because comic books dont need reversible deaths to have stakes the stakes lies in the emotional connection between friends lovers and family as disney movies need to be family friendly and superheroes shouldnt die marvel films worked on making the emotional stakes high in civil war the emotional stakes are very high as the ideological differences build to a peak only to encounter a personal matter that completely derails tony stark the pain constant in tonys eyes was portrayed perfectly by robert downey jr other characters such as black panther were given great personal arcs too these character moments are what gives marvel movie emotional weight as well as fun for a person who is invested in the mcu this movies stakes is incredibly high due to my value in the friendship between the avengers     isnt it just poor film making like every other superhero film     a defiant no superhero movies are not godfather or citizen kane they wont push all the frontiers of great film making or open new doors to creative processes however this does not prevent them from being a good movie what does a good movie need interesting plot strong characters good visuals by these elements i dont mean they have to be outstanding and noticeable it means that the plot is interesting enough to hold the audiences attention throughout the movie the characters are strong enough to warrant an emotional connection and the visuals are great enough to allow audiences to suspend disbelief having these elements do not guarantee an oscar but having them means that the movie will be an enjoyable one civil war was an enjoyable movie with all three elements above with added emotional finesse that can be fully understood by those who have watched previous films it was also a humorous film with most jokes landing perfectly and inspiring laughs all over the place furthermore it was a film that was really satisfying to watch as it is full of awesome kickass action scenes that didnt feel unnecessary yes the airport scene may lack some reality but no one can deny it was 18 minutes of none stop fun and eye candy yes the score may be forgettable but it served its purpose as a atmosphere building block that made moments better     all in all civil war is a film that holds up to a second viewing in the cinemas it has a very engaging story to tell with some very engaging characters and talented actors it managed to bring black panther and spiderman into the mcu perfectly with two great actors who fit the role perfectly and though it is an imperfect movie it is still one thats worth your time
Apr 30 2016,positive,its hard to find anything to criticise about this film  brilliant stunts and plenty of funny dialogue
Apr 30 2016,positive,with the abundance of characters in the movie the pacing is very well done also the writers did a great job at balancing both sides  i found myself unable to side with either sides as both pov has a point well for me at least either way this is just a pause until their eventual reconciliation for the ultimate battle
Apr 30 2016,positive,a true marvel avenger fan will understand where the both sides come from  clearly this is new to marvel used film  humor is present but not as much as the other films a deep sited emotion clouded better judgement a must watch film
Apr 30 2016,positive,kicking off the third phase of marvels cinematic universe captain america civil war is the third and possibly final film centring on the leader of the avengers  captain america has only gotten better with time and civil war is the biggest and best of the three ranking alongside the strongest films the company has put out    about a year has passed since the events of avengers age of ultron and the team continues to fight towards making the world a safer place after an explosive operation in nigeria that claims the lives of several innocent civilians questions arise over the teams place in the world it appears to be the final straw for the government who take the avengers to task over the destruction they have caused from here two separate camps led by captain america chris evans and iron man robert downey jr are established each with their own ideas and perspectives on what the group stands for all the while however external forces are taking advantage of the rift within the team meaning to turn them against each other in retaliation for the havoc they caused its a web of political intrigue and rising tensions that bounces between many different locations and juggles all of its characters with a gusto that stands alongside the previous avenger films civil war also boasts some of the more unexpected twists in the franchise so far taking the characters to darker places the escalation posed here is intentional captain americans third outing doesnt flinch or buckle under the weight of all its material instead it gives us one of the most thoughtful and important narratives in the series so far    with a set of characters fully established civil war can focus on creating dramatic tension between them and the results are both palpable and understandable you can grasp the motivations at play here and you understand where theyre all coming from despite having so many characters its practically avengers 25 with ten heroes in all what really holds the film together is the relationships between the characters steves near unbreakable friendship with bucky barnes aka the winter soldier fuels much of his motivation to uncover the dark secrets of the program that created them both hes steadfast and loyal to his own moral code which stands at odds with the other avengers iron man on the other hand has become genuinely concerned about the teams actions and believes that signing away their authority is the better thing to do stark himself feels more human than before his charismatic ego almost entirely muted by a sense of guilt the other characters all have their own individual tales which are lesser in scope but still equally engaging scarlett witch elizabeth olsen and vision paul bettany are particularly strong in the ways they play off each other with their powers civil war also brings a couple of new characters to the proceedings i wont spoil them here but the film does a fine job of both surprising you with their entrances and also giving plenty of backstory to make them worthy additions what it all comes down to is that every character has their own motivations at play and they each contribute to the conflict in their own varying ways    captain america continues on from its predecessor with even more outstanding fight scenes that have drastically increased in scale with some slick editing mixed with eyepopping special effects audiences certainly wont be disappointed by the action which never once becomes too overbearing because of the coherent plot the action feels much more immediate and captivating the most impressive moment is of course the airport battle where the two teams square off cutting between both the two sides as they swap between fighting different targets makes for one of the most intimate and tense fight scenes in the entire mcu the films globetrotting narrative gives way to a greater variety of environments which in turn give off their own atmospheres the winter soldiers locales are especially foreboding conveying the sinister experiments that were conducted on him to begin with    with its detailed story deep characters and standout presentation captain america civil war is another superb addition to a wildly popular franchise its easily the best superhero film of the year so far and seeing marvel maintain their high standards thirteen films in is really encouraging it deserves all the success it can muster    rating 55 stars
Apr 30 2016,positive,one of the best movies ive ever seen in my life everything was wellbalanced and we actually got to see other aspects of every characters beahavior plus the new spiderman is awesome and black panther is just perfect
Apr 30 2016,positive,the third marvel movie to be headlined by captain america after the first avenger and the winter soldier this is pretty much avengers 3 in allbutname only really missign the hulk and thor from the lineup of the two previous avengers movies    its also the second movie of the summer to set up the protaganists in opposition to one another the first being the somewhat lacklustre batman vs superman dawn of justice with captain america leading one set of superheroes in opposition to the sokovia accords whilst iron man leads another in favour of the same  and what are the sokovia accords  essentially they have arisen from political pressure to install a system of accountability on the avengers following another incident that results in collatoral damage albeit not as much as in age of ultron no longer can they go off and do their own thing when they want but must instead operate under the control of the un    not surprisingly tony stark is all for this whilst a postshieldhydra captain america is not    throw in his old brainwashed friend bucky barnes aka the winter soldier far more globetrotting than i remember their being in any previous marvel movie and a few new faces  most noticeably in black panther and in possibly the best representation of spiderman yet  while briging some of the phase 3 heroes into the main story im looking at you antman and a bit of baitandswitch towards the end and the result is another thoroughly enjoyable movie even if imo the winter soldier is still the best of the 3 captain america outings
Apr 30 2016,positive,will you let vengeance consume you till the point of no return can you bring back loss ones after revenge ill leave that for you to ponder    as marvels third instalment on one of the most iconic american superhero ever captain america civil war dares to think big its a hero versus hero movie done in the rightest way ever known in human history personally i havent watched  batman vs superman dawn of justice hence i shall not make any unnecessary comparison between the two of them im a fan of both dc  marvel so im not bias towards either side    first of all civil war tried hard to move marvel cinematic universe mcu into a whole new phase they have done really well exploring themes outside of the usual comfort zone guilt plays a major role in shaping the story and the character development in this instalment you would have thought they are already over it after defeating ultron in avengers 2 sadly the more they try to save the world from seemingly unending threats the more they have failed to save because innocents will always be caught in the crossfire its as simple as there is bound to be casualty in war capt said this job we are trying to save as many people as we can but sometimes that doesnt mean everybody    the series has become more and more mature ever since it has started capt along with all the other avengers has faced countless challenges but they have managed to come out on top every single time because they stood together as a team as the slogan for the movie has suggested united we stand divided we fall in this movie the villain who was so obsessed with his lust for vengeance tore the team apart its not a wonderful sight seeing heroes fighting heroes just because they dont share the same ideal    casting wise marvel has certainly made a good call i think the new characters are as good as marvel wants them to be you will see a different spiderman for example and although a bit forceful black panthers entrance is quite acceptable too im glad that im able to say this all of the seasoned avengers are once again performing at their very best    lets move on to the technical side of things for most of the time im unable to withstand the motion blurring in fast paced action sequences 24 frames per second fps is horrible and it really needs to go now could you imagine if those scenes were filmed in at least 48fps yes i can it would be a marvel to behold the pun is so certainly intended the visual effects are spot on and you can tell from just looking at the number of staff working in rotoscope the soundtrack is well mixed with the audio effects and the overall dialogue is crisp and impactful    if i were you id book a nice seat for the next show time and thoroughly enjoy this masterpiece marvel has spent so much gold and sweat piecing together captain america civil war is the definitive superhero blockbuster of 2016 believe it or not it has a virtually flawless blend of engaging action powerful drama and quality wit whether or not you are a marvel fan im sure you will still enjoy watching it have fun and do look forward to the future of mcu because they just keep getting better and better
Apr 30 2016,positive,this is as good as a superhero movie can get
Apr 30 2016,positive,spidey and ant man brought the humor and the action was good but  i just did not enjoy seeing my gang beating up on each other
Apr 30 2016,positive,the best marvel movie to date
Apr 30 2016,positive,a fantastic adaptation of the legendary comic the story was excellent and both sides of the fight had very compelling arguments which led to a very interesting struggle between which one was the right one to go with and led to a brilliant clash that might be one of the best battles in a marvel film to date it had its serious moments but some of the funniest moments in any marvel film as well with spiderman and ant man stealing the show in that department both newcomers spiderman tom holland and black panther chadwick boseman were amazing in their roles and were arguably perfect picks for those characters overall this film is a must watch for any marvel fan a film with a compelling plot that could well be the best film of the year
Apr 30 2016,neutral,inconclusive film there was no war was more a civil fight and that even the subject became irrelevant and was not resolved similarly as the main plot was quite shallow positives are spiderman antman and the panther
Apr 30 2016,positive,an excellent addition to the marvel cinematic universe
Apr 30 2016,positive,marvel keep up the great work with this latest instalment of captain america which is on par with the winter soldier imo    spidey  black panther are great additions to the mcu    8510
Apr 30 2016,positive,well its a example of how to do a big budget team up right unlike the other train wreck from the other guys
Apr 30 2016,negative,was okay way to overhyped no where near as good as these critics are saying
Apr 30 2016,positive,great movie but not as good as the previous installment how the critic s can give this more than bvs s is concerning
Apr 30 2016,positive,civil war slows down to give the audience the story and depth missing from the last few movies of the mcu while simultaneously offering up an awesome ensemble of characters some old some new as well as great action sequences one of the best marvel films to date
Apr 30 2016,negative,this movie was all over the place the fight scenes were phenomenal but the plot is very poor and messy
Apr 30 2016,positive,i feel very conflicted about this movie it was good but not my favorite maybe my expectations were too high the story was alright i felt like there was not much character development aside from black panther and iron man everyone else was sorta just crammed in there i did have fun watching it and the funny moments were great black panther was the best part hands down
Apr 30 2016,negative,it just runs away from the original comic story where the comics follow more ideological lines discuss the temptation of fascism and other mature themes this film adaptation is just about two guys being manipulated by a vengeful villain and also criminally sexualize the only non sexualized main feminine character of the marvel universe i wonder if  there is any problem with being old where the comics were a master piece this half hearted flick is just bunch of really good action scenes put together under a terrible plot
Apr 30 2016,positive,with amazing action set pieces a very compelling villain and a very solid story captain anerica civil war is in the marvel holy trinity besides avengers and captain america 2
Apr 30 2016,positive,i liked batman vs superman and is a do fan coming into this film planning on hating this film but this is amazing the fights had comedy drama and suspense and the film flowed so well that is also the films only problem i wasnt sure whether captain america and iron man were friends or enemies half way through and they didnt use spiderman as much as i would like but those are insignificant compered to everything els because i just cant just go watch it i didnt like any of the avengers films but i love this dc and marvel fans will love it equally
Apr 30 2016,positive,just take zemo out and this one is undoubtedly the best marvel movie ever its mature like winter soldier but comical like every superhero movie should be
Apr 30 2016,positive,captain america civil war hes my friend so was i quick review  civil war has begun as cap and iron man clash over political differences the catastrophic events of the past has caught up the avengers are all to be held accountable for but who is right cap who believes in freedom the will to do what needs to be done without govern restrictions or iron man who believes restrictions and rules for superheroes will create a more stable world iron man understands the consequences of no restrictions i mean he did create ultron afterall and cap well he has experienced first hand that shackles are bonded with corruption    cap and iron man have never seen eye to eye ever since the avengers and its clear this confrontation was building up director josh whedon at the time did a fantastic job of creating this conflict in the avengers probably knowing someday that civil war would happen i admire marvel for thinking ahead and connecting the story years later cap and iron man have come a long way ever since the avengers there morales and ethics are still different either of them could be right because both of there arguments are valid and logical as you see throughout the movie    if you enjoyed the new turn the winter solider took into more grounded superhero genre territory  you will enjoy this movie civil war is in the same boat but in a much bigger scale with more heroes on screen including new additions black panther and spider man both who are done exceptional well its clear directors the russo brothers see these characters as the fans do and for a movie with so many superheroes onscreen the russo brothers found a way not the pollute the movie by only giving us snip bits here and there of them  civil war is movie that relies on your knowledge of the previous movies such as the first avenger avengers winter solider and age of ultron you will be lost if you havent at least seen winter solider    verdict  captain america civil war adds just enough screen time to introduce new characters while not over overindulging us with unnecessary story arc while still keeping to what the movie is centred around cap v iron man
Apr 30 2016,positive,they have definately stepped up their game with this movie it was definately on another level of awesome fight scene at the airport definate highlight and wow black panther
Apr 30 2016,positive,one of the best marvel movies ive seen spiderman antman black panther and most of the characters were amazing
Apr 30 2016,positive,best movie of 2016 because of its very great plot  action great choreograph scenes and actors
Apr 30 2016,positive,a great movie for fans of the mcu
Apr 30 2016,positive,the thirteenth film in the avengers saga veered away from the usual formula and delved into challenging motifs in the same style as its predecessor winter soldier resulting to a remarkable and spectacular superhero thriller it has been said several times already but its worth mentioning again that captain america civil war is by far the best entry to the marvel cinematic universe
Apr 30 2016,positive,the civil war is a great superhero movie especially the airport scene and spiderman but somehow i just feel that it needs more epic moments for the movie in this kind of scale maybe i was too excited or expecting too much
Apr 30 2016,positive,captain america civil war eschews the dull trend of citywide destruction instead the plot focus on the guilt of having caused all that ruin eventually loyalties powers abilities and egos start to tear them apart in spit an overflowing with characters the russo brothers brilliantly balance old favourites with new ones while continuing the winter soldiers sense of mystery and intrigue to keep comicbook fans or audiences alike the joie de vivre
Apr 30 2016,positive,hmmmmmm im not really convinced yes the story line was more mature and the new characters that were introduced were fun butit felt long it didnt really hit its boot straps until halfway through it want as much fun as previous marvel movies and in places it was just plain silly if thats even possible
Apr 30 2016,positive,just awsome just see it is wirth the price and wait
Apr 30 2016,positive,here you go dc this is how you make a vs movie
Apr 30 2016,positive,another brilliant film by marvel excellent performances by the talented ensemble cast fantastic storyline fight scenes and graphics    i cant wait for the next marvel film
Apr 30 2016,positive,a more satisfying marvel ensemble piece than either of the previous avenger films civil war delivers on the action tension humor  more importantly it also makes you think
Apr 30 2016,positive,what i liked the final act of this movie is the real takeaway as the final battle alone is enough to warrant your money its emotionally heartbreaking and thankfully proves that marvel arent afraid to test the boundaries of their characters and relationships the gravitas of this though is only possible thanks to an efficient setup that the russos craft well  littered with great action and touching moments that all really click together  what i didnt like that superefficient setup does strip some life from the movie though as the russos dont give long enough in each moment to create real engagement or emotion this in turn makes it feel a little manufactured and less human than other mcu stories thats not to mention the lack of style or the outofplace character decisions either  verdict whilst not really engaging on a human or spectacle level for its majority civil war is well made and contains the best final act in any mcu movie ever
Apr 30 2016,positive,best marvel movie yet it was way more lighthearted than i expected yet emotionally darker too especially the jawdropping end scene the only critisisms i have is that although zemo was a fantastic villain he should have been cut  the screenwriterscostume designers completely ruined vision i cant complain though i love all the characters in this movie the action truly made me speechless  it was incredible how the russo bros tore the avengers in half
Apr 30 2016,positive,an intense environment for civil war the action parts were insane it is definitely a psychological thriller
Apr 30 2016,positive,it was an absolutely fantastic movie like many marvel movies past it does not fail to disappoint however my only gripe with it is it should be called avengers  civil war not captain america  civil war not enough focus on cap for a captain america movie but to reiterate it was still a very good movie
Apr 30 2016,positive,spidey stole the show
Apr 30 2016,positive,this two and a half hour blockbuster can be called an entry in the captain america film series only loosely more than anything its a story about the avengers above all its chilling thrilling and impeccably human despite the fact that antman becomes giantman in a endearing and utterly perfect manner thanks to paul rudds performance as scott lang or that tchalla breaks out the black panther garb while still managing to be shrouded in mystery chadwick boseman is by far the best addition to the mcu we saw in this film it is ultimately a story about the lengths one man will go to save his best friend ironically enough this may have been the least explored relationship steve and bucky spend a lot of the movie fighting for each other or talking about each other but only once or twice did they talk to each other likely due to the sheer amount of stuff the russo brothers had to pack into an already lengthy film other characters may have suffered from so much to do so little time issue natasha who is yet again a different version of herself this time a strangely solemn one disappears at the end of the second third of the movie with little to no explanation so much so that you dont realise shes gone until she doesnt come back the relationship between steve and sharon also felt forced steve remarks that their awkward kiss was late but to the audience it feels rather rushed and happens fairly early in the film leaving sharon nowhere to go but away  and baron zemo as villains go was decidedly lackluster not frightening or threatening but mostly pitiful for the most part he served as a way to stir up tension which he did very well and which actors robert downey junior and chris evans carried with the utmost skill and grace other highlights the rivalry between captain americas two best friends sam and bucky the little we saw of jeremy renners clint barton and the gorgeous exhilarating fight choreography we saw in winter soldier the best part however was that despite the team cap vs team iron man mania that makes up the entirety of the films marketing strategy at the end you are left unable to truly say which of the two sides you are on thanks to the grace and the thought the russos put into both
Apr 30 2016,positive,the greatest marvel film ever seems to be the general consensus amongst critics across the globe either they watched a different film to me or disney have payed them some serious cash dont get me wrong i enjoyed it its exciting and full of great moments but to call this the best yet is an insult to other films in the series which are far superior   the first hour is a bore theres no getting away from that fact also the tone is even more dark and serious much like dcs last offering however when spiderman and antman show up the film comes to life and it is a joy to watch from that moment the banter is present as is the fantastic action and great special effects   the thing is this is nothing new it doesnt change anything youve seen it all before but audiences lap it up a sold out audience laughed at all the moments when they were supposed to laugh and stayed until the end its become normal i think to adore anything marvel churns out people ignore what is right in front of them   this isnt a 5 star film and for it to sit at nearly 100 positive reviews is just baffling   the elephant in the room is obviously batman v superman which people seemed to dislike before it was even released   marvel films it seems are now critic proof and this latest offering has surely proven it   i do love a lot of what they have released and films such as the first iron man the avengers and the winter soldier are much better films in my opinion but it seems im in the minority
Apr 30 2016,positive,ok ill say it the premise was thinner than public toilet paper once again we fall back on that tired plot device of making smart characters stupid really unforgivably stupid   yes i love these characters and there were lots of good sequences and even character developments but every time i started to buy in again these ridiculous paperthin plot devices slapped me back to reality i remain astounded that it scores so highly
Apr 30 2016,positive,the greatest superhero movie of all time i dont say that lightly as i consider all the movies that i now have beneath this film in terms of quality the avengers winter soldier xmen 2 and even the original batman and superman films     i remember my excitement when going to watch the first avengers film or when i saw the original spiderman film for the first time and although my anticipation levels may have been higher in terms of quality i cant think of another superhero movie that tops civil war     the biggest challenge this film had was giving sufficient screen time to so many characters thor and hulk might not make appearances here but virtually every other mcu character does and across the 150 minutes i never felt anyone got left out which is quite an achievement i feel     there are some fantastic scenes in the film a couple of which i wont spoil for you but easily the best addition to the franchise was spiderman finally marvels most iconic character is part of the mcu they do a great job of introducing him and his scenes certainly contain the most humour and leaves you excited for the forthcoming solo spiderman film in 2017     if youre up to date with all the marvel films you are going to love this
Apr 30 2016,negative,this isnt civil war this is just captain america 3 the movie title was just marketing ill try to forget they called it civil war and pretend i just watched captain america 3
Apr 30 2016,positive,frankly the plot is so similar to batman vs superman people getting ungrateful to the super heroes and say they do more harm than good and the heroes fighting each other because personal interests anyway one word overall still entertaining
Apr 30 2016,positive,out of this world left the cinema wanting to go back in and see not only it again but any one of the already confirmed three movies that are spawned from it would willingly go see a movie about any one of the 10 characters that feature heavily in the film literally not a thing done badly a rare movie with absolutely nothing to complain about for all that it differed from the graphic novel that was its source material it did that material justice and kept the spirite of the comic perfectly delighted will be going to see again
Apr 30 2016,positive,i enjoyed bvs but when i watched this i realised why the critics hated bvs so much the sheer contrast in terms of plot was glaring civil wars actually made sense although i still hated the fact it needed a villain behind the scenes  both share this fault i could get behind most characters motivations the only exception being visions will likely watch again     loved it esp the spidey and antman scenes
Apr 30 2016,negative,again im suckered in by the hype my man says its all fanboy hype in the populace and the media i guess hes right two out of seven is not good this one is the worse i think im done with the superhero genre dont be fooled skip it watch something else anything but this garbage
Apr 30 2016,positive,absolutely awesome definitely the best marvel movie  just as an fyi so you dont leave early there are two after credits scenes
Apr 30 2016,positive,captain america civil war is one of  the best mcu movies if not the best onecharacters in this this movie are developed in an amazing way the pacing is great and the action sequenses are shot perfectly this defintley is a must see movie
Apr 29 2016,positive,apparently 2016 was the year when the marvel vs dc war reemerged as both companies released films where their respective heroes fight against each other after the mixed response of dawn of justice audiences expected a better film in civil war did civil war live up to the hype  remember when marvel explained every aspect of its cinematic universe and made movies that setup characters for future crossovers well now that they are full of themselves and after already making the avengers this philosophy seems to have been thrown out the window and what a better example than captain america avengers 25   civil war counts with solid performances from the cast thats already extremely comfortable in their respective roles while the newcomers tried their best once again the russo brothers direction is confident and wise by perfectly balancing this insanely big cast the story solidly works as the basis for this conflict the main event is extremely fun to watch and the different ideals are well executed by making them relatable and not labeling one side as good and other as bad   with all that being said this film has its flaws the new characters are hammfisted in such a lackluster manner the story starts with some interesting moral ideas but soon decides to throw them away just for the sake of the spectacle the comedy is excessive and mostly not funny the overall villain is the most forgettable and unexplained in the marvel cinematic universe and thats saying something the characters are contrived as at times they go against their stablished personality some characters are unnecessary they are just here for the sake of showing an all out war between the avengers and overall this story has no resolution whatsoever and i doubt marvel will continue this story arc with infinity wars due to the fact that phase three is mostly introductions of even more characters thus making this conflict somewhat pointless   captain america civil war is a film that throws efficient storytelling and writing to make room for some mindless spectacle thats expertly executed and is indeed fun but ultimately hollow and pointless it is undeniably not the best mcu movie this is nothing compared to its spy thriller predecessor but it is the best super hero film of 2016 for now at least
Apr 29 2016,positive,good on marvel it excites your for black panthers solo film especially
Apr 29 2016,positive,enjoyed the film although it wasnt particularly a standout action was decent though pacing erred in places storyline was mediocre overstuffed and all over the place evans was rather plastic downey jrs acting was fantastic despite the poor choice made for the direction of his character hawkeye and spiderman had no place in the film felt like the russos were shoehorned into having spiderman in the film for marketing purposes chadwick boseman was interesting on debut and was a good pick for black panther good to see vision and scarlett witch finally get some muchneeded character development even if it was minor once again we see a mcu edition with no real consequences the story seemed way too forced bruhl was another missed opportunity by marvel for a great villain though that is the storys fault not his acting hoping that the russos ramp it up for the infinity war movies
Apr 29 2016,positive,captain america civil war awesome movie its everything batman v superman tried to be but failed miserably its not a perfect movie but then again which movie is but its real close to perfection in the superhero genre   good storytelling awesome action sequences and the best live action spiderman black panther is worth mentioning too i bet hell get many new fans   civil war is a highly recommendable movie
Apr 29 2016,positive,425    not quite as balanced as the winter soldier but offering a million times mor ein terms of entretainment value and story development civil war is an amazing example of great film making that doesnt turn its back on the action and fun that makes superhero movies so impressive and worthy of their time
Apr 29 2016,positive,this is what a great superhero movie should be like great story great characters great introductions to new characters like black panther done right giant man and spiderman done right and best of all an amazing time at the movies
Apr 29 2016,positive,a marvel masterpiece  i was completely riveted from beginning to end  is it a perfect movie  no  is it the most fun you can have in a theater in 2016  you bet your iron ass  spiderman slayed
Apr 29 2016,positive,ok its a good movie a lot better than i expected    points of interest    wandas accident does comunicate the same feeling of this is fed up that the stanford incident did in the comics at least for me     spidey damn i didnt think i was gonna like him but it was a lot more enjoyable than expected all things considered i might see a spiderman movie again now    bucky cap stark love triangle meh honestly it got old pretty soon    main battle damn great and enjoyable    greatest thing excitement built for black panther movie
Apr 29 2016,positive,the best marvel movie to date
Apr 29 2016,positive,this is  by far  the best marvel movie ever  it has so many similar elements to batman v superman but with sheer fun and spectacle theres so much awesomeness going on that i kept saying holy shit more than once  beneath this gargantuan clash comes with consequences that changes things in the future of the cinematic universe and if everyone asks if this is avengers 25 yes it is but deep down its also a captain america film  in summary  black panther is awesome spiderman is awesome scarlet witch is hot aunt may is hot and everyone gets the spotlight im looking at you antman   and damn that airport battle is enough to satisfy my geeky desires no spoilers i want you all to witness the multibillion dollar production scale
Apr 29 2016,positive,i keep reminding myself this is a captain america movie but the timeline is after the avengers so you have to keep up at first the airport scene is probably the most awesome in a superhero moviealso thanks to spideys cameo its real good but to claim its the best marvel movie ever i beg to differ
Apr 29 2016,positive,definitely on the top 3 marvel movies the airport scene is the standout movie the only dumb or down side being the weakass villian other than that incredible movie
Apr 29 2016,positive,great movie cant wait for more from spider man
Apr 29 2016,positive,not the greatest film of all time but one hell of a ride that managers to do its ensemble cast justice and was a lot of fun to watch story was a little fast paced but there was a lot to fit in and it did a much better job than age of ultron did whilst dealing with more characters      highlights include the infamous airport fight with tom hollands spiderman absolutely stealing the show every time he is on screen and chadwick bosmans portrayal of black panther which bodes well for the future of the mcu it certainly got me excited for both characters standalone outings which is nice to see and means marvel dont have to just rely on the preexisting big names anymore paul rudds antman provides the much required light relief and holds his own against the established title characters while anthony mackie and don cheadle fulfill the roles of dutiful sidekicks scarlett johanssons black widow does a good job of walking the line between the teams and trying to keep them both in check whilst scarlet witch and vision have a very subtle romeo and juliet style story line with both feeling torn by their loyalties hawkeye gets little screen time but shines when he is in front of the camera and had far more personality than was shown in the entire of thor and the avengers put together      the villains are sadly under utilised in my opinion but this seems to be a common complaint of the marvel films they are good when they are there but are absent for most of the film and you cant help but feel at least one of them should have been saved for a different film so they had more time to shine      you may have noticed at this point i have yet to mention cap bucky or iron man the three title characters get the lions share of the screen time and do a stellar job of portraying their characters but they actually are the least interesting in my opinion they do and say exactly what you expect them to that being said the three way fight between them is awesome and one of the stand out set pieces of the entire film      my complaints are few at times the camera work in the fight scenes felt very choppy and and poorly edited but perhaps i have been spoilt by the mastery of daredevils choreography there are a few plot points that are skimmed over and not explained week    probably my third favourite marvel film behind caws and gog and a must see for anyone who enjoys an action film with a good dose of comedy
Apr 29 2016,positive,for a movie crowded with characters captain america civil war makes every step in the right direction its not only an amazing blockbuster its a mature movie its deeply emotional you feel for this characters you care for them it burns you watching them fight joe and anthony russo makes everyone shine its just one amazing clip after another its amazing how smooth the movie plays out nothing seems forced or cluttered it all plays out beautifully i was there sitting in the theatre on the edge of my seat this is the most exciting movie marvel has ever made it feels deep and dark but marvel does not t forget were they come from they dont forget marvel can be fun fun can be thrown in between a conflict this is an amazingly well developed movie we see robert downey jrs finest moment as tony stark hes performance is one for the ages the emotional rollecoaster that tony goes through its just breathtaking   everyone gets a time to shine paul rudds antman works wonderfully funny on point jokes chadwick bosemans performance as black panther is amazing he is the neutral side he stands for his own agenda the dialogue is amazing wise but full of power but obviously one newcomer stole the show peter parker came swinging into the mcu and boy does he make an entrance  i remember being a kid standing in line to see the first live action incarnation of my favorite hero spiderman i remember being out of my mind once tobey put on the suit marvel brought me back last night marvel made me a kid all over again tom holland really is spiderman he is the best incarnation of the web slinger to date for years we have been waiting for spideys wit and playful personality the russos gave us the spiderman we deserve he says lines in the most peter parker way it can he makes reference a 15 year old would have made there is a joke in the middle of the big airport scene thats just so perfect so peter parker all i can say is that finally we have been given without a doubt  the amazing spiderman  civil war is an amazing ride is everything you wanted to and more i bowed down to james gunn after seeing his amazing guardians     i shall bow down to the russos for giving me the joy of watching such an important part of my childhood being brought up to life in the most amazing pun intended way     thank you marvel you are not playing this game you are the game
Apr 29 2016,positive,nowhere near as good as winter soldier
Apr 29 2016,positive,simply the most memorable movie marvel in years  awesome
Apr 29 2016,negative,this is crazy listening to the high praise by some of the critics had me running to see the flick my expectations were so freaking high that theres no way it could attain such heights and it didnt i felt so cheated and upset that i and my girl walked out before the big brawl dont believe the hype marvel and dc fanboys love their characters so much theyll settle for garbage b v s was trash and this is worse
Apr 29 2016,positive,the best super hero movie this year until now this is the best spiderman to the date black panther makes perfect match to all of the other characters antman is other perfect match to th other avengers drama action and fun in a perfect mix its a must see movie in imax great
Apr 29 2016,positive,ok hearing iron man calling spider man underoos is almost worth it by itself  but great fights powerful emotions bad consequences make it a dont miss
Apr 29 2016,positive,one good thing to be a taiwanese is some hollywood hot movies are released in advance27 apr the movie is great not too predictable plot especially the nontypical villian a argument between team cap and team iron makes audience think the combat sense and visual effects are fullfilled customers request the film still has it funny part i love the sense when cap kissed the gril  his behavour met with an enthusiastic response from his good buddies the movie definitely worth to see it there are 2 trailer eggs in the end of film hope youll see the wakanda one
Apr 29 2016,positive,the marvel universe films are just getting better and better this film is everything that batman v superman should have been and the inclusion of spiderman is great
Apr 29 2016,positive,the movie is more of a avengers sequel than a captain america movie although the story does work around cap letting him on more information than other characters with them coming across as antagonists for being less informed on the situation  it does follow a simplistic plot especially when you find out who the real antagonist is but with a few viewings it can be easily nit picked    caps major argument is that he doesnt want to be told who he cant help by the un and that it is agendas that may determine who gets help  dan cheadle being in this movie in the same room on the opposite side of the argument when captain america conveys his reasoning and having done an oscar nominated performance in a movie on the same topic when the un doesnt send help when it was needed made it a bit ironic for an avid movie viewer  i guess the mcu has star warstrek but not hotel rwanda
Apr 29 2016,positive,scarlet witch and black panther were really great
Apr 29 2016,positive,captain america civil war non spoiler review    this movie was the best comicbook movie i have ever seen black panther and spiderman stole this film the fighting scenes in this film was next level and i was on the edge of my seat these characters you feel emotion for them and i cant wait for doctor strange next on marvels list d
Apr 29 2016,positive,best superhero movie by far why because it has the most engaging characters the action scenes are like art brought to life the narrative is a little slow at points but the dynamics of the characters and the fact we get to see some of the most iconic characters in modern culture battle it out on screen easily the greatest superhero movie ever and it will be very tough to beat
Apr 29 2016,positive,just back from captain america civil war awesome marvel film i would put it right up there with the original avengers and captain america the winter soldier as far as the best of the marvel cinematic universe movie so many awesome moments for comic fans the fight scene at the airport where both sides finally face off against each other is not only a great action sequence but it may be the best comic book hero movie action sequence ever gave me chills  if there is one small complaint its that they are trying to do a lot of things in this movie including rebooting spiderman so much so that at times it feels as if youre watching avengers 3 rather than a captain america movie that being said the new spiderman is awesome and im actually excited for a rebooted spiderman movie other than being quietly resigned as i was with the previous reboot  black panther was also done incredibly well and i cant wait to see that solo movie with him as well  just a great storyline see dcwarner this is what you get when you naturally build to a conflict so that it makes sense rather than just doing the equivalent of slamming two action figures together for 2  12 hours coughbatman vs supermancough you totally buy the conflict between tony stark and steve rogers and its actually emotionally moving because of it  despite a brief slowdown after an actionpacked start this movie was a true delight youll love it even if youre not a comic book fan the fact that i am made it even better
Apr 29 2016,positive,the russo brothers are at it again brilliant story great character motivations and awesome action
Apr 29 2016,positive,marvels best so far not only does it manages to give all the amazing characters their fair share off screen time but it also lets them show off it has enought badass action to catch the eye of someone whos doesnt know any backstory and the story itself is pretty interesting and thought provoking the events actually have a reason to occur and it doesnt feel forced plenty of good laughs too the very very high expectations were met and the bar is pretty high now not that dcs batman vs superman left it anywhere high to begin with
Apr 29 2016,positive,before i watched the movie 2 times now the trailers made me feel like tony was once again trying to make things right and fucking up again well he is trying to make things right but this time we can understand why from the scene at the mit we can actually feel bad for him and sad for the mothers kid the kids mother blames him for the death of her son and then he does too and if that wasnt enough the relationship between tony and pepper isnt good either  the only way he sees to make things right is to be putting the avengers in check and then i think you all know what is going to happen
Apr 29 2016,positive,a real joy to watch story dialog action amazing had the humor we all love about marvel and each character was true really a soft to behold
Apr 29 2016,positive,hands down captain america civil war is greatest comic book movie ever made and the greatest marvel movie to date spoilers free as a fan and a person who grew up with comic books i have to say this movie delivers in every way its absolutely brilliant so emotional the conflict between both teams works out just perfect the characters are amazingly developed throughout the movie and so full of emotion every character has a reason and every character is important tom holland is spiderman his interpretation of the nonmutant super hero is incredible black panther is magnificent a serious character in a journey of vengeance and antman is one hell of a surprise its filled with breathtaking action scenes the choreography is astonishing the fights are the greatest ive ever seen in a comic book movie so energized and vibrant ive never heard a theater audience reacting like that in a movie the airport fight its an absolute spectacle of chaos and the most perfect example of what a real super hero clash is suppossed to be and despite never losing its great humor adding the perfect amount of comic relief absolutely necessary in a movie where theres a lot of tragic events this is also the most emotional darkest and most violent marvel movie to date there are really dark parts in the movie touching the limits of the pg13 rating the final fight takes a really dark tone and ends up in a heartbreaking and fierce brother vs brother battle the russo brothers and marvel studios did an amazing job redefining the genre with a solid and masterful work and giving the avengers a whole new tone more human and emotional in a world where their actions affect the world around them more than ever before even the political themes were done just right you can truly feel the effort and the heart they put into it i have no words captain america civil war is a masterpiece in every aspect and surpassed my expectations i cant be happier with it and im gonna watch it as many times as i can as a fan it was a joy and a gift even the reference to captain americas legendary speech in the amazing spiderman 537 is just a nerdgasm an event that must be seen by every true fan in the world
Apr 29 2016,positive,another brilliant marvel film 1010  spiderman black panther really good cant wait see them again rest of the cast all good to acted there ass off  my first review but this film deserves it
Apr 29 2016,positive,if the dc universe ever came this close to a such a captivating cast and story linewow  please do not ever let bryan singer touch this branch of the tree xmen regardless of earnings has just never matched the ability to weave the fabric of these multiple story lines and characters   captain america has moved far away form the origins story and really created the most solid character that seems to be the one the really binds all of them in mission focus the way they have set everything up with the iron manstark family ark through out the multiple platforms from the birth of cap to the cause and effect of action vs inaction   watching these is is hard to imagine what hollywood has in store for us in the future   sound track great and not overwhelming like the loud boom boom of the first superman and fancy filter work marvel makes everything visually enticing and easy to swallow bite size pieces  time flys so dont gobble down you popcorn for this great two hour feature
Apr 29 2016,positive,captain america civil war is probably the best marvel studios movie yet take that dc batman v superman dawn of justice at no point do you feel the time drag a story that contains more drama humour and most importantly fun than ever appeared in the dcs bvss even at 147 minuets some characters seem a little under used and are only here to add to the visual spectacle in fight scenes tom hollands spiderman sequence leaves you wanting the spiderman film to just turn up now paul rudds antman still brings a smile plus a host of other avergers cameos chadwick bosemans black panther is another character youll enjoy and will be turning up to the marvels film roster there are plenty scenes of mayhem and fights to go round and fill a dozen superhero movies for those who dont like this genre ill say then that there is probably nothing here for you stay home and leave it alone the rest of you who do then your going to get your kicks from this one has is always the case with marvel films there are post credit scenes this time two so you might want to sit around through those so come along and enjoy the ride because it well worth it
Apr 29 2016,positive,all the characters done perfectly and the film was great by itself too nice work marvel 
Apr 29 2016,positive,i had the pleasure in seeing yesterday evening the best movie of super heroes of my life really all the characters are shown and the best thing they give unexpected drafts as a good adaptation independent from the comic an intelligent villain and with big plot arch
Apr 29 2016,positive,another great marvel film spidey stole the show looking forward to his solo film black panther was also a welcome addition great story with good pace and a satisfying twist for you to get behind the characters motivations
Apr 29 2016,positive,striking a perfect balance between marvels style and breaking the status quo captain america civil war not only serves as an immensely satisfying start for phase 3 of the mcu but also serves as the perfect end for the captain america trilogy
Apr 29 2016,positive,this movie is awesome watched it twice in less than 24 hours already im thinking of watching it for a 3rd time and 4th and 5th and 6th already
Apr 29 2016,positive,from  a person who loves a good classic caper style movie and appreciates the new generation of action films with superheroes from dc and marvel universe this is hands down the best damn movie i have ever had the pleasure of watching youre eyes will dance in amazement at how well the story carries all characters throughout it will pull at your heart strings and your mind will be blown away go see this movie more than once
Apr 29 2016,positive,absolutely amazing very entertaining
Apr 29 2016,positive,best marvel movie seen it twice already going to see it again tomorrow cannot recommend it enough
Apr 29 2016,positive,this is one beautiful onion layer cake of a story and movie how the movie is told and unfolds is a testament to the superior movie making skills of the crew and cast warner and zack snyder get your notebooks out and take a long hard sobering look on how its done properly
Apr 29 2016,positive,the greatest superhero movie ever made wonderful character development a compelling conflict and the single best action sequence in any film set civil war headandshoulders above all others the final clash between steve and tony is heartbreaking not merely due to a friendship lost but because of grief and crippling trauma that may never heal 10 out of 10
Apr 29 2016,positive,omg this is better then that new starwars movie
Apr 29 2016,positive,in russo brothers we trust this movie was everything a fan could ask for when their favourite superheroes are fighting each other the characters were amazing i am now so excited to see spiderman in his solo movie and that one battle scene was probably the best most entertaining fights i have ever seen this movie is emotional exciting hilarious and basically everything you could ask for from a movie super impressed surpassed my expectations
Apr 29 2016,positive,captain america blew my face off
Apr 29 2016,positive,this is an emotional film no more games dialogues and backstory are great its a film that focuses on an emotional battle between tony and steve all the characters are great and specially the new ones there were applauses screams and laughs truly probably the best marvel film to date and the best action scene in years its so important to know the backstory of the characters so go and see previous marvel films if you didnt 
Apr 29 2016,positive,now thats what im talking about
Apr 29 2016,positive,to many unnecessary characters slow to start light on plot felt like they squeezed one story into another and lost focus undercooked lead character arcs were flat except spidermans entertaining but not the 5 star film people are saying however the 30 minutes with spiderman is awesome
Apr 29 2016,positive,the most intelligent marvel film yet with genuine character drama and humour it also has the best action i have ever seen in a superhero film
Apr 29 2016,positive,the best marvel movie ever made
Apr 29 2016,positive,not marvels worst film but not the best either  whilst the film has some good moments the film doesnt feel like a captain america film  the film feels a little bloated and fall under the weight of so many different characters in one movie  to give each character enough time and even then barely the story suffers particularly because marvel want to set up other movies    the acting is good and there are some funny moments but i wish marvel would stop trying to create their next franchise with each movie it just means the movies suffers and this have been very noticeable with this and avengers age of ultron
Apr 29 2016,positive,everything you could want from the 13th film in a blockbuster franchise and more this is essentially the third avengers film just told from captain americas perspective as opposed from the usual pov of iron mans in fact its a lot more thrilling and enjoyable than age of ultron  with a novel plot emotional weight and rdj acting his balls off like he hasnt had chance to before in the mcu all this is backed up with spectacular action judicious humour and a compelling new kind of villain its a sign of a good film when it makes the last avengers film a better one than it originally was now i just have to decide whos cooler black panther or the new and already definitive spiderman
Apr 29 2016,positive,the russos have worked magic on what could have been a chaoic movie but gives all the characters a chance to grow and especially developed bucky and the captains friendship and explores the winter soldier programme spiderman and antman are the comic relief but this film balances the emotional content well with brutal raw fights that were breathtaking and heartbreaking i was only sad this ended up being a set up for the next avengers movie but otherwise well worth the hype and the wait
Apr 29 2016,positive,it is just so good they were able to bring joy fun and some hear breaking moments to this movie it was also thought provoking the battles were amazing its hard to believe they were able to put this many characters in and make it great marvel never disappoints p
Apr 29 2016,positive,a solid entry into the massively enjoyable marvel cinematic universe ill keep this spoilerfree this movie suffers with a bit of a wonky middle third storywise but wraps things together amazingly in the finale a very very good start to phase three
Apr 29 2016,positive,as close to a damn near perfect comicbook movie as well probably ever get with the best portal of spiderman and peter parker this movie showed batman v superman how to do a complex verses comic storyline the right way
Apr 29 2016,positive,some say that its the best marvel movie yet that is not an unfair claim
Apr 29 2016,positive,this is what you wanted an avengers fighting each other movie to be it was emotional but also funny it gave all the heroes a good amount of screen time and awesome moments to shine
Apr 29 2016,positive,not much to say here simply the best movie of the franchise                    epic
Apr 29 2016,positive,this is the best movie in the mcu loved every minute worth every penny    story is excellent action in the movie is the best ive ever watched acting is great cgi brilliant and camera is spectacular also two good directors
Apr 29 2016,negative,big pile of shit marvel fucking sucks
Apr 29 2016,negative,what the hell my expectations were way too high this is definitely fanboy crap
Apr 29 2016,positive,three things that dissapointed me   1 the lack of mask on one of the many villains  2the endingg i was rooting for a team and well they didnt win  3 no squirrel girl or doreen green mention i was very excited expecting to see her name on some sort of monitor while looking for recruits or at least yeah like that girl that talks to squirrels i got nothing    the best thing were  1 the amazing plot twist the villain in this one its absolutly brilliant and intelligent  2 the battle scenes very well performed  3 ant man and spider man wow i was like a little boy where they had action scenes paul rudd delivered and its good to mention hot aunt may everybody was saying she was really hot    and really the thing that made my experience dreadfull were the jokes every goddamn 5 minutes really everything seemed forced to look really silly i didnt enjoyed that many jokes some witty remarks seems fine and some comedy relief but not every five minutes i really hated that the russo brothers claimed to be delivering  yet the darkest marvel movie and they failed by making so many silly unnecesary scenes winter soldier didnt had that many stuipid scenes i mean really they were very stupid like a confused falcon and then his costume confused for a bird i didint liked that many jokes
Apr 29 2016,positive,civil war kicks off phase 3 with a huge bang thanks to amazing action the great personal story and the sheer spectacle and intrigue of the avengers battling each other truly one of the mcus very best
Apr 29 2016,positive,captain america civil war was what avengers 2 should have been in my opinion  an epic escalation of all characters involved done well they also managed to touch upon the idea of super heroes in society without boring me to death like batman v superman did  great things  antman  black panther  spiderman  there are certain motifs right out of the comics spiderman holding up falling debris iron man cheating with his computers etc keep an eye out for them  can you move the seat up  no  pretty good things  ridiculously nihilistic 3rd act   everyone else had their time to shine  tony actually has a side you can see yourself agreeing to cap side sorta has a downside  meh  total waste of baron zemo hes a good actor but he could have been a guy named bob and nothing changes  bad  aunt may uh what ok then  things dont really get resolved so much as a set up for future arguments  theres a running theme about not killing people but im pretty sure falcon wastes like 5 people in the first fight scene  overall though i really enjoyed it
Apr 29 2016,positive,demasiada teleserie harto humor buena la pelea entre todos mucho captain america 3 bucky
Apr 29 2016,negative,an academy nomination wow not even close a boorish movie if youve seen the other avengers movies youve seen this one yawn overhyped go see another flick
Apr 29 2016,negative,this film is a rip of it has nothing to do with the comic and is really just a crappy continuation of winter solder with shoein characters like spider ma  who i was looking forward to seeing but was barly in the film it was pure crap
Apr 29 2016,positive,wow what an action packed roller coaster a well directed action film that is enjoyable from start to finish with real emotional stakes and ideologies at battle the russo brothers have made a film that is on par with the winter soldier and may even top it in some ways if tws was a spyespionage conspiracy action film then this is best looked at as the film age of ultron should have been spiderman was unbelievably well handled and instead of his set up standalone story being a bit of an after thought like thors storyline in aou spideys standalone is set up perfectly and woven in to the narrative and handled really well as is black panther     basically this is a great fun enjoyable summer blockbuster and well earned too cant wait to see what the russo brothers do on the infinity war films
Apr 29 2016,positive,yes this is the best one
Apr 29 2016,positive,yes it was awesome i just cant believe that i saw only a glimpse of what infinity war will have  yes spiderman is in this movie more than i thought he would be lil tom holland shows great promise
Apr 29 2016,positive,the peak of this age of comic book movies people are going to struggle to top this
Apr 29 2016,positive,political maneuvering grim twists clever dialogues shocking revelations surprising appearances and fantastic set pieces are just some ingredients in this funny welldirected movie dc will never accomplish such heights
Apr 29 2016,positive,ive seen the movie and i can say that it provides the best action scenes an interesting plot and wonderful development of the movie itself
Apr 29 2016,positive,this is the completion of caps story its not avengers 25 this is a captain america movie and chris evans is the heart of the mcu he will do anything to save his friend even if that means burning bridges with his new colleagues    civil war is thought provoking its entertaining and its funny its everything that bvs wanted to be and more    its not just a great superhero movie its a great movie full stop
Apr 29 2016,positive,what can i say they did it
Apr 29 2016,positive,it was awesome 1010 i expect the dc fan boys who were butt hurt with bad reviews for bvs will be on soon to try and bring this movie down please dont do it out of spite as this movie was great and can not be faulted in anyway watched it again and its still awesome only the dc butt hurt brigade would put it down even with not seeing it
Apr 29 2016,positive,far too many heroes in this one for me
Apr 29 2016,positive,captain america civil war delivers an amazing plot game changing action sequences and a talented cast which results in marvels best movie yet
Apr 29 2016,negative,the film was ok it wasnt winter soldier and strayed too far from the comic for my liking
Apr 29 2016,positive,robert downey jrs neck cgi is odd and aunt may is young
Apr 29 2016,positive,brilliant fight scenes awesome special effects great performances and just a generally entertaining plotline this film is a superhero battle film done righttake note dc the mcu just goes from strength to strength
Apr 29 2016,positive,not the best marvel movie very long
Apr 29 2016,positive,this is probably the most fun of the big marvel teamups  spiderman was absolutely hilarious
Apr 29 2016,positive,sensational action and some genuinely funny scenes which spiderman utterly stole a great movie
Apr 29 2016,positive,holy shit they finally made a good spiderman movie
Apr 29 2016,positive,good action and an interesting plot but a somewhat unnecessary villain slightly bogs down an otherwise enjoyable movie
Apr 29 2016,positive,i need to see it again but my first thoughts on captain america civil war are as follows  good fight scenes some nice character development lives up to the civil war title does not live up to the captain america title the ending ruined an almost perfect film
Apr 29 2016,positive,dope movie i still have winter soldier as my favorite marvel film because i liked that story a lot better the action in cw was great the story was okay spiderman was dope but freakin black panther was the highlight of the movie for me  overall ill give it a 7510
Apr 29 2016,positive,very successful an adaptation not faithful but presents important elements of its printed version a selection of well characterized and interpreted appropriately characters the best film of the marvel cinematic universe
Apr 29 2016,positive,one of the most entertaining movies i have seen and it really pays off if you have seen all the previous entries in the marvel cinematic universe
Apr 29 2016,positive,the most perfect superhero movie since the original superman  with fantastic action â
Apr 29 2016,positive,best super hero movie ever
Apr 29 2016,positive,simply epic and awesome
Apr 29 2016,positive,liked this movie a lot  good narrative and for the most part well paced acting by some characters rdj in particular is very impressive even the marvel villain is nicely understated and avoids any predictable tropes  action is some of the best on film so credit to the directors and 2nd unit directors   i particularly liked that the film avoided the normal scenes of mass destruction in the final act and instead went for an emotional showdown that you could see they were heading towards but couldnt stop from happening  the ending would have been better if the consequences had been greater
Apr 29 2016,positive,fun ride i had hoped for more in regards to the friendship between cap and bucky more emotion but all in all a great movie
Apr 29 2016,positive,many good things that captain is not one of those
Apr 29 2016,positive,the russo brothers continues the captain america legacy by crafting a successful overlysmart and big conclusion to the trilogy adding more marvel familiar and newer elements but justifying their presence in an emotionalyetexhilarating crossover that might as well serve for a more worthy and iconic sequel to the first avengers even if the humor stands in a minor but constant way it doesnt stops this blockbuster to deliver just as winter soldier did in regards of its quality
Apr 29 2016,positive,think this film series cant get any better well you and i would be very wrong stunning is the only word i can think of part cap part iron man part avengers film it has everything incredible action sequences but also some thought provoking questions not just of right and wrong but who is responsible for the collateral damage of well intentioned actions
Apr 29 2016,positive,an amazing movie with so much comedy emotion and action a true marvel movie great cast with lots of potential especially the new ones like spiderman black panther ant man and i would like to see zemos character develop just a little more as i would very much like to see what he has planned next best marvel comic book and lets face movie in general ever 
Apr 29 2016,positive,marvels captain america civil war could have easily been a 255 if not for chris evans smile at the end of the movie    on a serious note as someone who has read the comics the movie could have done so much better firstly crossbones appearance in the movie just felt like he was used to create buzz for the film when the set images leak happened during the shoot he could have been easily replaced with some hydra assassin or a person with an agenda against the avengers or what not he had an even bigger role in the comics which made it even more so disappointing with how he was used in this movie next the storyline in the comics had spiderman as a critical centerpiece with him being part of iron mans team and revelation of his identity sent out a huge message for other superheroes out there that did not wish to be registered with the government whereas the movie made bucky barnes the main plot point dont call the movie civil war if youre veering that far away from the comics even spideys age is meant to be much older in the comics during civil war plus theres no iron spider outfit wouldnt work in the movies timeline anyway but the trailer spoiled spideys outfit    aside to those the movie was wayyyy toooooo longgggg whats with all the long superhero movies these days  certain parts of the movie dragged out too much and villain had such a weak agenda against the avengers the movie also had way too much happening in just one movie itself  could have almost been a complete mess of a movie if not for its organization    the above made it sound like it was such a bad superhero movie isnt it hey at least its better than bvs but how the film got to a 35 for me aside to chris evans smile had these worked out well    black panthers appearance was fabulous  had that charismatic air to him and all round tenacity that made his story an interesting plot point in the movie the jokes were all on point and i totally enjoyed giant mans appearance that chemistry between scarlet witch and vision was enjoyable to watch whereas the key highlight for me was of course spiderman watching him in his teenage years just starting out and almost abandoning the mission to germany for homework was incredibly adorable to watch and his constant fanboying over the avengers was too cute though he talks a little too much    the movies great fun but just didnt live up the expectations nor hype surrounding it and i probably wouldnt watch it again because it was too draggy good for watching once with a weekday rate at the theatres
Apr 29 2016,positive,what everyone is saying is true this movie is great and sits in the top list among iron man avengers gotg and capitan america tws the movie is not perfect but the low points are very few and well exceeded by the high points   just go watch it you wont be disappointed
Apr 29 2016,positive,best marvel movie epic fights and a good storyline
Apr 29 2016,positive,marvel has a better grip on captain america than any of their heroes and it can be said with confidence that the three movies come together to create the greatest superhero trilogy of all time
Apr 29 2016,positive,another best marvel movies love it
Apr 29 2016,positive,hands down the best marvel film if not the best superhero film  a film big in scale that still feels extremely personal  it couldve easily have been avengers 25 but this is definitely a captain america film  every character feels fleshed out the bonus of having 12 films building up to this moment and they all get their moments to shine  the action is fluid and a pure joy to watch whilst the dialogue is sharp witty with no filler    cant recommend this enough
Apr 29 2016,positive,captain america has always been the strongest character in these stories and this doesnt disappoint whilst filled with stars it still manages to tell a coherent story and include cameos from previous films and the tv spinoffs the time goes quickly and the overall film is very enjoyable wait until the very end for the two extra scenes
Apr 29 2016,negative,same old same old a movie for fanboys a big bore maybe worse then b vs s
Apr 29 2016,positive,civil war is the perfect combination of all mcu ingredients the perfect blockbuster of the year the russo brothers take the comic and adapted the best way possible  im desperate to see infinity war
Apr 29 2016,positive,another year another mavel epic  perhaps becoming a bit formulatic but there is no denying this film is awesome nice to finally see mavels take on spiderman
Apr 29 2016,positive,the russo brothers have a mountain to climb after making the winter soldier a story of spies and secrets which held its own as not just a great marvel film but just an overall fantastic film     civil war begins as more collateral damage hits innocent people as the avengers mission misfires captain america believes the avengers should have the freedom to move the world and keep it safe at any cost tony stark aka iron man disagrees    sides are drawn heroes take their platforms and the stage is set for the biggest superhero showdown ever brought to the big screen yes captain america civil war is the best superhero not comic book that still is held by the dark knight made to date     the russo brothers have again made a film which feels deep layered and difficult to fully make a decision of who is right and who is wrong both have convincing arguments played brilliantly by all the cast the plot is still running and enhancing from its previous films so the platforms for caring about each of these characters is already set its been a eight year job but its been incredibly successful so far the struggles of both sides having a valid reason for their points is only made worse by their personal issues be it protecting a friend or trying not to get anymore people hurt     for a moody tense narrative cw is often lighthearted with lots of comedic moments the introduction of black panther and spiderman doesnt clog its already overflowing either they add to the wheel which continues to spin into what can only be called the best superhero brawl shown on film everyone has their moment to shine which just bursts when its beautifully chereographed and handled by such a fantastic cast and crew     i have no doubt in saying this is the best superhero film made so far weaved and sowed by eight years of creating a cinematic universe for these comic book characters captain america civil war is best marvel film made so far the hard work has paid off
Apr 29 2016,positive,a nearperfectly executed comic book film for the postbourne era fun intelligent and characterdriven without action scenes that feel more grounded and relatable as opposed to laying waste to cgi cities bravo russo bros
Apr 29 2016,neutral,first things first  i am truly entertained but its a very much flawed followup to both captain america the winter soldier and avengers age of ultron its not nearly as powerful or gripping as tws but it also does a much better job of juggling so many different characters than aou did oh and boy do the storyline sound familiar to their dc friend batman v superman sins from their superhero savings earth past come back to haunt them  checked parents issue checked so ironman and batman have similar origin story  heroes fighting super villain collateral damaged come back for revenge  checked wheel chair guy from bvs and slovakia know it all super spy     huge plot hole  checked i am like still waiting for them to explained how the baddies got to know about tony stark parents but he with all his advanced technologies still in the dark after so long short but intense fight scene between the 2 main leads  checked  long movie run time  checked i am not pointing any fingers here but i am sure no critics will complain about it and theyll love it     between civil war and batman v superman hopefully both filmmakers and audiences have fulfilled their need to address the issue of collateral damage and can once again embrace what superhero movies do best namely pure escapism thats not at all to say superhero movies cant or shouldnt address heroes moral culpability or echo real world concerns but continually lecturing to and piling the guilt onto the protagonists and by extension the viewer for superheroes doing what superheroes do is growing rather tedious and frankly taking the fun out of the genre    hands down spiderman and antman are the best thing in this movie they injected the much needed freshness and fun into the show  black panther ably played by chadwick boseman who is as much a regal badass as thor panthers fight scenes are very cool his costume looks great and his emotional arc essentially satisfies the need for an origin story in his own upcoming movie aka wonder women      captain america the winter soldier is my favorite mcu movie its smart characterdriven actionpacked emotional gutsy intense and has something important to say while civil war certainly checks several of those same boxes i simply didnt find it as effective as its predecessor in that sense then it was a letdown to me that was probably phrased poorly as civil war is by no means bad its just a good movie as opposed to the awesome one i had hoped for its central villain is ultimately lackluster and its final act while dramatic lacks the energy and effectiveness of the central action setpiece that assembles the avengers in instantclassic fashion now at least the other vs movie director had the guts to kill off some main character hence creating a very twisty ending 
Apr 29 2016,positive,even if it feels as familiar as a bunch of comic book movies out there its the careful thought and intrincate character dynamics that at expense of its other flaws make the movie shine and triunf in huge emotional and incredible ways
Apr 29 2016,positive,an ambitious spectacle of high budget goodness brought down by an overly crowded and unfocused narrative
Apr 29 2016,positive,a huge 2  12 hours of pure entertainment some fantastic action scenes some great fun some perfectly timed comedyone liners and a good amount of story all characters had their time in the spotlight a great addition to the marvel cinematic universe
Apr 29 2016,positive,picture the biggest action set piece you have ever seen now double it hmm may as well double it again ahh thats better that is civil war
Apr 29 2016,positive,even though we are now many years into the marvel cinematic universe disney and marvel continue to amaze with great movies  while i thought age of ultron was pretty good this movie is one of the best superhero movies i have seen it is action packed but also has a great story where the characters motivations are based upon simple premises rather then the traditional conquer the world ideas that existed in ultron and iron man 3  even if you dont really like super hero movies you will likely like this one
Apr 29 2016,positive,im writing this 4 days after seeing civil war because it has taken me this long to process all i saw in this movie i loved this movie i cannot believe that something this thought provoking exists i was blow away by the acting of chris evans and robert downey jr the promotional campaign was whose side are you on but the movie is so much more than that dichotomy  the writing was superb you understand both tony and caps perspective and its hard to argue against one or the other the action was amazing the introduction of spiderman brilliant all the avengers who made appearances were used exceptionally well the major criticism of this movie is the villain zemo but i really like him i understood his motivations his plan was yes very convoluted but you cant deny the results most of all this movie had the balls to leave you with questions things are not tied up in a pretty bow at the end of this movie the ending was so real so humanbravo joe and anthony russo bravo i look forward to your work in infinity war im going to see this movie a few more times but as of right now this is my favourite mcu movie
Apr 29 2016,positive,it was brilliant definitely one of the best marvel films yet the airport fight scene is probably the best superhero movie fight scene ever the film is also very thought provoking with its themes and actually takes time to look at the characters remember how nobody really cared about vision and scarlet witch in age of ultron you actually give a damn about them in this film the climax is more emotional and subtle then it is epic but it works  but my favourite part had to be spiderman tom hollands version is the most accurate version of the character ever on film seriously my girlfriend every now and then saw me jumping up and down with excitement every time he was on screen as someone whos been a fan of spiderman pretty much their entire life it was like watching him on screen for the first time ever
Apr 29 2016,positive,some parts were uninteresting and unentertaining the fights were good the plot twist at the end was shit this movie did more of action than talking which is good if people are saying this is the best superhero film they really have not watched christopher nolans dark knight trilogy
Apr 29 2016,negative,again marveldisney missed his villains is removed again by not actually at risk of life none of the heroes emblems without mentioning that already seems cliche several tips that are repeated over and over again  very bad
Apr 29 2016,negative,out of all the captain america movies this is my worst out of the 3 in fact this is one of the worst marvel studio movies so far once again another throw away villain this time with a end motivation that made no since to me  from the first 10 minutes of the film i knew where it was going and from then on i was bored the first time i watched winter solider i was on the edge of my sit in civil war i was slumped back in my chair thinking when it was going to end i felt it dragged on too long   i feel like marvel are slowly on a downward spiral age of ultron was no where near as good as the first averages movie and i felt like antman was meh and marvel have really dropped the ball with civil war i was so hyped to see this but felt let down in a big way
Apr 29 2016,positive,captain america civil war was definitely not marvels best picture narrativewise and left me partially disappointed because of the misleading title it is not a captain america film but rather a miniavengers i still need to recognise that this is a really good written directed and shot film that features fantastic performances by the whole cast i really liked how tonys and buckys past was presented to us fleshing out both characters even more and elizabeth olsen surprised me with her fantastic rendition of scarlet witch the weakest part of the plot was the villain and his motivation my favourite aspect of this superhero flick was the cinematography which was top notch in the end i found civil war to be weaker than winter soldier but better than age of ultron
Apr 29 2016,positive,just finisshed watching it and without spoiling the movie here is my quick review      it was a fantastic well throughoutput together film i was thing about halfway though the film how would this get the the point i wanted to see that was in the trailer and they did a fantastic job in setting the stage for a amazing end to this movie whilst also setting up many new characters and also many movies to come    tldr this would have to be close to the best superhero movie i have ever seen
Apr 29 2016,positive,pretty exception film everybody has their own motivation which is so important captain america winter is just a graze better for me as for the best marvel film so far its still the avengers assembled why loki was a better villain that zemo in the latest installment
Apr 29 2016,positive,awesome just awesome
Apr 29 2016,negative,boring piece of rubbish that made me suddenly want to see an arthouse movie and i havent had that thought for a while or any movie about  actual real people it was like no one cares about you superheroes because you are all glum you are witless humourless and taking yourselves way too seriously the whole first 20 minutes dragged on despite the fight scenes which were edited so that they were all choppy which added nothing at all i could not bear to even stay until the end mark my words youll sit there waiting and hoping that surely it will get better than a video game but it doesnt its just tedious cliched predictable dull and boring my husband stayed hoping that i was wrong hed invested far too much in the idea to be able to realise as quickly as i did that the thing stank
Apr 29 2016,positive,captain america civil war is certainly the best movie on the marvel cinematic universe up to date 2 hours and 26 minutes packed with flawless action sequences combined with a quality product and characters we already know and love along with new ones we never thought wed see together on screen provides a joyful experience and it delivers the statement that marvel always manages to stay on top    spoilers     after the fight sequence including scarlet witch falcon and cap that weve seen on the teasers a crucial breaking point to the plot starts to develop after that the movie can turn a little dull for a good 20 minutes but it is also very important because it explains each point of view and the motives that drive the characters to act as they do    spiderman was introduced organically into the story and didnt mess with the continuity of the plot tom holland did a marvelous job as our friendly neighbor spidey he was funny and witty although we couldve gotten a little more peter parker screen time overall i can honestly say that weve seen the best personification of spiderman so far plus the suit looks amazing    antmans paul rudd was very funny as usual even though we couldnt see much of him of course thats understandable since hell be getting his second stand alone movie very soon giantman was a nice surprise thanks funko     black panther was magnificent hes a very powerful intimidating noble emotional and a character with very clear motives his fight sequences are some of the most incredible ive seen on screen    of course the movie was centralized on the internal conflict between the avengers but non of that couldve been possible without baron zemo a somewhat discrete villain managed to create mayhem using the power of persistence and dedication marvel hasnt had many memorable villains but this one delivered its purpose    it was a nice change of pace that the producers decided to take on the story from a darker perspective they did it with the winter soldier and progressively took it onto caps third installment    marvel continues to please the audience and critics that is why we will stand by them till the end of the line wink
Apr 29 2016,positive,a worthy sequel to the first avengers ignores age of ultron which is decent but just doesnt compare comparisons with batman v superman is inevitable but fortunately civil war is much better than bvs in many areas and overall simply the better movie there was not a single moment where i wasnt entertained when i watched the movie even more amazing is how well everything fits together in spite of the crazy amount of cast very big scope    definitely recommended
Apr 29 2016,positive,i went to watch this movie not expecting much i wasnt a huge fan of age of ultron the first iron man the second hulk thor are amongst my favourites what those movies have in common are somewhat of a grounding in reality albeit a hyper one so that being said captain america civil war follows suit and exceeded my expectations of another kid friendly outing ala either avengers movie the russo brothers did an excellent job of mounting the tension between our two literal heroes portrayed by evans and downey jr both arguments between the characters are presented unbiasedly and you can see the for and against likewise you can understand why subsequent characters take the sides that they do hulk and thor are notably missing this is briefly referred to and one wonders if either of the characters being included would have weighed too heavily on the outcome of the inevitable battle scene as everyone knows by now spiderman is bought into the mix and yet again marvel have taken the liberty of rebooting his origins somewhat mild spoiler alert coming up so tony stark now gives spidey the push he needs into becoming a fully fledged superhero after hes admittedly only been swinging around for 6 months prior to their meeting after something happened im assuming he meant the death of his presumably much younger than martin sheen uncle ben if the new aunt may marisa tomei is anything to go by its fine its glossed over quickly but nicely nevertheless this movie has a lot to squeeze in and tom holland sounds exactly how peter parker should sound and has firmly rooted the character back in his proper scrawny teenage roots spidey is basically there as a nice touch a prize for fans and setting up next years homecoming with downey jr likely 100 involved now if only marvel could make a similar deal with fox and get the xmen onboard before the current cast start getting a little too long in tooth civil war could likely be anyones movie but as the story heavily revolves around caps bff bucky its the captains film no matter if youre on his side or not it bounces around the globe each new location having the name of the city emblazoned across the screen in stark white bold letters giving the vibe of a slick spy thriller which to some extent it is performances all around are great from the newcomers and the seasoned cast the big epic faceoff is done not without a good dose of humour and the inclusion of spiderman and antman make it fresh and interesting as each show off their respective skillset but it really comes down to the tension between downey jr and evans that carry this film to an exciting crescendo and the will they wont they still be buddies when all is said and done
Apr 29 2016,positive,in contrast to last months gritty frustrating nonsensical dc hammer blow civil war is a powerhouse showcasing great character development motives and ideologies you understand as they have been built up over 7 films my only real negative not even that is with marvel films plots starting consistently showcase villainsbig bads of the movie being direct results of a specific characters actions such as ultron being created by starks mistakes but the way they use this to set up the final battle is really interesting in all best marvel movie yetcould well be
Apr 29 2016,positive,a great marvel universe movie  the new characters are great especially spidermen     this movie is actually cap america vs iron man and is so much better than batman vs superman in every possible way
Apr 29 2016,neutral,was okay not spectecular
Apr 29 2016,positive,100 oh my god oh jesus christ oh stan lee wow right now im feeling breathless its incredible that after 13 movies looking at all this heroes i am feeling surprise again  they keep doing this better and better captain america civil war is a masterpiece one of the best movies ive ever seen in the super hero genre a lot of well paced action with motivation and two political ideas both with benefits and disadvantages but at the end with reasons you will stay on the edge of your sit from beginning to end and lets talk about the two new introductions black panther is seriously the most serious character of the movie in a great way and spidey well yes he is the best liveaction spider man its like watching the 90s animated tv show from fox kids i cannot believed it i felt like a kid and of course the showdown between all this lovely characters is an orgasmic fight of geek fever the best fight ever and the most fun one 5 stars out of 5 stars
Apr 29 2016,positive,i love the friendship between captain and winter soldier whatever winter soldier did captain always trusts his friend
Apr 29 2016,positive,the best super heroes movie so far
Apr 29 2016,positive,it did not beat winter soldier in my opinion but it is the second best from winter soldier in marvel cinematic universe i was so upset over age of ultron that i was scared to see this spiderman and black panther stole the movie for me it is in my opinion it is a must see film for mcu
Apr 29 2016,positive,smashed it best action scene i have ever seen in the movie
Apr 28 2016,positive,the best movie ever made by marvel so far with a perfect in the argument that i didnt expect the action satirical and suspense are perfectly melted in a great movie
Apr 28 2016,positive,perfect film both in execution and plot
Apr 28 2016,positive,one of the best superhero flicks that hits almost all notes almost full review 
Apr 28 2016,positive,longer than it needs to be but is still a great super hero movie
Apr 28 2016,positive,aside from the bizarre tone changes civil war succeeds in every possible aspect it stands for with well rounded motivations spectacular practical and cgi action sequences and builds a deep story arc for almost every character  something age of ultron and bvs failed to deliver

Apr 28 2016,positive,loved all three cap movies  keeps improving and reeling
Apr 28 2016,neutral,the movie was good but to much yelling and the again they say batman v superman has lots of yelling this movie does and plus batman v superman was way better cause it went by the comics and civil war not really but web head was funny
Apr 28 2016,positive,im not regret to choose the caps side and ill still stay on that side even after hail teamcap oh i am teambucky too now haha
Apr 28 2016,positive,captain america civil war tackles the dilemma of what happens when friends disagree over what is right as usual nice ensemble work from marvel and much more entertaining than dcs recent dreary efforts
Apr 28 2016,positive,this movie is the pinochle of all superhero movies from start to finish it was amazing and would definitely recommend watching this movie over and over again 1010
Apr 28 2016,positive,outstanding the skyfall of comic book movies best depiction of spiderman yet cannot wait to see it again
Apr 28 2016,positive,this movie is awesome  the fight scenes the new character introductions this movie managed to completely shake up the mcu really digging tom holland as the new spiderman he expertly manages to balance the geekyness of peter parker with the sardonic whit of spiderman this could actually be the best portrayal of peter parkerspiderman yet
Apr 28 2016,positive,amazing my first marvel movie in 3d at the cinema      story  continuing off after aftermath of destruction which occurred by ultron in avengers age of ultron and the debut of antman   the avengers are a high risk on the world as many of people have been killed in the name of peace so the government has called them in to take control of the avengers with the a world agreement that they will only be used if they are highly need and to do what the countrys agree a pond what they believe is a threat     bucky barnesthe winter solider returns with steve rogerscaptain america still looking for his best friend after their last battle which took place during the events in captain america the winter soldier where bucky saves steve life and saved him from dying after the falling from a helicarrier in to the water and almost drowning steve knows after hydra brainwashed bucky that their is still good in his friend and it wasnt him the blame for his actions     with hydra gone and all their details uploaded around the world people know about the avengers and hydra around the world so this allow mad men to take advantage to find the avengers weakness     without spoilers team captain america and team iron man are formed who is right and what will happen who will survive     my rating review   action sequences and special visual effects 3d were the best i have seen the stunts in this movie left you saying wow   the storyline was great but was expecting to see more at the ending when you see it you will know what im taking about   characters peter parkerspiderman    and tchallablack panther scott langantman steal the movie they are so great on the big screen cant wait now to see spiderman homecoming and black panther now     i loved this movie was it better the the past movies yes and no in ways each movie is different but the fight sequences and stunt work were the best i have ever seen     i will be seeing this again in the cinema 2d and cant wait to own my copy on 3d blu ray     1110
Apr 28 2016,positive,best marvel movie great casting what a film
Apr 28 2016,positive,brilliant the russo brothers follow up their excellent winter soldier with an absolute tour de force which delivers in every way so good
Apr 28 2016,positive,omg fantastic movie by far the best marvel movie for me after some of the reviews i saw before i went to see it i was going in think zemo was gonna be awful but i didnt actually see much wrong with him he wasnt supposed to be a huge character dont even get me started on the action scenes in this movie they are truly spectacular i will just say one thing and that is the airport scene such a good movie really would encourage u to see it
Apr 28 2016,negative,what a rotten movie
Apr 28 2016,positive,this is marvels best movie to date it manages to juggle over ten superheroes while still telling a personal story and exploring serious themes and issues it introduces black panther and spiderman wonderfully and sets them up for a bright future it also delivers some of the best action sequences you will see in the cinema all year and that airport seen is sure to go down as one of the greatest superhero action scenes of all time an absolute must see
Apr 28 2016,positive,definitely best marvel movie so far
Apr 28 2016,positive,best mcu movie until now
Apr 28 2016,negative,extremely overrated movie it was good but predictable the humour is starting to get a little boring still no progression with the thanos storyline has lost momentum as for this films story arc its a repeat of the oversight story touched on before although we are supposed to pretend its the first time the real war is at the end which has nothing to do with the entire movie its personal between cap n stark pointless 34 of the movie
Apr 28 2016,positive,a film of two halves the first sadly was for me at least very slow and lacked the humour of most marvel films the second half was amazing in every way fast funny exciting and spectacular overall good but not great imho
Apr 28 2016,positive,they turned my wanda into a nugoth 1010
Apr 28 2016,positive,a pleasantly sophisticated thriller that effectively handles a significant ensemble of marvel characters very effectively the third instalment of the captain america series is tailored with a strong storyline to push its thoughtprovoking themes and character development across of which the audience can engage with and relate to the classic marvel humour is also something that deserves praise as this is one of the most enthralling mcu entries yet
Apr 28 2016,negative,maybe im just getting old to this kind of thing but the infamous civil war of the title was the one inside my brain wondering what our blockbuster industry has become its certainly an improvement from the mediocre avengers 2 but still use better your money
Apr 28 2016,positive,captain america civil war russo 2016 its hard to point out which part of the film i didnt like thats if i hated anything 1010
Apr 28 2016,positive,simply awesome the best movie of the year
Apr 28 2016,positive,without a doubt the best mcu movie to date
Apr 28 2016,positive,really interestin how the managed the plot of this confict and adapted it to a film
Apr 28 2016,positive,perfectly handles all characters and relationships between teams and teammates are hilarious and seriously amazing showing the great directing of the russo brothers
Apr 28 2016,positive,thoughtprovoking superhero flick that moves the marvel cinematic universe forward
Apr 28 2016,neutral,it was good but the story was kinda week with some dope fight sequences why tony stark jumped to the 15 year to fight  assassins thieves and the living wepon thats so dangerous and not daredevil or some other more experianced hero i still dont no  and then it kinda just kinda  ends with a quick 30 sec fix to tie up loose ends seems they threw a lot of stuff in without a solid reason have to watch it again though
Apr 28 2016,positive,capitain america civil war manages to be a lot different from the comic source but still a very solid and overall incredible movie black panther and spidey make their amazing debute but they dont outshine the rest of the heroes and this creates a perfect balance between the two teams and literally splits the audience in half
Apr 28 2016,positive,captain america civil war    the brothers that made captain ameirca the winter soldier have done it again and they have done it better with more action with more ideas a very fine film there is a divide of ideologies between two camps in the avengers team one sides with the hero of the film probably the most fair uncompromising good natured super hero in screen captain america who thinks well that with an international council overseeing and deciding everything for the avengers simply is not good enough captain america gives his hesitance on the issue that the agenda objectives of people in that international council can be arbitrary and their whims and actions decisions will indeed overrule them   this is an acceptable concern but tony thinks that this a good device to have more control and not get involved into this tony is very headstrong arrogant egomaniac megalomaniac sometimes he imperially decides what is best for everyone captain america will not bend or break he believes in good in the people he has faith in them that they can do better his perception of faith and hope that people can continue to improve ameliorate always including his estranged old friend bucky james barnes for him barnes is more than a friend he is family and you dont give up on family there is a conniving plot by zemo played by daniel brunl an underrated actor that has a nuanced performance he has a covert scheme that is a shock the avengers fight against themselves the fight is leipzig is melee fighting it is not bad but not the best part of the movie the best part of the movie is the climax the denouement of the fight between the protagonist characters the heroes one a good hero the other one a flawed one even an anti hero they fight with all the strength might breath tears sweat blood everything is left in the soil in the deck in the ground it is spectacular fight the goodness of captain america and the despair the agony the sadness in iron man truly the best part of the film that leaves you subdued in an emotional level you are spend with these characters that had had differences but had worked together yet they have totally different perspectives and beliefs one is more good the other more flawed and visceral both think they are right stark is too arrogant to admit he could be wrong   the plot is very good the fights are very good except the melee and disorder in leipzig that is a good place to put the fight because leipzig was the place where the battle of nations happened in 1813 between the napoleonic forces and the allied nations guided by tsarist russia it was an interesting historical correlation this is the best marvel film ever better than the winter soldier with the brother directors now in charge with avengers infinity war expect films at the same level of excellence bravo
Apr 28 2016,positive,fans will not be disappointed with this latest  installment of the marvel  cinematic universe  full of fun action and drama it will make you say hello  captain big fan  makes you think who you gonna side with
Apr 28 2016,positive,immediately at my top 5 of all times
Apr 28 2016,positive,captain america 3 is another great addition to the marvel cinematic universe this time the films basically avengers 3 as it features almost every superhero weve seen so far plus a few new ones natashablack widow johansson continues her close association with stevecaptain america evans  which worked really well in the last film  but cap also has samfalcon mackie as his righthand man too the premise is quite simple the sokovia accords instead of the superhuman registration act from the 2006 mark millar comics the films based on are new laws forced on the avengers by ross hurt us secretary of state as the un wants to see the avengers held accountable for their actions since too many people died in the fake country sokovia during the events of avengers 2 tonyiron man downey jr is all for it but cap is not    buckywinter soldier stan then becomes involved and a massive manhunt ensues the film goes to more countries than a bond film and the avengers are divided into an even six vs six iron man black widow rhodeswar machine cheadle tchallablack panther boseman vision bettany and peterspiderman holland vs cap falcon winter soldier wandascarlet witch olsen clinthawkeye renner and scottantman rudd the fight about twothirds in with only the hulk and thor missing is epic  definitely something everyone wants to see some great quips too mostly thanks to antman and spiderman  would love to see that teamup film as theres no malevolence just a group of superhero friendsacquaintances fighting for what and who as the films definitely captain america v iron man at its heart they think is right     there could still be a little more done with buckys backstory  which kind of get mixed in with iron mans  but maybe i just need to rewatch captain america 1 again as it just seems like his  caps chemistry isnt quite there also needs to explore the sharon carter vancamp storyline more the introduction of black panther and spiderman is handled superbly with spiderman only getting two scenes but holland nails them  the new spiderman films will be in good hands and boseman as black panther is fantastic full of poise and just the right amount of anger  plus great fighting skills cant wait for his film in a few years    overall i thought it was better than avengers age of ultron but not quite as good as captain america the winter soldier the ending probably dragged out a little and didnt quite resolve everything with zemo bruhls plot not being as interesting as it couldve been still some great action some decent ethical questions and some truly inventive fight scenes
Apr 28 2016,positive,the movie is truly spectacular and by far the best action drama to date amazing actors great writing its everything you need to be happy i saw it two times already and i will see it lots more my favourite scene is the car scene the old car scene youll know when you see it 
Apr 28 2016,positive,way back in 2008 can you believe it has been that long marvel released its first shared universe film iron man pretty much you know the story after that this is the 13th film in the shared universe and the start of phase 3 for the mcu there have been high points avengers iron man 3 and some low points avengers  age of ultron thor the dark world but the ultimate gamechanging genre defying film was captain america  the winter soldier it shook the foundations of the shared universe and captivated an audience with a spy genre thriller that proved to be one of marvels most successful and loved films to date    to say that this was sitting in the back of my mind the whole time i was watching this is an understatement and i am proud to say that this film almost hits that high that may disappoint some viewers expecting avengers 25 edition the film serves straight up as a sequel to winter soldier with steve rodgers chris evans on the search for his best friend bucky barnes sebastian stan and to help flush out the evil brain wash he was subject to for years in addition to this after public pressure general ross william hurt thats right the one from the incredible hulk presents the sarkovia accord  basically enforcing the avengers to fall under united nations control and authority before they assemble tony starkiron man robert downey jnr says yes and captn rodgers says no    i dont want to give too much more away of the plot here as there are a few surprises in store action wise this film raises the bar for superhero action films it packs in a lot of characters antman iron man falcon black widow captain american black panther spiderman scarlet witch the vision hawkeye war machine and the winter soldier that are not struggling for screen time it does present a complex and well told story at 2 and a half hours and completes the captain america trilogy to deliver imo the best super hero trilogy on screen    so you are waiting to hear about the big airport action scene right well its at the end of the movie and it is better than the previews make it look its long its orgasmically nerdalicious and should please comic book fans and anyone who has followed the mcu films all the characters face off against each other in different combos and is hands down my favourite super hero scene of any mcu film ever    newcomers spiderman and black panther are given enough screen time to wet your appetite  and leave you wanting more spideys trademark humour is present here and fortunately this time next year we get the first homecoming film black panther aka tchalla getting his own movie in 2018 pounces and scratches his way through the blurry of heroes to warrant a origins story and inclusion in the mcu personally black panther is my favourite marvel character so this has been a long time coming for me and i was not disappointed    i saw this in 2d and i am so glad i did i have heard horror stories about headaches and blurred vision as the onslaught of cgi fighting muddles the eyes so my recommendation is as always 2d for a post conversion film another question i have been getting is will you pick a side you might but i did not the script delivers compelling arguments for both sides and all through the film i found myself switching my support i was really surprised by this as i love cap so i cw3expected to team cap all the way    while this film does not exceed the surprise and thrill factor of its predecessor winter soldier it does exceed by delivering a satisfying finale to the captain america trilogy and gives the russo brothers an opportunity to show joss wheedon how to deal with so many characters in a superhero movie    captain america  civil war is playing in cinemas in australia now it will open in the north america next thursday
Apr 28 2016,positive,absolutely brilliant  the best avengers film yet albeit its technically a captain america film but it felt a lot less disney and a lot more marvel the inclusion of spiderman as hes reintroduced was brilliant great to see most of the stars of the mcu and brought together a lot more action and less family based really enjoyable film would go as far as saying one of the best yet loved black panther in it as well
Apr 28 2016,positive,just seen civil war the first half of the movie has major problems its too long too slow and too boring luckily the second half more than makes up for it its emotional funny has exiting fights and even some romance and spiderman kicks ass in the end civil war is better than age of ultron but not half as good as winter soldier
Apr 28 2016,positive,not much of a war but more like after school slapping and hairpulling im team spidey
Apr 28 2016,positive,avengers 3 i mean captain america civil war was awesome
Apr 28 2016,positive,simply amazing so many awesome things and im am beyond existed for spiderman
Apr 28 2016,positive,the first thing i want to say in this rottentomatoes review is this anyone who watches this movie and doesnt enjoy it especially those who are willing to take time to write a negative review of this movie probably doesnt understand action movies doesnt understand the superhero movie genre doesnt like comic books and wonders why anyone would make a movie about people who wear costumes  for this movie to have migrated from 95 positive reviews to 90ish is proof that the internet is made to ruin good things      review in brief  action 4 stars  plot 35 stars  casting 5 stars  directing 45 stars  overall 4 stars      lets get a couple of things right before we talk about this movie with the minimum number of spoilers  first it is utterly unfair to marvel and the talent associated with this movie to think that the audience ought to be able to walk into this movie without having seen all the other movies before it which is something like 7 movies and may be more like 9 or 10 given that the mcu canon version of thunderbolt ross is in this movie  they are not making these movies to standalone and in that purpose is one reason not to pan this movie this movie is a sequal and as marvel movie 9 its quality overall is a monument to something which may never have been done in cinema history before it delivers a product as good or better than the first movie in the series    to that end the complaint that this movie is a formula movie is a horrible reductionistic observation  every movie is made inside a formula and in the end the audience is left to judge whether or not the final product is a good or bad version of that formula  my suggestion is that marvel and the russos have mastered the formula and do something especially clever with it they honor the core audience comic book nerds and also appeal to the wider audience action movie nerds while giving some service to the wider audience still movie nerds    im not going to rehash the plot here or otherwise spoil it but a lot of people have written about how this movie is about current political themes  that observation misses the way this movie is made  which is that it is a movie about charismatic protagonists who must deal with the consequences of responsibility failure and loss  there are three takes on this subject in this movie  tony stark steve rogers and tchalla of wakanda  if you watch this movie as a study of the resolution of personal failure and loss and how we redeem the past to make the future it becomes a far better movie than the one about solving a problem with our fists    go see this movie at least twice  you will like it much better the second time and you will have everything you need to tell the naysayers about it to find something better to do with their time
Apr 28 2016,positive,best marvel movie to date brilliant story telling excellent action the way they brought on tchalla and spidey has me incredibly excited for what the future holds for the mcu
Apr 28 2016,positive,does a lot of good things spiderman and black panther are effectively introduced and the big action scenes dont disappoint  on the other hand the central conflict gets a little contrived and zemos big reveal is disappointing  probably about 5th in the total mcu rankings
Apr 28 2016,positive,this year we had a battle of heroes on two comic book platforms dc and marvel batman vs superman started it last month and while it had its moments it was very bleak dark and just not fun enter marvel with itswait doing the math here13th movie in its saga and it blows the competition aka dc out of the water being in the capable hands of the russo brothers who also directed the previous cpt america movie the film is fun exciting actionrich and plainly just great few mishaps is given like martin freemans character is plain useless and the villains masterplan fails at the masterpart but then theres the good stuff the heroes ranks are multiplyed with the very welcome adds of black panther chadwick boseman and spiderman tom holland in its third incarnation and they both perform well spidey earing top marks but then theres the scene were our heroes are divided and are forced to fight each otherwords cant express how awesome that scene was it had great action but it also had insanely funny humor the whole movie theater was laughing at the jokes with me and that was the main thing while the movie has its dark and darker moments it was funny  overall the movie had its flaws but with the heroes vs heroes moments being incredible this movie was one of marvels best productions to date
Apr 28 2016,positive,this movie is like avengers 25
Apr 28 2016,positive,easily in my top 3 favorite marvel movies the airport scene alone was worth it black panther is so dope omfg i cant wait for his movie to come out spiderman is the best film adaptation of spiderman so far time to look forward to dr strange
Apr 28 2016,positive,great movie love it
Apr 28 2016,positive,best of all  after i watched the civil war it seems that deadpool movie and batman v superman feels down love the conflict  the wave of contradiction and swinging emotions for me civil war was the best marvel movie yet  even better than the avengers movie
Apr 28 2016,positive,thats how its done plot  character dev  laughs  bonkers action  greatness
Apr 28 2016,positive,what dc did wrong mavel excelled
Apr 28 2016,positive,if you need me ill be there
Apr 28 2016,positive,brilliant sequel russo brothers managed to do better than captain america winter soldier which i considered the best marvel in silver screen new spidey kinda ok and ill definitely watch spiderman homecoming    captain america is always be my marvel nonmutant no1 superhero he always display loyalty and stand proud even the world against him     antman  scarlet witch are two supporting characters which catch my eyes good plot for em cant say the same for thunderbolt ross aka red hulk which has small role in this film    baron helmut zemo bruhl is just what id imagine cunning and should be compared with loki although his background story is tame in my opinion    anyway hail hydra
Apr 28 2016,positive,this film is a very good and the running time flies by so you dont know it is 2 hours plus i love this film was the way to do with two heroes fighting each other
Apr 28 2016,positive,captain america civil war shows us solid well crafted action scenes and well developed characters the humour and drama is also well balanced
Apr 28 2016,positive,my two biggest complaints about the mcu so far were the lack of consequences and a lack of great villains well talk about the villain later but for now lets focus on the story and the ripple effect it has on future mcu movies because when you have team captain america and team iron man going at each other it shouldnt be a surprise that things will not be the same and the russo brothers made a great job at building up to this iconic clash while also seamlessly include the newcomers black panther and spiderman  the captain and iron man always had their disagreements since their first encounter in the avengers but when tony stark wants all of the avengers to sign the sokovia accords in order to be supervised by a special board and stever rogers strongly disagrees their clash reaches its peak in a brillantly filmed action sequence at the leipzig airport  months before the films release the marketing also tried to divide the fans between teamcap and teamironman but the film itself even though a captain america movie at its core never leans to one side or the other both characters have their motives and bring valid points as to why the believe in what they are doing and while being a movie about an allout war between the super heroes it also focuses on the undying friendship between steve rogers and bucky barnes aka the winter soldier a friendshipt that ultimately leads to the civil war and the tragic inclusion of tchalla as the black panther  there is so much going on so many story lines and characters to be taken care of and that is where this movie truly shines not in the visuals and the fight scenes which are fantastic but the focus the russo brothers managed to keep throughout the whole runtime of 2 12 hours  and although captain america civil war is similar to the winter soldier a more serious adventure compared to other mcu movies it still has its fair share of laughs especially when it comes to spiderman marvel really knows its characters and how to bring out the best in them while still including them into the bigger picture without any problems  the weakness of this movie is a very familiar one in the mcu the villain he is just there drinks coffee and eats bacon    it is one of marvels best pictures a more serious one that still never forgets to entertain the audience and bring much needed consequences into the mcu consequences which will have its effects in future phase 3 movies and find its ultimate conclusion in the infinity war movies
Apr 28 2016,positive,i might be biased ive seen all of mcu films loved most hated none though   i just like a good story adding superhero element to it is just fascinating to the eyes what the russo brothers did with winter solider was brilliant and they stepped it up a hell of a notch with this one call it a marketing ploy or whatever you want but this film made me appreciate iron man 2 more and i thought it was the weakest out of the iron man trilogy   its one enjoyable film that even if you arent a fan of superhero genre can get a kick out of the action sequences greengrassstyle this is a pg13 mcu version of finchers se7en with hints of other influential films of old the russos sure are students of films   i place civil war at the top of my most favorite mcu film to date
Apr 28 2016,positive,very satisfying everyone is entertaining
Apr 28 2016,positive,thats what a super heroes confrontation should look like with the same old great cast a compelling plot and exceptional visual effects captain america civil war becomes one of if not the best marvel movie
Apr 28 2016,positive,one of the best action movies ive seen in years the russo brothers once again deliver a blockbuster political drama with stellar performances from both the main and supporting cast phase 3 has kicked off with a bang and i suspect its impact on the superhero medium will be discussed for many years to come
Apr 28 2016,positive,yesterday it was premiere and time for the second big superhero film this year captain america civil war i really like captain america as a superhero mostly due to his lack of over powerful strength he is a soldier who during wwii was subjected to experiments intended to make him a super soldier the result was superhuman powers but nowhere near the likes of superman or the hulk frozen down and later awaken in present day earth he struggles to adapt in modern society where everyone he has known or loved is gone in civil war he is pinned against iron man the government of the usa forces the avengers to sign a contract stating that they have to obey and work under supervision of the leaders of the world iron man is convinced that it is the right thing to do while captain claims that they will be forced to do things they dont want to    i really liked captain america civil war and i would say that it is one of marvels and overall among the best superhero films ever made forget supermans or the avenger films extremely over powerful enemies that practically can erase the earth with a wind blow here it is brains before muscles and i like it the film practically has more in common with james bond and the mission impossible films than with other superhero films the spy theme is pretty constant throughout the film with for example a hunt for a terrorist through several countries there is also focus on terror acts which feels both modern and disturbing considering todays world situation the other thing that the film does really well is balancing the characters civil war contains a lot of superheroes and it is at times hard to keep track on everyone but with finesse and a prioritised focus they choose which ones will run the story and which ones will figure as background characters very smart and thoughtout with most focus on captain america and then iron man they succeed much better than the previous avenger films and most of all the latest batman v superman    the biggest question we all had before the film was how will they put captain america against iron man where batman v superman totally failed to motivate why those two giants would even fight each other here they succeeded better from an even more difficult position because captain america and iron man are friends that becomes enemies due to ideological and psychological differences overall the characters actions are really well motivated they have worked hard on giving every character a believable back story that drives them forward aside from the main conflicts and the superheroes it is an incredibly well made film the battle between the superheroes is so good looking and well choreographed that i cant think of an equal also the tempo and editing of the film works well towards it pretty long but still good runtime the film constantly moves closer to the truth with small surprise moments and turning points along the way it is perhaps necessary to have watched some of the other marvel films before this one but i still think that this works well on its own and that you should definitely take the chance to watch it in the cinemas because it is really exciting good looking and well made without a dubt 4 out of 5    david lindahl  
Apr 28 2016,positive,marvel never disappoints this film is filled with action humor emotions they elaborate more on tony and buckys past i still dont like spiderman though the way they wrote his character reminds me of quicksilver in xmen dofp would definitely recommend everyone to watch this film
Apr 28 2016,positive,this movie is amazingly fun and pure awesome
Apr 28 2016,positive,perfectly executed in story action sequences all perfection
Apr 28 2016,positive,great storylineairport battle alone is worth an entire movie amazing how everything fits within 25hrs captainamericacivilwar 55scales
Apr 28 2016,positive,there was a lil more thought given to character development and this really wasnt about capt a but defending ones sense of justice and protecting those we profess to care about i have to say this was done much better than the recent instalment of batman vs superman
Apr 28 2016,positive,6 on 6 showdown testing friendships trust vengeance loyalties and standing up for ones beliefs peteys a bit out of place but the rest of the movies quite engaging still love the ol capn but that kiss was a bit much after all pegs still warm
Apr 28 2016,positive,awesome actionawesome characters and chemistry between those charactersawesome cameos and an awesome twist theyve run in the ground and the unexpected humor  i would give it more if the airport fight lasted a bit longer
Apr 28 2016,positive,i live in colombia and i saw it last night its a really espectacular movie rich argument awesome action and balanced humor the movie has some twists that change the history i like the clean introduction of the new team members finally let us audience with great expectations about what happen next
Apr 28 2016,positive,interesting plot maybe a sidgetoo much fighting
Apr 28 2016,positive,although civil war is kind of a misnomer the movie definitely holds up to the hype it also demonstrates why solo movies are so important to the progression of the mcu overall plot in order to get the spectacle that we see in civil war the plot had to suffer a little in the form of not progressing forward as much as you might hope it would make sure you stay for both aftercredits scenes one in the beginning and one at the very end
Apr 28 2016,positive,if you can put aside the occasional shakycam and a slightly rushed untied ending  and you will be able to put it aside  this movie is magnificent while the action remains a strong point civil war never forgets what drives every conflict and thats the characters theyre  all so true to themselves including those weve only just been introduced to winter soldier is a hard one to beat as movies in the mcu go but this might just do it
Apr 28 2016,positive,a marvel film is usually overthetop in senseless action polluted plot and frequently leaves its characters unable to reach their full potential captain america winter solider breathed air into the franchise giving us hope that great things lay upon the horizon and did they achieve what they promised and ultimately granted us what we all most wanted yes yes  yes  captain america civil war is by far the best marvel film to date without question hands down to the russo brothers and the spectacular cast for giving us this blockbuster and speaking of spectacular tom holland was born play spiderman
Apr 28 2016,positive,exciting heartbreaking and very very fun the action sequences are fantastic the plot is a little to dense with the large cast but it doesnt damage the movie
Apr 28 2016,positive,mature and smooth comfortable entertainment
Apr 28 2016,positive,mature and smooth comfortable entertainment
Apr 28 2016,positive,america fuck yeah    the third captain america film civil war was to put it simply just absolutely incredible the russo brothers have hit it out of the park once again following winter soldier nailing almost every single aspect of the film including the action the plot the characters and the humour it is once again the whole package before the films release they described winter soldier as a political thriller and stated that this film is more in the vein of a psychological thriller and man that is exactly what is was the way this film looked at the conflict between the characters as more than just superheroes kicking and punching each other gave this film a tone unlike any other marvel film it deals a lot with psychological trauma tragedy death and consequences and how all of those themes affect the mindsets of our heroes and that does a great job at humanising the characters which hasnt really been done before in the universe     fyi you may think you are smarter than everyone else and think you know exactly how the film is going to play out from start to finish but i assure you that you do not even know 90 of the events in this film and how they will play out so much of this film has been shrouded in secrecy and it makes the film so much more enjoyable when the big omg moments hit and you didnt see them coming at all the captain america vs iron man aspect of the film is only really the surface of what this film has to offer in terms of plot it goes a lot deeper than you think and as expected there were a few seperate plot lines that you are asked to keep track of over the course of the film and the way it was edited to swap between the storylines made all plotlines very cohesive and easy to follow and you may think at one or two moments what a certain storyline has to do with the rest of the film but before you have a chance to complain they manage to tie everything up with a nice little bow where pretty much everything in the film affected the bigger picture     now as always a captain america film directed by the russo brothers is bound to have some intense action scenes but once you bring on the directors of john wick to help film those action scenes all of a sudden expectations go through the roof if youve seen john wick youll know what i mean and the action in the end was oh so very amazing just the way it was shot with some far wide shots depicting massive epic moments or closer more in your face brutal moments was so goddamn crazy to watch the choreography too especially in that gem of a fight at the airport was so cool it was just great to see them match their powers and go toe to toe with each other and i gotta say this film most definitely has the best and the most exciting action scenesequence in any marvelsuperhero film ever hands down so be ready to have your mind blown and you know from the outset that they arent really trying to kill each other as vision would decimate everyone in a second but that doesnt mean the fights arent brutal as hell     there are multiple times in the film where you can tell that theyre not holding back and it just upped the intensity of the scenes immensely but where there are your more serious gritty fights you still have your large scale royal rumble showdowns that incorporate a perfect amount of cool shots clever humour and little quips here and there that really suck you into the scene and everyone does share the humour around but a certain web slinging someone does bring a lot to the table really though these fight scenes were just so goddamn entertaining that i had the stupidest smile on my face during them and youll enjoy them too     and now you cannot talk about this film without having to address the thing a number of people were either concerned about of just unnecessarily pissed off about and that is the comments sooking about too many characters or this is supposed to be a captain america film or what is this avengers 25 so for all those people having a nice little sook about something they are assuming about the film based on nothing other than the amount of heroes in it heres what i have to say to you this is first and foremost a captain america movie not avengers 3 and the russo brothers did a fantastic job at handling the number of characters in a way that gives everyone a suitable amount of screentime and despite some characters not being in the film as much not a single character felt forced in there just because the way all the characters were introduced felt very natural and they played a role that was as significant as youd expect that character to play there was one character though who for me wasnt used right in the film they did make a direct impact on the plot but i wasnt overly satisfied with how it was handled i wont say anything due to spoilers but i guarantee you that 80 of people leaving the theatre wont be able to tell you who they are because they either didnt know or completely forget they were even in the film just something minor     and finally fucking spiderman is in this movie and all i will say about him is that tom holland is hands down the best and by far the most entertaining spiderman we have seen on the big screen and even though we havent seen him in his own film yet i am still confident in telling tobey maguire to move over as my favourite spiderman so in the end this is a marvel film you should know basically what you are going to get from this film but being a psychological thriller it does differentiate itself from the other superhero films in the universe     and remember there are two after credits scenes once again so dont be the person who leaves early as everyone stares at you wondering why    910
Apr 28 2016,positive,captain american civil war isnt just the best captain america movie but is probably the best marvel studios movie to date the caps movie have been my favourite since the off with the capt a the first avenger that gave us a war movie which alway had the feel of an indiana jones movie to the espionage and emotional beats of the winter soldier these movies go from strength to strength civil war is no different  it balances great action scenes big and small with character development and emotional story telling it also does well with its ever growing universe of characters developing and relationships between at no point do any of these character feel shoe horned in everyone have a purpose in this movie and are used well used  the movie is genuinely fun and has real moment of shock and awe but it is also funny and heart felt   this movie has be call avengers 25 which it is but it doesnt do it justice yes it movies the mcu and you can start to see the threads of the infinity wars starting to come together but at its heart it is a captain america movie
Apr 28 2016,positive,this is a great captain america movie but also shows us a sequel to the avengers
Apr 28 2016,positive,best marvel movie to date 28416
Apr 28 2016,positive,dark just like bvs but with humor spidermanwoah antmanwow
Apr 28 2016,positive,its the fightingsuperheroes movie that everyone deserves
Apr 28 2016,positive,if you are a comic fan you are not going to like it but as a movie its really good
Apr 28 2016,positive,one of the worst marvel movies ever    i am a big fan of marvel movies and was so excited to see this movie sadly it disapointed me at almost every level    the villain was bad  the cg was not really good  the morals of the characters just suddenly disappear  the ending left a sour taste in my mouth  the characters were badly written in this movie    some of the few positives    antman  spiderman  the humor
Apr 28 2016,positive,a filmmaking triumph makes me realise that the superhero genre isnt going weary or seasoning deconstructing the marvel cinematic universe has never been done so beautifully each character was given such a magnitude it even made me like hawkeye keep em coming
Apr 28 2016,positive,pretty entertaining  good action and a few surprises esp a big one at the end
Apr 28 2016,positive,freaking awesome 3
Apr 28 2016,positive,it was definitely a good movie but i felt like the climax didnt live up to the amazing second act still it definitely has its memorable scenes and is up there as one of marvels finest movies to date
Apr 28 2016,positive,rating 5 out of 5 a perfect superhero movie     when writing this review on captain america civil war i am trying to find faults in what i believe is a near perfect super hero movie     this movie is the good work of all the marvel movies beforehand and something that dc tried to do with superman vs batman     why its important to know the other movies is to learn the true characters and their principles and how all of them are challenged by not only the laws that the government are trying to introduce but also their alliance towards their colleagues friends against friends     we also get to meet some new characters into the marvel universe which was very welcoming when the come into play     all the key highlights cannot be revealed in this review as i believe they are spoilers but lets say this movie is worth seeing     people have touted this as the best marvel movie and i have to agree i will one further to say that captain america civil war is the empire strikes back of the marvel universe
Apr 28 2016,positive,better than bvs easily the fight isnt forced its reasonable and the groundwork for the fights raison detre was laid down carefully bit by bit i have a bit of complaint about the sides rogers and stark took considering their natural temperaments but ill let it pass since most of the story was rationalized well except perhaps the villain who was a bit unbelievable im not a comic fan so idk who that guy is and the movie didnt show any background on him on how he could do all those shit  you might not want to bring the kiddos though my son didnt liked it much he said superheroes arent supposed to fight each other theyre supposed to fight the bad guys
Apr 28 2016,positive,balancing alot of main characters and plotpoints has always been a worrisome factor in alot of movies avengers did it with pure finesse due to whedons direction however age of ultron fell flat captain america civil war however puts marvel back in the reign by doing all the main heroes justice yet maintaining a welldriven plot that flows smoothly without a hitch     the acting in a marvel movie has never been this good everyones motivations is clear cut anyone complaining about wandas accent in age of ultron will think twice here chris evans and robert downey jr has stepped up their game the usual flamboyant robert downey portrays a rather broken tony stark and it is absolutely convincing while chris evans portrays a steve rogers with heavy doubt about the silverlining between freedom and security    also anyone expecting this movie to be a jokefest who am i kidding of course theres jokes in there but more like a quarter of jokes compared to age of ultron and its very well done and doesnt put a halt to the seriousness or smoothness of the plot the action scenes are some of the best in the mcu and im not exaggerating everyones ability is used to its maximum potential
Apr 28 2016,positive,marvel did one thing dc didnt do civil war has been and will grab the favourable reviews due to marvel establishing the background stories of the fresh characters they introduced in this movie and simultaneously exploring the background of the other characters that have been already established with further depth this formula will rake in the projected millions if you have read the comic book event the way mark millar had crafted the story it would have been abit easy for you to not take tonys side whereas here the russo brothers have showcased a battle of personal values and morals to such an extent that i was just left wondering if i was really partial to cap although evans didnt disappoint as expected with his unwavering and steadfast sense of values its downey jr who really makes you feel emphathy with his acting we all have seen stark as the sanctimonious larger than life and sarcastic individual that we hate to love in the past movies heretony is finally seen as a mere man who has nothing left and is nothing but empty without purposeboseman and holland do massive justice to their comic book counterparts with brühl delivering a fantastic portrayal of baron zemo a nefarious villain with methodical schemeswith the more then slight deviation of origin from the comics overall an easy 45 enjoyable to the very end  ps  there are 2 post credit scenes for civil war
Apr 28 2016,positive,this is a complete pure treat after that major mess baca bvs  and marisa tomei is both absolute pleasure and distraction in civil war p
Apr 28 2016,positive,what i like most about civil war is the different perspective it offers ya kno we watch superhero films and when the huge battle against the big baddies are done were left wondering what happens in the wake of the battlewhat about the buildings destroyed the innocent people killed they won and theres a big celebration at the end but at times a great cost costs that sometimes arent touched upon  superhero films tend to no longer explain these making the actions of the protagonists look like theyre without repercussions but civil war finally treads those lands i especially loved the level of vulnerability that our heroes displayed here at times it got a little heavy  id want to say more but i might spoil the film and i dont want thati want everyone to enjoy the experience as much as i did if you havent seen it yet go do so now
Apr 28 2016,positive,amazing movie very entertaining  very well done great acting great job in general but the most important thing is that the movie does an amazing job in presenting the plot and placing the characters inside that plot their ideologies and the different points of view they are all there and they were all very well done the action scenes are simply awesome
Apr 28 2016,positive,captain america  civil war  first things first no spoilers ahead so relax d    its extraordinary brilliant evenly matched for both team awesomely plotted superb fantastic  im running out of words to say its marvelous in every way honeybunnys    nobodys wrong here no ones promoting evil no ones the bad guy   we just have different ways of being the good guy and that can get fiery    its emotional intense and with perfectly placed humor and fullsized roller coaster fun  the best ever marvel movie since the avengers  what are you waiting for grab your tickets before they ran out and those who have it my friend youre in for a treat of a lifetime
Apr 28 2016,positive,if you are a fan of the mcu civil war is in the elite group of these films along with the avengers winter soldier and guardians of the galaxy  the story is outstanding with no real good guys or bad guys its an honest disagreement about heavy topics with weighty consequences because of this unusual formula one does not generally know where this movie will take us to next or how the conflict will be resolved if it will be resolved  there is plenty of drama suspense humour and character development that never left me bored during this 25 hour romp  the characters are well written and fleshed out it truly is an achievement that so many characters were served equally well ive seen many complaints about the villain but i believe it was due to the fact the writers decided to call him zemo if they didnt name him zemo then we have a simple villain with an explainable skill set and motivation does his plan depend on coincidences sure but it doesnt overly suspend our engagement of the film  the only complaint i have about the movie is the first couple of action sequences are hard to watch because of the shakycam especially in handtohand combat but the last two conflicts are wonderfully shot and the effects are amazing  marvel you have produced these quality films for a long time now and i look forward to see what will happen next  this is a must see for comic book film fans and action fans
Apr 28 2016,positive,i think this one is the best yet from the mcu but  the first iron man is really my favoritewhen everything in the movie is so fine really really good 
Apr 28 2016,positive,probably the best marvel superhero movie ive seen so far torn among capwinter soldier the first avengers movie and this one it was very entertaining as what you may always expect from a marvel film and while the plot was quite simple the acting and the story line was very powerful the cap v iron man plot was very great and emotional i honestly felt all emotions while watching and its a fight thats definitely being cooked up by marvel ever since the iron man 2 movie when tony used caps shield as some kind of wedge i really felt that 25 hours was not enough since it was so action packed and entertaining that it makes you go asking for more but overall it was a very emotional action filled and wonderful addition to marvels films spideys scenes were so memorable as well
Apr 28 2016,positive,captain america civil war launches phase 3 with an absolutely delightful action packed debut that results in bold outcomes laying the foundation to the future of the marvel cinematic universe although its low on the risk and unpredictability department it manages to push forward with sheer exhilaration and topclass entertainment factor
Apr 28 2016,positive,amazing batman v superman should learn from them
Apr 28 2016,positive,i  love mcuand i cant wait to see this movie after reading these critic reviews
Apr 28 2016,negative,this movie was bad cs of iron man was just bad like his head head got stuck on a doll i started laughing at parts of the dialoge becouse it was so badly writhen the force these charachtes against each other but it makes no sence why its just so forced this movie is usless when you look at it its just a fight no set up for nothing its a forced conflict it sets up relations but ruins them oke spider man was good thats it
Apr 27 2016,positive,grab yo bitch n take her to see it
Apr 27 2016,positive,this movie is definitely a long yet funexciting actionpacked film that marvel studios has ever made aside from that the film deepens between cap and stark as they settle their differences and the opinions in regards to their accountability to the government which would bring out the best and the worst case scenarios within the film in addition to that characters such as spiderman black panther and antman were incredibly portrayed in the film the plot was amazing and the fighting scenes were definitely worth watching
Apr 27 2016,positive,best movie of the year so far hands down never thought marvel could hit such high peak
Apr 27 2016,positive,captain america civil war is brilliant     the russo brothers are a force to be reckoned with absolutely brilliant     the plot a percentage of the world big enough wants the avengers to be held accountable for their actions taken in previous films resulting loss of innocent civilian lives melbourne had something go down according to the map haha anyway the countries of the world put this system that will basically have the avengers take orders from the government to prevent further collateral damage tony has a run in with a mother who lost her son from the events of avengers age of ultron who personally blames him and in turn he agrees that this is should be how it works captain america believes the avengers should be able to help with out government interference which causes the rift in the team having to choose which side to be on the winter solider has this thing going on which if i say more will be going into spoiler territory    i have no idea how many main characters there are in this movie but bvs had seven that had a major role in it and was a complicated mess which by the end of you just didnt care for at all this has around twenty main characters in it and each one you understand their motivations and you care greatly for you connect with them cause they are acting like people would act the vision is a great character i thought would be pretty dull but isnt  emily van camp is revealed as sharon character and is great want to see more of her paul rudds antman is fun but a bit underused black panther first i was thinking id just be ok but now i cant wait for his solo movie and last but not least tom holland as spiderman he must have like ten minutes of screen time and he is already the best spiderman good work marvel     if you havent seen the other marvel movies you probably need to before you see this but it was a fun exciting and  at times pulling on the heart strings movie that has you seeing both sides point of view and your constantly struggling to choose
Apr 27 2016,positive,i feel this is more avengers movie than captain america movie but that doesnt make it bad im bored these government hates you type stories and with some annoying details spiderman sigh that reduces one star otherwise civil war is enjoyable and fun movie story is good enough and like i have said   earlier i like these characters with these actors excl spiderman sigh
Apr 27 2016,positive,its really fun and the caracters are amazing nice to see that the avengers are getting bigger and others are joining that never joined before thx for black panther and spiderman
Apr 27 2016,positive,way better than i expected congratulations marvel good storyline amazing introduction to the new spiderman and what i liked the most was the background development for the black panther movie
Apr 27 2016,positive,just saw this movie and feeling kind of disappointed this should have been called avengers civil war chris evans may had marginally more lines than everyone else but this certain ally wasnt a movie about captain america the story line was rushed with a multitude of side stories which sets the movie makers up for spin off movies in the future come on marvel you can do better than this
Apr 27 2016,positive,best marvel movie have seen and fight scene  between captain america and iron man also great scene from spiderman t
Apr 27 2016,positive,civil war is one of the best the best superheroe movies ever made the russo brothers and the writers make a fantastic job with the material i cant wait for infinity wars the marvel cinematic universe is in good hands
Apr 27 2016,positive,strangely the allstar action scene wasnt even the best bit
Apr 27 2016,positive,it was absolutely amazing it just came out in my country and man if you want a movie that keeps at the edge your seat the whole time this is it
Apr 27 2016,positive,this film is soooo great i watch it twice
Apr 27 2016,positive,i really want to rate it with only one star cuz crossbones might dead and cap hurt tony however rdj really rocked and spidermans cute so
Apr 27 2016,positive,thank for great  marvels movie now i love this
Apr 27 2016,positive,saw it last night it was amazing that is all
Apr 27 2016,positive,its just a great movie with a great plot at heart about whats really right and a good villain its a great movie
Apr 27 2016,positive,the best  marvel movie
Apr 27 2016,positive,super tight script fantastic fight choreography nearly everyone has significant story arcs incredibly balanced and paced story the 25 hrs flew by definitely a marvel masterpiece
Apr 27 2016,positive,russelling reviews captain america civil war    is this the best marvel film how does it stack up against all of the superhero films of the past    spoilerfree review    
Apr 27 2016,positive,quite good entertaining and fun  marvel seems to have established its trade mark humour into their movies very well  however the main motive is too light for me they should have put more weight on it
Apr 27 2016,positive,quite the entertaining movie  even though there were some things i had issues with they were minor and didnt detract from the film that unfolded in front of us     i hate to use this as a comparison as its something that ive seen critics say  this is the film that batman vs superman wanted to be but failed miserably at
Apr 27 2016,positive,winter soldier 95  10  avengers 910  civil war 910    pro  spiderman  definitive   black panther  on the spot  story  great and makes sense unlike ehhmmm     con  needs multiple watch to let it all sink in 1 watch isnt enough  spidermans suit is still rubberycgi
Apr 27 2016,positive,everything is so good so much better than age of ultron
Apr 27 2016,positive,really enjoyable absolutely everything was in character particularly the ending with some touching and funny moments between various characters villain was very much evil based on his character and manipulation rather than superpowers but that really allowed you time to see the internal dynamics of the team not traditional in its structure but i thought it worked perfectly some general issues with the logic behind why people were so keen to control the avengers but that was my only real beef the trailer has me questioning why they would be fighting in the first place  it all seemed like such an overreaction but the movie played that out perfectly and surprised me at every turn with lots of twists
Apr 27 2016,positive,although calling it a captain america film seems a tad incorrect this marvel blockbuster excels from its ability to finally make its invincible characters responsible for their vigilante actions its a true look on how the world would likely react to something as absurd as various men in costumes running around saving everyone at the root of this as well lies a firm story for each character fuelled by past and present emotions considering the oversaturation of marvel characters its impressive how capable civil war is at keeping things mature and holding a ground that films from this neverending makesureyouveseenemall franchise rarely stand on
Apr 27 2016,positive,okay captain america civil war is amazing it is absolutely impressive from start to finish     full review 
Apr 27 2016,negative,civil war  no  this movie is captain america 3
Apr 27 2016,positive,not as good as winter soldier bit disappointing because the trailers were too epic like iron man 3 thor 2 and avengers 2 but it was an okay film not as good as catws bvs or deadpool but its still better than ca tfa avengers 2 thor 12 and iron man 23
Apr 27 2016,positive,i never thought marvel studios could set the bar this high  captain america civil war is a total package entertaining actionpacked humorous and an emotional ride its just a bonus if youve invested your time starting from the first iron man up to now to get attached to the characters but its not necessary    the airport battle royal between our favorite super heroes is the crowning moment of the film the action sequences in that particular scene plus the surprises is one of the best ive seen in a comic book movie although every action sequence throughout the movie is nearly on par if not on the same level its just that seeing a lot of characters going at each other is much more enjoyable    black panther spiderman and antman were also highlights of the film but everyone did an amazing job and had their deserved screen time some will definitely disagree with me on this one but as for zemo his role manipulating and working behind the scenes worked for me    for others saying this is avengers 25 i didnt feel that way i still felt this was a true sequel to captain america the winter soldier only partly aou the conflicting ideologies of our two main heroes is still the focus of the whole movie and everything was balanced perfectly    to sum it up this is arguably marvels best movie to date and one of the best cbms of all time i cant wait for the solo outing of black panther and spiderman and how the world of the mcu progresses from here    ps  honestly im now having doubts that they can top this one with their lineup of upcoming solo movies until maybe infinity war lol
Apr 27 2016,positive,98 for a start and deservingly so i must say the trailer didnt give away the storyline and im sure you wont quite be able to tell what is the villain up to quite straightforward and not messy like bvs yes this is waaaayyyy better that overhyped battle i also personally like the new spidey i think they finally picked the right one i think the most memorable scene is that guy thing bit which im sure all guys can relate to anyway a very entertaining movie and totally a must see 910    ps theres two clip at the end credits one midway and one at the very back i say its worth waiting for
Apr 27 2016,positive,just saw it on premiere day in belgium i will not spoil anything for anyone just say that i thought the movie was great definitely raises the level of the mcu once again and just a pointer towards dc looks like it is possible to make a movies where 2 superhero characters fight each other and make it work just watch this movie and see how its done
Apr 27 2016,positive,well balance in action and plot  classic moral dilemma story actually not  more than enough actions fighting scenes but quite disappointed with this version of spiderman kid not even teen
Apr 27 2016,positive,in 7 words  everything you ever wanted in a movie  incredible
Apr 27 2016,positive,despite its name captain america civil war is really the perfect avengers film it has a strong central story whilst expertly interweaving multiple other characters and themes into the films narrative without losing focus sure some of the appearances are extended cameos but they dont feel crowbarred and all serve a clear purpose to the films main drive in contrast the age of ultron struggled to contain so many iconic characters with its shaky pacing and unwieldy plot i feared too many cooks were inevitably going to spoil the marvel broth i neednt have feared  civil war steers the franchise squarely back on track the captain america films always appear to be the more grown up end of the superhero spectrum far more effort is spent on crafting an intelligent engrossing and at times quite dark storyline than on some of the other spin offs civil war again charts some very thought provoking territory amidst the excellent action explosions and rippling biceps all of which i thoroughly approve of too whilst the premise certainly shares a lot of common ground with batman vs superman civil war does so with more panache more fun and more integrity there are moments when my allegiances genuinely shift and back again making you question the motives of some of your beloved heroes  all played superbly once again by an incredible cast  slick in style and substance captain america civil war really has the marvel blockbuster formula nailed i genuinely cannot wait for more
Apr 27 2016,negative,and these idiots call batman vs superman boring
Apr 27 2016,positive,this is the best comic book movie of all time and definitely in my top favorite movies of all time those who are dc fanboys and think batman v superman was better than this clearly have some issue
Apr 27 2016,positive,another great marvel movienot included fant4stic
Apr 27 2016,positive,whilst not inherently bad civil war doesnt come close to the levels of greatness that the avengers winter solder and gotg had  a major detractor is the often woeful cgi especially with spiderman black panther and certain captain america moments
Apr 27 2016,neutral,come back joss whedon awful but the stars are for the cast bar woeful nonandrew garfield spiderman
Apr 27 2016,positive,beautifully done theres no why just when when i got to watch it again watch it on imax 3d for that airport scene
Apr 27 2016,positive,exhilarating joyous and heartbreaking marvels greatest accomplishment
Apr 27 2016,positive,now thats entertainment folks
Apr 27 2016,negative,huge yawn dont really understand why the civil war mediocre brawl was initiated they were friends then wanted to draw blood from each other then resolved to a friendly banter without a thought about a storyline behind their actions marvel movies are designed for braindead twits
Apr 27 2016,positive,easily the best marvel film to date
Apr 27 2016,positive,very good interesting twists
Apr 27 2016,positive,caught the 1st show at midnight on the day of its release  it has a story and it has action going to see it again
Apr 27 2016,negative,became a big yawn but spidy and antman was great
Apr 27 2016,positive,the best marvel film to date bright emotional actionpacked and legitimately funny the russos has done a marvelous job at juggling all the pieces and characters together cohesively finally a marvel entry where you dont need to review the other movies to get it this is a good a standalone film as any plus its fun snyder learn some
Apr 27 2016,positive,great movie that war really amazing
Apr 27 2016,positive,has a lot more action a teeny bit less character my opinion than winter soldier but just as awesome i might have a new alltime comicbook film fave
Apr 27 2016,positive,this is how you do a versus movie
Apr 27 2016,positive,damn fine movie personally an incredible superhero movie with an intelligent cohesive and naturalorganic story the action in this movie is one of the best i have ever seen the stair way fight tunnel chase airport brawl and the final piece with tony steve and bucky are just so incredibly well shot and choreographed but the best thing about the action is that the we the audience cared about the conflict we were all invested in the action because we followed the development of these characters and this conflict there is great tension in this movie very serious atmosphere but theres still very well timed humour and time to develop the characters in this movie the side characters who join in black panther antman and spider man all add to the movie and dont feel forced im surprised at how the film didnt feel crowded at all this was such a great introduction to spiderman and black panther they just add more depth to the marvel cinematic lore and they dont hinder the story and the movie or the conflict at all unlike wonder woman or lois lane in the other superhero brawling movie ant man is the character i was surprised to be delighted by he wasnt a crucial character but his introduction to the movie was great and fun to see it also helps that his and spidermans presence in the action sequence were amazing     the best fight scene and probably my favourite scene actually has to be the final battle with cap tony and bucky not spoiling much but the shocking moments and the pure emotion of that scene was just incredible not gonna lie teared up a little bit in that scene and a lot of  geekout moments too for someone who read the civil war comics    my only real issue with the movie was not the villain but with the ending yes its not really the zemo i was looking forward to but he wasnt a bad villain at all in fact his story in the movie and purpose just adds to the theme of loss and consequences as for the ending its just a bit too happy for me if it was about closure for the two main leads fine but it felt too wrapped up    dont want to spoil anymore but this movie was great i dont post stuff often in rt or mc but do believe me that i dont give films really high ratings a lot    id give this movie 87100 45 ish but 45 is still very high for me personally it just hit all the right marks for me not only did they have a great story but they also told the story really well two thumps up for sure
Apr 27 2016,positive,the best superhero film of 2016 actually the best movie of 2016
Apr 27 2016,positive,the cival war story arc should not have been mashed up with captain america it should have been its own stand alone marvel film besides a few nitpicks there were some good fanboy moments and overall it is a decent film
Apr 27 2016,positive,first of all im glad that indonesia had the chance to see this movie one week earlier than usa and after spending 2 and a half hours watching this movie i can guarantee you that the wait is worth it    i must gave all the praise to marvel for doing this movie way much much better than what dc did with batman and superman clearly russo brothers know how to make a movie about our favorite superheroes battle each other even though it is a multi cast movie with a lot of our favorite stars and character just like avengers but the character development for everyone is fair and square with the scenestealer goes all the way to our young spiderman with the wonderful performance from tom holland russo brothers did it all with a really simple story they can develop each of our superhero character proportionally that they can shine on their own such as black panther which is for me chadwick boseman did an amazing job portraying it    overall it is a superb opening to the marvel cinematic universe phase 3 and definitely cant wait for the avengers back in action again together in infinity war
Apr 27 2016,positive,a cap movie which better than a avenger movie
Apr 27 2016,positive,marvels third phase of their cinematic universe kicks off with the best entry of the entire catalog captain america civil war shrugs off the trend of a horrible trilogy film and instead kicks us right in the feels for a two and a half hour ride full of spectacle avengers characters and reeling reveals while many people suggest that 13 is an unlucky number i feel marvel has bucked all preconceived notions and in doing so changed the status quo for the next 9 films that will be talked about for years to come    civil war may look and feel like an avengers film but it is not to me the movie captures what a lot of people had issues with during phase 2 in that these characters teamed up during avengers but where were they during their own moviecreating circumstances we never found out but now we get to see what happens when everyone is involved in a character film minus the inclusion of hulk thor and nick fury every character gets at least one highlight moment if not more throughout the films running but at the core this is steve rogers journey to clear the name of his best friend    speaking of characters the mustsee airport fight sequence is worth the price of admission alone while many have claimed its not enough characters compared to the comic book civil war those naysayers obviously didnt see the movie yet which is also to say this is mostly an homage to the material in which the name was derived stand out performances include rdj as tony stark as always since it isnt an avengers film we dont get his full story since ultron but every action he takes in this film is an emotional one usually in reaction to a larger bit of information or news his reactionary role is what provides his stance on the sokovia accords and only sways one person to his line of thinking the rest of his team are more sympathetic including the great introduction of tchalla and the black panther mythos spiderman joining feels the most out of place did he sign the accords is he an avenger fulltime now but he steals the show for every second hes there marvel gets spiderman and next year his own film will probably knock our socks off    yet i digress from the true hero here captain america chris evans brings thoughtfulness devotion and has elevated the character from humble beginnings in his 2011 origin film to probably betterhigher quality content than rdj gets with iron man in the past few years bucky also has some of the greatest actionfighting scenes throughout as hes more of a handtohand brawler with a sweet apartment setup function over form hes just as great here as in the winter soldier and hopefully we see more of him in the buildup to infinity war the falcon also steals his scenes as a support character his new tech upgrades are cool but hes very capable of tackling a lot of situations on his own and saves some ass occasionally coming in close to third is antman a latecomer to the marvel cinematic universe but definitely upped the ante in the airport scene with surprise action and clever use of his powers on point paul rudd    we also see some scarlet witch and vision moments hawkeye shows up black widow is awesome early on and war machine is there as well the only person to agree with tony for the most part even with all of these characters they never get in the way of the film or feel they hinder the captain america story arc which has a great closing by the end of the film were not done with steve rogers nor do we want to be but how and where he shows up over the next few years will keep people speculating including us    the story is straightforward although the actual sokovia accords and their ramifications take the backseat to a larger plot orchestrated by zemo the tides and plans shift quite a bit but it is definitely another great plot with a villain that is in the upper echelon of marvels properties without delving much into it this is again an emotional journey that takes our main characters on a ride and leaves them in new places by the time the credits roll this film takes bold stances against common tropes as well probably cementing the fact they can be bold in doing what they want without trying to employ shock value throughout their series    after repeat viewings captain america civil war is without a doubt my empire strikes back of the marvel films while other films before it were good this takes them and improves upon them exponentially the ending will leave you wishing there was more and that much more anticipated for phase 3s offerings including newcomers black panther and spiderman keeping in mind that this is steve rogers story and his relationship with buckythe winter soldier helps elevate civil war even higher and is one of those films that gets better on repeat viewings it isnt a perfect film throughout rarely anything is but this is damn near close even without the marvel name captain america civil war raises the bar to heights never before thought possible and i couldnt be happier
Apr 27 2016,positive,near perfect possibly the best superhero movie i have ever seen tom holland is also the best spidermanpeter parker we have seen on screen
Apr 27 2016,positive,this is awesome super heroes movie ever  u gonna love this if u enjoy with aou  and if u love spidy good job brothers russo u have to watch this movie u must to
Apr 27 2016,positive,teamstark all the way
Apr 27 2016,positive,heartbreakingly awesome
Apr 27 2016,positive,to be fair this one is a good movie one of the best came from marvel i have ever see but the civil war things  i dont think it fit here while the fight scenes was awesome the villain are kind of  meh    anyway  looking foward to see spidey again 
Apr 27 2016,positive,exhilarating fastpaced yet intelligently written alternatively hilarious and emotional brilliantly acted and well directed popcorn entertainment at its finest
Apr 27 2016,positive,a lot of heroes impossible to develop all of them the spiderman was awesome he is the comics on the screen but he was useless for the story the governamental motivation was set apart to give space for a personal issue of iron man
Apr 27 2016,positive,i gotta admit this is better than bvs 1000 times
Apr 27 2016,positive,this is more like ironman 4 than captain america movie which is what makes it great better than expected superb with surprises every now and then rdj shows hes worth every penny hes paid
Apr 27 2016,positive,this is the best marvel movie to date
Apr 27 2016,positive,its all great expectations meet reality
Apr 27 2016,positive,this is the masterpiece you are looking for
Apr 27 2016,positive,just a heads up its not about the superhero registration act like the comics its a continuation of ca winter soldier and age of ultron    review  loved the newbies spiderman and especially black panther its fun to see antman with the other guys too  not enough black widow tho  but might just be me  loved wanda and clints friendship  i dont think its actually a civil war story captain america v iron man might be a more suitable title or captain america fighting for his boyfriend bestfriend against iron man  its great watch it    might be a minor spoiler i guess idk  this movie could be a great prologue for a real civil war movie not an avengers civil war movie but a marvel civil war movie in the comics cap along with some super powed pips are against the superhero registration act they then formed a team and started helping people in secret like daredevil who is a part of caps team in the comics then the fighting and the civil war started   they can still do this   they have daredevil and the punisher on tv theyll have dagger and cloak soon plus the inhumans in agents of shield  they could strike a deal with fox to get the rights for f4 and some xmen characters  they have to do it
Apr 27 2016,positive,disneys marvels captain america  the winter soldier part 2 aka avengers 3  civil war was an awesome and fun action thriller roller coaster ride     i give it a full 55     66 even      a superbly paced engaging action thriller that just happens to include super heroes very well scripted well acted and well directed it was different in tone from the previous marvel films but at the same time it had that familiar fun feel to it also    with peter parker i dare say that marvel studios managed in one 5 minute  cameo  scene to do more right by the character than sony pictures managed in 5 full length feature films tom holland nails it so hard  i almost got a little teary eyed and again in the airport scene his alter ego is spot on from what we know and love from the comic books the dialog is hilariously great and everyone in the theatre with me was howling with joy    the introduction to black panther was also masterful im completely in love with this character  no homo   and can not wait to see the stand alone movie starring chadwick boseman due out february 16 2018    as much as this film is avengers 3  civil war  it is clearly captain america  the winter soldier part 2 steve rogers is the main driving force here and the character is given much depth they build upon the events in the first avenger winter soldier and age of ultron the same goes for tony stark but in a smaller way     i have to say that each and every character in this movie gets their 15min so to speak and they all embrace it and run with it its hard for me to say who steals the show its a real toss up between spiderman black panther and antman i cannot stress enough how fun and exciting that airport scene is to watch the winter soldier is also becoming one of my favorite characters of the mcu im almost embarrassed to admit it now but when sebastian stan was cast as bucky barnes in the first avenger i was none too pleased about it  i read gossip girl star and got all bitchy about it my apologies to sebastian stan you fucking rock as the winter soldier and i hope you get at least one stand alone film as the character a good revenge oriented action thriller could work like gangbusters     the movie is all over the place and by that i mean its set in at least 6 or 7 different countries kudos to the russos for daring to have different languages spoken and subtitles on the screen it not only tells you that the whole avengers initiative is a worldwide issueconcern they go to these places you see it and feel it    the villain i would say was great this time and his motivations were not only made crystal clear but i found myself sympathising with him in the end again the russos   dont force feed you a monologue explaining it all to you like you were a 7 year old child with zemo they give you bits and pieces throughout the film like a good thriller should and just when you think you have it figured out zemo takes it in a whole new direction he was a much better villain character than von strucker from age of ultron but thats not saying much i would go so far as to say he is a better villain than loki was in the avengers and daniel brühl plays him brilliantly no camp or over the top gesticulations not a comic book parody villain but calling him zemo was just fan service and not good fan service they could have called him kayser soze  or ted bundy when i hear zemo i think of adhesive x  where was adhesive x kevin feige     this movie does feel very much like the end of one of marvels phases it almost concludes the whole avengers series because much of whats coming up is going into a completely new direction which is very exciting to think about there are 5 movies coming out between civil war and infinity wars movies like dr strange black panther  guardians 2  and of course spiderman homecoming  which i like to call the spectacular spiderman   all of which im super excited to see more so now that i have seen spiderman and black panther in action there is also thor ragnarok but im honestly not at all expecting much there my expectations are low after seeing the dark world  and perhaps that is their big chance to deliver a thor movie with substance    but in closing as far as captain america civil war goes i highly recommend it its hard to say how many of the previous films one should see before going into this one as far as understanding the characters better  and the choices they make i would say that captain america the winter soldier  ironman 3  and avengers age of ultron are the most important ones to have seen  its not essential as the movie does show and talk about these previous events enough for anyone who may not have seen any of the previous films to still be able to keep up and enjoy this movie as a one off thing and again kudos to the writers producers and directors for pulling that off    as a closing point i would recommend that no one sees this in 3d i recommend that no one ever sees the 3d versions of any movie as it never adds anything but a headache to the experience the problem with lighting should not be a problem with this film as most of the action scenes occur in the daytime but the action and fight scenes move at such a pace that i was thankful from the get go that i was watching in glorious 2d  3d is a worthless gimmick  and serves only to get more money out of each viewers pocket    mid credits scene and end credits scene worth sticking around for i think the russos actually put a song on towards the end of the credits just for the fans who stick around gawd damn song had me grinning dont think that song had anything to do with or in this film other than to give the fans waiting for the end scene a little fun    a little thing i have to mention is a scene where a character is made to look 30 years younger holy shit does that look great remember when they tried that with sir patrick stewart in that wolverine film well that like the movie failed miserably here it worked so damn well that the possibilities now with this technology seems almost limitless mad props for pulling that off    thats my review  thanks for reading and i hope you enjoy the film im seeing for a second time in three and half hours and i can hardly wait    razz    like my review and want more   then dont go to my site badsoundingsentencescom  because i really dont give many movies more than a one line review
Apr 27 2016,positive,oki wont give this 5 starsreally dont deserve itit is a good moviea bit slow at parts but good overallbest thing about it is spidermanand the worst would probably be the fact that since its so crowdedit feels like the video of we are the worldbut other than thatgreat movie
Apr 27 2016,positive,civil war carries similar expectations as batman v superman it also delivers on those expectations without the disappointment of dawn of justice
Apr 27 2016,positive,it leaves its audiences in a state thats different from the usual superhero movies not the typical saving everyone on earth while destroying the city its packfull of action as what youd expect but with an added surprise
Apr 27 2016,positive,easily tied for my favorite marvel movie
Apr 27 2016,positive,not just any other superhero movie very deep plot replay value is through the roof and the more you rewatch it you finally get how good this movies plot was made
Apr 27 2016,positive,two words to the russos  thank you
Apr 27 2016,positive,i am in love with this movie it feels great just to see so many favs on screen though i have to admit not every character is demonstrated enough but whatever i like this movie
Apr 27 2016,positive,just another great movie from marvel  much better than dcs b vs s  still not quite as good as the winter soldier but i think i did like it better than ultron
Apr 27 2016,positive,this movie has the best storyboard in the whole mcu universeand the action was awesomei thought i have already seen the new jason bourne film
Apr 27 2016,positive,one of the greatest marvel studios movie of all time behind infinity war
Apr 27 2016,positive,captain america civil war   a crystal clear evidence that superheroes films could be mature touching and extremely entertain at the same time hey dc  batman v superman you guys lost again
Apr 27 2016,positive,best movie yet   id skip the 3d the movie is a 10 out of 10 even though the 3d was hard to watch this movie makes up for it im going back to see it in 3d
Apr 27 2016,positive,the third installment of captain america is a bomb   this is a film where you shift sides because both of them laid very valid points and ideologies it is well paced and the action sequences  are superb  surely youll leave the theater with smiles on your faces  stellar performance from the actors especially tom holland as spiderman this hes the perfect incarnation of of the web crawler  and yes paul rudd you did great too    and lastly the best marvel film by far
Apr 27 2016,positive,a movie more about friendship and family with an added sprinkle of super power into it captain america civil war give you the perfect conflict for them to fight each other and makes you question whether you choose the right side or not
Apr 27 2016,positive,this movie shows you can please critics and fans at the same time
Apr 27 2016,positive,great movie form start to end good action interesting story there is no point in dwelling to long or hard on the complete psychologies of the characters because its just a movie
Apr 27 2016,positive,just saw the movie and i cannot even begin to describe just how awesome it is and this is particularly relevant after watching zack snyder butcher another dc movie franchise just last month     the russo brothers truly are masters of the superhero thriller movie just when you thought you had the movie figured out it grabs what you know by the throat and throws it out of the window i strongly suggest you watch this without reading any spoilers whatsoever just let the twists and turns wash over you    it is also more a tragedy compared to most of the other marvel movies culminating in captain america losing his shield spiderman is awesome they established him as truly one of the most powerful superheroes in the marvel universe but retaining some of that awkwardness and inexperience because of his youth this movie could have singlehandedly jumpstarted the spiderman reboot on its own     i disagree with those who say that this is not as good as captain america  the winter soldier this is deserves to be among the best marvel movies out there must watch for me 
Apr 26 2016,positive,has anyone seen captain america civil war yet the film excels in so many aspects the film is filled with plenty surprises  shocking cameos intense action sequences which remind you so much of greengrass style in bourne series great cast performances and above all its compelling and emotional storytelling well im not goin to spoil the story but do not wait to see it on a device you can hold in your hand watching it was one of the best times ive had at the movies sure youll enjoy watching it too so if dcs batman v superman didnt suffice you well civil war is for you  marvels civil war is a marvelous experience
Apr 26 2016,negative,horrible wheres the story
Apr 26 2016,positive,everything from beginning to end of this film was intense and captivatingstory line has you in your seat 2 and half hours of straight entertainment
Apr 26 2016,positive,im from vietnam and just saw it today it was fucking awesome than i thought big action great character great story black panther and spiderman was the best thing in this movie so much fun you must to watch it just watch it
Apr 26 2016,positive,i just loved captain america civil war i thought it was smart and the impressive cast really delivered this movie works on so many levels and makes you draw on just about all of your emotions i dont remember when i enjoyed a movie this much and its certainly the best movie that ive seen this year so far
Apr 26 2016,positive,best marvel movie theyve done for the last eight years
Apr 26 2016,positive,feeltrain  tony 3
Apr 26 2016,negative,honestly this one was pretty boring    watched it again fell asleep i tried to like it
Apr 26 2016,positive,an all out superhero civil war with a compelling unpredictable story faithful to the characters of the marvel comics
Apr 26 2016,positive,this was a great mivie with lots of action scenes and lots of funny jokes but i just couldnt take it seriously due to the fact that good guys were fighting good guys the arguments seemed a bit childish and youd think that superheroes in charge of keeping planet earth safe would be more rational and mature about their decision making rather than fighting like children this was definitely my least favourite marvel movie
Apr 26 2016,positive,an amazing movie not just a super hero action flick it is thoughtful and emotional cant wait to see it again
Apr 26 2016,positive,this is the first marvel film that delivers exactly what i hoped wed one day see in an ensemble superhero movie its just awesome in almost every respect
Apr 26 2016,positive,its worth seeing twice
Apr 26 2016,positive,absolutelyawesome and spiderman is great too
Apr 26 2016,positive,download captain america civil war full movie 2016  
Apr 26 2016,positive,this movie was more interesting for me than anything it would have been truly great if i had been able to understand what was taking place most of the time this plot was way too complicated i enjoyed this film a great deal i was lost but i enjoyed it worth seeing more than once
Apr 26 2016,positive,see it its amazing and flawless
Apr 26 2016,positive,the sequel to the avengers we wanted  its pretty amazing how well the russo brothers give all of these characters their moments and story arcs while still keeping it a movie about captain america  this is a must see
Apr 26 2016,positive,civil war is a terrific addition to the mcu that deftly handles a well crafted plot and the introduction of several key characters
Apr 26 2016,positive,this movie was amazing i really loved the humor and action in this movie i thought it was well done on showing the avengers being torn apart and how they all turned against tony
Apr 26 2016,positive,the best marvel movie is captain america
Apr 26 2016,positive,so very good id watch it again right now if i could
Apr 26 2016,positive,the best mcu of all time
Apr 26 2016,positive,i really liked it the only thing is that it felt a little long
Apr 26 2016,positive,what a movie just go see it not spoiling anything  the airport battle is worth the price of admission alone
Apr 26 2016,positive,great film maybe one of the best comic book movies out there every hero played their part right everyone got screen time without ruining the story watch out for spiderman definitely a show stealer
Apr 26 2016,positive,captain america civil war is a heartbreaking experience as i see these two factions duke it out because of different ideologies and personal issues marvel proves to dc that they have a long way to go but still they have to reinvent the wheel as the tried and tested formula begins to become a bit predictable
Apr 26 2016,positive,spiderman lack of schlocky dumb third act instead focuses on character development and more personal moments definitely feels like there are too many characters at time the movie doesnt do wrong with any of them but their contribution to the overall movie is not very great
Apr 26 2016,positive,marvel studios has been at its peak since the very beginning and continues to heighten the standards
Apr 26 2016,positive,as a diehard marvel fan i have to say that this ranks among the best of all time from the studio  certainly in the top 5 with winter soldier iron man the first avengers and guardians of the galaxy its incredibly rewarding for fans of the mcu as it incorporates pieces from many previous films and packs an emotional punch that fans of the universe will really feel the acting is terrific  with stellar performances from evans downey jr and johanson as usual but also from newcomers bosman and hollandthe storytelling is incredibly tight and thoughtful and thats thanks to terrific directing from the russo brothers the score by henry jackman is also excellent but thats just a bonus its an incredible film and will leave you excited for future mcu installments like the upcoming black panther and spiderman films
Apr 26 2016,positive,the russo brothers know how to make superhero movies 
Apr 26 2016,positive,this movies title is captain america civil war so it should be about captain america and civil war that order right but its not its about spiderman catman and hitman i didnt have much impression about cap overstuffed weak rhythm not good editing and boring story
Apr 26 2016,positive,its not about who were right or who were wrong its about personal matters and when you try to hide it it makes the other being heartbreak tom hollands spiderman really steal the show  great castingmarvel 
Apr 26 2016,positive,i was about to rate it 4 but that goddamn airport scene
Apr 26 2016,positive,good but no complete conclusion in my opinion
Apr 26 2016,negative,horrible corny ass movie not near as good as deadpool or bvs so many bad jokes ruin the movie
Apr 26 2016,positive,this is literally by far the best marvel movie that marvel ever did at first i was on ironman side but after i seen the movie with my friend there is no wrong or right in this movie it really hard to choose what side to be on cuz they made it where you can understand captain america point of view and ironman point of view too about this whole government registration act the airport fight scene was the best part in this film spiderman black panther and antman were awesome they were so good in this movie people are going love them pretty much every characters shine in this movie and had enough scene time plus the story is very good the action is intense and exciting it feel great when your seeing the movie cuz there so much greatness going on so go watch this epic movie it worth to watch 
Apr 26 2016,positive,simply the most gracefully exciting movie since the first avengers film
Apr 25 2016,positive,great movie in every way possible
Apr 25 2016,positive,great movie good story plot twists and action spiderman was dope and black panther was dope
Apr 25 2016,positive,the longanticipated captain america civil war is finally here and it is bigger than anyone could have imagined spiderman antman black panther winter soldier and crossbones were some of the most kickass characters in this movie besides cap himself
Apr 25 2016,positive,just a fantastic movie with amazing visuals storytelling and action best parts are definitely spiderman and black panther
Apr 25 2016,positive,seeing critic reviews and the fact that is is a government issue movie i dont see why anyone shouldnt want to see this this wont be directed at children looking for cool explosions and iron man flying around it is aimed at adults looking at a mature governmentsuperhero issue
Apr 25 2016,positive,while the ending is very hard to understand the upon the first viewing along with two plot holes and the plot being simple to follow but you feel unsure which plot is the main focus the law about the heroes being vigilantes or the misunderstanding of bucky barneswinter soilder but this movie shines with the best action a great climax cast and characters and an exciting battle royal captain america civil war is on par with the first avenger and rivals the best movies of 2016
Apr 25 2016,positive,excellent story of a crisis of conscience the new additions to the storyline compliment the core cast nicely
Apr 25 2016,negative,saw advance screening and was just a small version of avengers aou what a bore
Apr 25 2016,positive,fantastic film brilliant effects really funny humour as always for marvel spiderman was really well cast i cant wait to watch it again
Apr 25 2016,positive,it a fun movie with some laugh and it a movie you got to see
Apr 25 2016,positive,probably the best marvel movie yet and maybe the best superhero movie guys in tight fighting no slow motion no dream sequences and the heroes guess what act like heroes also best onscreen spidey five stars all the way and most fun i had in a movie theatre in years
Apr 25 2016,positive,amazing thats all i can say great
Apr 25 2016,positive,best superhero film marvel has ever made
Apr 25 2016,positive,what i hoped bvs action scenes where gonna be plus it fills alot of gaps from im3 and aou like a comic book they are building different perspectives and storylines that all make a great soup bravo marvel
Apr 25 2016,positive,thank you lord feige and his disciples the russo bros
Apr 25 2016,positive,excellent  definitely one of the best marvel films to date 
Apr 25 2016,positive,solid action with great acting the only problem is there are too many characters so i felt i didnt get satisfactory coverage and insight into each characters mind but on the whole the russo brothers killed it
Apr 25 2016,positive,a defining film for the marvel franchise captain america civil war set a whole new tone displaying a darker and more thoughtprovoking take on our favorite heroes we finally get to see who the characters and heroes truly are civil war achieved a deeper audience connection to the characters as marvel continues to dominate with its cinematic dynasty    though sometimes the plot seemed a bit rushed at times it was worth the hurryup to arrive to another brilliant piece of the plot you will get answers and you will have questions but regardless the writing was terrific    super hero fans wont be disappointed the action was great the cg was impressive and the story adds more depth to the marvel universe  minor spoilers  i absolutely enjoyed tom holland as the new spiderman he was fresh entertaining and reflected a more accurate representation of the comics additionally chadwick boseman   pulled off a great black panther he was mysterious and enticing    civil war was a much needed follow up after batman v superman and brought a whole new tone for super heroes    45 stars
Apr 25 2016,positive,best fight scenes ever visually stunning and wow spiderman
Apr 25 2016,negative,it has so many flaws but the most people dont care because its marvel tony wants to stop them to save them captain just want to escape  wtf thats not civil war  its just slamming marvel action figures together with no serious plot
Apr 25 2016,positive,has to be at least one of the top 2 comic movies of all time and in must be in the top 10 action movies ever omg classic fastest 2 12 hours i can remember i felt like a kid with his action figures sprawled all over the living room lol omg wanted to turn around right after the movie and force my way back inside to see it again gonna see it again today great job russos
Apr 24 2016,positive,you know what ill just say it the movie was damn perfect it kept me entertained and literally the greatest superhero battle royal ever
Apr 24 2016,positive,nice action and a plot that made sense
Apr 24 2016,positive,between a 710 and 810 it deftly  packages one of the most pivotal story lines in comic book history
Apr 24 2016,negative,i think the criticus always give 5 star to marvel
Apr 24 2016,positive,it was amazing it was what i expected from marvel spiderman was hilarious
Apr 24 2016,positive,im proud to be a russo
Apr 24 2016,positive,everything a fan could want this movie was amazing spend the money for imax 3d and or big screen like xd  big d will still be great
Apr 24 2016,positive,almost a perfect movie another marvel movie has come outand once again lives up to most if not all of the hype black panther was done brilliantly and so was spider man i was team iron man going in and still i am team iron man but i will admit it i did switch  sides also this movie is light on the swaring maybe 3   in all but i cant seem to wrap my head around     zemos character so in all i loved this movie and  decided to give it a 4 12 go see this movie
Apr 24 2016,positive,captain america civil war was amazing from the action scenes to the comedy this move had everything including great characters who i cant wait to see again  black panther was awesome and added another great character to work with while the new spiderman was great as the newcomer and portrayed wonderfully by tom holland i definitely recommend this movie
Apr 24 2016,positive,fun action thriller    but yeah all the marvel releases are starting to blend together and lack original originality
Apr 24 2016,positive,it is fantastic it blends the humour you come to expect from a marvel movie with a darker serious tone that the russo brothers established and executed so well in captain america the winter soldier character motivations are clear and you really get involved in these battles  even if you have in mind that probably nobody will really die here the battle sequences are fantastic  especially in imax   well choreographed and spider man absolutely kills it i loved the overall tone of the movie and i thought the ending was really well executed cgi is great  despite some shots i think could have been cleaned up if that is where the mcu is going then i will be there at opening night twice a year for as long as i can    well done 
Apr 24 2016,positive,amazing all the 5 stars go to the ending and the airport scene amazingly written
Apr 24 2016,negative,captain america civil skirmish is an overhyped convoluted mess of a movie i finally had the displeasure of viewing this last night and since then i cant quite get over why everyone is lauding it its the same marvel film weve seen over a million times before theres no originality to be found its just the typical marvel formula of whimsical lightheartedness followed by unfunny jokes flung left right and centre then it comes to a grinding halt with shallow action first off the tone of the movie is all over the place i cant tell if this movie is trying to be serious or a drama or action or at some points romantic i mean it is all over the shop i wont dive into every problem this movie contains but i will however talk about two of the most neglected parts though if theres two aspects of film that marvel have failed to reproduce since sam ramis excellent spiderman trilogy its 1 the music and 2 emotion music is pretty damn important in a film because there is so much a wonderful score can do it could convey raw emotion or set up a breathtaking action sequence but unfortunately for every single mcu film there hasnt been a quintessential score since danny elfmans work on ramis spider trilogy but probably the most important aspect marvel have flat out failed to do since harry osborns death in spiderman 3 is create emotion why should i become emotionally invested or whats the point in becoming emotionally invested in characters that you know are going to live and not get seriously injured whats the point if theres no danger that befalls the heros and whats more is whenever something potentially serious or threatening comes along its swept under the rug because the characters have started telling jokes the reason that this movie gets a two star rating is because 1 its predecessor the winter soldier kills it dead and 2 its not the crowning achievement that most people have said it is the movie does however benefit from excellent actors its just a damn shame that theyve been stranded in a mess it seems that everyone else is doing it so i will too but im going to share a completely different opinioncaptain america civil war is balls compared to batman v superman if you want to view a superhero movie that has terrific tension characters you care for a beautiful and powerful score exquisite cinematography and brutal violence go watch batman v superman if you do choose the latter however bring your brain and work it because itll be a much more rewarding experience just dont expect the marvel formula like most people did this review must sound like im a dc fanboy and contrary to what you might think im actually not im just someone who sees through the lies and deceit that marvel movies spew and ive had enough of it  ps that airport fight wasnt a fight it was punch joke kick joke fly joke in other words it was one big joke
Apr 24 2016,positive,captain america 3 struggles to manage all the character point of views some feel weak others a bit stronger but nothing that stands outand thats probably its biggest fault many good small moments dont make a great movie  winter soldier is still the best marvel film followed by civil war
Apr 24 2016,positive,one of if not the  best marvel movies great to see after such a disappointing bvs
Apr 24 2016,positive,good film although felt a bit like a setup for future films
Apr 24 2016,positive,loved it just loved it thats all i shall say
Apr 24 2016,positive,nearly as good as avengers assemble
Apr 24 2016,negative,another weak movie with a weak villain add civil war to the list of overhyped disneymarvel movies theres no real sense of any of the characters lives in danger the jokes were cheesy as usual
Apr 24 2016,positive,im not a huge superhero fan but this movie had me rooting for them it did had some flaws but the overall story and emotion and action sequences just made up for that youre basically nitpicking at this point cause its just a good solid superhero movie its a must see
Apr 24 2016,positive,a cinematic nerdy orgasm and thats a good thing
Apr 23 2016,negative,civil war is better than before avenger movies but not too good  if u hate bvs then the same emotion is carried out in this movie too u have to hate this alsodont make unnecessary trolls we can find many mistakes in civil war toojust make a better judgement next time
Apr 23 2016,positive,avengers 3 is in a good hand in russo brothers we trust
Apr 23 2016,positive,very loose adaptation of the comic but a stellar film regardless  loved the sheer number of heroes in this movie  black panther and spiderman were standouts  cant wait for their solo flicks
Apr 23 2016,positive,simply an amazing movie start to finish amazing characters almost everything you could want
Apr 23 2016,negative,given this is in fact a disney movie it came as no surprise that not one single avengerhero died however yet again marvel failed to deliver on a proper villain crossbones was killed within the first 10 minutes after being promoted a great deal in advertising the main villains plan baron zemo depended purely on chance and coincidence i was also dissapointed that captain america didnt surrender at the end of the film as his comic book counter part did in the civil war comic
Apr 23 2016,positive,captain america civil war blew me away my expectations were exceeded let me go over what i loved    positives     1 the characters almost all of the avengers are back and their personality and banter is all there but they all have resentment on one another over this issue this whole team cap and team iron thing quite frankly is just all marketing its hard to choose sides theyre both right their fight with one another is emotionally intense and i was on the edge of my seat     the villain baron zemo was also handled well too he has actual motivation you understand people are saying crossbones was a pointless villain i disagree i thought he was fine and i got behind his reasoning and i didnt think he necessarily needed to be this huge compelling villain because in my opinion the true villain in this film was the conflict with our heroes and he fit in fine with the film    2 the action and tone the action is awesome this is by far the best action ive seen out of all of the mcu films my favourite action scene by far is that airport scene which is honestly worth the imax admission or bluray if youre reading this months from now that airport fight scene might actually be my favourite action scene in comic book history i might have to think about it     the tone is dark and grounded this is by far the most grounded of all mcu films in my opinion i said the same about the previous captain america film and this film exceeds it on every level for me they dont hold back on some dark moments and honestly all the better for it    3 i loved spiderman in this film this might possibly be the best spidermanpeter parker weve gotten in my opinion hes awkward and convincing out of costume and full of quips in costume a perfect balance good job tom holland i cannot wait for spiderman homecoming    4 black panther was so badass i honestly felt for his character and understood where he was coming from and the scenes where hes kicking ass is awesome good luck chadwick boseman i am interested to see what they do next with him in future installments    5 antman was so awesome in this movie he was way more entertaining than his standalone film and thats saying something and the scene where he turns gigantic had the theatre roar with laughter good job paul rudd    overall  i dont have a single negative this is by far the best mcu film ive ever seen this exceeds captain america the winter soldier in every way in my opinion if you havent gotten the chance to see captain america civil war then what are you doing go see it right now as soon as you can i would recommend seeing it in imax or if youre broke go see it in regular version it doesnt matter just go see it in theatres as well as buy the bluray when it comes out
Apr 23 2016,positive,with a focused and audacious narrative extremely well directed action sequences and a story that presents its well developed characters as people first and superheroes second captain america civil war is one of the finest superhero films ever made
Apr 23 2016,positive,even with a couple of cgi errors this is still one heck of a movie idk why i doubt the ability of marvel to adapt an amazing comic into a movie  not screw it up but also make its own story it sounds corny but i found myself caring about the characters fun action packed funny with some emotional scenes like actual emotional scenes in a comic book movie who would of thought that could happen
Apr 23 2016,positive,civil war has a great plot along with some very good acting it has a brilliant mix of comedy action and drama tom holland is superb as spiderman and gives possibly the best portrayal of the film captain america civil war is without a doubt the best marvel movie to date
Apr 23 2016,positive,just when you thought they were running out of steam marvel manages to make captain america great again
Apr 23 2016,positive,the greatest cinematic experience since avengers
Apr 23 2016,positive,this movie did not disappoint me it wasnt perfect it started off a little bit slow for my tastes but once it started going there was no stopping it the action was handled perfectly all the characters were juggled expertly every characters motivations were clear and understandable antman and spiderman were absolutely on point as the comedic relief  secondary characters like war machine falcon and black panther were treated with very much deserved respect and they all played important roles for the plot and the main villain and his evil plan were extremely well done the comedic timing the special effects the acting the camera work even the sound design it all ranged from good to downright flawless i thoroughly enjoyed this marvel and the russo brothers really outdid themselves here
Apr 23 2016,positive,so good its almost unfair
Apr 23 2016,positive,must watch this movie in 3d atmos dbox
Apr 23 2016,positive,it will leave you feeling some kind of way
Apr 23 2016,positive,i loved this movie  it had great action scenes and a plot that kept you wanting to see how it would all resolve  even though there are other avengers in this movie it is still very much a captain america movie  the addition of the other avengers just enriches the plot line
Apr 23 2016,positive,saw an early fan screening of this and im impressed  its a fun film and way better than aou  the best part of the film for me was either the fight or spiderman  the bad thing is that baron zemo sucks in the film
Apr 22 2016,positive,after batman v superman i was a bit scared that i wont like captain america civil war i was scared that im getting sick and tired of superherocomic book movies but civil war reminded me why i love superheroes so much thank god  civil war has a perfect balance between action comedy and drama during the movie i swayed from one team to other and back i just couldnt pick the side should they regulate superhumans yes  no maybe probably  the airport scene both made me laugh and gasp in amazement i was scared for their lives i was giggling at their jokes the thing i love about marvel  they dont try to be super serious but at the same time they know how to pull the right heartstrings they know how to make fun of themselves and one particular reference made the movie even better wink wink  i dont think that any other superhero or villain movie will top civil war they can try of course
Apr 22 2016,positive,best marvel movie yet  if you dont love this one youre not a fan of marvel  great action sequences but fantastic casting for spiderman and black panther  antman may have been the best of all characters and puts antman and the wasp at the top of my cant wait fo list
Apr 22 2016,positive,amazing movie great characters plot and everything miniavengers movie
Apr 22 2016,positive,its not enough for marvel to simply entertain their fans at this point now theyre forcing tough questions like how friendship and family measure up to duty and morality its one hell of a rewarding experience the best comic book movie ive seen since the dark knight and maybe even surpassing it in certain aspects i dont know how many times im going to watch this movie but it wont be enough
Apr 22 2016,positive,totally worth the wait gonna see it again tonight all of the new characters worked really well
Apr 22 2016,positive,great movie  delivered everything it promised it would watch out for ant man 
Apr 22 2016,negative,i am giving this a unfair rating as bvs was not given at all a fair representation on this site this site is very baised
Apr 22 2016,positive,finally we have a superhero movie to wash the bad taste of batman vs superman out of our mouths im reading a lot of these reviews and i notice one common theme the people that are hating on this movie seem to be foreign and have no spelling comprehension there also seems to be a ton of butthurt dc fanboys the fact is this is the movie batman vs superman should have been and failed drastically to be marvel has a formula for their movies and it works they are the reason we enjoy the cinema and pay 10 bucks a pop to be entertained and forget about our mundane lives for a couple hours thank you marvel for thatand dcstep your game up you are failing your audience
Apr 22 2016,positive,quite possibly the best comic book movie ive watched thus far i might need a couple more viewings once its officially released in my area to help get the sour taste of bvs out of my mouth
Apr 22 2016,positive,there were several major ploy holes otherwise fascinating movie
Apr 22 2016,positive,no matter which side of the debate you fall on this is a funny thrilling film thats willing to paint marvels heroes in more grey hues than before while keeping them likable
Apr 22 2016,positive,captain america civil war is amazing
Apr 22 2016,positive,best marvel movie well balance which lacked in ultron
Apr 22 2016,positive,cant wait avoiding spoilers until i see film
Apr 22 2016,negative,over hyped and bad cji spider man was a complete downer
Apr 21 2016,positive,marvel studios has a knack of delivering great movies in a yearly basis this year they are simply continuing their winning streak the directors anthony and joe russo as well as the captain america franchise writers christopher markus and stephen mcfeely have demonstrated their ability to handle an ensemble cast with this glorious movie    the comparison to the avengers franchise is inevitable since the same team has been tasked to handle the two parts avengers infinity war as well with that said depending on how you see it civil war could either be seen as captain america 3 or avengers 25 it really doesnt matter because in a sense theyre both correct you could even say that this was a merge of the two franchises definitely a strong and satisfying closure to captain america the winter soldier as well as a worthy follow up to the fallout in avengers age of ultron eventhough steve rogers stood firmly in the middle of the story the others remaining avengers were also present with their own miniarcs tony stark in particular rose up to be rogers prime foil though not necessarily because he turned evil but rather because he has positioned himself in an opposite point of view    this particular point of view became the key element that eventually divided the team it also triggered some great and powerful character works through the years spent since the marvel cinematic universe mcu started in 2008 we have seen rogers and stark evolved through several movies they were no longer the same heroes we saw in their debut movies their power and strength developed their relationships expanded but so was their point of view on things this movie also showed plenty of great dynamics between its characters as they interacted and connected with one another in an upclose and personal level in a compelling and heartwarming way powered by strong performances of its actors thats why seeing them slowly tearing down their bond became powerfully painful and heartbreaking this bit came into climax in the last fight the theme of revenge and hatred played a vital role in this one as some of these characters were driven by it to the point of severing the unity between them     civil war was a roller coaster ride there were some somber and emotional moments that would move you to tears there were intense and heartpumping moments that slowly built up into a staggering event but the exceptional thing about it everything including the odd and smallest bit fit the bigger scenario in the most effective and efficient way possible the swift and kinetic action scenes returned with its glory and it would totally blow your mind away the action packed moments involved almost everyone this time servicing each characters with great attention that didnt disappoint the airport fight was seriously mindblowing and epic so many things going on so many combinations of oneonone fights but it flowed beautifully without missing a beat     this was not a perfect movie eventhough she was mentioned in one unexpected scene a special iron man character didnt show up other characters who appeared in age of ultron were absent and not even mentioned the 3d is a bit hard to follow due to the high speed action sets more importantly this movie certainly would work a whole lot better to fans who have been following the mcu the movie was designed to be accessible to everyone but there were plenty of mentions jokes and oneliners that would fly by the heads of those who havent seen one or two previous mcu movies     civil war was almost two and half hours long yet time flew by very quickly its serious and emotional moments drew me in the relatable characters made me fell in love with them the fun and comedies tickled me awake every now and then and the fun and immense actionpacked sequences kept me pumped with thrill and excitement thats the sign of a great entertainment a complete package if you will you might not get the message or the morale of the story in just one viewing but the more you thought about it the more awesome you realized it was crafted thats certainly the marvel magic and its here to stay for years to come phase 3 had just started with a loud resounding and glorious bang and we can expect more of such quality in the future      full review available at 
Apr 21 2016,positive,finally the perfect marvel experience years and years of great movies led to this grand feast of cinematic piece  usually i go into movies like this with such great anticipation and they are doomed because they will never fit into expectations but these do hell these do
Apr 21 2016,positive,fantastic from start to finish it took some of the best bits of the comic directly from its pages but crafted an original story that fit perfectly in the mcu everyone had time to shine with spiderman black panther and scarlet witch being especially memorable go see it
Apr 21 2016,positive,movie review may contain spoilers captain america civil war is one of marvels finest to date although the film does focus on yet another team up the plot fluidly picks up after the events of winter soldier focusing largely on captain america and bucky age of ultron plot threads fit in as well which could easily have been overcomplicating matters but instead drives the central plot forward as you may have heard or at least garnered from the title and poster events in the film eventually lead to our heroes particularly cap and iron man having different opinions when it comes to signing a contract which places the avengers as a governmentcontrolled regime rather than a private source for good after his many perilous decisions over the last few films tony stark decides control is necessary to make sure the team doesnt go awol but cap of course is against such control and believes the team should continue to work free from political agendas the setup may seem like boring politics but its also deeply ingrained in the characters behaviors up to this point and the recruitments for team iron man and team captain america do not seem out of place or forced       some new recruits for this film black panther and spiderman thanks to sonys new deal with marvel are shining examples of how even in such an already packed narrative marvel continues to define its characters without submitting them to caricatures subpersonas or plot devices sure spiderman plays a major part of civil war in the comics and his previous solo films have made a lot of money  so throwing him in seems like nobrainer fanservice again however the way in which both him and black panther are introduced feels organic to the storyline and both are given enough screen time and character growth to seem meaningful and memorable as a side note tom holland is easily the best peter parker we have had yet      if the film has any caveats its most definitely the final act the second act consists largely of the build up and finally outbreak of the civil war feud i wont go in to details but its up there with the new york battle in terms of pure joy and visceral action afterward the final act consists largely of falling action which services the captain america plot thread well enough but seems out of place and not nearly as exciting as the act two denouement still its a solid enough finale and the final fight while not nearly as grandiose in scale is definitely filled with whiteknuckle intensity      captain america civil war admittedly has a few narrative setbacks particularly when focusing on tertiary plot threads but overall it stands as one of the premire entries in marvels canon and one that reignites a franchise heading  into its third act
Apr 21 2016,positive,not only is one of marvels best and possibly the single greatest marvel film but its a damn good film apart from the superhero part it perfectly demonstrates the challenging opinions of two sides of an argument and develops it perfectly the character development for this movie is better then in any other movie making you love some characters who you hated and hate those you loved the action sequences set news standards for superhero movies whilst allowing for perfectly timed comedy the new characters that were introduced did not only steal the show but also get you hyped for the new phase zemo was an amazing villain was he needed probably not but he was a welcome addition to the story and as a character for later use is it the original civil war story no but it brings it to be more grounded and much more realistic making you understand why the accords could be needed but also makes you see the problems with the accords is the film a 55 for me yes for a marvel fan yes for a non superhero fan maybe not but they will defiantly still enjoy watching it and it may even get them hooked on superheroes so yes i say this film in my opinion and only take is that not a fact a solid 55 remember no movie is perfect but this movie gets damn well close
Apr 21 2016,positive,doesnt do an overly great job at being thought provoking like some reviews have said but it was still better than bvs so who cares
Apr 21 2016,positive,its commonplace for me to need more than one viewing to really nail down my feelings on a movie thats particularly true of mcu and even more so of this particular film that all said here is my initial reaction to captain america civil war    as is often the case its hard to write down too comprehensive a post about a film this early on while remaining totally spoilerfree so for starters ill just go ahead and ask the thing that was on my mind from about five minutes in to civil war i want to know how it is that two guys who have a filmography so firmly rooted in sitcoms of all things manage to direct action this spectacularly honestly its insane    winter soldier is one of the strongest mcu films in my opinion and just like that felt mostly like a follow up to both the prior captain america film and the prior avengers film civil war feels the same but for the sequels to said films winter soldier and age of ultron that said it might lean a little too far on to the side of avengerssequel and a little too light on the capsequel if you had to pick a lead here it would be steve rogers no mistake but this does feel like a film painted with a very broad brush of characterisation to be solely a captain america movie     considering the sheer scope of the piece its amazing that the russo brothers managed to get the ball rolling on civil war as well as they did even so there are a couple of roles i felt could have been cut altogether without really impacting the story and that time could perhaps have been used to serve some underrepresented puzzle pieces perhaps both the inclusion in places and lack of inclusion in others is because of plans for future mcu films though certainly not all instances can use that excuse but either way if im hunting for flaws that to some degree is one    i will say that for all of civil wars ups and downs mostly ups it is both a worthy entrant into marvels franchise and perhaps even more importantly it actually even cleans up some of the problems left in age of ultron of course the acting is all above board the primary action setpiece is just dumbfoundingly fun and the evolution of the mythology meshes with the universe at large    civil war may not be my favourite superhero movie or even my favourite mcu movie i mean it also might be i need to give it at least another two watches but it might just be the best comic book adaptation movie by that i dont mean it accurately portrayed the events of the marvel civil war event from back 2006 because thats not even close to true what i mean is there are so many instances that manage capture the spirit of what the comics are and you almost feel like you are watching one unfold before you on the screen a glorious squillion dollar two and a half hour comic book    oh yeah and the new superheroes introduced in civil war theyve got me pretty bloody excited    79    gimly
Apr 21 2016,negative,we see the same formula disney nothing new  we could say a regular movie
Apr 21 2016,positive,anyone that does not enjoy this marvel movie should just not watch them at all this movie has a bit of everything and is the best movie in the franchise so far to date in my opinion cant wait to see what the russo brothers do with the infinity movies
Apr 21 2016,positive,you cant get any better than this 
Apr 21 2016,positive,this is a must watch great movie spiderman black panther antman were ultimate watch cap 2 first but you will love this movie thanks again marvel
Apr 21 2016,positive,i dont like on how captain america kept the secret about starks parents cause of death its very unwise of him and about their avangers need of supervisor to monitor their operation so that theres no more casualties even if there is and its something inevitable than they must apologize or whatnot just like any other official officers the split up of avangers are unnecessary and in vain i blame captain america for this hes too arrogant
Apr 21 2016,negative,an excellent avengers movie the best even but not a cap movie a little too fast the introduction of spider man is a little forced awesome black panther though   after watching it a few times not as good at what appeared the first time still better than aou but really not at the level of the winter soldier and certainly not a captain america movie
Apr 21 2016,positive,its been written and said before but ill repeat it because it deserves repeating this movie is an absolute triumph arguably the best marvel film to date
Apr 20 2016,positive,one of these best marvel movies so far the trailers dont ruin anything at all you will enjoy it unless youre a die hard fan boy
Apr 20 2016,positive,i hate feeling the need to compare two different films in order to get my point across that a movie is fantastic but it seems somewhat appropriate in this case  what the mcu did with civil war is what batman v superman should have been  there were some similar plot points and other parallels to be drawn between the films but marvel did it with significantly more competence  do not get me wrong i actually enjoyed batman v superman for what it was but recognized its flaws  many of its flaws were related to having too many subplots as well as the fact that dc is playing catch up with marvels cinematic universe which began way back in 2008 but that is a whole other story so i digress  in civil war character motivations were clear and the films style was executed flawlessly  the raw dramatic and emotionally powerful scenes and ideas were very nicely juxtaposed alongside the light humor that the mcu has become so famous for  the action scenes were grounded and easy to follow and pretty much every utilized character was given his or her time to shine  lastly i must comment on the incorporation of the new characters that will soon be expanded upon black panther spiderman and one more character or should i say additional ability that i will not spoil  the way that the russo brothers and film writers added these characters into the movie was seamless  again my apologies for comparing the film to dcs venture but the way civil war established these future stars was far more natural than the attempt in batman v superman aside from wonder woman  great cast great directing great stunt work great drama great humor the amount of greats could go on and on  die hard fanboys of the original civil war storyline may be somewhat disappointed by the direction taken here but given what has already been established in the mcu the russos adapted the civil war storyline with flying colors  i want to let it sink it but this may be my favorite mcu film as well as perhaps my favorite superhero movie
Apr 20 2016,positive,the best iron man movie yet the best captain america movie yet the best onscreen spiderman yet the best marvel movie yet
Apr 20 2016,positive,wow wow wow what a movie
Apr 20 2016,positive,this movie made me tremble in so many different forms
Apr 20 2016,positive,captain america civil war is the culmination of marvels 8 years of cinematic caliber and its undeniably marvelous it follows steve rogers and his team of superheroes on mission to ensure the safety of humanity when another incident involving the avengers results in collateral damage the government wants to make sure that they are accountable for theyre actions every member of the team along with their principles is now torn between the idea of liberty and security captain america civil war is arguably the best mcu film to date thanks to the efforts of the russo brothers in creating a superhero film with personal human motivations the movie excels in providing broad insight for every characters motivation as well as creating visuallystriking grounded action sequences
Apr 20 2016,positive,this movie took the marvel series in just the direction i think it shouldve it was interesting to see a different story structure than the typical good guys fight bad guy that is the standard action blockbuster format i loved that new deeper themes of morality were explored i for one have always wondered what about all those poor people who get caught up in the damage of destroying an entire nyc block it was time those questions were addressed and they did it nicely and the sheer number of superheroes in this movie made the main battle a truly epic one and one of my favorite parts of the movie i mean it was one thing for spiderman to be there but i have to say when paul rudd showed up my heart may have stopped overall great content and a lot of fun
Apr 20 2016,negative,absolutely awful no risks taken for this   film clearly marvel just want to keep releasing tons of movies to help thicken their pockets good bad differences fightyada yada yada no questions asked generic plot nothing you havent seen before as you can see critics score all the zombies already love it
Apr 20 2016,positive,great captain america movie so glad spider man is in the movie too
Apr 20 2016,positive,so much better than age of ultron yet still not as good as winter soldier  this was a good movie but i still had a few issues with it  the airport scene that the entire world would not shut up over was not that impressive in my opinion  it just felt like another marvel fight scene that went on for way too long  i personally thought the motorcyclecar chase with bucky cap and black panther was the best action scene for the movie  i also thought in the end you wind up being more sympathetic towards iron man as apposed to captain america which is odd considering this is a captain america movie  finally this could have been the best marvel movie villain if they had left him as jokerish some men just want to watch the world burn type but they ruined it at the very end by turning him into a crybaby with a sob story i personally could not care less about and had zero emotional impact
Apr 20 2016,positive,loved this movie  what an amazing blend of superheros  this was equal to winter soldier my favorite and both avengers movies  go see it
Apr 20 2016,positive,civil war is a great ride you might be forgiven for thinking that captain america civil war is avengers 25 but the directors have delivered a heroladen film that combines serious themes great action a good plot lots of characters and locations real emotion great laughs and superpowered smackdowns into a film that never forgets that it is at heart a captain america story
Apr 20 2016,positive,the captain america movies have always escalated in quality and serve as the lynchpin of the marvel cinematic universe this entry is no exception to the rule great acting great writing and great direction makes this yet another high point for the mcu
Apr 20 2016,positive,captain america civil war certainly one of the best marvel movie ive ever watched with so many characters they can still focus and give us a climatic storyline marvel youve done it once again
Apr 20 2016,positive,had everything that you want in a superhero movie
Apr 20 2016,positive,dont get me wrong  i really liked it  i liked it a lot  as far as cap 3s story telling spot on the whole marvel cinematic timeline though im gonna say the movie was completely unnecessary    great to watch  loved the action scenes  loved the new spidey  go see this movie
Apr 20 2016,positive,captain america civil war is the best cbm to date the stakes felt real the geekout moments were great and it was engaging from the getgo spiderman and black panther are the standouts for good reasons wont say too much cause alotta people havent seen it yet but i highly recommend it the only gripe is a technical one shaky cam at some points but thatd easily overlooked by the positives 9910 for me
Apr 20 2016,positive,an action pact superhero movie and an emotional political thriller thats truly worth checking out it puts bvsdawn of justice to shame
Apr 20 2016,positive,the best marvel cinematic universe movie to date thrilling and emotionally grabbing everything you have heard about the airport scene is true
Apr 20 2016,positive,that airport scene though
Apr 20 2016,negative,watch as one of the biggest story lines in the marvel universe is butchered down to a petty bromance squabble gasp as the vast majority of the main characters punisher daredevil the fantastic four in this story line are simply not here while characters black panther vision falcon hawkeye war machine that were not in the story or had only a tiny cameo get major screen time be astounded by the tantrums thrown by marvel fanboys on facebook because dc is putting out new and original content while the biggest marvel movie they have to look forward is yet another joss whedon avengers film with the same boring ass characters that even the actors playing them are tired of
Apr 20 2016,positive,dc you have been totally outclassed
Apr 20 2016,negative,that movie sucked again nobody dies there is no fcking plot at all 
Apr 20 2016,positive,spidey just nailed it
Apr 19 2016,positive,amazing film with an interesting ending though i expected more from zemo
Apr 19 2016,positive,slow 1st half but the 2nd half moved well
Apr 19 2016,positive,avengers  political thriller what more can we ask for
Apr 19 2016,negative,worst movie in history
Apr 19 2016,positive,another cracking chapter in marvels avengers universe a very serious tone to this the 3rd captain america full of action when allies need to choose sides against each other the addition of spiderman and black panther a huge success
Apr 19 2016,positive,1 civil war  2 winter solider   3 the avengers  iron man     that is how good this movie is
Apr 19 2016,positive,the marvel cinematic universe has certainly had a number of successful and entertaining films under its belt of all the films that marvel has done over the past few years captain america civil war is one that i would consider to be one of their best films the movie certainly has a lot of the things that audiences love about these films but also offers some things that make captain america civil war stand out among the rest  things such as flashy action scenes quips and the great cast of characters that have been build up over time are all present in the film characters like spiderman and black panther make their introductions to the marvel cinematic universe in this movie and especially in the latters case were welcome additions as many would likely suggest given the movies title the drama in the film is more present than it is in many of marvels other movies i feel as if the movie did a good job with the drama part of which comes from how much time has been spent with the characters tensions between characters like iron man and captain america have been built up in the films leading up to this one and the film makes good use of it if there are minor nitpicks to have with this film i would say that the moments where they transition to new locations with the large white text felt a little awkward i feel that they could have had a better way to transition to places than with the way they did  this is a movie that all marvel fans should see but chances are that at this point everyone has already seen it the action is great many of the things we love from the previous films are still present and the story and characters have risen to a new level marvel has stepped up their game with this one and i look forward to more from them in the future
Apr 19 2016,negative,it was the worst of the series way over done if they continue like this they will destroy the series
Apr 19 2016,negative,total garbage two and a half hours of no name heroes sparring while no threat was even present and its getting amazing reviewspeople are seriously brain dead
Apr 19 2016,positive,another nearperfect entry in the captain america saga civil war boasts a more crowded cast than the avengers films yet the directors balance the enormous amount of characters deftly and still find time to focus on cap in the darkest and most emotional marvel film yet
Apr 19 2016,positive,cap is my hero did not see movie yet but its captain america so it will be good
Apr 19 2016,positive,the political discussion of the previous film in the captain america franchise gets personal in this instalment at times it felt close to shakespearean or operatic somehow the russo brothers managed to balance an already huge cast introduce new showstealing characters and still make sure that this was chris evans film its also a lot funnier than youd imagine and just as heartbreaking as youd expect you might think you know whats going to happen but its going to keep proving you wrong my only criticism is that it felt a little safe compared to the last one
Apr 19 2016,positive,best superhero film ever
Apr 19 2016,positive,all i can say is wow now thats what a hero vs a hero really is batman v superman cant compete also spiderman is just yes this is the best spiderman ive seen with all the new heroes brought in i really didnt want the movie to stop all i can say now with out spoiling is movie of the year so far amazing
Apr 19 2016,positive,captain america civil war was pretty much everything you could ever ask for in a modern superhero movie it had the right tone of reality and fantasy humor and gravity and action and drama unlike other big blockbuster action movies you feel the stakes for the characters and are challenged to think instead of simply being strapped into a rollercoaster although there are plenty of ridelike moments the nods to fans and introduction of new heroes was woven into the plot  i did feel like spidermans introduction slowed the pace a bit even though his scene did further character development    this was an actionpacked humorous  and emotional movie another amazing job by the russo brothersâi really recommend civil war
Apr 19 2016,positive,thankfully the movie bares little resemblance plot wise to the comic series it is ostensibly based on it is more of an avengers move than a captain america movie but i think thats a better choice as the character works best when hes in conflict with as many other people as possible also the introduction of both spiderman and black panther here works a lot better than i anticipated
Apr 19 2016,positive,quite possibly my favorite marvel film yet
Apr 19 2016,positive,oscar winning period
Apr 19 2016,positive,im waiting to see one of the best superhero movies of all time
Apr 19 2016,positive,minor quibbles aside from a plot perspective civil war was a rollicking good time and a solid entry into the marvel canon of superhero films
Apr 19 2016,positive,3 marvel  spiderman avengers age of ultron 172hrs20mins
Apr 19 2016,negative,not better than winter solder
Apr 19 2016,positive,even though it felt more like an avengers movie minus the 2 big guys this movie delivered definitely the best captain america movie and a great way to end the trilogy and transition into the infinity war saga great plot development and the fight scenes were every thing you would want in a live action big superhero battle the movie was never rushed during the fight scenes and the multiple surprises were delivered flawlessly go see it and enjoy the awesomeness
Apr 18 2016,positive,a lot of dc obsessed losers are against this movie because theyre bitter that batman vs superman was terrible i do love dc and i am even a huge follower of all of their animated movies but batman vs superman was not a good movie a buddy of mine actually dozed off during bvs and started snoring     with captain america civil war i was on the edge of my seat the whole time while i was checking my watch a lot in bvs and complained about its run time i wanted to see more of captain america civil war    i just think what if snyder directed civil war and russos did bvs i think that i may be writing a whole different review its not marvel vs dc i think its pro and anti snyder from such wonderfully coherent films such as suckerpunch
Apr 18 2016,positive,amazing movie saw it 3 times
Apr 18 2016,positive,this movie was a lot of fun as most of the mcu franchise has been so far a lot of great action and it doesnt feel as kiddie oriented as the avengers the airport battle royale scene alone is worth the price of admission as its one of the greatest movie moments ive seen recently only thing that keeps it from being 5 stars is a stronger villain
Apr 18 2016,positive,great movie really enjoyable with a very political plot love all the characters and like the new ones like black panther and spider man really looking for this solo movies
Apr 18 2016,positive,the 2nd best super hero movie of all time
Apr 18 2016,positive,great performances all around  not a bad one black panther is a very welcome addition but spiderman does steal the show a bit  pacing of the story is a bit stop  go though but overall solid
Apr 18 2016,negative,not enough marvel characters the story in which this movie is based on had so many characters it literally became a war on the streets of new york    instead the movie offers a small handful of characters effectively making it more like a schoolyard brawl instead of an all out war the movie doesnt even utilize all the characters who were introduced in tv shows daredevil punisher luke cage jessica jones etc    marisa tomeis casting as aunt may was a poor choice may parker is supposed to be a senior citizen old enough to become j jonah jamesons stepmother which is who shes eventually supposed to be disney and sony went for looks instead of authenticity ben and may parker were supposed to be close to 50 at the time they started raising an infant peter parker after his much younger parents they were in their 30s were killed while deep undercover for the cia meaning that aunt may should be in her mid60s when considering spidermans age    so this movie was just quickly put together in hopes to make a quick buck going by the illconceived story and poor casting choice    tom holland as spiderman works though his character wasnt used much even though he was one of the main characters involved with the comic book story     black panther received very little character development in spite of how he was part of most of the movie    the fight among the heroes was more like a stand up comedy in the comic books it wasnt treated as a joke yet thats how the movie was treated     why was there a random camera where the starks were killed by the winter soldier why did zemo act like he wanted to be captured i thought buckys arm was made of vibranium so why did it get destroyed why would a genius like tony stark not understand bucky was brainwashed by hydra even after reading up on the files    this movie serves as another reminder that disney tends to ruin good things when they get too involved iron man and the incredible hulk were what started the mcu and they werent owned by disney marvel had full control
Apr 18 2016,positive,this movie was absolutely brilliant in every single way chris evans once again gave a fantastic performance and so did robert downey jr but by far my favorite performance is tom holland as spiderman this was in my opinion the best on screen spiderman we have seen since spiderman 2 this is now by far my favorite movie ever
Apr 18 2016,positive,best movie ever i enjoyed this movie from beginning to end for those who want to watch a superhero movie done rightits a must watch do not listen to the those who say its for kidsthats completely wrong i saw it in a pre screening and i cant wait to watch it again action packed just a great movie i dont really write reviews but decided to because i saw all the fake bad reviews and is pathetic that they would do so just because it is marvel for an honest review this is a must watch you will enjoy itif not a fan of good movies watch that other flop that came out earlier this year
Apr 18 2016,positive,best action scene ever
Apr 18 2016,positive,the best entry in the marvel cinematic universe with stellar performances from the entire cast and a story thats compelling and real 5 out of 5 stars
Apr 18 2016,neutral,this film was marvels chance to finally take a risk and do something new they didnt every avengers movie has had at least one hero on hero battle this time there were just more players the editing struggled to establish solid ground jumping from one character to another overcomplicating the narrative with too many antagonists the main villain of the film was completely unnecessary and the movie ultimately ended with no resolution on a positive note black panther and spiderman made great debuts overall action and humor will win over a large audience distracting them from the weak storyline
Apr 18 2016,positive,haters just mad cause marvel knows how to make great movies
Apr 18 2016,positive,really good film want to watch
Apr 18 2016,positive,captain america civil war is a solid engaging masterpiece from the russo brothers and marvel studios
Apr 18 2016,negative,first of all not explains why they called this film civil war but it is faithful to the comic and definitely not risk killing any of the heroes this title implies that the capitan america should die just talk about domsday in batman v superman involving the death of superman which snyder run faithfully while this might displease the critics but definitely please fans of dc    the initial history is boring and meaningless trying to justify a fight between two sides which at the end is a fight between children with pillows as many have expressed it well they have no conviction or motivation to do so they have heroes who dont have no motivation rather than obey the capitan america and iron man    spiderman is the best movie but at the same time makes no sense that participates in the dispute which definitely can not be named as a civil war    in short is a mediocre film made for the pleasure of children to which disney knows as squeeze them tickets
Apr 18 2016,positive,all around great movie
Apr 18 2016,positive,best fighting scenes amazing introductions to new characters and scarlet witch gave me lifeim sold d
Apr 18 2016,positive,warning may contain major spoilers    im gonna compare civil war to a few things here as i feel its only right to especially as the year has opened with hero against hero which creates a good base for any superhero movie there has always been that debate whowillwin when matching heroes against one another and i believe the hype over batman v superman was greater with regard to who wins but civil war had more hype overall     is it really a captain american movie robert downey jr has been quoted saying its iron man 4 in my opinion its another avengers movies which centres around rogers and stark disagreement to be put into check only thor and the hulk are missing and you can understand their absence though the russo brothers have done something rather incredible and thats a perfect balance between all the characters its a super busy lineup yet each and every character gets decent pieces each having their own moments its almost like vision has devised a formula calculating the percentage each character should have and divided the 147mins perfectly     the debates between rogers and stark creates an unnerving tension which eventually tears them all apart theres a basic agenda there but understanding both sides of the argument its hard to pick a side even when knowing certain truths you can still sympathise with the other as a whole its like theyve stripped everything back to basics and built it back up whilst letting the heroes tear it back down again     its not just the characters they balance so well either but the action versus downtime and comedy this has some of the best fights out of all the marvel movies put together and i believe that to be as a result of it being mostly hand to hand combat and some web to shield the staircase fight was bournish but with super strength the airport showdown is epic beyond measure again everyone getting their piece of the action the footcomecar chase was clever too and just when you thought youve seen natasha kickass before she goes and throws all that about a lot of very imaginative action without it going silly in fact its the most believable fight scenes ive seen in a marvel movie     the comedy element is there and yet again everyone else having their moment giving the audience so much to talk about which i reckon most of would be unfortunately lost during the adrenaline rush it isnt just stark that throws the witty oneliners and cheesy comebacks sam clint gets some in and even bucky shows his sense of humour for a brief moment this is down to excellent script writing and theres a lot of clever dialogue to go about     we see the familiar heroes rhody sam wanda and scott lang having a small big part with his quirky uncomfortableness clint obviously returns and it seems he has a lot more to say or it feels that way im not doing any word counts here but they introduce two more characters from the marvel universe one of which is already a major player on the field and the other being tchalla the black panther     chadwick boseman does an superb black panther and really makes his presence known he can punch and kick with the best of them and what is really great about the introduction of both these characters is that there really isnt one no origin story for either so not to derail and insult the audience like spiderman needs a background story hes always been one of my favourites    your friendly neighbourhood spiderman is recruited in comic fashion and what he brings to the arena is nothing short of amazing not sure if tom holland has the peter parker look but its refreshing and his boyish chatter is brilliant actually complimenting on his enemies abilities and attributes whilst giving them the slingshot and web bashing it was his part i was most worried about hoping they wouldnt ruin him or just give us a hint it works thank you     im not sure about martin freeman and as much as i love him as an actor im not sure he fits in i dont think his part was wholly necessary or to have him play it maybe they should have dressed him up to be more like agent coulson william hurts character yes but emily vancamps carter could be seen as a weak link though she has more than one purpose in this fight     now it does lack the major badass super villain but theres no need and even though theres a hint of one or a squad of them theres a clever twist and like batman v superman it involves mothers hmm was that one below the utility belt it totally works and allows the story to finish with the ending it deserves    other things to note are the baseball cap disguises everyone seems to wear and of course everyone being on first name terms you cant see everyone going about calling each other by their superhero names when sat around desk it actually adds some humility to each of them and yes stan lee makes his usual comical cameo with some lasting effect thanks to rhodes     is it to comic book lore well after consulting my comic hero expert its better than the comics fleshing out their storyline is it better than dawn of justice yes so much better on so many levels is it better than avengers definitely better than age of ultron its like a separate movie all together and my current mood is saying its even better than avengers assemble i think its because this time its personal and not so over the top its marvel at ground level and at its best     running time 8  the cast 10  performance 9  direction 10  story 10  script 9  creativity 10  soundtrack 8  job description 10  the extra bonus points 10 for the russo bros perfect balance and great story telling oh and spiderman     94 910
Apr 18 2016,positive,captain america civil war the latest venture of the captain and other avengers was not just a marvellous treat to the longing fans but also a change of track from the old cartoonish theme of most superhero movies  after avengers age of ultron the ultimate question remaining was whats next and now marvel has come up with the perfect answer  this is the best marvel movie ever they added the right amount of darkness and to balance that some lighthearted humour and mind numbing action sequences  the only question youll be having after the movie is  where the hell is nick fury  dont worry im sure theyll answer that question with thor ragnarok in 2017    the whole cast showcased their best performances for the movie and made it a mustwatch on the way so pick your sides and go watch the movie i promise you wont be disappointed    teamcap
Apr 18 2016,positive,this movie will not disappoint its a must see this summer blackpanther is a beast the barack obama of marvel hands down its a great movie for the entire familymarvelfan
Apr 18 2016,positive,so much awsomeness in 2hrs 27mins every scene is better than the last
Apr 18 2016,positive,how the russos found a way to balance and handle a large ensemble of a cast is amazing topnotch stunts the best mcu movie by far
Apr 18 2016,positive,amazing this is one of the best marvel films if not best avengers films in the mcu  it is a great follow up to age of ultron and winter soldier  it is as much of a character driven story for tony starks iron man as steve rogers captain america  surprisingly deeply emotional and entertaining  the introductions of black panther and the new spiderman is well set up and goes with the narrative  it is a great ending to the captain america trilogy and caps relationship with his pal bucky
Apr 18 2016,positive,captain america civil war again did a good job of ensemble film to put every actors together while sticking to the main storyline so glad to see black panther and spiderman portrayed by talented young actors as well  no offense to the fans of dc but marvel really gets much ahead on movie making with this film comparing to the batman v superman     ps after recruited benedict cumberbatch in the upcoming doctor strange martin freeman showed in this one who will be the next
Apr 18 2016,positive,so satisfyingly good
Apr 18 2016,positive,fantastic character driven film that makes the viewers question themselves both sides are right and wrong at the same time you will go back and forth between which side you are on    pros    1 great action scenes especially the airport sequence    2 spiderman black panther and antman stole the show    3 each character gets their moment to shine doesnt feel overcrowded at all and acting is great    4 extremely well written plot    5 both sides provide valid points and reasons why they are fighting    5050    1 zemo is a great character and his reasons are solid but his plan required a little too much coincidence    cons    1 some of the characters motives for choosing sides arent that clear or explained    overall great film 910 one of the best comicbook movie of all time and undoubtedly a great movie    tips though not 100 necessary i would highly recommend seeing captain america  the winter soldier and then avengers  age of ultron to appreciate this movie and to fully appreciate this movie see all mcu movies prior to to this
Apr 18 2016,positive,not the best marvel movie made i was disappointed honestly i thought superman vs batman was better even though no one else did
Apr 17 2016,positive,is it just me or there a lot of dc trolls giving this movie a bad review just because theyre upset with critics reviews of bvs apparently maturity does t run in comic book fanboys not calling any group out but get over it if you didnt see it your opinion is of no value if you did and didnt like it then you didnt like it fine but a better description than f marvel might warrant a better review
Apr 17 2016,positive,if anything marvel has promised us the most significant showdown or the most ambitious superhero stunt the american way this is it civil war is emotionally grounded with real consequences for the avengers family and vendetta for humanity surpassing the captain america franchises to date it is a formidable piece of politicalaction symphony to general audiences
Apr 17 2016,positive,mcus best movie so far
Apr 17 2016,positive,couldnt come out on dvd fast enough best superhero movie this year definitely looking forward to purchasing it on apple tv
Apr 17 2016,positive,do yourself a favor and go see it thumbs up soldier
Apr 17 2016,positive,finally a movie long enough to been watch again yet again thats one of the issues and its a direct sequel from avengers age of ultron but if thats an issue you need to consider the possibility that you might been missing an oustanding movie
Apr 17 2016,positive,fun movie great action sequences mixed in with humor and funny dialogue it will be very interesting to see how they follow up the story arc especially in the next avengers movie it felt like a little too much to throw spiderman and antman into the fold but there were some good lines particularly from tom holland at times it did feel a little tough to root for captain america which was awkward
Apr 17 2016,positive,holy amazeballs the russos have done it again by far marvels captain america movies are my favorites
Apr 17 2016,positive,spiderman is fantastic and the movie too
Apr 17 2016,positive,i really hate the guy from the young folks who gave this movie a poor review just so it wouldnt have a 100 on rotten tomatoes just pathetic the movie is amazing
Apr 17 2016,negative,it was alright it wasnt as good as people are making it out to be the bad guy was somewhat boring and the whole movie was just alright for me the only bright spot was the black widow fight at the beginning and thats it really
Apr 17 2016,positive,nearly perfect  i saw see it in imax but you canpeobably skip the 3d
Apr 17 2016,neutral,while running a bit long and sometimes relying on shakycam for its action sequences civil war ties together many of the mcus characters in fun fighting scenes and cool special effects however i did not enjoy spidermans annoying character plot nor the very little amount of the comedic antman we were given
Apr 17 2016,positive,my favorite marvel movie to date and no its not just because spidey was in it thoughtful funny entertaining etc all the stuff you want in a good comic book movie and everything youve come to expect from marvel go see it
Apr 17 2016,negative,batman vs superman is better and screw disney for paying critics to give bad reviews on batman vs superman  besides that there are other issues with this movie  i have seen it and the overall reason why cap and iron man are  fighting is very unclear in previous movies they have been shown to get along and now suddenly they hate each other  this should have been done after the avengers not after they caused destruction and werent follwing the law not once but twice  also there were other plot issues and too many characters some characters who werent even introduced to the mcu like black panther made the movie very confusing and too stuffed  despite that the action sequences were well done and the actors acted quite well
Apr 17 2016,positive,comic book movies dont get better than this
Apr 17 2016,positive,great movie awesome action with a darker theme but still keeps is able to keep the comedy element that marvel does so well
Apr 17 2016,positive,a bit too safe considering the themes explored but good fun
Apr 17 2016,negative,too many maeve movies just stop
Apr 17 2016,positive,loved it go team cap the avengers are divided  but team cap wins 
Apr 17 2016,positive,civil war was definitely a great movie especially the introductions of bpspiderman airport scene the motivations of the characters especially iron man and the final fight scene however some of the scenes to me couldve been done better especially the ones with zemo overall the story direction and performances were top notch especially chris evans who i feel is kinda under rated in his own movie one of the mcu movies to date but i feel the winter soldier was a little bit better still better than bvs tho 8410
Apr 17 2016,positive,cap civil war is an amazing movie    first and foremost thank you russos for the best possible welcoming party for spidey and for making black panther so much interesting than i ever found in animation i love those spidey and black panther costumes the designers did an outstanding job    finally someone balanced out iron rdj with avengers no this is not the iron man show we are used to with the avengers russos do justice to every damn avenger with equally distributed screentime rightly done to perfection    storywise i pretty much enjoyed the movie though i felt it had a big finale punch that never happened knowing the civil war comic might make me feel so so i guess that is a minor gripe but i am so glad that it did not end like that comic story it just made so much sense to do it like it was done in the movie it would have been good to see some strong ramifications but the ones shown worked too    hyped  eagerly waiting for the webslinger to spin his magic next year
Apr 17 2016,positive,this is the best mcu movie ever it has so many things in it yet its executed every well  i enjoyed winter soldier very much and this might be sort of a sequel to that civil war is also up to date with last years mcu movies antman and age of ultron
Apr 17 2016,positive,this film has joined the mount rushmore of comic book films joining the dark knight the winter soldier and guardians of the galaxy
Apr 17 2016,positive,could be the best marvel movie so far its close between this and winter soldier this one deffinatly delivers the spectical but lacks the story in the second act and finale
Apr 17 2016,positive,as good as winter soldier or even better
Apr 17 2016,positive,i have a few small complaints so ill start there i didnt like the big white font that told us what year it was or where we were i think winter soldier and gotg had much better fonts the fonts in those movies had more of a comic book feel    now on to zemo i think they developed him well he was an interesting villain and im happy black panther kept him from committing suicide we may see him be a thorn in the avengers side somewhere down the line however i hate that he killed the other winter soldiers he could have found some creative use for themperhaps to tire cap bucky and tony before the big reveal    speaking of the big reveal i dont feel that stark reacted appropriately it was a tad out of character in my opinion yes he does act on the basis of his emotions but normally not out of anger or more accurately vengeance black panther said it best everyone is consumed by vengeance and hes not going to allow himself to be consumed as well i think tony should have reacted more or less along those lines especially since bucky killed his parents while under hydras control    as for the things i loved theres a lot spiderman is amazing hes definitely one of the better adaptations weve seen black panther is absolutely fantastic i love how they teased the dora milaje which are black panthers female warriors if you dont recall just remember the woman who told black widow to move black panther says while that may be entertaining its not going to happen all of the characters were amazing    what i really love are all the questions the movie leaves unanswered what is secretary ross getting out of this whos really behind the accords how will this affect the antman and wasp film theyll be operating outside of the law how will this play into the black panther film as well let them try will they try will bucky cap and team cap feature in the black panther film and to what capacity is thanos in the mix somehow this is a lot to process this is the first marvel movie that didnt actually end the avengers are now divided and the consequences of this will be interesting to see     so despite my small complaints i highly recommend this film the airport scene is fantastic and no the end is not anticlimatic its simply smaller in scale theres a lot left unresolved which works great for the mcu all of the avengers feature prominently and the villain is well developed and interesting anyone can relate to him i fully agree that this is the best superhero movie of all time five out of five for me
Apr 17 2016,positive,awesome movie much better than expected action packed and great story as well
Apr 17 2016,positive,best comic book movie ever
Apr 17 2016,positive,besides the first couple all the fights are amongst the heroesdont expect some spectacle fight against a doomsday villain at the end or anything but this movie is fantastic for nailing the characters it is my absolute favorite of the marvel films for story that of course would be the winter soldier     enjoy 
Apr 17 2016,positive,surprisingly marvel has improved with many shocks therapy but still like others marvel movies its typical with some plot hole story and many little mistakes on details this captain america movie turns out has really entertained the audience with their storytelling and jokes the jokes the cast and the battle are the elements of mcu that always to be the best part the tense between rogers and tony was wonderfully built also between their team fortunately even with quietly not great music and redundant plot the screenplay still good to be enjoyed
Apr 17 2016,positive,this movie was amazing  best one in marvel universe so far     spiderman was perfect
Apr 17 2016,positive,insanely fun escapism yet also thoughtful relevant to our world and emotionally compelling one of the best comic book movies to ever hit the big screen believe the hype this movie is for real
Apr 17 2016,positive,fantastic movie  wonderfully written  great acting  awesome action  marvel really does an outstanding job bringing these characters to life on the screen   the casting was brilliant well except for one minor cast member   aunt may  marissa is fabulous but i really dont think super sexy is the right choice for dear old aunt may  haha
Apr 17 2016,positive,every moment is gripping theres so much in the movie that it almost requires a 2nd viewing just to absorb it all spontaneously clapping cheering and laughing throughout can be expected
Apr 17 2016,positive,i loved every second of it 
Apr 17 2016,negative,too bright too pg directed towards kids and most importantly missing balls
Apr 17 2016,neutral,well there is no side to be honest iron man against everyone
Apr 16 2016,positive,very awesome movie it had good action scenes in a perfect moments and airport scene vest action scene ever
Apr 16 2016,positive,capitan america  civil war its the most exciting movie from ucm i was very aware that spiderman would make his debut in this film with captain america iron man and the rest of the avengers however  half of the film i was so involved that spiderman show was a real surprise  captain america civil war is so entertaining that i forgot that spiderman would come it is like enjoying a delicious meal and then the chef reminds you that you have just tasted the first dish
Apr 16 2016,negative,terrible movie way over rated even before its released  dc is way better
Apr 16 2016,positive,if you think this movie is boring i dont know what could ever excite you in your life it easily has the best action scenes in a comic book movie nothing else even comes close the russo brothers took what worked for the winter soldier and expanded it making room for new heroes who stole the show each character is developed well paying attention to the mcu continuity while not being a giant teaser for the future like age of ultron captain america civil war has heart emotion and fun the humor is not out of place letting the movie take on an appropriate tone     complains about a villain would be more valid if this film was meant to have a big bad it isnt still some may have wished for more the score doesnt stand out to me while it wasnt bad it could have been better one action sequence got a bit shaky at times otherwise the cinematography was great     captain america civil war is the accumulation of the mcu storyline in a mature and smart film
Apr 16 2016,positive,favourite marvel movie of all time
Apr 16 2016,negative,to many stupid jokes to take this movie seriously thats why dc is soooo much better
Apr 16 2016,positive,awesome action and funny scenes best superhero movie i have seen a top 5 movie of all time
Apr 16 2016,positive,i hope youre watching this dcwarner brothers this is how you do a hero against hero movie
Apr 16 2016,positive,awesome movie  best marvel film yet go see this for the whole team
Apr 16 2016,positive,this was the best two hours of my life i didnt have the joy of going to a theater because of where i live but i watch a surprisingly decent torrent and honestly wow i didnt have a  side until i watched the movie and this was so well executed the emotions and everything just wow
Apr 16 2016,positive,opening was may 29 in tijuana mã cxico and let me tell this movie is one easy word awsome
Apr 16 2016,positive,just go watch it i dont want to try describing it without spoiling it spiderman is good that should be enough i highly recommend
Apr 16 2016,positive,captain america was a great movie but a couple movie mistakes were made by the way the fight was fantastic
Apr 16 2016,neutral,so many wrong decisions were made with this movie it is more an iron man or avengers movie then a cap movie and quite frankly half the characters to turn it into civil war are completely unnecessary ant man vision hawkeye war machine spiderman were clearly brought in just to make it civil war way too over crowded of a movie black panther is even questionable from a story perspective seeing as how the circumstances of his plot could have been substituted with any random person he was thrown in just to introduce him before his own movie and its obvious  the supposed airport scene is way overhyped as well it is wayyyy too short especially considering just how many people were fighting not only that it jumps all over the place with the heroes fighting each other with hardly any transitions to them switching who they are fighting and why not only that its incredibly counter intuitive to the whole point of the story they talk about all the destruction theyve caused and then turn around and blow up half a tarmac the villain is another marvel ruining of a possibly good villain his plan is convoluted and his end game is laughable when compared to what he went through to get there  the cgi in the movie was also possibly the worst cg in a marvel movie yet almost every timeespecially during the big fight scene we see stark in the suit it is obvious that the suit is fake and even looks like his head is fake its bad the movie brings characters in and then seemingly completely forgets them left and right another wrong decision were the trailers and the seemingly endless tv spots something like 40 they gave away almost every good part of the movie this could have been a really powerful story but it was just too unfocused it would have worked way better as 2 separate movies one being a true avengerscivil war movie and one being essentially cap vs iron man now i will say that this was without a doubt the best performances in a marvel movie to date mainly from rdj    overall definitely not the greatest superhero movie ever better than aou worse than ws a more appropriate poster for this movie would be iron man on the right panther off to the far right by himself black widow in the back in the middle and the cap and bucky on the left with falcon and scarlet witch back in the background
Apr 16 2016,positive,amazing brilliant story amazing acting all round brilliant and spiderman is specfuckingtacular
Apr 16 2016,positive,everything you want and nothing that you dont everything the trailer promised is delivered everyone is given their time to shine could not be happier with this movie will absolutely go back for subsequent viewings
Apr 16 2016,negative,how can i rate it 0 bitch aint out yet 0 imma give it one cuz it reminds me of woody
Apr 16 2016,positive,thank you marvel wow wow wow
Apr 16 2016,positive,all i can say is awesome  very well put together 
Apr 16 2016,positive,amazing entertaining from beginning to end it gave you seriousness consequences drama and in my opinion most importantly a great amount of levity and brought it all together much more successfully than a certain other superhero franchises latest attempt leaves you wanting more and excited for the future
Apr 16 2016,positive,the film makes you think its going to be a formulaic third act but reveals its going to be much more it juggles so many characters while also being thought provoking and entertaining at the same time the character work is just amazing every character gets a moment every character shines the airport fight scene is probably the best fight scene ive seen in years the story is very well crafted with amazing action this is probably the best superhero movie ive ever seen and i dont know how the russo brothers are going to top this hopefully they can
Apr 16 2016,positive,by far the best super hero team up movie ever made not just by marvel either
Apr 16 2016,positive,well here we go again a movie with kiddie jokes and mindless explosions i would definitely go watch batman v superman instead of civil war dc comics movies are way better than these movies if you want to spend money on a beautiful masterpiece of a movie go watch batman v superman if you want to watch a movie that is worthless go watch this movie
Apr 16 2016,positive,haters gonna hate  but marvel movies are still gonna rock
Apr 16 2016,positive,more intense than the average marvel movie but just as fun youll have a great time watching this latest installment of the mcu
Apr 16 2016,positive,the best marvel movie
Apr 16 2016,positive,great movie worth repeat viewings
Apr 16 2016,negative,not quite what i had expected lots of plot holes
Apr 15 2016,positive,way better than b vs s
Apr 15 2016,positive,this captain america movie is a bit generic on the plot and acting however the storyline action sequences even those jokes that they offer less still lives up its predecessors the battle between team captain american and team iron man seemed very entertaining and packed fun action i voted for team captain by the way spiderman was annoying a bit but still hilarious antman paul radd was lacking a little and couldve been bada but he failed it on this one the other superheroes except iron man and antman did a great job w this flick this was close to be rated 4 stars but i rated 3538 stars because of the plot before the middle made it looked pretty boring overall this is a pretty darn good film and i do recommend giving this a watch as a marvel fan
Apr 15 2016,positive,absolutely loved it probably one of my favorite marvel films
Apr 15 2016,negative,forced humor and very predictable lol  anyone who likes this movie
Apr 15 2016,negative,same old marvel formula forced jokes awful villains and a too conservative plot
Apr 15 2016,positive,great movie i was pleasantly surprised  even though i disagreed with the fact of a superheros fighting a superheros go see it if you get the chance 
Apr 15 2016,positive,best superhero movie ever
Apr 15 2016,positive,dc should watch some marvel movies so they can see how its done  this movie has great acting  by far the best villian and smartest storyline  i like all marvels movies but this is the best
Apr 15 2016,positive,by far the best marvel movie to date  the action was incredible and even more impressive was the emotional connections between the characters  there was no doubt why these heroes were facing against each other  tom holland was incredible and while chris evans pulled his weight showing the connections he shared with everyone in this film he was nearly overshadowed by regal warrior that chadwick boseman portrayed as tchalla  everyone in this film brought their a game  this wasnt just a great marvel movie it was an incredible film  the russos markus and mcfeely created a beautiful script and executed the vision no vision doesnt get executed in a way that should earn them oscar nods  im going to see this again at least twice more in the theaters  teamcap
Apr 15 2016,positive,good action sequences spoton humor and the perfect display of the ever varying perspective of what one considers the greater good captain america  civil war begs you to choose between the need for accountability and the spirit of friendship makes you wonder about with great power comes great responsibility
Apr 15 2016,positive,marvel is now doing something i find rather amazing unlike any other studio pumping these many movies out in a decade they have managed to make me say the following this is the best marvel movie yet about 3 or 4 times in a row now i loved iron man 1 and 3 loved captain america 1 ant man was awesome and the two thor movies were good too     the avengers were both epic movies that i loved and incredibly well directed and written but nothing has made me just fall flat in love with marvels cinematic universe like the following three movies     guardians of the galaxy the winter soldier and now civil war the last two are flat out masterpieces the thing which strikes me why this has happened is simple really its all due to the directors involved being total fanboys and showing both the love and respect for the material they are working with     james gunn clearly loves the guardians and it shows in his movie hes a fanboy and hes like a kid in a toys r us store playing with all these sweet toys creating an entire galaxy that some how one day marvel will fit into their current avengers movies  he also managed to take a bunch of unknown characters and made them come to life in a way not many thought possible     but while hes crafted something special and amazing what the russo brothers have done with their two captain america movies has been something i never saw coming captain america is my favorite marvel character followed by blade namor deadpool black panther if you needed my top 5 thats how id rank them     but my memory of captain america goes back to my child hood  the first comic i ever read was a captain america comic my first action figure not in the star wars brand was a captain america action figure when i was 6 i had that thing for years until my dad broke it one day when he got mad that i didnt get out of bed fast enough for school lol its ok youre forgiven dad took me years to get over it tho     but the point is im a big captain america fan and loved the winter soldier for all they got right in the movie but i was hoping that like past franchises they wouldnt drop the ball in the 3rd film this tends to happen often to movies this size soon as part 3 comes around it becomes something silly and stupid     the russo brothers have not only avoided the pitfalls of bad 3rd flicks in a franchise but they have managed to make without a doubt a movie which can contend with the title of best comic book movie ever made now for the record for me going in that title belonged to the dark knight and while i loved dark knight rises and batman begins the middle act in that trilogy is aw inspiring well civil war was also aw inspiring    there is one main thing people criticized about batman v superman and spiderman 3 amazing spiderman 2 and a few other movies like these they feel overloaded with characters and the writing feels choppy and disjointed   some how the russo brothers managed to group together all these heros we already knew give an origin story to black panther and introduced us to a new spiderman who i will say more about in a second and kept it all together so well that everyone got a chance to shine and never felt like they were just thrown in there or shoehorned in    the new  the black panther is a character that has long been in need of a cinematic birth and finally to see him come to life just brought tears to my eyes they did a damn near perfect job setting up his origins and making him important to the story from the get go actor chadwick boseman whos quickly becoming one of the best young actors working today nailed it and hit a major homerun as black panther i personally cannot wait to see his solo film after watching him in this movie chadwick has not done a single bad movie thus far and really i was blown away by him in 42 where he played jackie robinson and then again in get on up where he played the godfather of soul james brown now hes off as another iconic role in black panther     the new spiderman my god this was such a nice change from andrew garfield and while im a big tobey fan i have to say in his small role here tom holland nailed it better then andrew and the kid has the potential to be better then tobey no doubt watching him in the movie made me feel for the first time since spiderman 2 that i was watching a really badass spiderman and something that felt like peter parker and spiderman stepped right out of the pages of marvel comics i was never a big fan of andrew so i never bought into him much but tom in less film time made a fan out of me he was simply awesome in the film and really stole the show in every scene he was in    marisa tomei as may parker is fine by me ive had a major crush on her since my cousin vinny and we need more marisa tomei in movies shes such a wonderful actress and she will nail the hell out of the part of aunt may sure it does seem like may has been getting younger with each reboot but whatever im happy because its marisa tomei like i said i really love her    the baguy in this movie was not bad at all i was expecting something cheesy and nothing to mind blowing since this movie really is a build pu to an internal civil war between he avengers but the way zemo was played by daniel brühl was on point and his motivation in the movie both make sense and almost have you rooting for him hes a badguy but to quote obi wan from a certain point of view    the old  black widow my god she needs her own movie and fast shes a complete kick ass character and scarlett johansson as natasha romanoff the black widow has worked in every movie but in this one shes ever so much more epic shes hardcore and id take her over wonder woman anyday in any fight shes awesome     anthony mackie as sam wilson  falcon also was much better in here then he was in winter soldier while good in that its clear that anthony had more fun while doing this movie as you can tell hes a lot more comfortable in this franchise after getting the first movie under his belt he was an awesome sidekick to captain america    don cheadle as war machine or lieutenant james rhodes was also good in the flick and his tragic fall from grace was heartfelt i dont want to write spoilers but lets say i feared we had seen the last of him for a minute there happy we will be seeing more of him in the future don is such a fantastic actor hes another one who feels totally comfortable in the role now after doing it a few times first time he played war machine after taking over for terrance howard it was weird and jarring but hes a great actor and hes made the role his own loved him in the movie    paul rudd as scott lang  antman actually managed to surprise me here while i love paul rudd and find him to be very funny i didnt expect him to steal each and almost every scene hes in but he did he had me cracking up here and when he went into giant man i nearly peed my pants with fanboy glee paul rudd was incredible in ant man the movie and while i was never big on ant man comics now i find myself loving them and have been reading them since i saw the movie he really was a great great pick for the role     jeremy renner as clint barton  hawkeye is finally not wasted in a movie he was almost wasted in both avengers movies but here hes a very important part to whats happening and takes sides when you least expect him too hes pretty badass and he even tried to fight off vision just happy they arent wasting hawkeye anymore maybe one day he will get his own solo flick lol ok ok maybe not    but speaking of vision paul bettany as vision was once again great he even had some very funny scenes involving cooking off all things overall i love how vision is being introduced and used in this universe cant wait to see what the infinity wars will do to him his scenes with scarlet witch were from touching to intense to down right badass    this brings me to elizabeth olsen as wanda maximoff  scarlet witch well elizabeth olsen has proven a few things over the course of her career   1 shes the olsen sister who can act really really well   2 shes not afraid to really give it her all in any role shes in  here she does just that shes great in this movie and actually liked her more here then i did in avengers 2     now down to the main 3 members of this movie and thats chris evans as captain america robert downey jr as iron man and sabastian stan as bucky banes aka the winter soldier first let me say that the storyline here and the twist at the end is simply something to be seen and not told im so happy i stayed spoiler free and did not know what happens to the parents of tony stark and how winter soldier played a part but the way the movie is tied up together was breathtaking and it really makes you want to switch sides    i was team captain all the way until the very end and after that twist i said iron man fuck these guys up the twist is that good chris evans simply is captain america i cannot picture anyone else right now playing the role and thats a major tribute to how good hes in the role ive said this before and ill say it again some actors are born to play a role he was born to be captain america much how chris reeve as born to be superman christian bale was born to be batman and how robert downey jr was born to play tony starks aka iron man    robert gives his best performance as iron man in civil war he owns this character and is like watching a master at work when i watch him play this part the marvel brand has managed to find actors who not only fit the roles they play but found actors who were born to play these roles    the action is never too much where you feel numb by it and its spread out perfectly in the film the acting writing and directing here is as perfect as you will ever find in any comic book movie this movie right now folks is neck and neck with the dark knight for best comic book movie of all times this movie was simply that good this was everything batman v superman should have been but wasnt
Apr 15 2016,positive,great movie i cant wait to see it again
Apr 15 2016,negative,the movie was boring  and average et best the cgi was horrible loking and this si far is the original comicbook is they cna get no since iron man 3 a see a intent so horrible of a movie marvel is getting very behind in his universe they better to something evry good with dr strange
Apr 15 2016,positive,my favorite since captain 2  spiderman nails it intro to black panther is amazing well thought out fight scenes and great character balance
Apr 15 2016,positive,best comic book movie i have ever seen without a doubt
Apr 15 2016,negative,did the exact same thing as batman v superman dawn of justice it doesnt deserve as much praise at its getting once again marvels movie rips off dcs and gets praised for it while dc gets thrown under the bus
Apr 15 2016,positive,great movie  however slow at times  i know its not an avengers movie but it really felt like one which was the main problem for me because as an avengers movie it is severely lacking epicness  it was slow a few times and i caught myself yawning at a 245pm matinee showing  spdermans cameo was cool but not great  seemed gratuitous unlike wonder womans appearance in bvs  my son and i are in agreement that batman vs superman was more entertaining  are we the only ones
Apr 15 2016,neutral,i was really looking forward to captain america civil war  it was a disappointment  it should have been so much better  no plot no villain no tension weak theme
Apr 15 2016,positive,from the outstanding performances to the excellent storytelling including the best action sequences ever to make its way on to the big screen captain america civil war is by far marvels best film to date as well as being the best superhero film since the dark knight tom hollands performance as peter parkerspiderman is outstanding and i praise chadwick bosemans performance as the black panther i highly recommend this film for everyone especially superhero fans to go watch this superhero masterpiece
Apr 15 2016,negative,they want to be serious  but just make stupid jokes
Apr 15 2016,positive,my new favourite comic book movie handles characters and arcs perfectly has amazing action and emotional acting introduces new characters seamlessly and develops existing characters in surprising fresh ways its not perfect but the safest hands are still the russos its as damn near perfect as it could be cant wait for infinity war
Apr 15 2016,positive,best superhero movie ever
Apr 15 2016,positive,russos are the right people to lead infinity wars they just get it as i stated before captain america civil war in my opinion is the best comic book movie out so far making captain america the best trilogy out there looking forward to infinity wars and whats next for everyone in the movie
Apr 15 2016,positive,action sequences performances  cinematography are all at the marvelstandard level of awesomeness as usual  but what really annoyed me is that this movie was promoted as a war  a darker than the rest  movie  with lots of unexpected twists  surprisesdrama etc i was let down by the fact that it felt more like a friendly war with shoehorned appearances even though these apperances were part of the best highlights this movie provided at the end it all felt like 2 separate movies  one clearly done to please the audience and raise the box office  winter soldier is still marvels best film in my mind  the rating is clearly subjective  as it is every time  35
Apr 15 2016,positive,yet another splendid job from the russo brothers for bringing the excitement of super hero fantasies that much closer to the fans and yet after seeing it i felt disappointed marvel movies can have as much realism as they want but if the creators do not choose to actually let go of characters  through death or other means  the films are going to loose their sense of urgency civil war would have been the perfect installment for this but it just goes to show that marvel cannot let go of any of their characters it may be a loose loose situation but if there is no balance in the marvel franchise creators are going to have a really tough time topping themselves and keeping the fans interested
Apr 15 2016,positive,finally a good film rendition of spiderman as a passionate childhood fan this is something ive been waiting for seeing as every spidey film hasnt really come close to cutting it rami may be a cool director but maguire is a lifeless garbage spidey that plays more like a secondrate vision as for civil war as a whole i went into it as an advocate of team cap given my knowledge of the books and came out of it the same the movie has a lot to juggle but i believe it does so rather well though it is a bit too speedy at times especially given that what its being quick about is a rather complex political issue the action is great mainly because so much of it is real fight choreography as a fan of martial arts cinema i love this and real stunt work the primary thing that i look forward to getting out of the movie is the philosophical discussions that can be had from it concerning power government and the public black widow says at one point that whats important is that we the avengers stick together it doesnt really matter how which is a good chunk of tonys argument cap and myself wholeheartedly disagree the how is not negligible it defines who we are not just for the enhanced humans but as a society i could go into my thoughts concerning power and the dangers involved in having it be in the hands of any government such as how can we trust that another hydra wont arise from it especially since they could be the ones orchestrating things but ill leave that for later or for an inperson brawl at the moment what makes this movie great is that it rises above the typical superhero movie formula in facilitating access to such ideas while continuing to be very much a superhero action flick
Apr 15 2016,positive,saw this ad an advance screening last night and it was exceptionally good theyve knocked it out of the park with this one
Apr 15 2016,positive,the russo brothers along with christopher markus and stephen mcfeely have not only duplicated their success from captain america the winter soldier but they have have exceeded it every character in this deep cast had their moments to shine and no plot points went unresolved this movie has some of the best new character introductions and a premise where you can actually see the validity in each sides opinions the fight choreography and action sequences were off the hook
Apr 15 2016,positive,the newest installment into the marvel cinematic universe that kickstarts the phase three movies with a very big shoe to fill because this movie is pretty damn amazing im going to do my best to keep this review as spoiler free as possible because there are quite a few twists for that reason im not going to actually give detail on the story because a lot of it does rely on spoilers      that said i will give my thoughts on the story and those say that the story flows very well i know that some critics and reviewers thought that the beginning was a little too slow and they pushed the morality questions a little too much but i completely disagree the story moved with a good pace in a very understandable way and i was thoroughly engaged in it just as much as i was with everything else i found it difficult to find plot holes in the film after watching it and i wasnt bored for a moment as always there are midcredit and aftercredit scenes not sharing what they are because spoilers but they are wonderful teasers and one a possible plot point in a future movie     the film features not one main super character not six or even seven but twelve of marvels biggest name heroes in as youd guess an all out civil war on one side of the conflict you have iron man war machine black panther black widow vision and spiderman not a spoiler since he was revealed by the trailer on the other side you have captain america falcon winter soldier hawkeye scarlet witch and antman surprisingly every single one is actually given a fair amount of screen time no character is overlooked and they all stick to the personalities weve come to know and love them as special mention goes to panther and spiderman both making their debut appearances in this film and both having their characters done perfectly i was absolutely sold on both of these heroes from this film alone and now im eager to see their own movies      of course being a movie with war in the title its got to have action in it and this movie delivers in a massive way these are without a doubt the best action sequences marvel has ever put out and not just because there are a lot of characters involved the russo brothers took their time to ensure that every single character fights exactly as youd expect them to based on who they are and how they became these superpowered characters the choreography style and actions are all brilliantly done to emphasize the individual fighters rather than just using some bland onesizefitsall fighting and its not just fighting as the action there are several chase scenes throughout the film that keep your heart pumping again emphasizing on each individuals strengths and weaknesses in the best way possible     the effects are just great of course there are things here and there that are obviously cgi but for the majority of the film i cant tell what is cg and what is practical effects however there is a glaring issue with one specific set of cgi and that is from the captions for some reason marvel thought that its entire audience has gone blind between this movie and antman and decided to make the caption of each location huge white allcapped letters that were plastered over the entire screen why they did this i will never know but it is the only time i was completely distracted from the rest of the film as it was painfully distracting     captain america civil war was absolutely amazing it didnt take any of the twists or turns that i was expecting but that just made it all the more engaging for those that i didnt expect aside from the mentioned caption problem i can only nitpick to find problems with this film if you like heroes if you like drama if you like story if you like good characters if you like action if you like any of those and dont mind the rest then go see this movie as soon as you can    side note i didnt see the film in 3d i only saw it in 2d from what i saw though the 3d wont add much so you dont have to see it that way
Apr 15 2016,positive,fulfilled what i came to expect from the marvel cinemaverse fans of the movies so far will enjoy this film especially those invested in the captain america films and its characters like bucky and a few others    some cinematographic choices couldve been done better giant fonts awkward closeup transitions    i recommend rewatching the following before seeing this film  avengers age of ultron  captain america winter soldier    optional watching  antman
Apr 15 2016,positive,absolutely phenomenal from start to finish this was a film bursting with energy swagger but most of all heart the russos know how to direct comedy and we know that they can direct big action and all of that pools together here into a brilliantly written intelligent surprising bombastic and hilarious thrill ride that manages to give every character significant screen time without ever losing sight of the main plot which was intricate yet simple and brilliantly handled as close to a perfect superhero movie as youre ever likely to see it takes similar themes in bvs and explores them properly but most of all this film works because youve had 1012 movies to care about these characters and all the conflict in it resonates on an emotional level
Apr 15 2016,positive,great movie great graphics
Apr 15 2016,positive,this movie was so much fun i was very impressed by the dichotomy of levity and severity in both the action and the underlining conversation that was playing out on screen this might be the best marvel movie yet forget what you think you know is going to happen and just sit back and enjoy the ride
Apr 15 2016,positive,this the best mavel movie ever epic scene of action and humor
Apr 15 2016,positive,it was everything i ever wanted from a superhero movie and more it was emotional funny and just awesome if you didnt like age of ultron youll definitely love this movie
Apr 15 2016,positive,awesome movie  love that they finally did a spiderman that throws out lots of witty and funny comments
Apr 15 2016,positive,this movie does justice to all the characters old and new heroes we knew held their ground and character new heroes were given an amazing introduction to the mcu acting was on point great balance between action and comedy i wish aunt may came forward with a different character type as the way this young version of her seems to have a notsoplatonic love towards peter however not a deal breaker the movie gets a straight 55 the fact that the vast majority of heroes were shown to have a very unique skillset but at the same time kept the story dedicated to steve rogers was a major aspect of the movie will definitely rewatch x3 or more    that airport scene was amazing
Apr 15 2016,positive,simply the best super hero film ever a seat of the pants ride where every character excels  hats off to every person involved in this masterpiece
Apr 15 2016,positive,phenomenal i will be watching this movie multiple times on a big screen for sure it was uhmayzing
Apr 15 2016,positive,one of the top 3 marvel movies easy  take notes warner bros and dc this is how you make a great top to bottom superhero movie
Apr 15 2016,negative,this is gey my momy took me to c dis movie and it was shit iron man died and it fucken sucked major titties i wish there was more black wedow becaus she is hot
Apr 15 2016,positive,in an effort to not spoil anything i will say little this was hands down the best marvel film so far
Apr 15 2016,negative,boring and made for kids only
Apr 15 2016,negative,boring movie and feels like is made only for kids
Apr 15 2016,positive,just left the early screening and i kid you not this may be my favorite mcu movie ever the russos really did an outstanding job they care about these characters and understand the strength skill sets power levels and personalities didnt care for the villains diabolical plot but it was a great movie oh yeah wait until you see the airport scene everyone has been talking about
Apr 15 2016,positive,i saw captainamerica civil war twice yesterday and today in imax 3d one of the most greatest superhero movie in marvel cinematic universe black panther was awesome badass  epic spiderman was also epic awesome  funny the airport battle was truly epic brilliant and powerful i enjoy this film
Apr 15 2016,positive,with a great and very dramatic script superb acting and spectacular choreographies captain america civil war is the darkest even creepiest installment of the entire mcu ever a big superhero film a dark thriller and an emotional story of betrayal and vengeance all condensed in 147 minutes
Apr 15 2016,positive,best marvel movie ever  unbelievable  dafug did i just saw  i rewatched it three times now three fricking times itll take days for me to state why this movie is so great   if u r a comicbook fan  marvel fan  love superheroes  like something different do watched this once  highly recommended
Apr 15 2016,positive,good movie with a few minor flaws to it
Apr 15 2016,positive,better than b v s airportfightscene
Apr 15 2016,positive,succeeds in great characters action locations realism not cgi bombardment and humor probably some of the best action scenes put to film the detail reminded me of mad max it got everything right that batman v superman got wrong the heart and motivation of the characters was handled well here and we have i believe the best portrayal of spider man ever
Apr 15 2016,negative,boring most of the time luck of plot spidermans animated suit is worst that the animated suit of green lantern i mean come on seriously  all in all a pale uninterested movie with bad scripting and bad acting from most of the cast except from rdj   and last of all where are the heroes i can only see 23 of them in a freaking civil war i could easily put my grandpa in there for some fight scenes very bad movie dont waste your time 
Apr 15 2016,positive,this is as close to perfection as ive ever seen im not a viewer who needs edgy or ground breaking stories its great if it happens but a familiar story well executed gets me every time this is a well crafted piece of cinema
Apr 15 2016,positive,simply amazing one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time and it goes with the original batman with micheal keaton as my favorite comic book movie genius
Apr 14 2016,positive,incredibly paced with action and story lovable characters that interact with human emotions and the fantastic directing from the russos compile a coherent and well executed film
Apr 14 2016,positive,hands down the best marvel film to date best peter parkerspiderman seen on film the russo brothers top their previous film which i thought impossible
Apr 14 2016,positive,im not going to write a review and i would suggest that you do not read or watch or listen to anything at all about this film its excellent period nuf said best marvel film yet opens may 6th i will definitely see it again  that says a lot right there
Apr 14 2016,positive,this film is absolutely amazing civil war may not have the large scope of the comic series but that cant be helped and it doesnt stop this film from exceeding  spiderman and black panther steel the screen from the rest of the characters both new additions are expertly performed   all characters and relationships between them are superb and id easily recommend this to everyone to watch the airport fight scene is the best fight scene in any comic book film to date   in conclusion watch this movie it is amazing   easily my favourite film of all time
Apr 14 2016,positive,amazed this movie was so well put together its hard not to compare it to bvs but ive gotta say it this movie is what bvs wanted to be but failed at doing so all of the characters in the movie had the perfect amount of screen time to fulfill their purpose the only character that didnt have a whole lot of screen time was the villain but i still bought him spiderman stole the show for me he had the best introduction in the whole movie the chemistry between peter and tony is fantastic the chemistry between bucky and steve is great there are others like them that might be a spoiler if i mentioned them but overall this may be my favorite marvel movie
Apr 14 2016,positive,marvel has a problem with lame badges so they had to make each other the bad guys despite their reason for fighting and the reason for the government forcing them being dumb this movie still pulls you in and keeps you intrigued
Apr 14 2016,positive,captain america civil war functions as the 13th film in the marvel cinematic universe the 3rd captain america the sequel to age of ultron is pretty much an avengers movie introduces the characters of spiderman and black panther into the mcu and balances more characters in any movie i thinkever as far as comic book films go how well its a culmination of everything that has taken place in the mcu and its masterfully well done everything from the focused story character motivations and action are done to perfection it isnt as simple as teamcap or teamironman because we fully understand where everyone is coming from because weve become so invested in these characters it is among the very best comic book films ever made because it transcends the genre and is just a great movie in general if it has flaws at least with me it would be that some of the cgi was poorly done in a few sequences and the score except for winter soldiers was underwhelming other than that this film is pretty much perfect
Apr 14 2016,positive,awesome action very fun and serious  great new characters
Apr 14 2016,positive,it was forced a bit at some parts trying to mix in all the end credits together and make zemos plan work which was a great and amazing plan it was nice to see the flow of each character and see their personality shine anf not bogged down it was smooth and a bit dry in part but never boring the origin of tonys parents and the fact that steve knew and covered it that was a punch in the gut then the real kicker was this was zemos plan all along i didnt love it but i liked it a lot     it didnt make me think of the comic even tho it touched on key points seeing spiderman and black panther wasincredible marvel managed to bring everything together and not bog you down this movie had class romance comedy and grit when steve was beating on tony i actually thought steve might kill tony it was good and dark the only downside is it felt like a set up for more
Apr 14 2016,positive,fantastic fresh fun and fullhearted
Apr 14 2016,positive,excellent i love black panther and spiderman
Apr 14 2016,positive,the best marvel movie
Apr 14 2016,positive,this is the greatest gladiator match of all time lets just say the critics are not wrong this is the superhero film everyone has been waiting for you know that moment in avengers when the camera pans around all of them and you realize the magic you just saw this is that the movie

Apr 14 2016,positive,its okaynot what i expected
Apr 14 2016,positive,best movie ive seen all year
Apr 14 2016,positive,best movie of marvel yet
Apr 14 2016,positive,i had been getting a little tired of marvels films of late it was all getting a bit too formulaic with entirely predictable setpiece endings on a ridiculously large scale the planet being saved yet again and some supervillain or other popping up only to be rather 2dimensional and disappointing then came deadpool which changed the game  and then came this  this is marvels finest film to date there you go i said it   the captain america story arc is my favourite thus far and this just cements that view this is what age of ultron shouldve been and is actually in many ways a sequel to it but better its deeper throwing up real issues such as the decay of friendship and how our agendas can change as we grow as people how our experiences in the past can blind us in the present if were not careful and how any given situation can be looked at from multiple perspectives none of which are necessarily right or wrong   this is also a funny film paul rudds cameo as antman is hilarious and the introduction of spiderman is the reboot that the character finally deserves scarlet witch is given much more screentime and depth as a character and we watch as the vision grows and develops as a human and at the core of the movie is the bucky winter soldiercaptain america friendship and tony stark wrestling with his own guilt over the events of previous movies  and of course theres actionoh dear lord is there action iron man vs captain america proper toetotoe stuff awesome just awesome and far far more than just a popcorn movie go see it
Apr 14 2016,positive,dont listen to the butthurt dc fans they cant get over the fact that batman vs superman was garbage this movie was amazing marvel has the right formula for making comic book movies this will finish as the best comic book movie of the yearguaranteed
Apr 14 2016,positive,this is the movie age of ultron should have been and it trumps batman v superman at every turn the best film from marvel so far
Apr 14 2016,positive,one of the best marvel films to date right next to gotg  ws
Apr 14 2016,positive,outstanding non stop action welt thought out with a number of twists and turns the movie doesnt really end setting up the avengers infinity wars black panther and spiderman movies   the action is as good as it gets and the russos keep it going humor wasnt forced and used at the right times the movie moves quickly with few dead spots and doesnt seem like 2 12 hours it doesnt matter whether you are a cap or ironman fan youll find yourself rooting for both of them i dont know if there is a better marvel movie
Apr 14 2016,positive,this is the best super hero film of all time this movie is more than just a super hero films like the avengers spiderman 2 the dark knight deadpool and so on have films nothing on this film the air port scene made the movie the rest of the movie could have sucked and the movie would still have been fantastic but the rest of the movie was amazing and the plot twist at the end was pure gold and nothing was forced everything worked very very well so far best movie of 2016
Apr 14 2016,positive,spider man 3 teamcap
Apr 14 2016,positive,this movie really builds into the tension and conflict that the heroes are facing it was a true civil war unlike batman vs superman you actually get to see the heroes throw down for a significant amount of time just when you think all is forgiven things turn back around and we see an epic clash between 3 of the heroes at the end this movie had humor but it definitely handled its emotion and intense moments well it was entertaining and well written also this may be the best film adaptation of spiderman ever created bravo marvel
Apr 14 2016,positive,best mcu movie ever period the end 1010 a
Apr 14 2016,negative,its boring with lame jokes marvel destroyed superheroes movies with their movies for kids
Apr 14 2016,positive,its fun and emotional with big plot holes and inconsistent tone
Apr 14 2016,positive,outstanding marvel is unstoppable    captain america civil war is the best marvel movie yet its superhero conflict done right spectacular action sequences its well thought out its got nicely placed humor here and there the plot and the motivations make sense all the characters have fair share amount of screen time and may i just say that the new spiderman is totally awesome even if you didnt grow up reading comic books you will geek out every step of the way this film is every bit as fun as 2012s the avengers    one of the many brilliant things that marvels kevin feige and his creative team and writers and directors did is that they already mapped out marvel cinematic universe they already know what a through z will be and how to connect the dots in between and so when secretary of state thaddeus ross william hurt shows the avengers the disastrous consequences of their savingtheworld efforts we the audience feel the impact as well because we remember those individual movies which lead up to this installment theyre still fresh in our memories and in captain america civil war the repercussion of cap vs the winter soldier continues to be force that drives the story forward because its actually more layered than we think    i know what youre going to ask me what do i think of the new spiderman fair enough before we get to that let me just say that my initial concerns that this movie would end up just being some kind of avengers 25 instead of a cap movie because of the inclusion of so many characters my initial concerns subside because again by this time marvel already knows what theyre doing they know how to balance fun and intense action they know that they have to showcase the skills and traits of each character instead of applying one size fits all screenwriters christopher markus stephen mcfeely with directors anthony russo and joe russo are all master storytellers ok so spiderman hes alright im kidding hes awesome and i truly mean that actor tom holland is perfect in this role no offense to tobey maguire and andrew garfield but hollands version is the spidey that we the fans have been anticipating and im not talking just about his wisecracking sarcasm holland owns it he embodies it he has some of the coolest lines in this film and this whole idea of picking up the character from the middle and putting him into the mix is absolutely brilliant because spidermans time in captain america civil war is as significant and as scenestealing as quicksilver was in xmen days of future past hes the one most fans will talk about long after this movies done    another great addition is chadwick boseman as black panther and wait till you get a load of the surprise that antman paul rudd will have for you in the wellchoreographed airport scene which is the part where both teams ultimately clash that said there is an underlying secret there is a common enemy so smart that he doesnt even have to get his hands dirty thats how clever this script is because its more than just about sokovia accords or putting superheroes in check and the reason the characters clash makes sense its more than just about a simple payback that ability to keep itself fresh at every turn is one of the many many strengths of captain america civil war the story ends with you wondering if your favorite heroes would ever join forces again when a greater threat like thanos finally comes to town what an outstanding film with great performances across the board in this year where daredevil is fighting punisher on tv superman is fighting batman on the big screen and apparently charlize therons ravenna is fighting emily blunts freya in the huntsman winters war captain america civil war trumps all    please read more at 
Apr 14 2016,positive,marvel studios does it again another winner
Apr 14 2016,positive,best superhero film put on screen to date from the modern eraperiod  obviously nothing beats supermanthe movie perfect blend of action and story
Apr 14 2016,positive,amazing movie defenitly the best marvel has done to date
Apr 14 2016,positive,this movie was the best movie in the world
Apr 14 2016,positive,this review contains spoilers     political pressure mounts to install a system of accountability when the actions of the avengers lead to collateral damage the new status quo deeply divides members of the team captain america chris evans believes superheroes should remain free to defend humanity without government interference iron man robert downey jr sharply disagrees and supports oversight as the debate escalates into an allout feud black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner must pick a side    since 2008 disney have changed the face of the superhero movie with their triumphant marvel cinematic universe the superhero genre yes its its own genre now has produced some terrific films many people believe xmen 2000 started the modern era of superhero movie craze and while i do agree i think it was sam raimis spiderman 2002 that gave it the boost it needed and the one it deserved these were real characters with real depth the 2004 sequel was even better building upon the story that the original started we got a better insight into who these characters were and what made them so special its the real beauty of a sequel they allow you to explore so many different aspects of a character its why tv shows are the goto place for excellent character development we get to know them for years and it helps us sympathise with them the mcu feels much like a tv show each phase is a season and each season ends with a finale avengersavengers age of ultron    captain america civil war adapts mark millars popular comic book that saw the avengers the xmen the fantastic four and much of the marvel universe collide the comic was filled with deaths betrayals and fantastic monologues that furthered the dark side of the marvel universe that we had previously seen in stories like house of m    unlike the comic the movie feels much smaller and more personal to captain america sure you can call this avengers 25 but it still feels like what is is as heart a captain america movie captain america civil war is packed with some incredible fight scenes and an engaging plot which differs dramatically from the source material its adapting we have spent numerous movies with these characters and to see the compromises they make in this film is what makes it stand out    while the avengers are on a mission their carelessness leads to the deaths of innocent civilians and political pressure begins to squeeze them into choosing a side save the day with absolute freedom or fight by order of bureaucrats while previous mcu films are all about fun adventure and heroism civil war brings the universe into a real world with real consequences if the events that took place in both avengers movies were real life there would be hundreds of innocent lives lost and this would be something that is immediately brought up yet we dont hear about that grim side of it until this movie the characters and the audience are both being smacked in the face with consequence its what watchmen 2009 and the incredibles 2004 do so damn well however the film isnt necessarily a downer unlike batman v superman dawn of justice the film still has plenty of the humour and fun that the mcu has come to be so widely known for not that thats a fault of bvs so theres a mixture of seriousness and jokiness and i dont think that works too well    until the final few scenes i never felt any real tension the first act is full of reasons why the avengers is a controversial branch of the once mighty shield and so we understand that something big has to happen and once the avengers take sides we expect brutal deathfilled warfare after all the movie has war in the title however the second act contains an action scene that felt as though it was out of a completely different mcu film one with a lighter tone where there were no real worries and it was all about fun they have come here to fight and if needs be kill each other in order to make a stand and have their way in an incredibly important and serious issue so what do they do why they tell jokes of course theyre not supposed to be having fun they should be terrified about the outcome of the fight but its not even clear if they want to kill each other or not of course like every mcu movie there are no major characters who die and stay dead this takes away the impact and any tension the airport scene could have had had there been one or even two characters die the airport scene is one that was made to entertain rather than propel the story    in comparison the final confrontation between rogers bucky and stark is brilliant this fight has raw emotion its brutal where the airport sequence focused on spectacle and great big set pieces this fight has a much smaller scale yet the stakes are so much greater there has never been a fight in the mcu like the fight at the end of civil war and im not sure well ever get one like it again    my favourite thing about this movie is the philosophy that weaves the story and separates the characters the dark knight sees batman and the joker fight a battle of wits daredevil season 2 sees daredevil and the punisher collide in both verbal and physical battle batman v superman takes batmans anger and plots it against supermans naivety captain america civil war has the patriotism of captain america go up against the compromising and regretful iron man the writers stephen mcfeely and christopher markus do an excellent job of giving reasoning and understanding as to why there is conflict and why the two lead characters take different sides but the minor characters dont seem to get enough screen time or dialogue they pretty much decide their team in a few lines or less it doesnt feel like the characters made the decisions themselves but the writers along with the good writing for the lead characters both robert downey junior and captain america give their best performances of the mcu thus far as far as newcomers go black panther and spiderman had great onscreen presence chadwick boseman gives a fine performance and his character has a touching and inspired arc tom holland brings a spiderman that weve never really seen before he is very much like the spiderman from the ultimate universe in that he looks a lot younger and doesnt shut up although a little shoehorned in he works really well throughout his sequences and it was a great advert for spiderman homecoming    the film almost feels like one producer wanted them to go dark with this and another wanted them to stick to the usual mcu feel when war machine is blown out the sky and free falls into the ground he should be dead no question but its the mcu and so he is more or less fine hes walking again not soon after its this sort of thing that makes me a little sick of the mcu it almost feels like schlock same formula same result i have to say i enjoyed this movie but not nearly as much as i wanted to    its uncommon for superhero movies to directly adapt a single story from the comics they rarely even use the name of the comic they are inspired by or are are adapting on the contrary captain america civil war uses the name of the comic and i suppose would call itself an adaptation but it greatly differs from the overall story and tone of the comic had they faithfully adapted the comic i think it would have felt out of place for many people if many characters were killed off in this film and if it was handled really well i would have loved that but im not sure the general audience would have been too keen the mcu took the ultimate risk in bringing all of these characters together but from there there hasnt been much to greatly admire about the mcu like there once was    score 35
Apr 14 2016,positive,for what it is its perfection
Apr 14 2016,positive,top quality this is not an avengers movie to its core its a captain america story
Apr 14 2016,positive,impossible not to compare it to the other super vs super movie the difference is the organic feeling that comes after every single step taken through this movie unlike some moments that felt totally crammed up on their dc counterpart the russos really know and love the material they like and they stuck to it like they way they handled spiderman while snyder felt he had to create from the ground up well beloved characters and redesign them  overall it is an awesome movie with a real heartfelt conflict which couldve been resolved in a better way but that might be just me nitpicking
Apr 14 2016,positive,the misleading title is the one complaint the film has to accept its certainly no solo adventure for cap but thats a good thing continuing the thriller style of the critically acclaimed winter soldier this film juggles even more characters and that is no easy feat each one of the characters has their moment or five to shine the new additions fit in perfectly the well known ones feel like our friends by now the film also refuses to take the easy way out and force a position on the viewer in the war between former allies both points have merits and the film takes his positions and his characters serious enough to give them time to articulate them   while the beginning is still somewhat serious two very special characters bring the fun into it culminating in the greatest superhero action sequence on film to date and thats not even the showdown yet perfect blockbuster entertainment with brains and muscles another triumph for marvel
Apr 14 2016,positive,though theres some lack of antagonistic role but this movie is thrilling and extremely fun
Apr 14 2016,positive,a great piece of entertainment
Apr 14 2016,positive,a movie that lives up to its hype and name  i am a huge marvel fan and this movie delivers on all scale  excellent story and well paced filled with 55 action sequences cilvil war will leave you wanting more
Apr 14 2016,positive,greaest marvel movie its rare to take so many characters and tide them into one movie which is exactly what it does it takes old characters by continuing their story but also introducing new ones to the audience
Apr 14 2016,positive,civil war smothers a potentially powerful story  and some of americas most iconic superheroes  in a grim whirlwind of effects driven action
Apr 14 2016,positive,i am totally pumped if i get any pumpier im gonna blow
Apr 14 2016,positive,i laughed i cried i cheered i was thoroughly entertained the best armored vengeance seeker vs spirit of justice and fairness movie of the year by far
Apr 14 2016,positive,in my opinion this is one of the best super hero movies yet i went in with high levels of hype and i still enjoyed this movie immensely i had a huge grin on my face whenever spiderman was on screen paul rudd was hilarious and the story was wonderful i went in team ironman and i switched sides multiple times throughout because both teams had valid points by the end i just wanted the fighting to stop not because it was over the top bad boring or stupid but because i cared about all of the characters and didnt want them to hurt each other or worse id also say zemo is one of the best marvel villains yet because  spoilers    spoilershe didnt die and he in fact wonspoilers    spoilers over    i cant wait to see what marvel has yet to come
Apr 14 2016,positive,you dont even know  antman
Apr 13 2016,positive,my name is nathan summers and i was told that qualifies the movie like 10
Apr 13 2016,positive,a nearperfect superhero movie inventive action pieces great characters and a solid story definitely marvels best ensemble film to date towering above the silly antics of joss whedons overrated avengers films let the russo bros direct every marvel film from here on id be very happy with that captain america is definitely my favourite superhero in this universe based solely on chris evans pitch perfect performance and the characters good oldfashioned ethics of always doing the right thing no matter what and they finally got spiderman right after all these years although i wish he wasnt using webslinging tech  i like the idea of his shooting it out of wrists far more a
Apr 13 2016,positive,teamcap vs teamironman are nice fighting  damn amazing i love spiderman
Apr 13 2016,positive,im too pumped for this film  i cant wait to see this one  why is it taking it so long to release 
Apr 13 2016,positive,one of the best comic book film ever must watch at all cost
Apr 13 2016,positive,civil war takes these characters to the limits of their relationships and introduces fantastic new characters to the mcu action tops any other marvel movie before it and blends humor in it perfectly without over using such as the other movies this movie has great action sequences but unfortunately its hard to focus on the fights without noticing the extremely awful cgi especially in the airport fight scenes and especially with spiderman spiderman is perfect and a spectacular sight to see but unfortunately didnt feel needed to be in the movie and most of the time the suit was complete cgi black panther surprising was the best addition to the movie was finally was a superior and stronger african characters compared to caps and ironmans sidekicks as for zemo the villain served no purpose but to starts fights and his plan was a huge waste of time great action and character development  but bad cgi and bad villain
Apr 13 2016,positive,this movie was really intense i loved everything about it spiderman blown away black panther holy crap he was awesome and the airport scene amazing ant man was freaking awesome and the cap what can i say totally freaking awesome this is right belowtied with winter soldier
Apr 13 2016,positive,the best movie of super heroes
Apr 13 2016,positive,the best marvel movie thats all i can say just go see it
Apr 13 2016,positive,not bad far from what people are saying lower your expectations and yes spiderman bogarts the show
Apr 13 2016,positive,by far my favorite superhero movie ive seen every superhero movie dating back to the old batman movies theres so much more character depth in this movie and the russo brothers could not have directed this movie any better it sets up future solo movies as many know such as spiderman and black panther they were still able to add humor into such an intense movie it had the entire theater laughing personally i think its a movie worth seeing twice the movie definitely lived up to all of the hype go see it
Apr 13 2016,positive,yes i can not wait for thisssssssssss
Apr 13 2016,positive,like its predecessor captain america civil war is probably one of the best action movies you will ever watch and it is the best marvel movie since the winter soldier the fight between the heros is amazing spiderman black panther and antman shine throughout their roles in the film though the ending and villain could have used some work the film as a whole serves as one of the best films the mcu has ever offered
Apr 13 2016,positive,amazing great fight between the two heroes possible the best marvel movie for now
Apr 13 2016,positive,great movie some scenes are redundant but it doesnt change how good it is
Apr 13 2016,positive,i love captain america civil war the best superhero movie today 55
Apr 13 2016,positive,i have very few issues with this movie great action marvel film so much better than ultron
Apr 13 2016,positive,very entertaining lots of big action fight scenes like i had expected the only reason it doesnt get five stars is because at parts it felt weirdly rushed like the villains back story which abruptly came towards the end of the movie or the sudden obsession with what happened to tonys parents all and all a good movie as a final note there is a certain movie studio that should not be fulfilling what was said in the last end credits scene not unless they want to screw it up again
Apr 13 2016,neutral,i got bored with the action this is very competently made and if you like blockbuster action films with marvel superheroes then you will love this for me not a fan of the genre to begin with fatigue has been setting in for a long time
Apr 13 2016,positive,probably the best marvel movie yet
Apr 13 2016,positive,i laughed i cried i made a cliche but accurate review
Apr 13 2016,positive,an absolute masterpiece this movie will go down in history as one of the greatest superhero phenomenons of all time black panther was perfect just as spiderman was i am going to see this movie again and again and again
Apr 13 2016,negative,one of the worst movies ive seen in 2016 movie goes to fast you dont know whats going on full with to much stuff worse then fantastic four movie and tries to fix itself by putting in a hero that wasnt even part of the mcu in the first place
Apr 13 2016,positive,really fantastic job a lot is going on in this film its almost overwhelming but the russos do a fantastic job juggling everything spidey black panther scarlet witch are really great  rdj really brought his a game chris evans is terrific
Apr 13 2016,negative,original comic civil war  was outstanding this is  movie is a freaking farce marvel sits there and says they have an mcu but cant even get canon when it comes to its movies how pathetic i know i will get called out on this but as a comic book fan i have given up on the marvel franchise movies 69 of their movies are too disney friendly and are terrible they do not care about the actual fan dc may look like they are behind and dark but at least they own all their characters and can actually have a universe that is canon
Apr 13 2016,positive,cant wait 3 3
Apr 13 2016,negative,worst movie of marvel  had aou all over it and once again weak villain only good part was black panther and winter soldier 310
Apr 13 2016,negative,it is as bad as batman vs super mixed with the first daredevil if you see it you will want to kill yourself with a blunt knife
Apr 13 2016,positive,i loved this move you got to go see it
Apr 13 2016,positive,wow just saw it 2nd time even better
Apr 13 2016,positive,great movie and story
Apr 13 2016,positive,marvel studios has truly mastered the art of superhero filmmaking
Apr 13 2016,positive,most probably the best film of the superhero genre that i ve watched  if you like to have fun in a movie with a good adventure  a very well structured story as the good times productions from steven spielberg during the 80s  this is the film for you     but if you like superheroes of movies that are just pretentious full of catchphrases and cheesy scenes which are sold as serious adults and deep films but actually seem written by adults with the brain of a child of 8 years trying write about serious things  pretending to be philosophical and existentialist films filled with poorly constructed metaphors then this film is not for you if you are the kind of adult who makes speech i prefer serious and adults films that make me think but which are actually empty movies who can not work context and are just scenes sequences and affected and pretentious phrases  then this film is not for you
Apr 13 2016,positive,best marvel movie so far  almost an avengers movie as everybody almost is in civil war i love these characters and its difficult watching the feud im team cap but the russo brothers did a great job presenting both sides spiderman is excellent a likable age appropriate  and talented dynamo he kinda steals the show when hes on screen  im seeing civil war two more times this weekend with family there is way too much to absorb in watching just one showing
Apr 13 2016,positive,one of the best movies of all time  the action is just impeccable  probably the best action fight scenes in cinematic history
Apr 13 2016,positive,just about as good as entertainment cinema gets spectacular emotional mature fun and once again the captain america film has left the mcu far different to what it was yesterday
Apr 13 2016,positive,possibly the best mcu movie to date entertaining intense exciting visually stunning black panther is great spiderman is finally amazing for real
Apr 13 2016,negative,absolutely disappointing movie there was zero sense in the plot i really thought i would love this movie and i cant believe i have to say batman vs superman is helluva better zach snyder have won this shame on you marvel you look weak
Apr 13 2016,positive,the best marvel movie that really blew me away  it had the best spiderman ever
Apr 13 2016,positive,let me start by saying this is a really good film and it does a great job of showing what happens when restrictions are placed on people and how those restrictions can fracture relationships    this movie does have its funny moments and enjoy the vw bug scene  sarcastic comedy at its best 
Apr 13 2016,positive,well civil war got all the missing things of batman vs superman charismatic characters a awesome plot absolutely amazing action scenes and introduces in a big way new fresh characters to the marvel cinematographic universe such as black panther and the new rebooted spiderman its a serious contender for super hero movie of the year highly recommended its 2 hr and 26 minutes of pure fun i am expecting that x men can also deliver that will see it later oh my god black panther and ant man were very fresh and gain enormous protagonism civil war a success as a superhero movie  no matter you are team cap or  team iron man you would be pleased after seeing the whole movie oh i can wait for the black panther movie 
Apr 13 2016,positive,great movie dynamite from the  beggin to the end very different from the original comic but still works marvel has found the perfect mixture between action plot and even jokes spiderman and blackpanther were the best characters
Apr 13 2016,positive,best movie from the marvel cinematic universe period
Apr 13 2016,positive,this was an amazing film it was very well done i dont really have any complaints with this movie the russo brothers were able to create this real conflict between the heroes where it is easy to see where either side is coming from it isnt a black and white issue zemo was perfect for what he needed to be he just was someone who was doing what he could to get conflict to arise more and more in the avengers and ultimately he got what he wanted and i really find that fascinating you could really feel the tension between tony and cap in this movie the action sequences are also done really well the airport scene is absolutely amazing
Apr 13 2016,positive,everything you could ask for in a superhero movie  its the culmination of everything the mcu has put out till now and its an incredible pay off a gut punch of a movie that pulls out all the stops
Apr 13 2016,positive,zemo seemed shoehorned
Apr 13 2016,positive,the best comic movie i ever seen 
Apr 13 2016,positive,possibly the best superhero movie to date batman v superman take note on how its done right
Apr 13 2016,positive,as dc crashes and burns marvel prevails again this movie can finally wash the horrible taste of the realistic batman v superman out of our mouths the story is crafted carefully and beautifully scarlet witch black panther and spiderman steal the fight scenes while the battle against the entire avengers rips at your heart strings its almost if not actually oscar worthy
Apr 13 2016,positive,avengers 3 was great
Apr 13 2016,positive,so awesome could have used more spidey though still amazing
Apr 13 2016,positive,i really enjoyed this movie everything youve heard is true spiderman black panther  the airport battle are awesome also awesome falcon ant man and rdj will definitely see this again in a theater
Apr 13 2016,positive,at a time when super hero fatigue hd really began to set in with myself i find that due to the russo brothers latest instalment in the mcu i have found a reinvigorated interest in this genre     the story telling is brilliant and they make what i feel is arguably my 2nd favourite comic book movie to date the dark knight is no1 there feels like there is real stakes and accountability for the actions our protagonists take this is something that has been lacking i feel thus far from the mcu they manage to integrate comedic elements into the serious moments which we saw done so well in winter soldier probably the best feat is once invested you will find yourself flipflopping between the two opposing sides and that internal turmoil keeps you invested in the 2hrs 27min run time    all characters are given their chance to shine be it from captain america down to hawk eye the introduction to the new heroes is brilliant and i think the new spiderman tom holland absolutely knocks it out the park black panther felt at home with chadwick boseman doing a superb job in the role the two leads in chris evens and robert downy jr do what i think is their best work to date in the mcu    my only complaint is once again the villain seems to be shoe horned in and is never fully developed his motivation seems to be fairly weak but serves his purpose for the story    overall a superb movie which will get multiple viewings my my account
Apr 13 2016,positive,this is goob movieee i like it lots
Apr 13 2016,positive,the latest and greatest offering from the marvel cinematic universe the perfect comicbook crossover of a story that starts in iron man continues in the avengers and concludes in captain america all while expertly juggling nearly the entire roster of characters and easily introducing several new characters well done
Apr 13 2016,positive,in my opinion it was the best avenger movie that has been made the action was obviously amazing and the drama was on point the best part however was the plot the writers really did a good job on this one
Apr 13 2016,negative,this is a fascinating movie for me the script is utter garbage that tries its hardest to make logical sense and fails spectacularly under the slightest bit of scrutiny but everyone from the directors to the actors is so convinced its not utter shit that they almost manage to fool you    no ones motivation makes sense whatsoever none at all tonys whole thing is that a young man full of potential died in sokovia because of a war he started whats his bright idea with spiderman bringing in a young man full of potential into a war zone to battle amongst the most dangerous men and women on the planet i could just hear tonys validity just scream as it plummeted towards the ground off a skyscraper and splat    captain america stupid bullshit about freedom he talks about how everyone in governing bodies has an agenda then he repeatedly withholds information and does things solely for his own interest aka his friend bucky also steve fuck you age of ultron is the perfect example of how the safest hands are our own isnt true does anyone bring this point up in the movie no not at all because that would be drawing attention to the fact caps motivation is stupid     another problem is the sokovia accords they make no sense the avengers didnt set up shield which leads to the hydra takeover which leads to aou thats on fury and the government does anyone bring this point up no does anyone bring up nick furys involvement in this nope    also can we please stop acting as if the sokovia accords are the registration act from the comics because its not its not forcing super powered people to either work for the government or go to prison it is solely on people who were or are members of the avengers     sharons whole spiel about peggy being oppressed because she was a woman makes no sense in light of this the government isnt oppressing you because you have powers steve its not rounding super powered people up and putting them into the negative zone what the actual fuck are you people even talking about     antman and hawkeye have no reason to be in this movie antmans whole thing is proving to himself his exwife and his daughter are that hes a hero he just throws that all away because fuck you we need to pander to the fanboys with giantman now if the accords were a registration act like everyone in this goddamn movie is acting like they are antman joining up with cap would make sense     hawkeye happily retires in aou its one of the best parts about that movie that the guy who you know the least amount has the most out of anyone to lose his reason for being here nothing     spiderman hawkeye and antman shouldve been axed for hulk youd create a nice parallel where both sides of the conflict have dear friends on the opposing team and hulk would have good reason to be involved in this movie logically and thematically its sure as hell more sensible than putting him into a movie about the norse god apocalypse     like with vision the big reveal of the movie happens  too late into the proceedings for me to care and this has that weird mos  bvs thing where there is essentially no second act its a big long setup act and a big long finale act with barely a bridge between them    so yeah for a movie thats trying its hardest to make everyones arguments seem mature and logical it utterly fails in many ways its just as appallingly stupid as the comic but the way the directors are shooting it and the way everyone is acting it you honestly cant tell on a first viewing its like if dark knight was filmed and acted the exact same way we know it with a script thats on par with a transformers movie
Apr 13 2016,positive,great film cap 2 had the political spy thriller theme and cap 3 rises to expectations with a well crafted psychological thriller embeded in a super hero film
Apr 13 2016,positive,perfect movie great action scenes and plot
Apr 13 2016,positive,the marvel cinematic universe has provided some great superhero action films within the past eight years but i believe captain america civil war might just be the best one yet it successfully combines drama and humor together and has some of the best action scenes ive seen in a superhero movie to date all the returning characters are great along with excellent new additions like black panther and spider man i would highly recommend this film to all superhero fans out there overall score 1010
Apr 13 2016,positive,this movie is a gift from the gods straight up i dont know where to start yo i was shaking the whole time it was that good the bucky and sam moments were the best thing to ever happen in film history spiderman has the best introduction youve ever seen forrealzies the best comic book movie of all time no question there go see this movie bless yourself trust me dawg 9875010
Apr 13 2016,positive,good not great it was enjoyable but i dont feel the need to see it again
Apr 13 2016,positive,i give it a full 55    a well paced engaging action thriller that just happens to include super hero characters very well scripted well acted and well directed  spider man black panther and antman steal the show    a departure from the previous marvel films in tone but still retains that fun familiar feel that marvel films have a great continuation from cap 2 the winter soldier but also an equally well continuation from ironman 3 and  avengers age of ultron  i dare to say that if this film disappoints you then perhaps these marvel movies are just not for you i hear the jungle book is fantastic go see that then     i dare say that marvel studios in a 5 min cameo do peter parkers character more justice than sony pictures managed in 5 full length features     daniel
Apr 13 2016,positive,i havent seen this movie but its definitely a 65 that scene where spiderman fights venom and carnage while iron man takes on optimus prime is the most explosive scene in the history of french cinema this isnt even an action movie its a love story with a steampunk aesthetic    captain americas sex scene with bucky is one for the ages and something the whole family can enjoy     who knows what infinity war will hold now that cap has been declared the ruler of the world only to be sent out into the galaxy on a space crucifix classic marvel
Apr 13 2016,positive,best marvel film as of yet had everything i love such great dialog and fantastic action
Apr 13 2016,positive,right so there are only two superhero films so far thatve connected with me emotionally one being the amazing spiderman 2 and the other being the dark knight rises i am so glad to say that captain america civil war is the third fantastic story incredible action especially the airport fight scene dont even get me started about spiderman my god he is perfect
Apr 13 2016,positive,two superheroes go into a fight because of a confusion thanks to a villian behind the curtain sound familiar it is but better done in almost every aspect is a complete hell of a ride with amazing characters fantastic moments and the perfect introduction to our friendly neighborhood spiderman
Apr 13 2016,positive,if there is a flawless mcu movie its this one by comparison mind you this hits the tones that everyone wanted marvel to hit and its all thanks to the russo brothers ultimately this is captain americas story a character that is a reflection of american beliefs and ideals against the current american realities every second is enjoyable mustsee in terms of anticipation and intrigue
Apr 13 2016,positive,incredible movie  surprising history the introduction of black panther and spiderman is perfect there is a problem with the villain because it was not needed but overall the film is a success
Apr 13 2016,positive,best mcu movie the captain america franchise has continue to become greater and greater after the other cuss this movie is truly a captain america movie even tho other avengers are in it but its from what hes thinking and what he thinks is best teamcap and shout out to the whole cap team black panther and spiderman
Apr 13 2016,negative,a lot of humor dead villains a lot of jokes a piece of civil war comics  610
Apr 13 2016,positive,excellent movie great story well directed each character get their shining moment wow the airport scene only weakness is the villains plot which i thought wasnt necessary and too far fetched overall great zach snyder and wb should take note this is how a super hero movie should be
Apr 13 2016,positive,totally awesome all the marvel fans must watch it even nonmarvel fans must watch it
Apr 13 2016,positive,fun witty actionpacked maybe my favorite marvel superhero film
Apr 13 2016,positive,sometimes when people hype stuff up theres always the fear that you go into the movie with expectations way too high thats what i was worried about for the first part of the movie  although i gotta say the movie kicks off wdamn good action scene  im glad to report this movie didnt just live up to my expectations it easily exceeded them    the action was on a whole other level from other movies in the genre and on top of the good action you had a real solid story  at its heart its a story of friendship accountability loyalty and betrayal real great ingredients for an awesome story  i think the best part of all is this movies repeatability because those action scenes are so grand its hard to take it all in on one viewing  this movie really brings out the kid or geek in me will be seeing this multiple times
Apr 13 2016,positive,excellent  every character has a moment to shine  brilliant pay offs to multiple dangling plot threads and references in previous films  great intros to spidey  black panther the latter having a wonderful story arc  scarlet witch was a standout for me  the closing battle between cap  iron man put bvs to shame imo  that fight mattered  they had real reasons for nearly killing each other and just as many for not doing so  so much to love here for longtime fans
Apr 12 2016,neutral,this overstuffed superhero sandwich has all the avengers you can eat so calling it a captain america movie is a bit misleading yeah they fight some of it is kind of cool to watch when its not a bunch of heads yakking on the screen to pad the run time spiderman is very promising if you still get excited after the previous five bigscreen attempts old aunt may is now marisa tomei antman is still really stupid i cant with that character the main villain is not interesting at all and most definitely the weak teat on this mama cat its better than age of ultron not as good as winter soldier and a long ad for the next phase universe or whatever you want to call it they wont stop making these you wont stop going
Apr 12 2016,positive,that feeling you get when you have high expectations on something but youre also scared it might not be that good but at the end its even better than whatever you could have dare to dream and beyond if that feeling has a name id use it with captain america civil war
Apr 12 2016,positive,it was really really good
Apr 12 2016,positive,best marvel movie by far best superhero vs superhero movie ever
Apr 12 2016,positive,snyder pay attention you just got schooled son i would say i still prefer the winter soldier but this is how to do a traditional summer action blockbuster tent pole loved it
Apr 12 2016,positive,awesome tons of superheroes in this non stop action
Apr 12 2016,positive,captain america civil war manages to balance out its vast array of powerful characters while still remaining a captain america story and a continuation of his friendship with bucky as well as falcon emotional stakes are the highest theyve ever been and you can see both sides of the argument which is a credit to the performances and directors the action is also the best ive ever seen in a comic book film airport scene and new characters such as black panther and spiderman are weaved perfectly into the story both being stand outs in this incredible movie it also wouldnt be fair not to mention antman as paul rudd provides a lot of humour in a very serious movie without detracting from the story and also is a stand out in the fight scenes as for the rest of the avengers they dont feel forced into the story and all service their characters very well
Apr 12 2016,positive,way back in 20062007 marvel ran a story line that redefined what it meant to be a superhero it dove deep into the grey blur between right and wrong forcing some of their most notable comic book heroes to draw a line in the sand and demand the other heroes see their point of view at the time it was one of the best comic book story lines in years and made headlines for major revelations and deaths in the marvel universe 10 years later the marvel cinematic universe has done something that hasnt been done by any comic book film ever made it took a particular comic book story line reimagined it and made it better much better       as the story goes the last we left captain america after the events of winter soldier and avengers age of ultron we have a world where threats are becoming increasingly more dangerous and happen more often than not in the midst of capturing a terrorist an avengers disaster in which several innocents are killed the question of accountability finally comes into play and the un demands that oversight be instated to determine where the avengers can go and where they cannot fearing the worst steve rodgers aka captain america fresh off the dissolved shieldhydra meltdown and disillusionment with leaders and their agendas refuses to sign accords which grant powers to figure of authority us secretary of state thaddeus ross tony stark aka iron man immediately signs them following the events of the last few films and what happens early on in civil war here is where the conflict comes into play on the surface however with bucky barnes aka the winter soldier involved a mysterious new player named zemo and the need for tony to redeem himself for his actions a lot complications arise        in theory this film shouldnt work and there should be next to zero character development but amazingly it all does every single hero and supporting character gets a moment in the spotlight and shines the airport scene alone is now sorry spiderman 2 the greatest action superhero battle sequence ever done with moments of pure action hilarity suspense and melancholy the effects are extremely top notch if you think antmans young michael douglas was incredible wait until you see who gets the younger look treatment done to perfection here the pacing is great considering its 2 hour plus run time and the small moments of the film are perfect the action sequences despite all the effects are as kinetic as ever and both sides play to their strengths beautifully what really works wonderfully in my opinion is how the russos manage to have audiences feel sympathetic to both captain america  iron mans point of view this is something that the comic book story line as brilliant as it was didnt get quite right as most readers were on the side of captain americas view of protecting the identity of heroes rather than iron mans view of registering every superhero under a registration act that would catalogued their abilities and identities and possibly also make them vulnerable to their villains here it is a different scenario but with a similar theme on the one hand tony sees a chance at redemption and have oversight to keep them from racking up civilian casualties using valuable resources other registered superheroes that could be utilized to better the world on the other steve sees the possibility of another hydra scenario and decides that the world is still safer in the avengers hands and no one else especially when he begins to notice that certain events dont add up both heroes have good points and are blinded by what they think is right instead of what is actually right       as a whole this film is definitely top five of all 13 marvel films released to date where the good folks at disney  marvel take us from here is up to them but damn it all if it isnt something to be really excited about there is so much more i would like to say about this film especially about spiderman black panther and antman but ill leave you all to discuss that on your owns after you catch this film definitely watch in theaters if you manager and on the biggest screen possible too this is one event film you wont want to miss and now ill leave you with this quote from the film which pretty much sums up a central theme for the whole story    compromise where you can where you cant dont even if everyone is telling you that something wrong is something right even if the whole world is telling you to move it is your duty to plant yourself like a tree look them in the eye and say no you move
Apr 12 2016,positive,marvel just said boom and dropped the mic  must see film
Apr 12 2016,positive,its like bvs but a little less moody and a little more candy crush saga
Apr 12 2016,positive,this was the best superhero movie i have ever seen marvel did it again
Apr 12 2016,positive,great movie waiting for the next one
Apr 12 2016,positive,no spoilers    one of the best marvel movies and one of the finest superhero movies to date brilliantly written and directed by the same team that brought us captain america the winter soldier this sequel is a master class in transcending genre trappings like mindnumbing and sfx heavy fight scenes to provide audiences a  characterdriven and emotionally powerful story that dares to be profound     despite a huge cast of new and old characters who willcanshould carry their own movie the script amazingly manages to give them all moments to shine with each actor at the top of their game civil war is really avengers 3 way stronger than age of ultron yet it never forgets to remind us this is first and foremost a captain america story chris evans gives us his best portrayal yet of a decent man trying to stay true to himself in spite of the moral relativism of these contemporary times and even his motives become questionable when the conflict gets personal     which makes robert downey jrs guiltridden iron man the perfect antagonist he may be the chief opponent but more so than ever downey offers up his strongest performance yet keeping tony stark righteous charming and emotionally conflicted the first half of the movie makes it a point to show where each of these heroes are coming from you understand why the conflict becomes inevitable so when these two heroes come to blows its a fight not about right or wrong but of differing philosophies leading to a tragedy of shakespearean proportions     it may sound like civil war is all grim and gritty but the directors keep marvels trademark humor intact throughout the flick especially through the wellchoreographed action sequences that clearly tell you whats going on that will have you laughing and cheering when the heroes face off in the huge action climax all shot with imax cameras no matter who youre rooting for this isnt just a case of the heroes using their powers against each other but their personalities playing off each other as well honestly its hard to find any fault in this movie aside from the pacing in the first half being a little on the slow side compared to the winter soldier     the thrill of civil war is how it feels like a huge payoff for marvel cinematic universe fans all the interconnections between all the marvel movies creates an epic mosaic thats beautiful to look at and gets us amped up on what happens next once again marvel proves to the superhero haters that theres still a lot of life to the formula brilliant work
Apr 11 2016,positive,the best of the marvel cinematic universe have every mcu formula and it blends so well in the movie my worries of marvel cant blend in so many characters in a movie is just pure unnecessary every character have its own role and the main plot is clear the airport battle is brilliant and packs tonnes of awesomeness every character have their own time and the interactive among the character is well execute  hats off to everyone that spend their time and effort to create this great movie
Apr 11 2016,positive,zach synder start taking notes the russo brothers have made a masterpiece that manages to be funny dramatic and intense best spiderman to date black panther is great and barron zemos character is surprisingly complex the best cbm trilogy to date and arguable the best marvel movie to date
Apr 11 2016,positive,as perfect a superhero movie as riveting an actionspy thriller and as nerdy a comic book flick as it gets with the most mindblowing action set pieces ever put to film this is the right way to bring together a host of established characters and equally servicing each one of them while effortlessly introducing two stupendous new ones in black panther and spiderman and all without giving everything away in the trailers
Apr 11 2016,positive,i will go out and say i thoroughly enjoyed this film i honestly did the build up was immense with even downloading the music to the trailers due to the intensity of the music marvel seriously have raised the bar with this     as ive sat several times now in the cinema watching this film i cant help but think that there are so many flaws in the story stark created ultron so why isnt he himself being held accountable after all the rest of the avengers either didnt know or didnt want anything to do with it if the wakandans were going to complain about the loss of life at the start well what wouldve happened if rumlow had escaped with the biological weapon there wouldve been uproar about the release of the agent and the avengers wouldve been slated the same with the detonation of rumlows bomb the same with knowing who killed starks parents either that or it wasnt hard to work out in winter soldier who actually did it and with the release of all of shields and hydras files and with stark owning them all anyway im surprised he hasnt come across the evidence already and why on earth wasnt there a camera on zemo at any single point     i am nitpicking here but it really does let the film down especially with the retoned dialogue from the trailer to the film    the film itself is great aside from my nitpicking the way they built zemo up the development of bucky the passion from captain america and the arrogance of stark just blend so well    roll on secret avengers
Apr 11 2016,positive,captain america never has a bad movie
Apr 11 2016,positive,awesome   antman becoming giantman and black panthers cool  spiderman is a rock star
Apr 11 2016,positive,want to see it hope itll be a good movie
Apr 11 2016,positive,second favorit movie of 2016
Apr 11 2016,positive,this movie shines when balancing the crowded ensemble amongst a legitimate outer threat that tears its way through the avengers
Apr 11 2016,positive,with tons of laughs teeth gritting action twists parodies and plot lines that branch off into limitless new storylines how could anyone not love this film marvel has done it again reams of old character mixed with an equal amount of new ones that all work so well together and have actors who all out shine each other this movie has hit my all  time great action hero films list as i know it will yours
Apr 11 2016,positive,i was impressed by the storyline  thank goodness they didnt use the same old villain versus the avengers template  they touched on some deeper topics and still kept me on the edge of my seat with their trademark action and wittiness
Apr 11 2016,positive,saw the movie last night throughly enjoyed it best super hero movie ever it is not but it does hold its own intro of black panther and new spiderman were welcomed great action scenes and a good twist last 5 minutes werent much to desire but all in all you shouldnt be disappointed
Apr 11 2016,positive,this is how batman v superman should have been
Apr 11 2016,positive,very good it is better than the avengers 2012
Apr 11 2016,positive,pro best spiderman ever awesome debut for black panther best super hero battle ive seen probably best avengers movie yet    con didnt really care about the story minus the avengers stuff mcu still having a problem with compelling villians little slow in the first act    overall although i dont feel it beats winter soldier  hard to beat its still a solid movie with a coherent story and great action solid a
Apr 11 2016,positive,i dont know how to explain my love for this movie go see it if you havent
Apr 11 2016,positive,nice story with lots of action and new people that is made up as if they are slowly moving out the old for new  we will have to see how that works in the films to come
Apr 11 2016,positive,all ypu ahem critics are hilarious all will bow to the mcu
Apr 10 2016,negative,too long and too many characters action was pretty good though i would have preferred seeing hulk and thor over spiderman and antman plot was somewhat confusing
Apr 10 2016,negative,worst movie ever stupid marvel fanboys
Apr 10 2016,positive,best marvel movie up to date
Apr 10 2016,positive,awesomeness one of the best marvel movies yet 
Apr 10 2016,negative,no surprise that critics are slurping up mickey nut butter im sure they will get a fat check
Apr 10 2016,positive,great movie with total bad ass black panther
Apr 10 2016,positive,civil war is a fun movie that shows the darker side of our favorite marvel characters while yet again the villain is wasted the film still delivers a good time at the movies newcomers black panther and spiderman are the two standout characters that get the audience excited for their upcoming movies
Apr 10 2016,positive,great fun need to watch again but i have to say though spidey is great his inclusion in the film seems a little last minute and forced  im guessing it took away from the black panther back story which is fine because i now have more anticipation for his solo movie  in addition to the next ant man  wasp flick  who needs iron man  cap with such rich supporting characters that steals the show   dont listen to anyone this is not a sequel to cap winter soldier i found rdj dominating most of the screen time  awesome movie cant wait for more viewings  also though it should have been super heavy brutal decisions  conflict they still some how made it feel like a school yard brawl between frustrated buddies or athletes not trying to really go at each other  the banter always works in all the right moments
Apr 10 2016,positive,i wont be peppering these comments with superlatives the grade ive given should cover my opinion of this movie what can be said is how much each of the characters shinedtheir wit  humor and charm was well represented most superhero movies have defined good vs evil as well as what side the hero is on but what happens when the lines are blurred thats what makes this movie so different from others my only complaint is since this movie is so good it will be too long until is arrives on dvd for me to buy my copy
Apr 10 2016,positive,one of the best directed and written marvel movies
Apr 10 2016,positive,good story  the characters you love and new ones you will love soon you can see both sides
Apr 10 2016,positive,it was kind of hard to believe the betrayal between cap and iron man they were never actually that close
Apr 10 2016,positive,la mejor de marvel desde avengers iron man y guardians of the galaxy
Apr 10 2016,positive,oh my god this movie changed my life it was so good and so emotional im thinking of scheduling therapy after this experience the movie was a work of art spiderman was amazing lol poor bucky was so lost and precious just wanted to give him a hug black panther was soooo perfect and true to his character went into the theater  a team cap supporter and walked out on both teams is that a choice idk but very mature great action sequences and love th character development marvels best movie so thankful for this film
Apr 10 2016,positive,my gosh marvel marvelous does it again
Apr 10 2016,positive,this will be an amazing movie comic book fans will love it
Apr 10 2016,positive,doing something that wouldnt be possible without 12 previous movies is exactly what makes this movie so powerful that on top of tremendous performances incredible writing and a stellar directing team willingness to take risks change the status quo and make the audience uncomfortable is why this movie is more emotionally impactful than the others  its downright heartbreaking at times    but most importantly this movie manages to juggle a massive cast while succeeded in giving every character their moments nobody feels underserved that takes an immense amount of skill from a whole team of people and that is obviously what they had
Apr 10 2016,positive,this movie has a prefect balance of drama exposition humor and phenomenal action the russo brothers have once again brought captain america on screen in a way that fleshes out his character in a brilliant way one knock on this movie is the weak antagonist but in the end the ideological differences the heroes share drives the story foreword the comic book version of civil war has been done justice in a different and captivating way that fits seamlessly into the narrative of the mcu this film is a must see and a triumph in the comic book movie genre
Apr 10 2016,positive,let me start with this  captain america civil war is my favorite marvel studios movie now till yesterday it was captain america the winter soldier another masterpiece directed by the same visionaries behind this one    it always gives me ineffable pleasure and happiness when i see the marvel flip logo playing at the start of a marvel studios movie needless to say no other production company logo has earned that respect from me in simpler words marvel studios knows what fans want and they deliver    two months ago another blockbuster came out from dc plot wise both these movies are exactly the same heroes cause catastrophes while saving the world and held responsible one chooses to serve the government another stays vigilante and fight ensues friends become enemies emotions got hurt dc rather snyder showed how to do it wrong marvel russo brothers and especially your highness kevin feige shows how to do it right    marvel studios movies are not for casual movie goers these movies are for geeks and nerds like me who live and breath marvel anyone watching this for the first time will have problem understanding exactly what is going on and whos who and why someone is doing something so to understand it you gotta go through the first twelve movies and numerous tv shows first told ya i am a nerd    btw this new spiderman stole the show so does black panther marvel casting never fails and russo brothers are my new favorite action movie directors as long as talented passionate filmmakers like these two brothers continue to be brought aboard to take these stories and characters in fresh directions there is no reason to expect this massive franchise will grow stale or lose its vitality anytime soon    now waiting begins for the two parter infinity war movies again helmed by these gems and yeah for spiderman homecoming 2017 and black panther 2018 too
Apr 10 2016,negative,as expected  critics took as good this movie just because it is fun you fuckers  fanboys marvel and disney  as it shows that are critical fucking paid for disney and marvel  dc makes better movies that marvel and more realistic  captain civil america war is an insult to comic civil war  when the comic there are more than 100 heroes and is just 10 heroes putos appear  and to save the movie humble themselves before sony it then appears spiderman and have hearing  and rotten tomatoes lost credibility
Apr 10 2016,positive,amazing so close to reaching the dizzying heights of the winter soldier it doesnt quite get there but its provoking occasionally emotional and entirely dazzling
Apr 10 2016,positive,great movie the action the emotionthe stakes the comedy all on point both sides are fleshed out its everything i wanted it to be  one thing that may bother people is how much this movie is tied in continuity if you havent watched a marvel movie youll be lost but personally it added to the experience
Apr 10 2016,positive,my hopes might have been too high but it did not hinder what is still a great movie the airport fight scene daaaaamn would have like to see the movie focus in on a single plot line instead of running with the 4 they had and jumping all around think the visionwitch story could have been done in another movie just too much going one but they did a good job with it even still loved it but still put gotg antman avengers 1 and winter soldier above it
Apr 10 2016,positive,im not gonna spoil one single thing since this movie should be seen by only the two trailers you probably saw dont watch any tvspots after the second trailer or whatever    im gonna touch a few aspects and rate them    acting of course its amazing the characters we were waiting for were black panther and of course spiderman both were done amazing spiderman has a bigger role than i personally expected and its done with grace love it black panther was such a good character with great motivation why hes doing what hes doing the acting per usual from the other characters were great 1010    story now where another lets leave it unnamed superhero movie failed this year and no im not talking about deadpool was the story now this story is what i expected from the other unnamed superhero movie i didnt know what side i wanted to be on caps or iron mans i was so conflicted and even while theyre fighting you dont know who to root for the villain in this movie felt a bit not really out of place but unnecessary in my opinion but marvel always struggles to find a good fleshed out villain except for loki  kingpin in the series 810     actioncinematography o boyif youre an action freak you will love this if youre a comic book fan youre gonna live these amazing action set pieces the much anticipated airport scene is amazing youve seen nothing literally nothing of the amazing action that will bestow upon you guys the airport scene is in complete imax and has a runtime of around 17 minutes just let that sink in the russo brothers know how to create great action and film it great as well i can go on record and say this is by far the best superhero action scenes ever 2010     verdict was it a perfect movie no but for me as a fan it came darn close the only thing that bothered me were the villains well actually one of the few that are in there     was it better than batman v superman yes by far i mean were in a comic book movie year so we might as well compare it batman v superman lacked in a lot of places and civil war just did it better just the conflict in ideologies made it so much more believable why the characters fought and because this whole story arc is happening now after 2 cross over movies 3 iron movies and 2 cap movies the stakes are so incredibly high i tried to compare deadpool with it as well but its a different movie in terms of it being a solo movie and setting something up instead of showing a conflict between good and good instead of good and evil   checkmate haters and sorry its just not your year i have seen this movie but i wont mention a single spoiler here if you guys want proof you can pm me and ill tell you how the movie ends and the after credits the reason im really writing this review is that i know there will be biased people here wholl write that bvs is better and this is trash etc etc well just see this movie and judge for yourself speaking briefly of the movie it is an emotional roller coaster with an absolutely beautiful end spidey had a satisfying screen time as for the acting by the time the movie ended i was a happy man russovs are handling infinity war and after watching this movie how they did justice to characters ill not worry a movie we wanted as well as deserverusso brothers did an amazing job with this film i loved every scene in this filmthe action is amazingits good to see chris evans again as capitan americarobert  well he is tony stark and i actually loved him this film more than in his own movies black panther antman y spiderman they are just amazing and interesting characters in the film visual effects are amazing and the battles are really good i thought that marvel will never do a very good movie like it was winter soldier but i was wrong i was totally wrong i dont like to compare but i enjoy this film more than batman v superman its obviously that it is not perfect thats sure but for me this is the best marvel movie and i cant wait for the infinity war the mcu is in good hands with the russo brothers  why are you waiting for me to review this when you should watch it instead    you already know that this is one of the best marvel movies to date you already know that this movie has an all star cast you already know that this movie has great directors you already know that this movie is adapting one of the most iconic stories you already know that this movie introduces two great new characters  you may already know that this spiderman is regarded as the defining pp and spiderman you may already know that this black panther is a badass you may already know that the action scenes are newinventive and great you may already know that this movie has a lot off heart and emotion  you can predict this movie will cross the billion mark you can predict this movie is a movie for all fans and not just the comic fans you can predict that only dc fan boysgirls will not find this review helpful
Apr 9 2016,positive,come for the superhero fun youve come to expect stay for one of the most fullyfleshed out villains in mcu history the refreshing addition of spiderman and black panther and martin freemans american accent    ps in tackling the question of collateral damage and responsibility heroes face when saving the world civil war does a more than give lip service looking at you bvs
Apr 9 2016,positive,captain america civil war    captain america and iron man have to very different ideals about how the avengers should work iron man wants everyone to be in check since theyve killed so many people and he feels bad captain america knows what happens when good people do nothing and doesnt want government telling him who to save and who to not    the russo brothers directed both this movie and winter soldier the precursor to this movie ive only see that and the community and so far theyve done nothing wrong for met yet the direction of this movie must have been a massive undertaking and for that i applaud them    christopher markus must have done a ton of research into the civil war event because there are so many amazing shots in the film that he must have wrote in i cant wait for infinity war since hes also writing the screenplay    the cast in this film is a mile long and a mile deep each character gets their own screen time but not without taking away from this being captain americas movie it all felt like this was his story and yes there are other characters and here are what theyre doing it didnt feel like a three act movie but more like 4 or 5 almost leaving the film i felt almost exhausted with details to think about    newcomer black panther played by chadwick boseman i first saw this young actor in draft day and man he played that part well hes showing his range and why he deserves to be in the avengers     tom holland was by far the definitive and best spiderman weve had i say this having loved andrew garfields performance but he felt too old and not funny enough tom holland encapsulated what i felt was a genuine performance and quotable spiderman    emily vancamp kinda disappointed me i dont want to say this film is flawless and she along with daniel bruhl also were some of the downfalls that keep this film from being the best super hero movie i kept waiting for sharon carter vancamp to do something and it all felt mute in the end    the easy list  best captain america  best winter soldier  best falcon  best scarlet witch  a great iron man  a great antman  meh black widow  meh war machine  meh hawkeye  disappointing vision  disappointing crossbones    verdict everyone should watch the film theres barely any cursing and the violence is not over the top some scenes are whats the importance of this few scenes later oh okay well that makes sense
Apr 9 2016,positive,capt is my fav of the marvel films and therefore i expected more
Apr 9 2016,positive,a great marvel superhero movie featuring most of its favorite characters and introducing new ones it also features an action packed plot that was entertaining a
Apr 9 2016,positive,captain america civil war while not as stellar as the winter soldier is easily marvels most emotional and mature movie to date packed with amazing characters from iron man to marvels latest antman both old and new fans of the mcu will find a lot to enjoy black panther and spiderman are fantastic additions to marvels cast of characters however this is a captain america movie and i praise marvel for managing to successfully keep the spotlight on him while also bringing in many other characters overall civil war is an action packed movie fans will definitely enjoy
Apr 9 2016,positive,âïâïâï12   the next chapter in the captain america saga features some of the best action scenes character development and thought provoking plot of all the marvel films after an accident involving the avengers the governments of the world decide they should be regulated ill stop there any more ill give too much away the film is full of shocking moments but never to the point where it is exhausting the film always moves but never too fast where the audience will get lost there is not much i can talk about without giving much away all i will say is captain america civil war proves to all the doubters that the superhero movie is stronger then ever
Apr 9 2016,positive,best captain america movie yet only issues are that the baddie is weak and its a major departure from the source material
Apr 9 2016,negative,this film promises much  but its just a movie full of bad jokes and pointless
Apr 9 2016,negative,boring movie horrible plot the only good thing were the fight scenes obviously put in there to dazzle the audience and then add some explosions and people simply ignore the horrible plot and the many mistakes through the movie batman v superman the other hero vs hero clash had a much better plot stayed more true to its source material and honored the fans much more than this one in fact they have more respect for the fans by giving them a complicated plot whereas in civil war and every mcu movie before it the plot is so simple a 5 year old understands it completely how people can like this over bvs i can understand being fans and all will do that but how critics can rate this higher than bvs from a critical standpoint that i dont understand bvs got backlash for its plot being all over the place even though its all connected to lex luthor civil wars plot was even worse how can you as self proclaimed internet critics hate on 1 movie for its complicated plot but then love another that has no plot but dazzling fights and fun jokes in a war that was never a war to begin with in a movie thats being nullified and left completely irrelevant by its ending as all mcu movies do no self respecting critic would call that good unless they were biased which seems to be the case with rotten tomatoes rotten indeed it seems even that critics dont appreciate accurate adaptations i just noticed ratchet and clank got a very low score as well here and that movie is as accurate as it gets maybe you people need to dig more into the fandom and what its all about before judging something as bad or good from my perspective a civil war is a civil war not a fight between friends on a tarmaq where an underage boy gets dragged in that has nothing to do with the whole fight in the first place and is just there to stroke the ego of the two main protoganists or 1 guy falling from thousands of feet high crashing into the ground in a metal suit but lives to tell the tale or running faster than cars but then deciding to chase each other in a car and bike or ruining yet another great villain 2 even or just dropping random characters at random points of the movie or the fact that this movie is supposedly based on an all out war between all marvel characters yet for this movie they couldnt even get all established movie characters this story came much too soon and its already been established and confirmed by the russo brothers that the only reason marvel studios greenlit this movie was too compete with batman v superman dawn of justice and from the looks of it half of what happened in civil war was a direct and complete rip off from bvs almost seemed as if they had acces to bvs script a manipulating villain a bombing where an important political person dies an attack by terrorists in an african country and thats just the beginning  if you truely are a critics then those are things you should and must have noticed so my guess is that youre just mcu fanboys sabotaging the dceu by giving bad reviews to make sure the mcu movies make more money as most people tend to believe critics words   you know what i call that  power abuse and a disgrace to the profession
Apr 9 2016,positive,captain america civil war knocked me off my feet just when i thought that it would be difficult for marvel to outperform itself i was pleasantly shocked not only is this the best in the captain america series i dare say this is the best of the avengersmarvel universe the screenplay directing and of course the casting takes another notch in distinction theres nothing more thought provoking than a powerful story of redemption friendship honour nobility and justice especially when principles collide the quiet runup fuels the final act which will blow you away saying more would only lead to spoilers a must watch
Apr 9 2016,negative,too much talking and debating not enough action very disappointed with the movie
Apr 9 2016,positive,phenomenal best super hero movie yet
Apr 9 2016,positive,greatest marvel movie of all time period
Apr 9 2016,positive,best captain america movie
Apr 9 2016,neutral,the most anticipated marvel movie so far captain america civil war is just like avengers age of ultron a lot of characters and not enough room for them all it is also too over hyped and it is good just not great
Apr 9 2016,negative,because the comparison is unavoidable this film makes all the missteps that batman v superman dawn of justice made while it definitely outshines dcs attempt in certain areas namely character motivation it falls flat in comparison to others like bvs certain scenes shouldve been cut and certain aspects feel like tacked on fanservice cough spidermancough both films have disappointed me in in certain areas and in the same area the film entertains the idea of the superhero control but strangely refuses to do anything worthwhile with it it feels like its just there to make a film seem much deeper than it actually is as a result marvel delievers a film that is safe far too safe to be considered satisfying     you know what im going to go a bit deeper this movie fails in what it attempts to do the accords the most interesting part of the film are merely a plot device and can easily be forgotten throughout the rest of the film except the film wont let you instead it keeps on insisting that the accords are still the focus when it absolutley is not the case lets compare this to another high on the radar cbm the dark knight tdk has the theme of that at their core people are animals and all they need is a push the difference here is that tdk actually does something with this theme rather than just talk about it the entire climax of tdk focuses on this theme while the accords in civil war are just glanced over     the airport scene this scene was the last straw for me its a fight with absolutely no stakes or tension it is the literal embodiment of flash over substance there are no stakes because theres never a feeling that anyone could actually get hurt at least when batman fought superman there were stakes and someones life on the line     in every marvel film prior weve seen the avengers make the lives of civilians their priority yet this movie shows that marvel isnt afraid to have their cake and eat it too    in interviews the directors have expressed concern over making sure that the film makes sense apparently in this case that comes at the cost of compelling story telling as a result we get the most disappointing film marvel has ever put out    if youre hoping to see the superhero film that portrays a battle of morals and ethics youll keep waiting because this isnt it either  i wanted to love this movie i really did but the more i actually analyzed the more i just hated it 510 close but no cigar
Apr 9 2016,positive,dude this movie was great saw it the night it came out 1010 recommend
Apr 9 2016,positive,unforgetable movie probably the best movie in mcu
Apr 9 2016,negative,messy cgi fest and they turned a captain america movie into a avengers movie
Apr 9 2016,positive,the russo brothers have done it again     captain america civil war is everything you want from a marvel cinematic universe movie characters that have been established in previous movies which we are all emotionally connected to at this point some of the best action scenes in any comic book movie and everything is pieced together so perfectly     theres so many characters that have their moments to shine but in the end of the day the movie felt like it was a captain america movie from beginning to end no character is forced into the plot for every action there was a reaction it was the best build up i seen for a comic book film spiderman and black panther are the biggest stand outs in the movie for me even though each character blows me away tom holland is the best man for the job as peter parkerspiderman and he does amazing with the screen time he is given he was nerdy innocent and full of heart and his spiderman was full of energy  sarcasm i think everyone will be more than happy with him chadwick boseman does an incredible job as black panther his action scenes were some of the best in the movie and i love that he created a wakanda accent for the movie daniel brã 14hl was simple but effective as the villainous zemo even though he doesnt do much his plan is so big and hes more of the puppet master of everything i do hope we get to see more of daniel brã 14hl as zemo in future installments     final verdict captain america civil war is everything a comic book fan can ask for and more the best action scene for any comic book movie ever is in this movie the airport scene will blow everyone away the russo brothers did something that joss whedon couldnt do with two avengers movies make every character important and fit everything perfectly im so excited when they get their hands on infinity wars it might not have the same sophisticated story that the winter soldier had but they have created the best marvel movie ever 55 stars and it deserves it rightfully so
Apr 9 2016,positive,best marvel film ever best spiderman ever in marvel or sony movies marvel is leaving dc behind in good fashion
Apr 9 2016,positive,just oh my god this is spectacular not for a while that i was bored the whole film was exciting and tight especially winter soldier not pulling pack his force at all in any of the fights heartbreaking as well for tony i look forward to seeing this again maybe two more times
Apr 9 2016,positive,still musing over this film review to come soon
Apr 9 2016,positive,not quite 5 stars but only because i loved the original comic storyline and making a film that covered a full cross title event was always going to leave stuff out i might find on a second viewing id give it all 5 stars well pitched tone throughout that for me never went too dark or too light with action scenes and comedic moments that never feel out of place
Apr 9 2016,positive,i am completely convinced now that this website is owned and operated by disney this movie was good dont get me wrong but was it as good as the critics are saying while they bad mouth all the non disney superhero films whose themes are just as thought provoking that is what i disagree with i actually am not sure if i liked it more than winter soldier too much praise
Apr 9 2016,positive,captain americacivil war was the most anticipated movie of this year in my book and what else i can sayit just exceeded all of my expectations i meanthis film succeeds on everything you hoped it would be spidermanantman and black pantherall of them stole the show in the movie black panther was a complete badassantman was hilarious and awesomeand spiderman was justhats off as a spiderman fanthis is the best spiderman weve seen on screen he was also the best peter parker i cant wait to see more of him the action was top notch and the best you will ever see in a comicbook movie   everyone gets to shine in the filmand yesthis is a captain america story at some partsit does feel like avengers 25but not everytime the motivations of tony and steve are quite understandable and relatablerather than batman v superman one is trying to protect his best friend who he hasnt seen for 70 yearsand the other is just looking for redemption the main villain was completely ruthlessthe one you always wanted to see his motivations are also quite understandable the russo brothers know how to make a perfect summer blockbusterwith right amounts of thrillactioncomedydramasuspense and edgeoftheseat moments all i can say is infinity war is in completely good hands good luckrusso brothers
Apr 9 2016,positive,best captain americairon manspidermanavengers movie to date  another excellent movie from marvel cinema
Apr 9 2016,positive,even though the villan isnt very menacing civil war exceeds expectations and is by far the best marvel film and that airport sequence was fantastic
Apr 9 2016,positive,spiderman was best part
Apr 9 2016,negative,horrible not close to the comics and for being such a dragging movie it still felt that they rushed everything only positive scarjo looks amazing and black panther is cool thats all
Apr 9 2016,positive,after seeing the early buzz ill be expecting high 80s for this film at the very least
Apr 9 2016,positive,it was a ballet simultaneously grand operatic and thrilling and intimate heartbreaking and human it monumentally exceeds where others have failed because it handles the characters with intelligence love and understanding it may be another in a long line of a corporate franchise but its handled in the exact opposite manner
Apr 9 2016,negative,another movie for kids marvel with disney sucks
Apr 9 2016,positive,fantastic from start to finish motivations are clear characters are given ample opportunities to shine and spiderman was incredible i look forward to seeing this again
Apr 9 2016,positive,this was probably the best marvel movie to date fun action packed and every character gets the spotlight the mcu is in great hands with te russos
Apr 9 2016,positive,this movie was so amazing second best marvel  movie to date in my opinion saw it day before opening day seeing it again next week
Apr 9 2016,positive,absolutely spectacular compared to winter soldier civil war is more action filled but it fitted in well so well in the movie and actually did a great job with trying to tie in the story especially the twist at the end the showdown was badass and had a great sense of humor that didnt have the iron man 3 feeling to it they were filled in right and was entertaining loved it and cant wait to see how they get together in avengers infinity wars    btw spoiler this is probably the first time that you can say that the villains won
Apr 9 2016,positive,best superhero movie to datea little slow after initial action scenebut with the best super hero fight squence at the airport and brilliant acting throughouthave to give it 5 starsspiderman and black panther are great additions tooi cant wait for their stand alone movies

Apr 8 2016,positive,absolutely a must watch for a movie fans fantastic
Apr 8 2016,negative,hate how spiderman looks sorry just no
Apr 8 2016,positive,my god this movie was mind blowing the only negative i can say is how in the world will this movie get topped this movie was amazing and exceeded my expectations in a way no movie has done since dark knight this one i must say finally beat dark knight i was lucky enough to get to see the early prescreening for fans in thursday april 14th at 730 got my tickets through seeitfirst via caps twitter account     this movie is firstly a cap movie with a bunch of avengers added as the movie goes on it is action packed and takes the winter soldier hand to hand  action to another level spiderman ant man and mutherfing black panther were some scene stealers comedy was top notch but not forced in any way shape or form this is not aou funny more like winter soldier funny    yes that airport scene is as good as advertised it is better than you could ever imagine i was smiling the whole time it was absolutely mindblowing amazing incredible gritty dark at times funny at others just soooooo daaaaamn awesome i can not believe how good this movie is me and my gf immediately started talking about it as was everybody  around us people clapped multiple times during the movie and it got a standing ovation i have never in my life given a movie a standing o until this movie     we will see this movie atleast 2 times the weekend it officially comes out and many times more after that go see it the hype is completely real dont believe the negative reviews that say this is a kiddy boring movie this is anything but that its most definitely an adult movie but guess what you can take your kids and its damn fun who said dark  not fun not marvel enjoy
Apr 8 2016,positive,im not giving this movie 5 out of 5 stars because one part of the film came out slow but it got so much better with all those superheroes choosing which team to go on i also love how they did a first scene before marvel studios i dont know why they do that but im very happy i saw this movie i wanted to see it thinking it will be one of the best superhero movies ever made and yes it is even better than avengers age of ultron  everybody go watch this movie because you will all the time you need before walking in the theatres and experiencing a cinematic marvel amazement im not even kidding you will have fun with this movie there were a lot of funny moments from spiderman and people thought he is the best character he is really cool and have damn laughable humour dont miss this one    score 910
Apr 8 2016,positive,if youre a fan of the marvel universe this is a huge payoff for investing in these characters over the last 13 or so flicks  the action is a loud mixture of amazing setpieces and beautiful handheld camera work the editing is fantastic  energetic and smart startling and thoughtful  dont get me wrong the action in this flick is giant but this film is actually a wonderful concluding chapter in the captain america trilogy  its is a dramatic character piece and i loved every minute of it  black panther dominates all  and marvel did the impossible and made me excited for a new spiderman movie
Apr 8 2016,positive,best captain america movie yet a lot of deaths but super really good awesome movie
Apr 8 2016,positive,awww yeah one of the greatest cbms of all time
Apr 8 2016,positive,the russo brothers do it again a great addition to the marvel cinematic universe that leaves our heroes in a interesting place at the beginning of marvels phase 3
Apr 8 2016,positive,what super hero vs super hero should look like
Apr 8 2016,positive,one of my top movies loved spiderman and black panther best marvel movie yet
Apr 8 2016,positive,one of marvels best so far the russo brothers are incredible and have nailed two films id love to see if they do anything else for marvel in the future
Apr 8 2016,positive,this was the best marvel movie i have ever seen
Apr 8 2016,positive,finally the wait is over i loved this movie joe and anthony russo have done it again and gone and delivered us a brilliant superhero film they understand the characters and storylines so well and have done a great job at juggling all the characters the action throughout the entire movie was filmed brilliantly and it was clear and concise there were no action scenes that i wasnt able to capture with my eyes     i loved the introduction of the new characters to this universe such as spiderman and black panther tom holland did a bloody fantastic job as peter parker and as spiderman this is by far the best spiderman weve ever had and he hasnt even had his own movie yet thats amazing he was constantly cracking jokes throughout battles  which is exactly what weve needed from this character black panther was equally amazing chadwick boseman does a terrific job at portraying the character and he added a lot of depth in his scenes it gets me very excited for his stand alone film all of his action scenes had wonderful choreography     i loved the conflict between captain america and iron man both thinking they are doing the right thing it gets quite emotional at times as their friendship really takes a beating its safe to say that the marvel cinematic universe going forward will be incredibly different downey and evans are just brilliant when they are on the screen together and their chemistry is incredibly believable     as much as i loved it there were a few things i didnt really like i thought the villain was incredibly underwhelming which is a problem marvel has always had i cared more about the conflict between the team rather than the whole story abou him trying to tear them apart he never came across as overly evil i also thought captain america kissing agent carter really odd i dont understand why that needed to happen first peggy and now her niece it just felt shoehorned im and unnatural as well as unnecessary her whole character was kind of pointless in this movie to be honest       overall though this film is incredibly fun with a lot of great action sequences the writing is pretty solid throughout however with a weak villain the directing is terrific and i can definitely see why the russo brothers are handling infinity war
Apr 7 2016,positive,maybe it is because im a marvel fanboy or maybe because i still drop my jaw at superheromovies probably both this movie was a blast
Apr 7 2016,positive,very good but not as good as the winter soldier
Apr 7 2016,positive,so great i am over spiderman so the end was poop but i loved teamcap
Apr 7 2016,positive,i give it a ten a fuckin ten
Apr 7 2016,positive,this movie was phenomenal and it just blew my expectations everyone was talking how great the airport fight scene but i think the 3rd act battle was far better cap and iron man fight scene was packed full of emotion rage and also sadness into it also a slow cap for chadwick b as black panther and tom h as spiderman it dragged a bit in some parts but rest assured everyone had their great moments  lastly i honestly think the action fight scenes are by far one of the best from among hollywood movies
Apr 7 2016,positive,this may be my intense love of marvel comics talking but i just loved this movieâ  i was entertained a lot of the timeâ  the characters were diverse and great and the large amount of them did not cause the movie to topple and have too much going on because the main focus is on cap bucky and tonyâ  the action sequences were some of the best i have ever seen and were designed well  the villain zemo was great for me because he was successful in tearing the avengers apart and did more harm than a lot of the other villains that ended up becoming underwhelming in other marvel movieshe just shouldnt have been called zemo because he is not at all similar to the character in the comics of the same name  there was a good amount of humor in this movie especially from antmanâ  the interactions of some of the characters also provides some humorâ  the tone was very good for a marvel movie and felt a little darkerâ  however spoiler beginning i just wish someone would have died to make the movie overloke meaningful and make the superhuman civil war be seen as more devastating end of spoilersâ  one thing that i wish would have been changed was that caps motive seemed to be only because of bucky at some point and not because he actually disagreed with the sokovia accords    summary funny and enjoyable with lots of good characters and a good storyâ  the minor mistakes that i found are eventually overlooked by the rest of the films success  verdict 910
Apr 7 2016,positive,probably one of the best movies i have ever seen spoilers ahead this movie had many strengths and very few weaknesses to go ahead and get the weaknesses out of the way it brings us to number 1  weaknesses  1 crossbones was killed off much too early he has an integral part in the civil war story i feel like his development in captain america the winter soldier was very well done so i was rather surprised to see him go so fast   2 baron zemos back story was changed a little bit too much for my liking however they were able to make it work     these are all the weaknesses that i can see lets move on to the strengths    1 the russo brothers did what they always do regarding having a mm impeccable plot     2 both sides of the accords were very understandable    3 chadwicks bosemans black panther was absolutely astonishing i have been waiting for black panther for a long time and he was incredible    4 tom holland is astonishing as spiderman he is officially the best on screen spiderman yet    5 incredible action sequences contains the best action sequences of any marvel movie so far    6 fantastic character development    7 on the good side of baron zemo his motivations for being a villain were outstanding it was nice not having another villain wanting to destroy the world like all the others    8 i love the formation of the secret avengers    9 paul rudd killed it once again as antman    10 fantastic comedy there were parts of this movie that seriously made me laugh out loud not only was the comedy hilarious it was also perfectly well balanced with the serious parts of the film    11 the perfect sequel to captain america the winter soldier while being the perfect sequel to avengers age of ultron    12 the introduction of black panther and spiderman was incredibly smooth    13 we should get to see more of baron zemo     this movie was outstanding in just about every way 5 out of 5 stars for sure if there was an option for a sixth star it would be 6 for sure i was looking forward to this movie for over a year and was not disappointed captain america civil war fantastic job
Apr 7 2016,positive,it was awesome movie and watching captain america fight for his friend and the ending was amazing and would recommend it to watch and being captain america fan and would watch it again and again on dvd and seeing all of marvel super heroes
Apr 7 2016,positive,excellent movie great script and relevant themes fantastic actors amazing action and well placed humor excellent directing 1010 the best comic book movie trilogy of all times
Apr 6 2016,positive,awesome movie a lot of action and story to keep you interested recommended
Apr 6 2016,positive,this movie was the best good action incredible graphics who wouldnt want to see it
Apr 6 2016,positive,civil war is so much more than just another superhero movie what disney has managed to pull off recently is cinematic history the way they and marvel have managed to build this franchise of complex characters that are all fleshed out is truly amazing every single moment in civil war feels calculated and it pays off in spades the film tops the avengers by not only juggling a multitude of characters but making them seamlessly fit into an intelligent plot with a purpose mix in the best action sequences of the genre and brilliant comedic moments and you have the pure essence of what a blockbuster film should be
Apr 6 2016,positive,this movie was a great movie and it had some cool action in it
Apr 6 2016,positive,this movie was a very fun blockbuster it was an event geeks and people of all kinds have been waiting to see and got what they wanted a nice action thriller comedic and unexpected plot line that got the audience on their toes well done
Apr 6 2016,positive,1 it reached the emotional stage where everyone who is watching can shockingly think why such moments should happen  2 spiderman and black cat made their debuts i love how tom holland portrayed spiderman its sorta similar to the way andrew garfield did but at way topper level  3 some scenes were a bit predictable but still amazed me when they hit 1  4 baron zemo  holy cow lol this guy i dont know but his type of villain feels like bane  5 russo brothers captured the interests remained after the winter soldier and mixed them to create better story every piece has its own meaning  overall good movie  910  id strongly recommend this
Apr 6 2016,positive,i may have enjoyed this better than the winter soldier as soon as i watch it another 15 times  i will know for sure
Apr 6 2016,positive,spiderman thank you for being amazing ãããã
Apr 6 2016,positive,best comic book film ever
Apr 6 2016,positive,fun adaptation of the comic one of my favorite entries into the mcu you might be lost if youre not familiar with the previous movies
Apr 6 2016,negative,really disappointed with this movie not really living up to the other avenger movies or captain america movies spiderman was pathetic and aunt may is an old woman not sure if the writers or directors of this movie have even ever read a marvel comic book hope the next guardians of the galaxy is not like this oh well
Apr 5 2016,positive,exactly what i expected
Apr 5 2016,positive,brilliant movie if you love all things marvel and are a big kid best film since avengers assemble everything works in this film go see it
Apr 5 2016,positive,certainly one of the deeper marvel movies still a good fun watch
Apr 5 2016,neutral,finally saw civil war  its a very ok movie but i was left kinda disappointed  its basically batman v superman 20  it has the same problems and flaws as well as character development and unnecessary stuff  i was most disappointed with the ending both films should have switched their endings they would have benefitted a lot from that  the film is very overrated it plays it safe they dont take real risks  and their villains are awfully executed so non memorable especially zemo whos back story wasnt very strongheres a tip you want our character to be understood show dont tell  also that airport scene was really tamed nothing new except another popcorn flick like bvs  but i did have a lot of fun and it had some decent moments  the best part of this movie was spiderman i love what was done with his character and how he was incorporated    i give this one a 62 out of 10    deserves a high rental
Apr 4 2016,positive,action packed and fun
Apr 4 2016,positive,its been said that joss whedon makes movies about the heart and soul of his characters which also happen to be superheroes so little of this move was actually about them being more than human beings quite the opposite its about accountability and how we react when things turn for the worse     we get a vulnerable tony a captain america without a purposeful direction to point and bucky to throw them all into disarray just when you think the climax has happened you get an emotional battle between cap and tony that tears at your heart for them both     this is how a movie is made this is how you create a cyclical universe that stays true to iteself and to its viewers new and old
Apr 4 2016,positive,great fight scene at the end
Apr 3 2016,positive,fantastic the russo bros deliver high intensity action like few can this movie has heart it is about friendship and consequences while the tone is serious  there are a lot of laughs and feel good moments     the introduction of spiderman and black panther was nearly flawless    great addition to the mcu
Apr 3 2016,positive,marvelous film i highly recommend it i dont know which ones better this one or winter soldier
Apr 3 2016,positive,loved every minute of this movie spiderman and ant man were hilarious i cant wait to see it again the whole time someone cursed i kept saying language
Apr 3 2016,positive,best marvel movie of all time and one of the best movies ive ever seen spiderman was depicted perfectly and black panther stole the show the movie is entertaining from beginning to end and make sure to stay for both after credit scenes
Apr 3 2016,positive,this installment of captain america is probably the best you would think that its a little overstuffed like age of ultron but its not black panther steals the show and is a fantastic add to the marvel universe everyone actually get enough screen time but its not stuffed and forced like another hero v hero movie i recently saw spiderman is awesome and easily one of my favorite parts of the movie there isnt much of him but he is shall we say amazing the final act and climax unfold the whole plot and you get a psychological twist reminiscent of the previous captain america installment the movie does not disappoint there is plenty of action and character development without sacrificing one for the other like most of these movies tend to do im talking to you zack snyder and your awful bvs
Apr 3 2016,positive,succeeds where age of ultron fails funny realaction packed and spidermaniron man meeting was brilliantly done looking forward to watching with the boys when it comes out on itunes loses a point for the ending felt a bit
Apr 3 2016,positive,another year another avengers movie this time under the captain america flag this film conflict emerges as the avengers have been forced to gove up their freedom to do as they will and be governed for the security of the planets population but there are some that will comply but others that wont that leads to a full scale assault on each other the film was quite fun but i dont think it was as good as winter soldier or indeed avengers 2 however if you are a fan of the whole avengers thing you will have a great time watching this
Apr 3 2016,positive,this will be the movie of 2016
Apr 3 2016,positive,watched it 3 times alreadybe my favorite marvel movie ever1010
Apr 3 2016,positive,marvel pulled out all the bag of tricks with this one a must see movie that the family will enjoy
Apr 3 2016,positive,marvel continues the trend of upping the stakes by pinning our heroes against each other captain america and iron man there are a lot of other characters but unlike age of ultron this is controlled chaos you understand each of the characters ideologies  why they disagree with each other why theyre on the sides that theyre on why theyre fighting for what theyre fighting for  and theyre each given enough screen time for us to care its political its personal its fantastic
Apr 2 2016,positive,fun movie great action sequences mixed in with humor and funny dialogue  it will be very interesting to see how they follow up the story arc especially in the next avengers movie  it felt like a little too much to throw spiderman and antman into the fold but there were some good lines particularly from tom holland  at times it did feel a little tough to root for captain america which was awkward
Apr 2 2016,negative,boring didnt impress me at all
Apr 2 2016,positive,spiderman was so awesome
Apr 2 2016,positive,a bit overrated but good
Apr 2 2016,positive,you have to see this when it come out wow
Apr 2 2016,positive,better than batman v superman by a long shot
Apr 2 2016,positive,awesome summer film even though it feels like more of a sequel to the avengers
Apr 2 2016,positive,what are the consequences when a group of superheroes battle it out with the bad guys and causing mass destruction the impacts from the first and second avengers after the heroes fought and left the cities in ruin is all explored in captain america civil war basically the emotional theme of loss and destruction and aftermath that the heroes will have to face the solutions to how to solve and contain from any further damage they may cause the film begins with the avengers of captain america chris evans leading a team of falcon anthony mackie scarlett witch elizabeth olson and black widow scarlett johansson are on a mission in lagos trying to stop an arms dealer from releasing a bioweapon the effects of stopping the bad guys which leads to scarlett witch accidently destroying a building and injuring civilianâtms causes the government to take the next step to contain these heroes tony stark robert downey jr still feeling guilty for creating ultron tries to persuade the avengers to join the oversight program which the government oversees and controls the team captain america does not believe that they should be overseen by the government with their own personal agendas meanwhile there was an explosion in vienna over a conference that killed the king of wakanda and some are believed that bucky sebastian stan is behind it while steve races against the government to save bucky and find out who is behind the attack     first off i will say captain america civil war is hands down the best one in the trilogy and up there with the two avengers films joe and anthony russo direction which they can handle the source material well they can have multiple characters in the film and give them enough story and development to make it a better superhero film the action sequences are top notch awesome including the second act airport fight scene with every avengers except for hulk and thor who are absent this time around every character had a moment to shine and the fight scene was entertaining and creative with each individual character there were a lot of fun moments and hilarious oneliners the newcomers like tâtmchallablack panther chadwick boseman and peter parkerspiderman tom holland both stole the show with panthers awesome fighting skills and spidermans nonstop talking their introduction does add the anticipation to see their individual films i will say i am happy with tom hollandâtms portrayal as the webslinging hero sad for the short lived spider man performance from andrew garfield the emotional climatic fight between iron man and bucky and captain america is thrilling at every level captain america civil war is one of the best superhero films in the mcu a great way of ending the trilogy with plenty of characters that was given a fair share of screen time and a moment to shine a deep strong story with themes and consequences and lots of action and visual effects definitely looking forward to the next avengers film
Apr 1 2016,positive,i have been waiting for 2 years to se this movie and i saw the first screening and it was amazing omg best marvel movie ever
Apr 1 2016,positive,great moviewent so fast didnt want it to end not perfectstill great
Apr 1 2016,positive,i loved every second of captain america civil war everything was so well put and the story and plot worked very smoothly this movie is everything batman v superman shouldve been every character fit right and at no point did the movie feel crammed with superheroes in my opinion the two heroes that stole the show was spiderman and black panther they got both of these characters right especially black panther as much as i loved batman v superman i have to give this movie more credit the russo brothers did not disappoint and they delivered another marvel masterpiece just like the winter soldier this movie was very good and i plan on seeing it again when it comes out to all theaters and maybe a couple more times this movie made me very excited to see what comes next in the mcu
Apr 1 2016,positive,out of all the marvel cinematic films this one really gets your blood pumping and has you on the edge of your seat for more its without a doubt the best and most exciting one yet
Apr 1 2016,positive,incredible movie really felt the emotions
Apr 1 2016,positive,best marvel movie up to this point a must see for comic fans
Apr 1 2016,positive,great movie introduced the new characters well and spiderman was right
Apr 1 2016,positive,it was the greatest captain america ever
Apr 1 2016,positive,the movie is going to be epic after the frustration with bvs a long and disconnected movie with nothing of interest going on except an 8 minutes fight civil war will bring together characters that we care about its gonna be awesome and judging by the trailers much better than the dawn of justice because the name bvs is not the focus of the movie age of ultron and captain america 2 were awesome
Apr 1 2016,negative,this movie is crap a fight of 5 vs 5  hahahahaha not even close to the history of comics civil war that brought together more characters than this crap
Apr 1 2016,positive,ive not enjoyed the captain america franchise as much as ive enjoyed say thor or iron manbut this is probably the best entry into his canon despite it feeling more like the avengers 3 than anything else great use of spiderman and introduction of black panther the marvel guys really know what they are doing dont they
Apr 1 2016,positive,spidey is awesome ant man is awesome panther is awesome it does get boring a little bit but the rest is amazing
Apr 1 2016,positive,the best film marvel  marvel the best films
Mar 31 2016,positive,marvel has done it again captain america civil war the 13th film in its everexpanding cinematic universe is also one of its finest     though not as tightly paced as its predecessor captain america the winter soldier or the first avengers civil war sets another benchmark for superhero films    the comic book spectacle tackles the serious themes of collateral damage and government interference while reveling in the fun of seeing earths mightiest heroes go headto head in one of the best superhero sequences on film    in captain america civil war the avengers face scrutiny after their latest mission in lagos takes a horrific turn killing innocent civilians more than 100 nations want the superheroes to sign the sokovia accords named after the devastating battle in last years avengers age of ultron the legislation would create a united nations panel to oversee the avengers    billionaire inventor tony starkiron man robert downey jr supports the accords believing the superhero squad needs to be kept in check but idealistic super soldier steve rogerscaptain america chris evans opposes the idea realizing the panel could cater to its own agendas by controlling the avengers actions    the clash of ideals splits the avengers along two sides on captain americas team are sam wilsonfalcon anthony mackie wanda maximoffscarlet witch elizabeth olsen clint bartonhawkeye jeremy renner scott langantman paul rudd and brainwashed fugitive bucky barnesthe winter soldier sebastian stan    joining iron man are natasha romanoffblack widow scarlett johansson james rhodeswar machine don cheadle vision paul bettany wakandan prince tchallablack panther chadwick boseman and some extra help from the webslinger himself peter parkerspiderman tom holland    civil war works as a sequel to 2014s espionage thriller captain america the winter solider and a followup to the epic avengers age of ultron    returning winter soldier directors anthony and joe russo maintain the atmosphere of political intrigue and capably navigate a story with a lot of moving parts although the pacing is a little slow in the beginning    the blockbuster deftly juggles a whos who of marvel superheroes bringing back popular characters and introducing beloved favorites in a battle drawn along ideological lines the film excels at explaining each sides stance    as the shieldwielding patriot evans perfectly captures rogers struggles as captain america moves past his boy scout persona and goes on the run to protect his best friend bucky downey jr conveys starks guilt as his work with the avengers leaves a significant civilian death toll that weighs on the tortured genius    even the motivations of daniel brühls understated yet methodical villain zemo make sense    the comic book caper features stirring special effects and eyepopping action theres handtohand combat a jawdropping foot and vehicle chase and a fierce final battle thats intensely personal but some of the early fights are hindered by too much shaking of the camera and frenzied quick cuts    the airport showdown is the ultimate comic book battle featuring no fewer than 12 superheroes each gets their time to shine as high as the stakes are the exciting sequence balances the drama with gutbusting humor antman rises to the occasion as the battles mvp    civil war welcomes two new characters to the mcu setting up for future solo films boseman is a standout as the agile vengeanceminded black panther and making his marvel studios debut holland is delightful as the youthful enthusiastic and babbly spiderman    captain america civil war masterfully blends grounded realism with fantasy in a comic book battle royal adding another feather to marvels cap be sure to stick around for the two bonus credit scenes for hints of whats to come in the mcu
Mar 31 2016,positive,not perfect but was really good and would love to see again        characters were great reasons for and against the registration were good but caps reasons were way better as iron man acts like the biggest douchebag ever in marvel fight scenes were good effects were amazing they didnt have to add baron zemo and crossbones had such little screentime and acting was good
Mar 31 2016,positive,wow best marvel movie since the avengers and the russo brothers do it again with capt america  spiderman and black panther are excellent new additions  action packed and team cap all the way iron man is a shill
Mar 31 2016,positive,great movie perfect blend of story action and comedy
Mar 31 2016,positive,one of the best movies in the mcu its emotional personal and fun the introduction of black panther and spiderman was astonishing and were actually part of the story the only negative aspect of the movie would be the villain and to me needed more of a unhappy ending to fully appreciate future marvel movies still this is an amazing movie and should be experienced in the movies
Mar 31 2016,positive,awesome worth seeing again
Mar 31 2016,positive,great  best marvel cinematic universe movie yet
Mar 31 2016,positive,kick ass from beginning to end
Mar 31 2016,positive,in my opinion marvel movies just keep getting better and this is evidence of that the action the characters the special effects and the story all pretty fantastic although i will say this is an avengers movie straight up they just didnt want to call it that for some reason
Mar 30 2016,positive,spiderman black panther and antman were the highlight of the film for me nuff said
Mar 30 2016,positive,villain why was he there whaaah
Mar 30 2016,positive,its going to be amazing
Mar 30 2016,positive,best comic book movie since the dark knight
Mar 30 2016,positive,just saw civil war and with all the high ratings i was really expecting it to be way better      a few thoughts without spoilers     1 captain america is sorta a prick   2 the best and most entertaining part of the movie was when spiderman was in it   3 there were lots of parts that i was bored out of my mind that just felt like filler     775 out of 10     still worth seeing for spiderman and the black panther
Mar 30 2016,positive,i think that the producers should mqke more movies like thisn
Mar 30 2016,positive,marvel has done it again smart actionpacked and very welldirected tom holland is already the best onscreen spiderman we have seen go see this movie
Mar 30 2016,positive,was it as good as the first avengersno but it is a good solid and entertaining movie
Mar 30 2016,positive,made the franchise fresh again
Mar 30 2016,positive,honestly among the best superhero movies to date my only issue was with the them of captain america he is a total contradiction of what he says he stands for he is a tyrant and self righteous and worst of all he thinks hes some sort of messiah but in reality is just as selfish as tony stark  i also dont really like falcon he just seems like some sidekick with a horribly designed suit and shitty powersabilities  spiderman was great as was black panther they were really great as well as hawkeye iron man etc were all great  the story was tense made you wonder exactly what was gonna happen but my only complaint the ending was idiotic and pointless captain america after allowing countless men to die to save his friendwho has also killed countless men over the years and some of them innocent as well as crippling war machine deicides to just freeze  the winter soldier he claimed to be fighting for the freedom of superheros but that was never the case hes fighting for his own selfish wants over the worlds better needs the film ends exactly where it started lives could have been saved had the winter soldier just been caught and ended up right where he ends up anyways   fuck captain america i wish they would kill him off already hes the hitler of the superhero movies   but aside from him the film is definitely worth a watch great all the way around
Mar 29 2016,positive,captain america takes on iron man the team divided this film creates the tension and builds on the excitement from the very first second the russos crafted a film that focuses on the conflict between captain america and iron man as the film continues the tension builds the mysteries unfold the mastermind and history of these character explored like no other films in the mcu this film also introduces new characters black panther and spiderman are the two highlight of the movie tom holland as spiderman is just amazing whilst  black panther just steals the show when ever he shows up the actions are crafted with such precision and its just unbelievably thrilling from start to finish this is a must see film of 2016 and hands down he best marvel film to date and spoilers theres two end credit scenes so stay in those seats
Mar 29 2016,positive,another great movie from the captain america series they never disappoint
Mar 29 2016,positive,good movie with plenty of action and characters that are appealing   the plot was dumb but the rest was good
Mar 29 2016,positive,great movie well worth seeing amazing characters and storyline
Mar 29 2016,positive,all out loved this movie i think the hype lived up to expectations best superhero movie i couldnt decide who side to choose  in the end it leaves you wanting more cant wait to see spiderman
Mar 29 2016,positive,ok the weakest thus far in the capn series story felt forced at times more importantly too many characters forcibly inserted to pull of the premise overall it was ok
Mar 29 2016,positive,wonderfully written great acting performances intros of black panther and spiderman to the mcu
Mar 29 2016,positive,an incredibly fun movie has everything from comedy to action spiderman was fantastic and so was black panther must see
Mar 29 2016,positive,the 3rd best comic movie ever the other two being the dark knight and the dark knight rises this movie has a fantastic plot the action scenes are really good and its entertaining throughout the movie spiderman and black panther were awesome look forward to there solo films in the future  simply the best marvel cinematic universe movie i recommend this movie to anyone
Mar 29 2016,positive,amazing especially the fight scenes seen the movie twice and have nothing bad to say about it marvel does it again
Mar 29 2016,positive,very intense full of action and surprises thought is was fantastic
Mar 29 2016,positive,another awesome marvels movie
Mar 28 2016,positive,so much fun loved it a lot want to see even more spiderman
Mar 28 2016,positive,best marvel movie since the avengers watch this one on the big screen for best results great from start to finish
Mar 28 2016,positive,it was great were their things i wouldve liked more maybe but over all it was fun
Mar 28 2016,positive,do all superheroes have mommy issues   captain america civil war starring chris evans robert downy jr and directed by the russo brothers the latest installment in the marvel cinematic universe tells the story of how the governments of the world want to put handcuffs on the avengers the collateral damage of the worlds greatest heroes has started to pile up and world leaders want to tell the avengers when they should and shouldnt act this idea doesnt sit well with captain america who doesnt want his team beholden to anyone he doesnt want a group of bureaucrats sending him somewhere for their benefit and not to a place they are truly needed tony stark feels the avengers need to be put in check or they are no better than the villains they fight   flashback to the first two iron man films look at how tony stark as a character has changed from those films if that tony stark would have been presented with the sokovia accords he would have laughed at them he wouldnt want any type of government to have any control over him or his suits in fact he worked extremely hard in the first two films to ensure his technology did not end up in the government hands while i still think he would fight to turn his tech over to the government he is still willing to be put in check now because of all the damage he has caused he doesnt trust himself after creating ultron and other events leading up to this movie what is great about civil war is if you didnt know how much tony has changed his point view is still valid those who have watched the previous films can appreciate the characters growth but they arent necessary for enjoying this film   if one movie would be crucial to understanding the motivations of the characters in this film it would be winter soldier that film gives the backstory on the relationship between steve and bucky and how far steve will go to save his friend civil war even with the numerous characters shown on screen is very much a captain america film the movie does a great job of examining both sides of the argument whatever side you fall on you can understand why both sides feel the way they do it isnt clear for the audience which side you should be pulling for that was one of the points of the movie and they pull it off brilliantly the story fits together so well you are taken along for a fun enjoyable ride but with heavy stakes for both sides the story is great and then you throw in the amazing action   there are a few actions sequences in this movie that are simply stunning yes everyone is rightly talking about the funny and exciting airport scene in which spiderman stole the show but there are other action sequences which are also enjoyable the opening action sequence was equal or better than the opening action sequence in winter solider  the chase scene through the streets was intense and was a great introduction to blank panther the end fight between winter solider iron man and captain america was a great climax but i still had a slight issue with tonys motivation for fighting in the end   this was my biggest complaint for the movie i didnt necessarily believe tony would continue the fight within the framework of the movie yes i think he would have been mad and upset but im not sure he would have reacted the way he did based on what we know of the character the fight was still amazing and a great payoff for the film it was also orchestrated by the villain and while i get his motivation in the film this was the weakest part of the story at the end of the movie tony is in a place of acceptance about events leading up to this point and then he reverses course like i said it is a great fight i just wish they would have found another reason for the fight   this is the only negative i can come up with for the movie other than the font used to display each locations of the film it was a little too blaring and in your face but thats small nitpick  up until the end that was the only negative i could see with the film it is so well paced so wellacted with great action and investment in the story that you cant wait to see where it is going i want to see the film again in the theatre just to take it all in one more time this is an event film and should be seen in theatres it is worth seeing multiple times if you have been invested in these characters since the marvel cinematic universe took off
Mar 28 2016,positive,high expectations and they deliver robert downey jr amazing as usual why cant dc do this but edgier would have given it a full blown 5 stars but spiderman was kind of an annoying candy ass
Mar 28 2016,positive,civil war is the most grounded and mature movie of the mcu so far once again the brothers russo delivered an impressive work managing to get a importance to every single character in the movie telling the final journey of steve rogerscaptain america passing to the troublemaker tony starkiron man and ending with a solid and unforgettable introduction of black panther and finally spiderman civil war is a gigantic blockbuster that never felt to big to his size or to small in the same way just with a right balance between characters actions and his clear motivations christopher markus and stephen mcfeely script is so smart that make the movie even more great the headline is that captain america civil war is incredible complex fun emotional and a powerful masterpiece of action and storytelling 55
Mar 28 2016,positive,super awesome movie to see it with  everybody
Mar 28 2016,positive,when of the best super hero films to date but thats my opinion see it yourself
Mar 28 2016,positive,great movie nuff said 
Mar 28 2016,positive,this was not only an amazing movie but an amazing experience not only have anthony and joe russo once again managed to tackle a great storyline in a successful attempt to make steve rogers a memorable character but they also manage to carry numerous characters through a perfectly orchestrated movie that has its comedic moments and its serious moments they manage to keep us integrated in a movie with perfectly choreographed action scenes and great character moments that will stay with us for the rest of our lives they manage to pull great performances out of these veteran actors and actresses once again but also manage to introduce new characters to the board like black panther and spiderman both brilliantly portrayed in the film by chadwick boseman and tom holland respectively they even manage to make the incredible hulk relevant again by reintroducing the newly appointed secretary of state thaddeus ross back into the mix many people have stated their problem with the villain but i actually liked him for what he was and for what his motives were they didnt need to call him zemo though
Mar 28 2016,positive,so hyped for this movie
Mar 28 2016,positive,in a world were more and more freedoms are being taken away captain america and a few others fight to keep people free its a modern day republican vs liberal movie captain america is definitely not a liberal
Mar 28 2016,positive,an amazing movie that brings a fresh perspective to the mcu  introducing new characters that keep the universe going for years to come both the black panther  spiderman had great introductions and when it comes to villains marvel usually doesnt give them a spotlight to shine with the exception of loki but with baron zemo daniel bruhl does get an opportunity to flex his acting skills in one great scene the actual civil war between cap  iron man is emotionally gripping  its results shake up phase 3 going into infinity war props to the russo bros
Mar 27 2016,positive,ironman and captain america showcase everything they have for this movie making it spectacular for the audience except with a cast bigger than the avengers it sometimes loses its focus
Mar 27 2016,positive,ive been waiting patiently its going to be epic
Mar 27 2016,positive,one of marvels best to date have to give it 5 stars what theyre able to do with so many characters in 25 hours is an achievement in its self
Mar 27 2016,positive,fantastic go see it now short and sweet airport scene will have have you crying with joy and a fantastic story just go see it i will again and again and again
Mar 27 2016,positive,okay i dont like it when the good guys fight each other too many lengthily scenes of such make sure you see aunt man prior to seeing this flick
Mar 27 2016,positive,it was everything youd expectnothing was wasted while it was different than the comic the basic premise remained intact it laid perfect groundwork for both black panther  spiderman films the antagonist and protagonists were all utilized to their respective ends masterfully and the outcome was far more plausible than that of another superhero movie that shall go unnamed the film had very few flaws if any at allprobably the best one marvel has dropped thus far the russo brothers did a great job considering the number of characters they had to work with       great movie
Mar 27 2016,positive,a great superhero movie about a serious issue that changes everything
Mar 27 2016,positive,definitely one of the best marvel movies ever i think its even better than the dark knight
Mar 27 2016,positive,the script action humor emotional tension and psychological thrills are few of the many reasons why captain america civil war is marvels best movie to date and one of the comic book genres greatest titles
Mar 27 2016,positive,one of the best avengers
Mar 27 2016,positive,brilliant best marvel film yet spiderman was amazing
Mar 27 2016,positive,this movie gives us the true benefits of a shared cinematic universe lots of characters we love new ones to love and a fitting end to captain americas trilogy of solo films this film does feature a lot of characters but it is very much caps film this ties up the storylines from the previous 2 movies and is only occasionally overshadowed by spiderman and black panther who has the best supporting arc of the entire film   we have a winner folks this is what you hoped for when you watched batman v superman a month and a half agoand so much more
Mar 27 2016,positive,amazing action great job developing characters the best part was it didnt stuffed with all the characters it had in it
Mar 27 2016,positive,one of the best marvel studios film to date  much better than bvs not dull and dark all the time  some of the best action scenes since winter solider    highly recommended it
Mar 27 2016,positive,i intentionally avoided the trailers i wanted to have no clue at all i know that pulling off the comic series would have been next  to impossible in just one movie the plot wasnt out of this world however this movie was sooooooo  awesome
Mar 27 2016,positive,my newest favourite marvel movie amazing characters plot and visuals a must for anyone
Mar 27 2016,positive,this movie was amazing the characters were well thought and offered and exciting new set of movies
Mar 27 2016,positive,this movie blew super man vs batman away
Mar 27 2016,positive,thrilling and moving movie of the year
Mar 26 2016,positive,an incredibly entertaining film that is sure to please veteran fans and newcomers alike
Mar 26 2016,positive,a miraculous movie the exact kind of conflict the mcu needed at this point in time every character was wonderfully developed and written extremely well could i rate with a percentage id give this movie a 99 merely because the ending left me slightly unsatisfied however i understand its intent and respected it immensely
Mar 26 2016,neutral,the film was very anticlimactic for me it kept building and building up to this showdown and then nothing happens and youre left with wondering who was the bad guy in this film  and while we are at it spiderman had to have been the worst cameo of any of the super heroes from the marvel cinematic  universe if you was to remove him from the film it would change nothing about the story and save 10 minutes off of the film it was clear that he was added in post as the only character he interacts with is tony stark outside of the cgi scenes
Mar 26 2016,positive,best marvel movie yet not a wasted second not as depressingly sad as trailers would imply
Mar 26 2016,positive,pretty good not perfect but good
Mar 26 2016,positive,what a great movie everything works
Mar 26 2016,positive,the story is climatic masterpiece if you havent seen this movie i highly suggest it when i first saw the trailers posters and generally the name i expected complete crap that i would expect to be eaten away just like the batman vs superman movie once i went into the theater the only reason i was going to watch was because of black panther and spiderman appearances i was honestly surprised after watching while watching every moment was intense and the climax was crazy
Mar 26 2016,positive,marvel exceeds expectations  masterpiece
Mar 26 2016,negative,i rather watch teletubbies
Mar 26 2016,positive,never a dull moment and some well placed cuckles concidering this pits two super heroes against each other this is far superior to batman versus superman no long winded flash back no annoying origin story and a plausable moral dilema why two friends would fall out with each other do wonder with the budget why no gwen and more missed mark ruffalo the new spiderman is adorable and wait till the end of the credits as a follow on story arch is reveiled
Mar 26 2016,positive,its awesome nothing else
Mar 26 2016,positive,this movie was simply fantastic seeing old and new characters constantly going at each other due to separate beliefs was interesting nonetheless but thankfully they were able to pull it off not as good as winter soldier but very very close to it
Mar 26 2016,positive,i laughed i cried i cheered i stared silently with my eyes wide open and my hand over my mouth this movie my god this movie chris evans was very right it is both very much a cap movie and its a movie about family amazing action deep character moments and emotional scenes that hit me right in the gut more than once i highly recommend it    as a side note some people said zemo was redundant and made no sense that didnt really come through to me maybe he wasnt necessary for this movie but he was hardly an awful villain youll see i see potential
Mar 26 2016,positive,i have to say the captain america movies just keep getting better each one has improved from the previous one this movie did feel like avengers 25 loved all the actorscharacters in this movie the addition of black panther was awesome and very well done even though im a fan of andrew garfields take on spiderman tom holland really does bring the character to life and does a fantastic job i cant wait to see him in his solo adventure next year even though i didnt know the character of zemo always thought he was cool looking back when i was a kid i didnt particularly like his character in this movie it felt like he wasnt needed in this movie his purpose was dumb imo the action scenes were awesome but the end was bothersome to me i felt the end of this movie was disappointing overall the movie was fantastic and i definitely recommend it
Mar 26 2016,positive,wonderful again from marvel teamironman
Mar 26 2016,positive,the only regret was i watched it so late d amazing movie
Mar 26 2016,positive,a really great film with a lot of superheroes great action great story not so great villain but all the aforementioned makes up for it
Mar 26 2016,positive,is the more waited of comics uu
Mar 26 2016,positive,all the fun of the avengers with all the intrigue and amazing story telling of winter soldier
Mar 25 2016,positive,everything i hoped it would be and more
Mar 25 2016,positive,each captain america movie gets better and better
Mar 25 2016,positive,captain america civil war is the best adaptation to the mcu and impressed with the directors anthony and joe russo they have done a masterful job on balancing multiple characters with out giving the character too much basis individualy captain america  civil war does a great job on introducing black panther and spiderman both characters easily stole the show period along with antman all though many would think that this is an avengers 25 to me that was not the case at all the title of the film is exactly what we got a 3rd installment to the captain america films all actors did a wonderful performance having said that this movie made think twice on who side i was on their acting was superb could ask for any better this film was exactly what the  mcu needed a fresh film with familiar faces this is the best marvel film to date i have full confidence in the directors as they take on their next avengers movies
Mar 25 2016,positive,united we stand divided we fall is the best way to describe this movie captain america civil war is filled with a captivating story that has the right backdrop required for a serious movie like civil war but it never forgets its funny side as well which is great also the action scenes will leave you at the edge of your seats as they are also choreographed in such a fantastic way so you can look at the characters and recognize the work that was put in the way each of them fight for example black panther has a different way of fighting an enemy than captain america civil war also did an amazing job at introducing new characters perfectly and the actors that played those characters performed them perfectly as well as just to be clear on that statement chadwick boseman killed it as black panther and tom holland is the best peter parker and spiderman yet last but certainly not least the russo brothers have outdone themselves once again it seems like they are the best directors marvel has as of now overall civil war is the best marvel movie to date period
Mar 25 2016,positive,looks really good
Mar 25 2016,positive,amazing movie with a great story fantastic action sequences and a sympathetic villian
Mar 25 2016,negative,it was a bad idea to have batman and superman fight each other and its an even more stupid idea to have the avengers fight each other
Mar 25 2016,positive,fight sequence discussion smirk moment and repeat add in a bit heart bromance  and some moments that the trailers dont prepare you for and you have one very enjoyable one very re watchable movie    welcome to the mcu black panther and spiderman     yes it has some plot holes and the villain is a bit meh but when its good its great and huge bonus points for peter parkerspiderman
Mar 25 2016,positive,i am quite impressed with civil war because beyond being a simple  movie of superheroes is a drama solido perfect mature and dark who  is the one who has the reason that is the question i asked myself  while watching the movie civil war is a rollercoaster of emotions  because unlike the comic which all the time favors the captain  america in the film both sides are defended with various arguments so  much so that you get to have great sympathy for the team of iron man    the film is a drama pure and solid quite political i dare to say  that it is the movie of the marvel universe more mature and serious  that i have seen in effect follows this humor characteristic but on  this occasion it is not feel forced    the action is spectacular the choreography of each battle is very well  developed and the battle at the airport is epic fun brilliant and  amazing accompanied by a good soundtrack the cgi may be the least  impressive of the film because sometimes the characters are false but  those scenes are minimal thank god     civil war is a masterpiece the best film of the whole universe marvel  and probably the best film of superheroes that i have seen    review en español  estoy bastante impresionado con civil war porque mas allá de ser una  simple película de superheroes es un drama solido perfecto maduro y  oscuro quien es el que tiene la razón esa es la pregunta que me hice  mientras miraba la película civil war es una montaña rusa de  emociones pues a diferencia del cómic que todo el tiempo favorece al  capitán américa en la película ambos bandos se defienden con distintos  argumentos tanto así que llegas a tener gran simpatía por el equipo de  iron man la película es un drama puro y solido bastante político me  atrevo a decir que es la película del universo marvel mas madura y  seria que he visto en efecto sigue ese humor característico pero en  esta ocasión no se siente forzado la acción es espectacular la  coreografía de cada batalla esta muy bien elaborada y la batalla en el  aeropuerto es épica divertida brillante y asombrosa acompañada de un  buen soundtrack el cgi puede que sea lo menos impresionante de la  película pues en ocasiones los personajes se ven falsos pero esas  escenas son mínimas gracias a dios     civil war es una obra maestra la mejor película de todo el universo  marvel y probablemente la mejor película de superheroes que he visto
Mar 25 2016,negative,not as bad as bvs but still its a bad movie
Mar 25 2016,positive,the best superhero movie ever created the jokes hit well the story is intimate and extremely interesting the action is very impressive and the big twist at the end shook the mcu at its core must see movie
Mar 25 2016,positive,probably one of the best marvel movie
Mar 25 2016,positive,this is the best mcu movie to date just everything about it is good the action is so good and the best moment had to be that airport fight spiderman was amazing no pun intended this is the best spiderman in a movie to date i just want more of him ant man was also really good and funny by the end of the movie it just throws everything at you and it does a really good job the ending is super emotional and now i really just want to see more spiderman and what would happen next in the muc and knowing marvel it will be good
Mar 25 2016,positive,this movie was pretty generic and lame
Mar 25 2016,positive,i really want to see it
Mar 25 2016,positive,the best mcu film ever
Mar 25 2016,positive,great action and light humor black panther and spider man are standouts
Mar 25 2016,positive,really enjoyed watching the team implode
Mar 25 2016,positive,marvel keeping  and improving their standard humanizing the characters great battle choreography good comedy timing slight drama easter eggs cameos     the only downside not making the villains shine a bit more they should take darth vader as an example from his first screen presence he was a force to be reckon with and still allow your heroes be the center of the movie    cant wait to see where the next marvel installments take us and if they can own up to this new bar that have been raised
Mar 25 2016,positive,a wild ride previous small conflicts between characters especially captain america and iron man in past movies has finally escalated into a huge brawl that pits them against each other newcomers in the mcu black panther and spiderman was established rapidly and effectively all in all this is the best movie by marvel studios yet im looking forward to their future films
Mar 25 2016,positive,best superhero fight ever
Mar 25 2016,negative,another boring marvel film
Mar 25 2016,positive,thrilling emotional and boatloads of fun civil war is everything you could want in a superhero actionadventure film and then some this is how you deal with a highly complex plot and give equal screentime to a whole team of rich characters as well as satisfyingly concluding a trilogy thats gone completely under the radar in the grand scheme of superhero stories
Mar 24 2016,positive,far from perfect but still entertaining with good action and great comedy chadwick boseman  tom holland were easily my favorite actors in this movie
Mar 24 2016,positive,this movie was awesome
Mar 24 2016,positive,some spoilers captain america civil war is the 13th movie in the marvel cinematic universe and the third captain america movie this movie is amazing they did so much right with this movie the characters are interesting and funny as always and some do have a limited amount of time but are still done justice the conflict between tony and cap was handled well and made you jump from side to side at times as both heroes had compelling reasons for what they were doing and why they believed they were right which was great to see so that it didnt seem one sided the whole time getting into the new characters spiderman was absolutely perfect the most comic accurate spidey to date tom holland is absolutely perfect for the role as not only does he have the acting chops be hes the right age as well finale a teenage peter parker and not a 20 something year old portraying a young person black panther was also amazing as well not only was he a great addition to the mcu but they handled his origin story very well by incorporating it into the overall narrative rather than slowing the movie down to tell a completely different subplot about how he became black panther with the movie barring the title civil war you expect there to be a civil war and the movie delivers on this as this movie has one of if not the greatest comic book action scene you will ever see in any movie ever so much happens and everyone gets their moment to shine and i have to say while spiderman and black panther were great in that scene it is antman who steals the show with his limited amount of screen time its also fantastic how self aware this movie is and doesnt try to play it off as if its some realistic thing marvel is known for having rather forgettable villains other than a few loki ultron hydra but not this time i feel that zemo didnt need to be in the movie but with him being in it i thought they handled his character well and made him a more interesting villain then the usual im evil and want to kill everything while rubbing his evil hands together because why not like a lot of the other marvel villains red skull kronan malekith yellow jacket etc he had a personal reason that you can get behind for his actions so i say that zemo is at the top for the better villains in the mcu and theres one thing that they do with his villain and its that even when zemo looses he still wins which i thought was awesome since we havent seen anything like that before hope to see him suited up in future movies the movie isnt without its problems of course cross bones was one on the many reasons i looked forward to this movie and unfortunately while he was great in the time he had in the movie it just another case like with barron von strucker in age of ultron where he gets a limited screen time then is killed off these are some of the best villains of caps rouges gallery and they are just killing them left and right without giving them proper amount of screen time overall though this movie is definitely a step up from the amazing winter soldier and is a worthy sequel and follow up to the other mcu movie although i have to say that the winter soldier is still my favorite mcu movie to date but this is a close second 55
Mar 24 2016,positive,i cant wait to watch this i am totally teamcap
Mar 24 2016,positive,best superhero experience ever has so many types of genre in one action packed movie that it somehow works i love how the superheros carries the weight of the public devastating events in such a realistic way that towards the end of the movie no matter how entertaining it was i realise its not alright for superheros to fight against each other the climatic ending tells us that superheros are no different from non superheros and you dont forget why the conflict between them is very special it shows how humane these superheros are with in the pointed arguments emotional conflicts and the support and love in friendship the best thing about civil war is how it managed to give each character a moment to shine and still relates to the overall storyline its such a clever mature movie and still manages to be marvelous
Mar 24 2016,positive,one of the best if not the best comic book movies ever made nuff said
Mar 24 2016,positive,easily the singlegreatest comic book film of all time thus far
Mar 24 2016,positive,one of the best marvel movies yet
Mar 24 2016,positive,felt more like avengers 3 than cap 3 but that doesnt take anything away from the movie great from beginning to end
Mar 24 2016,positive,a culmination of what have been and what will come civil war managed to combine several characters arcs and storylines while including new heroes and elements to create a suberb film that really manage to hit the high notes
Mar 24 2016,positive,it gives every character their moment to shine and manages to handle multiple character arcs while remaining and feeling like a captain america focused film and sequel great introductions to both black panther and spiderman as well as a great villain in helmut zemo who has purpose and his story makes sense one of the better marvel villains it also contains possibly the greatest action scene in any film in my opinion
Mar 24 2016,positive,captain america civil war is the best marvel movie to date with an incredible story action emotions fantastic performance and great direction robert downey jr and chris evans show one more time that they were born to play captain america and iron man but who really stole the show was black panther and spiderman marvel chose the perfect actor to portray the great king of wakanda but who really was the cherry on the cake was what tom holland this guy is the perfect peter parker and spiderman with his great humor which all fans were waiting anyway this film is a masterpiece thanks to the russo brothers now we can say that avengers infinity war part 1 and 2 is in good hands
Mar 24 2016,positive,dc move out the way  marvel is coming for that number 1 spot 
Mar 24 2016,positive,marvel has done it again just wow
Mar 24 2016,positive,greatest superhero film ever made
Mar 24 2016,positive,okay so i usually wait a few days after seeing a movie to officially review it but i dont need to captain america civil war is without a doubt in my top three comic book based movies of all time the dark knight captain america winter soldier captain america civil warin no particular order it took all the characters we have grown to love over these past 8 years and pitted them against each other i loved and disliked every character at one point in the movie except spiderman but more on that in a bit lol     chadwick boseman couldnt be better suited to play the wakandian king tchalla aka black panther he was dark and gritty with just the right amount of heroism     tom holland as spiderman was absolutely perfect in every way he was quick and witty but knew he had to take care of business the jokes he made while in high pressure situations were exactly as stan lee envisioned them so long ago    since iron man came out in 2008 they have tweaked each movie just a little bit till they found the perfect formula and im here to say they found it civil war is an intense heart pounding edge of your seat thrill ride that you wont soon forget     this is the easiest grade ive ever given a comic based movie9510 without even batting an eye a definite must see
Mar 24 2016,positive,everything bvs wasnt great characters great action and a story you can understand 1 or 2 plot holes here and there but you can forgive that when everything else is entertaining you best marvel film to date
Mar 24 2016,positive,best marvel film by far marvel stays winning teamcap
Mar 24 2016,positive,so excited for this go cap
Mar 24 2016,positive,this changes the mcu forever in epic ways
Mar 23 2016,positive,the greatest marvel movie to date
Mar 23 2016,positive,action packed a great movie
Mar 23 2016,positive,probably the best marvel film thus far this was more avengers 3 than a captain america sequel delivered on its introduction of spiderman and it didnt have the dark morbid feel of batman v superman this was a fun movie
Mar 23 2016,positive,wow just wow this movie blazed past my expectations in terms of story weight and structure it is truly a perfect example of a universe coming together in a perfect way to highlight each characters strengths performances by downey and evans stand out the introduction to spiderman and black panther are great and those casting choices are looking like another home run for marvel with enough humor to sustain you but enough drama to hold you tight civil war is truly marvel at its finest
Mar 23 2016,positive,this movie had everything i wanted and more every character got their moment and it appealed to probably every person who went to actually enjoy the movie rather than criticize it it was emotional and epic and has    to be up there with the best movies ever made
Mar 23 2016,positive,this is yet another outstanding addition to mcu  the new characters are introduce in an organic fashion and flow into the story everyone plays their respective roles to a t great film and plan on seeing again while in theaters
Mar 23 2016,positive,simply cannot fault this movie amazingly well done and a step up from both the avengers and winter soldier
Mar 23 2016,positive,excellent performances thrilling story great action set pieces  a whole lot of heart
Mar 23 2016,positive,civil war is a surprisingly deeply personal story that deals heavily with the consequences of the past but at its core is a tale of friendship and what lines one would cross to preserve it still despite its serious nature the movie manages to inject just the right amount of whedonlike comedy to prevent it from ever becoming too bleak and i found the entirety of it something special to behold    with the addition of spiderman and black panther along with the ever growing avengers roster not to mention some of the biggest battles in the entire mcu thus far civil war now takes my top spot for favorite marvel movies    and so begins the painful wait to see what the russos do with infinity war
Mar 23 2016,positive,literally every single moment of captain american civil war is a blast this installment of the mcu is arguably not just one of the best marvel films but one of the best in the superhero genre the drama has spectacular depth the characters motivations are 100 believable and the actions they take makes perfect logical sense given each of their perspective great writing great acting and great direction
Mar 22 2016,positive,awesome total action  great characters definitely worth watching again i swear iron man had a bigger role than captain in his movie lol
Mar 22 2016,positive,marvel does it again  and finally a true spiderman
Mar 22 2016,positive,the best marvel film so far
Mar 21 2016,positive,gone be movie of the year mark my word
Mar 21 2016,positive,i was pretty worried about this movie but rest assured it was pretty damn awesome captain america civil war is brutal emotionally driven film and is extremely entertaining and fun at the same time although the film doesnt carry the amount of realism from its predecessor all in all this film is your occasional marvel film but 100x better and sets many paths for upcoming marvel films    overall grade a
Mar 21 2016,positive,avengers 25 hardly i did go into the theatre with concerns that the movie was going to collapse under its supersized casting but i neednt have worried captain america civil war is fastpaced and filled to the brim with action in all three of its acts interspersed regularly with startling character development spiderman black panther scarlet witch vision  every moment of respite explores their relationships their vulnerabilities and where each of them stand as not superheroes but individuals while this films themes are nowhere near as intimately deeprooted as the winter soldiers it does round out the captain america trilogy into a series where each instalment is unique and immensely satisfying    now as someone whos on team cap ill try to be unbiased when talking about the story no spoilers here by the way the expected things are all presented  the conflict where no one emerges the winner the blurred lines between saving a friend and doing a greater good the subject of actioninaction vs moralsaccountability and which is worse when innocent lives are lost but these things arent made interesting simply because theyre happening to the avengers its because each of the major players holds a personal stake in which the greater good is affected whether they like it or not we see what drives both sides the same things that would drive us as human beings we witness the unfailing strength of loyalty and friendship and its counterweight the selfdestructive effects of revenge in a tugandpull of chaos throughout the film    as for the action civil war definitely does not disappoint where the first two captain america films lingered on scenes of conversation and reflection this one moves efficiently through the slow scenes and play out fights for long long sequences two hours fly by quickly when the bulk of the film is made up of the three brilliantly choreographed fight sequences at the beginning middle and end unlike age of ultrons bland overblown fight sequences every character is in their element here both stunts and special effects excel in highlighting their unique abilities and traits spiderman and black panther make for particularly likeable new entries making their debuts genuinely worthy of their hype    for a movie with such a serious plot civil war is not all emotional and grimdark there are plenty of laughs to be had at many of the jokes which are much more organic than some of the forced lines in age of ultron theres even a game of thrones reference in there courtesy of paul rudd the pacing is solid and i never felt bored which is an impressive feat for a twohour movie the villains plan unfolds in major strides while he holds a modest presence which makes him only more extraordinary in hindsight the entire plot feels like it bucks the common storytelling trend but its a bold step that i think has proven very rewarding for marvel and audiences alike    the performance of the entire cast is solid allaround and i must mention once again the charismatic tom holland and the thoughtful sympathetic chadwick boseman elizabeth olsen and paul bettany are both hilarious and dynamically fascinating as scarlet witch and vision im shipping them already but the gold goes to chris evans and robert downey jr who are absolutely electrifying in ways ive never seen before there are definitely a lot of emotions lingering in all the unsaid things during their last scene together and the film plays it straight there is no comfortable feeling of resolution only hurt and uncertainty  about oneself and ones estranged friends in equal measure  and they are things that can only be remedied with time or perhaps an infinity war    final score 9210
Mar 21 2016,positive,funny impressive and enjoyable with a superb performance from robert downey jr but also overlong  messy
Mar 21 2016,negative,spiderman look so cgi and out of places and look so fake sony spiderman costume look way better than this one so no not interested and beside i never get into winter solider and didnt find that movie interested too
Mar 21 2016,positive,another epic installment to marvels blockbuster movies that will set the mood and leave our heroes in a destroyed state throughout the rest of phase three not only does marvel know how to grasp our attention with with amazing advertisements but they also successfully hide the true plot of civil war cant wait to see how this movie will kick off marvels phase 3
Mar 21 2016,negative,captain america civil war is not bad but certainly overrated it has several flaws and issues few of them are  1 too much of shaky camera view why many action films want to be another jason bourne movie  2 is zemo the villain a prophet how does he estimate the arrival of ironman and prepare a video for him  3 nonstop changes of establishing shots especially the different country shots are they trying to sell tourism  4 the cause of conflict is ambiguous  5 why does the mastermind zemo has to kill all other winter soldiers instead of making good use of them to fight captain america so whats the point to trap the superheroes in the secret base if ironman never arrived what could he do as a nonsuperhero so he must be a prophet mastermind seriously  6 common sense issue if you want to kill the people at the state of hibernation what you need to do is not to disturb them or kill them any other time so zemo the prophet has been spending so much time and effort to plan just to kill hibernated people and then commit suicide seriously  7 if ironman never arrived how does this zemo fight against captain america whats his plan b clearly he must be a prophet  8 another common sense issue enemy of your enemy can become your friend what you got to do is to use brain so whats the point to kill those hibernated winter soldiers when you are killing the enemy of your enemy you are helping your enemy mastermind huh   8 the quick changes of personality or you can say character development for few characters are not making sense  9 the airport fighting sequel is fun to watch but not epic or even realistic why the main issue of marvel films is they tend to avoid any violent shot which make the superhero fight look like kids fights and unreal in addition when the cause of conflict is ambiguous it is hard to establish epic fight scene why the fight sequel in return of the king and mad max are great established motivation do or die and realism blood were shed any character could be killed    the best marvel movie so far is none other than the guardians of galaxy the best superhero movie to date the dark knight
Mar 20 2016,positive,this movie is probably the best marvel movie
Mar 20 2016,positive,first one is still better
Mar 20 2016,positive,defintly the the best marvel movie ive seen and it is everything a summer blockbuster should be spiderman was best thing in movie
Mar 20 2016,positive,the universe continues to grow develop and become more complicated  best of the marvel universe for me
Mar 20 2016,positive,must see again  again  yes again
Mar 20 2016,positive,i enjoyed every second great action great humor great emotion and every character has a great moment im not the biggest marvel fan in the world but this may change my mind for movies to come
Mar 20 2016,positive,might be the best marvel movie to date dc should watch and take notes on how to introduce new characters
Mar 20 2016,positive,the best marvel film yet
Mar 19 2016,positive,best movie i have seen in a really long time amazing in every way
Mar 19 2016,positive,amazing movie great action scenes and very interesting plot line definitely some curve balls so good i think ill see it again in the theaters
Mar 19 2016,positive,all round fantastic and entertaining film
Mar 19 2016,positive,almost on par with the original avengers in terms of ensemble super hero movies its main flaw is in its writing since it tried to get philosophical but in doing so had to portray normal people as complete morons its hard to be sympathetic towards characters who seem to be set on blaming the wrong person for their issues the new movie is filled with people who want to make the avengers accountable for the collateral damage they cause but it fails to address the obvious point of what would have happened if they had not stepped in in most cases in this movie universe the answer is the complete destruction of the entire planet or at the very least a city or two so while i was watching i kept waiting for someone to point out this obvious fact but no one did maybe thats the movie point that people dont care about logic all they want is someone to blame that rant aside i thought this movie was tits it had great visual effects good acting and wonderful action scenes none of the boring drawn out scenes of smashing robots from age of ultron these scenes were creative well filmed and chaotically enjoyable
Mar 19 2016,positive,excellent installment in the marvel universe addresses the difficult tradeoffs between security and freedom as well as loyalty and justice
Mar 19 2016,positive,amazing movie the characters and everything amazed me most definitely marvels best
Mar 19 2016,positive,awesome show loved when all the avengers were fighting each other cant wait for the next installment
Mar 18 2016,positive,2nd best marvel movie to date after winter soldier my opinion of course i thought black panther was great and that tom holland played a great peter parkerspiderman the rest of the cast was top notch as always so much so that i forgot that spiderman was even in this movie until i saw him and for me that says a lot about the plot
Mar 18 2016,positive,totally awesome moviemust see
Mar 18 2016,positive,a close second to the first avengers
Mar 18 2016,positive,good movie with great action and some emotionally powerful moments  however once the movie ends i felt as if the whole movie accomplished nothing  there havent been lasting stakes in marvel films for a while now and the last scene of this movie proves that trend will continue
Mar 18 2016,positive,marvel doing their thing black panther was legit
Mar 18 2016,positive,i wished it was more closer to the civil war storyline and the ending was not that great
Mar 18 2016,positive,did a better job than both avengers movies 
Mar 17 2016,positive,great story great pacing great action
Mar 17 2016,positive,good movie be sure to stay for the credits
Mar 17 2016,positive,an extremely entertaining movie with the misfortune of being named incorrectly it should more correctly have been titled avengers civil war
Mar 17 2016,positive,best marvel movie to date exhibits the superheroes vulnerability
Mar 17 2016,positive,not sure i can put rate it higher than winter soldier but this film is fantastic everything you could ever want in a superhero movie like the first avengers film  absolutely captures the feeling i used to have as a kid reading marvel comics  the only fault is the now common weak villain we get in almost every marvel movie why they have such iconic characters to choose from
Mar 17 2016,positive,another triumph for the russo brothers with its compelling  emotional story as well as action sequences with substance in them captain america civil war will give you an adrenaline from start to finish similar to its predecessor captain america the winter soldier
Mar 17 2016,negative,a big disappointment cant see them fighting themselves
Mar 16 2016,positive,an emotional thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat for the entire film
Mar 16 2016,positive,fantastic really fleshed out the comic perfectly
Mar 16 2016,positive,initial thought was good and had some funny scenes but they added politics and it ruined it overall  attention marvel next avengers should be the last and go out with a bang  i think we all want to see a huge battle where all the avengers are together and if you want to kill off someone kill all the politicians and hollywood elites  american and the world would pay 40 per ticket for that id pay 1m to see that and i dont have  million
Mar 16 2016,positive,great action very funny new spiderman is awesome
Mar 16 2016,positive,pretty good but definitely overrated 
Mar 15 2016,positive,a spiritual sequil to both the avengers  the winter soldier and a worthy one at that one of the best marvel movies yet
Mar 15 2016,positive,not perfect but damn close action was 55 they found a way to make the comic civil war premise make sense and there was definitely a lot of feeling the penultimate villi an angle was a bit of a let down though black panter and spider kicked all a great movie
Mar 15 2016,positive,its a mavel movie and the avengers storyline  what more needs to be said all the main actors that weve seen before still deliver powerful performances but it was really nice to see some new faces like paul rudd with the antman character  definitely adds some welcome humor to the equation marisa tomei also makes a surprising and pleasant appearance in this sequel i was disappointed that bruce bannerhulk was not in this movie though they did make reference to that character to try to explain why he isnt there and i wasnt too impressed with the tom holland version of peter parkerspiderman character but tobey macguires performances leaves some big shoes to be filled the plot and storyline are very fun though and the tony starksteve rogers faceoff is very enjoyable on the whole i recommend this as a very fun entertaining action movie to watch but definitely not one of the better avengers sequels
Mar 15 2016,positive,best marvel film yet wipes batman vs superman off the map
Mar 15 2016,positive,good noholdsbarred action flick with our old gang plus a few newcomers usual great production values and special effects nothing not to like
Mar 15 2016,positive,the russo brothers have discovered the formula for a perfect superhero film
Mar 15 2016,positive,captain america civil war was a amazing movie that packed in a lot of stuff in 2 and a half hours
Mar 15 2016,positive,this movie is going to be the best superhero movie of the year im a fan of batman and superman but we all know batman is no match for superman unless he wears a crypto nite suit  marvel rules
Mar 14 2016,positive,well done   the big civil war fight scene  although good was ruined for me when i realized they were pulling punches then the wasp actually confirmed that by saying it aloud during the scene  well written  serious when it needed to be  light when it fit but not campy  tony starks sarcasm is now legendary status this is definitely a must see
Mar 14 2016,positive,civil war has great action sequences a good standalone plot great superhero moments and probably the best spiderman interpretation we have seen even though you know the right cause is being fought by captain america it is still difficult to choose a side the best decision that was made was to put antman and spidey on sepparate teams since they both stole the show
Mar 14 2016,positive,the russo brothers hit it out of the park with another fantastic captain america movie
Mar 14 2016,positive,avengers disassembled    captain america civil war is a dream come true for comic book fans it is a payoff for everyone who has seen each mcu film since the first iron man where characters have come together apart and all together again the team of anthony and joe russo has done it again in an absolutely marvelous piece of blockbuster cinema that ranks highly in the superhero genre the only one to top civil war is the first avengers    one element that needs to be praised about the film is its script the movie even distributes its characters so that all of them have their key moments as well as established motivations as for the direction the russos pull it off efforltlessly with set pieces with large scale but an emotional core the great thing about this film is that it is very smart and psychological each team is both good and bad and throughout over a dozen films the audience cares for each and every character all of the performances are at their agame chris evans and robert downey jr continue to solidify themselves as their definitive characters both doing what they have to do because they are both in a sense correct other standouts include hollands spectacular portrayal of spiderman and bosemans absolutely ideal casting as black panther the film survives on its layered and focused characters so that during the airport scene youll be smiling with glee    the film does not have that many flaws if there were one it would have to be the fact that the film rests on the possibility that you have seen the winter soldier and age of ultron the film also throws in ant man hawkeye and spiderman but leaves us wanting more from them but that could also mean people are just spoiled as marvel fans a common criticism about the film is its villain but he is the best one since loki he is more quiet but he doesnt need to conquer or have a superpower he just wants to tear the avengers apart his motivations are great for such a character    overall civil war is another fantastic film in marvels roster it is outright surprising that they have not released a film that is outright bad phase 3 is definitely off to a great start    rating 86 a
Mar 14 2016,positive,captain america civil war is awesome marvel has once again blown us away with civil war the action in this film is great i only have one problem in this movie i wish there wouldve been more scenes with spiderman but he will get his solo movie in 2017 great film and i will be definitely be buying this movie on digital hd
Mar 14 2016,positive,it was better than age of ultron but not as good as winter soldier
Mar 14 2016,positive,its what every marvel fan wants to see 
Mar 13 2016,positive,great movie except captain america is wrong the only person allowed to go around with no government supervision is batman
Mar 13 2016,positive,this will be so freakin dope i cant wait to see this movie the idea of a little in fighting between the earths greatest protectors before they have to patch things up and fight against extinction is so freakin cool   ps very proud to see 3 black superheroes get some spotlight     awesome job marvel keep it coming
Mar 13 2016,positive,a masterpiece that is all
Mar 13 2016,positive,what else can i say if you know the history this story doesnt end on happy note this will be one the best movies and highest grossing movies in marvels movie making history should top winter soldier in ticket sales
Mar 13 2016,positive,this was a really good super hero movie with great action and was even really funny at points however it dragged on a little too long in my opinion
Mar 13 2016,positive,the best part of the latest installments and worthy of carrying the captain america name the spy movie style has and appears to continue working for the first avenger
Mar 13 2016,positive,nearly perfect superhero movie that raises the stakes for all involved  had the best fight scenes in any superhero movie and the acting and new characters are spot on  only flaw is that it drags a little too much near the beginning and the end credits scenes were kind of weak
Mar 13 2016,positive,ok i suppose would watch again on netflix etc
Mar 13 2016,positive,5 stars better then 1 and 2
Mar 12 2016,positive,loved it spiderman and antman were awesome black panther was a great new additionone of the best marvel movies ive seen
Mar 12 2016,positive,too many super heroes but they were all amazing i like how they brought the government in and a couple new supers who were dope ending was great and sets the tone for upcoming movies
Mar 12 2016,positive,one of the best for marvel they have a knack for injecting humor into action sequences like no othereven with a darker story line
Mar 12 2016,positive,great movie overall but i did have some negatives which include the cgi which was very obviously is some scenes and not seamlessly integrated  the airport scene to me was cool but didnt feel like they were fighting each other more like sparing  other than that i think everthing  was done well
Mar 12 2016,positive,this was everything i hoped it would be and more probably the best thing marvel has ever done honestly i had no idea how they could possibly incorporate that many amazing characters into one film and still make it work but rest assured the russo brothers have another winner the acting cinematography editing direction writing and pretty much everything you can think of what incredible and this somehow exceeded the astronomical expectations that i went into it with
Mar 12 2016,positive,the marvel movie ive been always wanting to see the theme of the movie isnt about saving the world its about worlds reaction to the consequences of saving it and the avengers themselves the screenplay is amazing and the villain surprisingly for a marvel film actually feels threatening
Mar 11 2016,positive,ive seen the best  i can die happy
Mar 11 2016,positive,perfect comic book movie go see it now thats all
Mar 11 2016,positive,i think they did the civil war saga to soon it still look good
Mar 11 2016,positive,captain america civil war is the awesome movie ever
Mar 11 2016,positive,this goddamn movie i was kinda thinking that the critics were giving the movie too much credit for nothing but i was so wrong  the movie is everything youd wish from an avenger v avenger movie  the fight scenes are so well choreographed and so friggin creative the storytelling is so intriguing and the new characters are spectacular  speaking of new characters blank panther is epic wasnt a big fan before but now im all about him and his amazing fighting skills bucky v black panther is phenomenal  and spiderman boy oh boy marvel wasnt a tiny bit wrong when they casted tom holland for the role he did the job so damn right to the point that you might forget that there are other badass characters around him his peter parker is everything we deserve his awkwardness trying to be cool but fails and of course his wit all i can say is the theater couldnt stop laughing everytime he opened his mouth  the one thing that was not quite as interesting in the movie was the villain zemo its not that the actor was bad or anything but everytime they changed to him you just cant wait to get into the civil war action again  overall the movie is so good and i advise every comic fan non comic fan to go and enjoy this masterpiece
Mar 11 2016,negative,awful how can you base a entire movie where you have to comic icons fighting each other this movie sucks how can the captain america allow the killer of iron man parents live i was a captain america fan until today
Mar 11 2016,positive,captain america civil war is quite an experience   the avengers fighting against each other   who can say no to that  i only have to problems with the movie   1 the movie is confused about why the heroes are fighting each other   2 they get heros like antman and spiderman   and barely use them but still fun to watch
Mar 10 2016,positive,phase 3 of the mcu has started off with a breathtaking bang no doubt while civil wars lenght is surely patiencetesting and some of its many characters get lost amidst the mayhem its adrenaline inducing action sequences and the emotional punch it packs are as enyojable as they are refreshing the russo brothers also manage to top themselves as directors after the winter soldier and that is saying a lot
Mar 10 2016,positive,tom great job as spiderman
Mar 10 2016,positive,fantastic movie  great performances  grounded reality that really shows the true outcome of the actions these heroes take zemo was very interesting villain and i want to see more of him  all in all  marvels best film to date  and takes the spot right next to the dark knight as best superhero film    also the airport fight scene is the single greatest action sequence in superhero movie history    and spiderman is handled perfectly  55
Mar 10 2016,positive,another entertaining film from the marvel franchisemissing thor and the hulk
Mar 10 2016,positive,best movie spider man is perfect the plot is decentblack panther is also awesome its a must see
Mar 10 2016,positive,in a post 911 world starks position makes a hell of a lot more sense unfortunately the film deviates from its ideological clash into the personal gotta save bucky plotline which weakens its themes doesnt beat winter soldier but is leagues better than avengers 2
Mar 10 2016,positive,marvel have perfected their films this is a film that has everything deep storylines with politics relationships humour and intrigue hard to know where i would place this in a list of best superhero films but it is certainly in the top 5    this is not only a great superhero film but a great film
Mar 10 2016,positive,interesting twist of good vs evil this case good vs good i think you have to either be a die hard avengers fan or have watched every single movie related to get everything that happened still very enjoyable story with mix of plot and explosionsfights very much missed seeing thor and hulk studio couldnt afford them
Mar 10 2016,positive,aswome movie this will be for the marvel fans
Mar 10 2016,positive,civil war is a great action film and an incredible comic book movie some of the best action sequences from any marvel film and having our favorite characters battle it out on screen is very fun one of my biggest gripes with this movie is that it is titled a captain america movie though the entirety of it is being split between cap and iron man im only upset by this because we will more than likely never get another standalone captain america film but besides the lukewarm villain captain america civil war has amazing nonstop action and leaves questions for our heroes in the next avengers film
Mar 10 2016,positive,the plot is a bit contrived  two different events destined to drive a wedge between steve and tony happen to occur at more or less the same time as though to make absolutely sure an easy resolution is out of the question and one of them depends on a piece of evidence that logically should not exist but the theme of accountability to others versus taking responsibily for ones own actions makes it interesting and importantly unique along with the fact that neither faction is 100 right or wrong the chemistry between the characters is great as always and the setpieces are predictably awesome though punches are definitely pulled as though the marvel studios suits are afraid to damage their valuable merchandise daniel bruhl is great weird but fun martin freeman cameo nice to see elizabeth olsen get more to do tom holland is fantastic as the new spidey good to see that dean pelton has moved on to bigger things mit
Mar 10 2016,positive,awesome movie not perfect but still awesome
Mar 10 2016,positive,movie was great good action and mix of just the right amount of comedy it lived up to the hype and wait while laying ground for future mcu movies i may go see it again
Mar 10 2016,positive,well if being from the south of the uniteed states that i am wisconsin i would know since iron man is probably the south the iron man with win just like the south and will rise again the south that is also holden smells
Mar 9 2016,positive,very good movie not perfect but very good
Mar 9 2016,positive,it doesnt reach the heights the winter soldier set but a well balanced cast and phenomenal set pieces means it easily takes its place amongst marvels best efforts
Mar 9 2016,positive,very long  but very good in places not marvels best but not disappointing
Mar 9 2016,positive,representing the culmination of nearly a decade of comic book films captain america civil war exceeds par and delivers a true spectacle the titular character is surrounded by a myriad of superhero legends both as allies and opposers such clout is deftly handled by the razor sharp direction of the russo brothers
Mar 8 2016,positive,solid marvel entry with a good blend of character mystery edge and of course humor  the latter admittedly coming mostly from the bugmen antman and spiderman during the faceoff between heroes with a few other fun moments as well
Mar 7 2016,positive,this is a very good action film not being an avid reader of comic books i can just enjoy the stand alone franchise movies well enough to follow along there are a few odd references that are lost on me but nothing i cant grab on to as it happens the next reboot of spiderman is going to have a lot to live up to from this installment though a far better casting choice this time around i still miss seeing toby mcguire in the role though overall a solid action movie with a strong plot that is just enough to keep up with
Mar 7 2016,positive,the movie sadly derails every time the main villain is on screen everything other than that is pretty much perfect    a
Mar 7 2016,positive,my least favorite one due to them fighting each other but overall still good to watch
Mar 7 2016,positive,i believe russo brothers will do good job  not bad humor movie like age of ultron 
Mar 6 2016,positive,definitely need to know the back story going into the movie but the action scenes as usual were amazingly crafted
Mar 6 2016,positive,hey knuckle heads go to this movie and have your mind blown
Mar 6 2016,positive,cant quite put my finger on it very good movie strong story well done but what i love about having the avengers around is the fun and the humor and thats hard to have when theyre divided diggin black panther and the new spidey though
Mar 5 2016,positive,kept me on the edge of my seat i love these movies hope they keep making them
Mar 5 2016,positive,so fucking good it was non stop awesomeness and i hate marvel
Mar 5 2016,positive,this was a good movie but it made me incredibly sad and there were a few characters i was entirely lost on who they were or where they came from i dont know whether im more mad at netflix for not having the other marvel movies i need to catch up on or at my boyfriend for never having the time to take me to movies even with all the characters i did know it felt like a fabulous orgy of action and personality and i cant fathom how infinity war is going to manage to be anything less than orgasmic but i wanted more happiness in the ending here and i had no idea black panther was already so well established before his solo movie came out i think this movie did everything it was supposed to do though great acting stunning visuals jokes landed action wasnt monotonous understood everyones motivations just maybe a little too sad to be the right choice to watch alone in the middle of the night
Mar 4 2016,positive,omg cant wait for this film 
Mar 4 2016,positive,spectacular action film with the most precise fight schemes ive seen this spring  mostly due to bright open areas of layout which allowed each marvel characters its opportunity to shine within its audiencethe movie sequel left me in a from start to finish    appreciated the same awesome casts of both sides brought back to defend against what they believe to be righteous    on the other hand this movie introduced several talented new cast super heros who were fantastic in their roles      with an extra scheme revealed during credits i agree this is a definite must see film which left me anticipating the next sequel film
Mar 4 2016,neutral,not that great good for a one time watch
Mar 3 2016,positive,just awesome loved every second of it the build up of he tension and everything were perfect
Mar 3 2016,positive,kept on the edge of your seat with suspense throughout also really hilarious which helped shine a light on the sad themes brilliantly executed by downey and evans
Mar 3 2016,positive,one of the best marvel movies so far
Mar 2 2016,positive,good mavel fare black pantergood  spideygreatgiantmangreater pretty much the same story as batman vs superman
Mar 2 2016,positive,captain america civil war is yet another excellent entry in the marvel cinematic universe civil war revolves around a disagreement between cap and iron man which escalates into an allout war between two factions of heroes it really feels like another avengers film since nearly every one is here and accounted for there is a plethora of super heroes so many in fact i thought it was overdone at times it seemed as if they were just shoehorned in but i know theyre probably setting up some future standalone movies by doing this the animosity and tension between cap and iron man is evident and glaring i thought they did a nice job of capturing that dynamic the final battle between the two is very satisfying along with the rest of the fight sequences the plot is out of the ordinary and brings some new elements to the table that werent possible before but the wellworn formulas still lurk it also runs a bit too long the action is excellent the performances are solid and there are lots of great superheroes for fans the conclusion proves very satisfying for both fans and casual moviegoers alike and its a movie that belongs in your collection when it releases on bluray
Mar 1 2016,positive,one of my all time favorite superhero film of this year
Mar 1 2016,positive,amazing movie good plot good character development so many comic book action scenes
Mar 1 2016,positive,love it black panther and spiderman rocked cant wait for their films
Mar 1 2016,positive,seen the pre release of this movie if you have a chance go this is more than just a superhero movie this is a movie that will appeal to all emotions on all levels may be one of the years best films in general and should get academy award recognition anthony and joe russo have figured it out and this shows they arent slowing down
Mar 1 2016,positive,exceptional  story and action both done well
Mar 1 2016,positive,better than bvs a lot of jokes for a civil war theme
Feb 29 2016,positive,not as good as the winter soldier but the russo brothers still continue to make a captain america movie that is very thrilling and engaging altogether
Feb 29 2016,positive,excelent movie its a success in every i love it
Feb 29 2016,positive,great action and compelling story
Feb 29 2016,neutral,the action was pretty rad and characters are precise my problem with these movies is their dry storytelling you start to ask the screen wheres the action then when an action scene stops you feel lost and like youre watching the wrong movie
Feb 29 2016,positive,spidey antman and black panther were the best part of this movie my biggest gripe with this movie is that once again the lack of testicular fortitude on disneymarvel to follow the source material and basically waste an opportunity with the crossbones character his moment was so brief and meaningless that it left me asking myself why even use him in this movie they couldve used any goon for his smalllimited role and it would still be the same by the end of the movie i felt the same way i felt when i saw iron man 3disappointed
Feb 28 2016,positive,best super heroe movie to date pure epicness
Feb 28 2016,positive,ive gotta say this is the movie of the century the best one yet i really love this civil war movies the fightaction is amazing the storyline actually fit and makes sense so i like it salute to marvel entertainment who have create this marvelous movie
Feb 27 2016,positive,dc please take note this is how you make us invested in a movie where heros fight each other you have to plot it out give us background on these heros so when they do fight we care about them each person in this movie i knew why they picked the sides they did and it wasnt just a cheap trick this movie it all the notes i wanted and more i just want to say thank you marvel studios for putting in the time to develop the characters
Feb 27 2016,positive,thank you joe and anthony russo for bringing us not only one of the best marvel films but one of the greatest movies ever made the way the russo brothers managed to handle so many beloved characters without fking them all up like the amazing spider man 2 did is almost magical the thought and care that went into this movie shows through the witty funny and heartbreaking dialogue as well with the excellent directing by the russos is shown once again as they demonstrate just how good a super hero movie can be highly recommend to anyone
Feb 27 2016,positive,disney knocked it out of the park with this one seriously absolutely incredible
Feb 27 2016,positive,is the avengers if you seen the other ones you will love this one
Feb 27 2016,positive,if you know me then you know i love the fantasy genre particularly comics ive always preferred marvel v dc and this film encapsulated so much of why i love marvel comics its not just the action scenes the actors although chris evans is superb but comic stories ability to handle complex issues while entertaining audiences everyone please go see this film bring you mom like i did i just hope you dont walk away just discussing the fight scenes or how badass the black panther looked and fought discuss the plot and the issues it tackled
Feb 27 2016,positive,very well done  pulls the viewer in and allows suspension of disbelief
Feb 26 2016,positive,another winner from marvel hats off for managing to put everything they did into that 2 and half hours i love this film
Feb 26 2016,positive,great movie  best marvel movie yet
Feb 26 2016,positive,damn near perfect i just dont like the new spiderman big big big fan of where theyre taking black panther and cap
Feb 26 2016,positive,absolutely incredible perfectly balanced movie
Feb 25 2016,positive,this is for sure the best superhero movie since the dark knight just everything about its polished voilent awesome exciting dramatic the russo brothers they make such an exccellent personal history and you really fell for the character and zemo is just good
Feb 25 2016,negative,boooooooringggggg horrible plot its only saving grace is the addition of a new super hero chadwick boseman as the black panther
Feb 25 2016,positive,very good movie lots of action great characters and a solid story
Feb 24 2016,positive,as good as the first avengers movie loved it 
Feb 24 2016,positive,a wonderful compilation of superheroes with a good reason to fight fun and thoughtful
Feb 23 2016,positive,action packed every mcu hero in their full glory good battle scenes leaves you satisfied like it was an avengers movie instead team cap all the way
Feb 23 2016,positive,note i will try to keep any comparisonsreferences to batman v superman to a minimum in this review i apologize in advance if i fail in that task   also very mild spoilers ahead   as many others have said the action in this movie is spectacular although similarly to 2014s captain america the winter soldier it was plagued with some of the same shakycam issues it should also be noticed that without the winter soldier stuff  it would be less of a cap film and more like a regular avengers film as well the thing that i really liked about it was that it felt the truest to the genre more than any other superhero movie has by far the source material and the movies main themes not only serve but also improve each other beautifully praise goes to the creative team at marvel and directors joe and anthony russo for handling the entire production in a deliberate yet still delicate way though sadly by the end of the movies second act the main concerns with justice and security vs privacyfreedom becomes superfluous and recedes into the background for the script my enthusiasm for the raimi spiderman as portrayed by tobey maguire cannot be denied so i will not say whether tom hollands new take on peter parker is superior instead i will say that he was hilarious and unlike andrew garfieldsamazing spiderman i actually want to see this iteration of the character in another flick paul rudd as antman also gets redeemed in this film after starring in his own lackluster movie the handsdown best character introduced into the fight in the film though is the black panther he was always a cool character from the comics and here chadwick boseman does a terrific job of bringing the character to life honestly robert downey jr and chris evans are as good as they ever were in their roles as tony stark and captain america respectively the vision paul bettany and wandathe scarlet witch elizabeth olsen are also given some stuff to do as far as character progression is concerned the only snags that the movie hits unfortunately are problems in advancement of the plot first of all mirroring a part of a film by the distinguished competition tony stark is too easily duped by the deaths of others to fall into the line of thinking for the flicks villain to triumph over the good guys i will give credit to the writers because they at least tried to overcome the past wishywashiness of the characters shifting actions and motivations and explain them away even if it was not very cohesive or simple to follow the gymnastics of starks prioritywaffling secondly when one views the villains plan closely it seems fairly rudimentary and does not totally add up the evil maniac may be thoroughly driven to achieve his goal but it seems like it was merely a portion of a larger undeveloped endgame still character actor daniel bruhl is excellent and committed in portraying one of the mostintelligent and best marvel baddies to make it to the mcu  in fact he may be even better than loki additionally jeremy renner as hawkeye played an almostinconsequential role and could have easily been excised from the film overall it is definitely the best marvel teamup film so far and it might even be the best marvel movie since the first iron man installment depending on how parts of the main plot may or may not have bothered you
Feb 23 2016,positive,captain america civil war combines thoughtprovoking themes with an intense setup which is impressive in the midst of its thrilling action sequences occasional humour and surprising depth
Feb 23 2016,positive,just saw it for martin freeman as everett k ross which i hope to see in future marvel filmshope is a word i dont use much but i hope he does stays and do more films with them the other reason was daniel césar martín brühl gonzález as zemo brillante el condenado the rest of the cast i already has seen them in every marvel movieno comments for them just for the new ones in this saga enjoy and watch if you are a fan of marvel im more dc sorry or watch it coz you are a martin fan or coz you love 7th art or superheroesdont if you dont apply for any of the ones before or coz superheroes already suck to you so many movies non stop right bye  may 13 2016
Feb 22 2016,positive,slow 1st 30 and the next 2 hours goes by too quickly great story good chuckles best of the avenger movies
Feb 22 2016,positive,from start to finish civil war is an exciting and action packed film and in my opinion i would say that it stands out as the best marvel movie to date
Feb 22 2016,positive,love every moments of the film especially spiderman  black panther
Feb 22 2016,positive,the only reason im writing a review is because of all the trolls im seeing on here saying batman vs superman was a better movie and because of all the comic book fanboys that said its nothing like the civil war comic im sorry but if you want 60 marvel characters in the same movie then maybe you should just make your own movie im sure it would be a box office hit the russo brothers are one of the most talented story tellers that the film industry has to offer
Feb 21 2016,positive,one of the best movies ive seen in a long time story action drama it has it all
Feb 21 2016,positive,great build up and great action
Feb 21 2016,positive,loved it  this is what a civil war is deep friendships torn apart at the core
Feb 21 2016,positive,good and entertaining but quite flawed the performances across the board are astonishing the new coming heroes black panther and spiderman are adapted properly from the source material and there are some genuinely powerful moments between characters but an unneeded cheesy subplot and certain unnecessary characters water down this civil war into a simple civil dispute with little to no consequences making this less powerful than it could have been
Feb 21 2016,positive,can wait for the next one this one was grade
Feb 21 2016,positive,this movie got pretty much everything right
Feb 21 2016,positive,again no need for comments
Feb 20 2016,positive,one of the best movies in 2016 fax
Feb 20 2016,positive,im absolutely amazed what i saw in captain america civil war this was one of the best comic book movies ive seen in a while
Feb 20 2016,negative,tried way to hard but just failed
Feb 20 2016,positive,one of marvels best
Feb 20 2016,positive,filled with outstanding action sequences and a more mature plot than most of the other mcu movies civil war is a thoughtprovoking superhero flick that might be the best marvel movie ive seen yet
Feb 19 2016,positive,to call this movie perfect would be an understatement  one of the greatest superhero movies ever made
Feb 19 2016,positive,one of the best marvel films of our time
Feb 19 2016,positive,loved it i also just love the civil war storyline from 2006
Feb 19 2016,positive,with flying colors
Feb 19 2016,positive,best marvel movie or of every movie i every seen
Feb 19 2016,positive,fun action packed film with the avengers team divided in two factions resulting in exciting fights way better than age of ultron i highly recommend it to marvel fans although fans of action films will definitely love it as well
Feb 18 2016,positive,another fantastic marvel movie
Feb 18 2016,negative,terrible dc is better
Feb 18 2016,negative,too much comedy and some pointless characters feels like disney buys reviews but still a good action movie
Feb 18 2016,positive,best superhero movie to date
Feb 18 2016,negative,in regards to captain america civil war    honestly this movie wasnt as good as people claim it to be it was extremely overhyped had many plot holesespecially involving bucky had some characters acting out of character dealt with a small little over escalated problem instead of how civil war should have been and just ended up ending in a train wreck fight scenes had no tension and jokes were cracked too often should take a note from dc and try to be a little bit darker  spiderman was amazing as usual but it doesnt excuse the screw ups and every spiderman scene seemed too rushed as if they put it in last minutehint hint thats what they did   the winter soldier was a way better movie    cant wait to see xmen apocalypse and suicide squad blow this movie out of the water
Feb 17 2016,positive,great film go see it
Feb 17 2016,positive,epic that is all i have to say  5 stars
Feb 17 2016,positive,an action packed final chapter of the avengers phase 2 films some fantastic scenes and witty banter new characters were introduced and reintroduced well without boring the audience my only gripe is that it was perhaps a little overly packed and overly long
Feb 17 2016,positive,my favorite marvel movie so far that tops even the first avengers perfect combo of comedy and action and just a great movie beginning to end cant wait to watch it again
Feb 17 2016,positive,i love the mcu so i will approach this in two ways looking at it critically and as a fan hopefully the bias wont seep through    civil war pretty much takes off where age of ultron since antman the movie wasnt central to the general plot of the mcu rather an origin story it grounds all of the capes and spandex to turn into something far more real much like captain america the winter soldier except all the characters get the treatment however it does this without becoming gloomy and depressing much like batman vs superman also to note is that this movie has some of the best jokes of any marvel film thanks spidey and paul rudds antman and now marvel has its second good villain excluding fake mandarin by ben kingsley that was awesome zemo he was subtle enough to be a driven and strong character but operate in the background of the movies title events spider man and black panther were both excellent additions and stole most of their scenes the action was one of the things i was most taken by in winter soldier so i was keen to see the russos very well choreographed yet still very intense civil war delivered despite having more characters with very extravagant powers lastly the plot was complex and managed to develop each characters motive so they didnt just seem like foot soldiers to add to the spectacle by the time the final twist dropped captain america and iron mans struggle that had been building since the avengers to be honest came into one payoff which leaves the audience with a cliffhanger demonstrating the effects of the movie
Feb 17 2016,positive,absolutely spectacular  amazing  wonderful  well done  perfect  unlike the last avengers this one had so many stars and did not confuse or bore at all even with the introduction of the new spiderman character it did not disappoint or take away from the movie this is by far and away the leading candidate for movie of the year so far lets see if it hangs on    and for those looking for those teasers at the end yes there are two one in the middle of the credits one at the end of the credits
Feb 17 2016,positive,the darker themes presented in this film add fear uncertainty and more relatable issues to the film making captain america civil war not just an amazing superhero movie but an amazing movie in general
Feb 16 2016,positive,great movie i love the action and everything
Feb 16 2016,positive,probably my favorite marvel movie brilliantly written thoughtprovoking and filled with action a blockbuster for sure
Feb 16 2016,positive,a good movie but a subpar marvel movie
Feb 16 2016,positive,best one so far iron man starting to be a d tho
Feb 16 2016,positive,this is a must see for comic book fans and it test the bonds of friendship
Feb 16 2016,positive,spider man will be great addition
Feb 16 2016,positive,the greatest superhero film of all time
Feb 16 2016,positive,one of the best of the year
Feb 16 2016,positive,thy could have done better
Feb 15 2016,positive,this movie was so exiting it got my attention the entire movie the visuals and the special effects were phenomenal they looked so real and they really made this film great loved the character development i thought almost every character was introduced perfectly and unlike batman v superman the fighting between superheroes and the buildup of it actually made perfect sense and it was really cool to watch go see this movie right now
Feb 15 2016,positive,best marvel movie to date everyone is going on about the airport scene but the tunnel chase is what dreams are made of someone call zack snyder and tell him this is what a superhero v superhero movie is supposed to look and feel like
Feb 14 2016,positive,ducking awesome my favorite of the mcu so far
Feb 14 2016,positive,spider man and black panther make this movie 4 stars better than avengers 2 not as good as avengers 1 but is the best of the solo films as this is a captain america film go see it  my only critique is the length of the film it moves a little slowly
Feb 14 2016,positive,ive enjoyed most of the marvel movies quite a bit but was semidisappointed with the second avengers filmso i was worried about this movie a little  i also thought that adding so many characters into one film would be too much but it works well here  ive never been a huge fan of captain america so i was definitely rooting for team iron man even though i knew cap would be right  spiderman was perfect in this and they didnt over explain him and him and antman added a lot to this film overall not one of my favorite superhero films but definitely one of the better than average films that i really enjoyed
Feb 14 2016,positive,1010 best mcu movie out to date
Feb 14 2016,positive,its rare i give a 5 star but wow fighting sequences action sequences dialogue storyline and most of all the ideas presented and challenged
Feb 14 2016,positive,not the best story too much of a feeder for spiderman and black panther they were the best parts but they shouldnt have been as iron man captain america and black widow have enough of a story but its not allowed to run
Feb 14 2016,positive,nonspoiler review of captain america civil war 2nd march 2016    captain america civil war is the film die hard marvel fan needs and the one they deserve     not only did the russo brothers directors of captain america the winter soldier bring us another action packed emotional thriller but they have redefined the mcu and perfectly introduced the next phase 3 into the universe     introducing new characters like black panther antman to the avengers and most importantly spiderman has supported this movie even further in the wake of phase 3 spiderman is undoubtedly the greatest adaptation of the character in a liveaction movie weve seen on screen and weve only seen 30 minutes of him peter parker spiderman there are elements of garfield and mcguires portrayal of the famous webslinger but there are new elements which are fined down to a point which are much truer to see in that the mind of a 15 year old teenage boy from queens tom hollands interaction with downey again is perfected by the russo brothers and such fine casting of yet another british spiderman    black panther my god they nailed black panther chadwick bosman has given us a fine performance and a great sneak peak into his solo film coming 2017 black panther his dark but yet hero driven goals are riveting to watch and relatable for many of us who will understand his character further once they have seen the film on its release in the states     the whole plot of cacw is perfectly tuned to possess sense enough action humour and connection of characters as we have seen tony stark and steve rogers have it out for the last 6 years or so theyve finally punched it out tony put on his suit and he isnt afraid of cap however he is now at a cross roads he is a new man he caused the deaths in sokovia with the creation of ultron he blames himself and he goes through this film at conflict with morality and sentiment he wants to redeem himself in the eyes of the law and public but steve wants the avengers to stay the avengers making their own decisions     cap has stayed strong to his morals throughout the course of the mcu and this is what you see here in civil war his ideologies dont change ill let you see in the film if anything happens to suggest conflict for those ideologies his character is cleverly crafted and the russo brothers have used each characters direct conflict to their advantage in this phenomenal movie     elizabeth olsen and paul bettanys characters have greatly developed and it was interesting to see how they grew and adapted to the avenging lifestyle antman having less screen time than spiderman is only there for a short time but its great to see a fan in the mist of all these heroes but only his reaction but the avengers reaction to him too     now the airport scene i think we as fans or movie goers can all agree this scene has probably got to be the best action sequence of possibly all time everything is happening all at once in different parts of the screen not one shot holds to long on one fight between a set of different characters humour is perfectly added in i was sceptical after watching a tv spot containing hawkeye and black widow that the humour in this was cliché cheesy and unnecessary for the moment of the scene but i was wrong it all works perfectly     coming out of the movie theatre i am ready for spiderman homecoming 2017 and black panther 2017 spiderman im pretty sure will be the highlight of the movie for people everywhere and yes there are after credits scenes one after the actors and directors then one at the very end which by the way are both very pleasing for the films i am excited for
Feb 13 2016,positive,everything i expected and more
Feb 13 2016,positive,jampacked with connective references big and small to almost every other marvel studios movie to date captain america civil war is a nearperfect balance of humor character moments and depth while it still suffers from the mcus continual lack of compelling villains civil war more than makes up for it by delivering so many fistpumping set pieces also the russos and their screenwriters manage to perfectly nail spiderman in a few scenes something other directors and writers havent been able to do in five other fulllength movies
Feb 13 2016,positive,i think it will be good either way but they should have it good on both sides keep the fans eyes on the screen and yes its captains movie but it still should have a lot if iron man and yes some should die make it a good film dont waste time you have about 2 hours it could have been two movies this is a good comic make it a good movie
Feb 13 2016,positive,captain america civil war starts off phase 3 with a bang and great teases to look forward in future films    all of the cast were fantastic especially tom holland who steals the show and is the best spiderman since toby maguire he had the humour personality and is the right age for his character the same goes for chadwick bosemans character black panther who was greatly developed his costume was fantastic stunning and excellently detailed i really look forward to seeing him more reprise this role in the standalone black panther film chris evans once again shows how good he is in his role as captain america likewise for robert downey jr as iron man although he mumbled a bit in the first stages but for the rest he was great however for daniel bruhls character baron zemo he was good but personally i felt that more could have been done with his backstory and reasoning in why hes doing what hes planning    the camerawork from the filmmakers was shakily and offputting with the first action sequence but for the rest it was greatly shot the action sequences were fantastic and excellently choreographed as for the visuals they were great and nicely polished    henry jackmans score is much better as it felt more like his style than his score for the winter soldier which sounded more like it was composed by hans zimmer the showdown between cap iron and bucky towards the end of the movie would be a good example to show that this is henry jackmans style of music which is great    the story itself was nicely developed and properly explains the reasons of why both sides in this conflict fought against each other compare that to batman v superman dawn of justice which pretty much didnt offer any explanation as to why these icon heroes fought each other    to sum it all up apart from some of the camerawork and daniel bruhls character development captain america civil war is the best marvel movie since the first avengers film its utterly enjoyable with great characters spiderman being the best and all round a fantastic blockbuster action film that will blow you mind away    dont wait for the bluray
Feb 13 2016,positive,ive been a fan of the marvel cinematic universe since the avengers came out in 2012 ive grown attached to most of the characters engrossed in their stories and ive become excited for every new mcu movie that has come out over the past few years ive decided that civil war ranks as one of the best in the series so far gaining the same prestige that the original avengers and the winter soldier earned anthony and joe russo take the reins once again behind the third movie in the captain america series the movie as the title suggests pits captain america against iron man in a political and personal standoff and it is fantastic it serves many purposes a sequel to the winter soldier a sequel to age of ultron a character builder for the avengers an introduction for newcomers black panther and spiderman an action movie a drama and many other things the ensemble cast is as excellent as always robert downey jr reveals more layers to tony starks personality as he confronts chris evans captain america this time in a less friendly manner spiderman makes his debut in the marvel universe for the first time and his portrayal by tom holland is the most accurate funny and smileinducing version of the webslinger that audiences have encountered i was happy to see other additions to the spectacular cast like chadwick boseman as the wakandan black panther and daniel bruhl as the sinister helmut zemo every member of the cast contributed to the story in some way and the inner conflicts between the members of the avengers kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time the action of course is welldone as usual handtohand combat sequences were appropriately accompanied by a jarring shaky camera and the superhero throwdowns particularly the soontobefamous fight at the airport were jawdropping perhaps my only complaint about civil war was that its plot did seem a little unfocused at times and i wondered if marvel was trying to fit in too much in one movie but by the end i realized how things tied together and that it was still overall welldone its hard to talk about captain america civil war much more without giving away any spoilers so ill say this as a marvel fanboy ill definitely watch this movie over and over again once its released on dvd its a tremendous opening for phase 3 of the marvel cinematic universe and i cant wait to see what marvel has in store next
Feb 12 2016,positive,i had high expectations for this movie and it looks like i was right captain america civil war is like an avengers 3 really but it kept it close to the events that happened in winter soldier the reason why this one is so good is because every marvel movie now is realistic in a way the scenes and the events made it look so real that its scaryin a good way now my favorite parts in superhero movies is the fighting scenes the fighting scene were good but just went by too quick the last thing im going to say is that spiderman in this movie was mildly cringy to watch like what happened to andrew garfield the scene were he fights captain america and cap says he is not bad and tells him were hes from but other than that its a good movie
Feb 12 2016,positive,action packed and a thrilling start to phase 3
Feb 12 2016,positive,take that dc learn how to make a versus movie
Feb 12 2016,positive,this was an okay movie though love antmans part
Feb 12 2016,positive,the early fight scene was choppy and hard to watch the story was great
Feb 12 2016,positive,the action was on point 100 the dialogue was a little boring but overall great film
Feb 12 2016,negative,this is for you disney and marvel for bashing bvs  this movie is completely overrated too long to kid friendly no character development and is a giant mess    how you like dem apples
Feb 12 2016,positive,marvel beats dc period
Feb 12 2016,positive,having seen it twice now with a third viewing coming this weekend i think its safe to say this is right there with or ever so slightly behind the avengers as my favorite film in the marvel cinematic universe
Feb 12 2016,positive,excellent one of the best if not the best films ive seen from the avengers canon and ive seen all but ant man and the older hulk films story line is engaging character interaction is great and fight scenes were superb thoroughly recommended
Feb 12 2016,positive,unconventional and personal captain america civil war explores emotional grounds while retaining a fun actionpacked extravaganza of a superhero film this is one of the greatest of the marvel franchises and will most likely always be
Feb 12 2016,positive,right into the action the first 20 minutes was so exciting and awesome which made up for the lack of great action in age of ultron this movie is a pure masterpiece in action and a little comedy it sure was not a let down and you can see it many times over
Feb 12 2016,positive,great action movie civil war was definitely the best comic book movie of the year so far
Feb 12 2016,positive,one of the best marvel movies to date
Feb 11 2016,positive,dude one of the best so far
Feb 11 2016,positive,great movie  def one of the best marvel movies to date  unfortunately the scene i was in got cut 
Feb 11 2016,positive,better than batman v superman
Feb 11 2016,positive,this is my favorite marvel movie now
Feb 11 2016,positive,honestly im not blown away by these movies anymore as in i can walk into these movies  know what to expect nothing different so i dont set the bar high for these movies winter soldier actually really surprised me so with civil war russo brothers again i did raise the bar up a little was disappointed hated the camera work the music was pretty good but nothing that stood out the acting was probably some of the best from a marvel film ever loved tony starks character development awesome fight scenes and action black panther was cool and his story scarlet witch was bad ass loved getting to see her with her powers more but not much of a character development which was disappointing i also love emily van camp so it was great seeing sharon carter a lot more than i thought where was vision though what a waste would have loved to see more of him the story omg so slow  boring especially in the beginning it took me forever to get into if ever at all yes these movies usually have a ton of jokes but felt all weird with this somber tone they were trying to set then a lot of the heroes felt shoe horned in like spiderman ant man  hawkeye when you really think about it spiderman had no reason to fight maybe they were sent in to save the movie from its horrible story line cause spiderman  ant man were my favorite parts of the movie they made the movie more enjoyable and raised my original rating from a 2 and a half to a 3 yes the airport battle main scene was awesome especially in imax beautiful so awesome but really only that scene in imax so disappointed with that i thought movies were moving forward with capturing more scenes in those glorious imax scenes  o  the giant words across the screen telling me where they were at what the lol once again they ruined another villain made the mistake of asking how he was in the comics  yeah sounded cooler in the comics its like disneymarvel is seeing how boring they can get away with making their villains but if dc changes something everyone gets mad  crazy bad ending as well bottom line same old same old nothing new just surprised how little i enjoyed this i get it though why change the formula when they continue to have massive success i try to make an effort and buy movies filmed in imax on blu ray cause i love those shots but this one im not even sure i want to own while im loosing my interest in these movies i will probably continue watching them for the most part they are quite entertaining
Feb 11 2016,positive,captain america civil war is a adequate and outstanding entry to the avengers canon its a delightful blend of action drama and humour the action scenes are brilliant and the storyline is complex i would definately recommend this film
Feb 11 2016,positive,entertaining and grippingreally fun flickwith state of the art action sceneswith a surprisingly good villain
Feb 11 2016,positive,a definitive chapter in the mcu with wonderful character moments sometimes however there is a severe lack of tension with no payoff
Feb 11 2016,positive,great movie that makes it very tough who really is right because both steve and tony have very well shown reasons for why they are on the side that they are on
Feb 11 2016,positive,captain america civil war is action packed and a highstakes superhero drama that capitalizes on brilliant writing and direction
Feb 10 2016,positive,pros   they finally nailed spiderman he is perfect and i cannot wait for homecoming    black panther is awesome good introduction   paul rudd got to be more like himself and was not held back like in his standalone film  there is a good balance between the mature and dark aspects of the story and the fun parts   civil war features the single best superhero action sequence in cinematic history    cons    black panthers powers are not explained he just appears in his cool suit   daniel brühl was underwritten i did not hate zemo heck i like that he is the rare villain that gets away with it but the character needed more focus on him the movie wouldnt have been less without him   the politics of it all is sort of forgotten by the end there is no resolution i wish they would have delved more into the actual sokovia accords    overall i really enjoyed it 455
Feb 10 2016,positive,awesome movie a must watch
Feb 10 2016,positive,the great thing about this film is that you understand the reasons they are fighting but the film does overstay its time
Feb 10 2016,positive,lots of action but i dont like the story line i love super hero movies but i dont wanna see them fighting each other
Feb 10 2016,positive,while there is plenty of action to spare and some impressive individual shots the plot is more often than not nonsensical and the heroes begin to feel all the same as one liners and quips abound that create difficulty connecting with new characters and creating anything deeper from old ones another blah villain and far too long a runtime civil war continues down a path like age of ultron that shows bigger may not entirely be better
Feb 10 2016,positive,almost lost it me the big battle super cheesy special effects in that moment not good  overall good novie
Feb 9 2016,positive,team captain america will see this movie again and again no complaints from me
Feb 9 2016,positive,my new favorite marvel movie
Feb 9 2016,positive,this is probably my favorite marvel movie aside from avengers 55
Feb 9 2016,positive,best mcu movie in the entire universe watched it 3times in 3d imax
Feb 8 2016,positive,some of the best action choreography ive ever seen onscreen a perfect introduction to spiderman and finally a good marvel villain are just the icing on the cake that is this ball of a movie
Feb 8 2016,positive,this movie would have been better called avengers 3 with the myriad of marvel characters that appeared or were introduced i liked the moral obligation dilemma amongst the superheroes that lead to the eventual standoff between captain america and iron man too much time is spent with the new spiderman in my opinion but well thats what franchises do i cant wait to see where marvel goes next with this storyline great action sequences with a twist at the end and black widow is badass as always
Feb 7 2016,positive,this one is gonna be good
Feb 7 2016,positive,civil war was everything i couldve hoped for and more different from the comics but just as good marvel has set a new bar to which all superhero movies must attain to
Feb 7 2016,positive,awesome movie i really liked it
Feb 7 2016,positive,awesome movie the best captain america movie so far it was borderline avengers except that they were split on the issues with being controlled rather than independent hence the civil war if you want to stay in the loop on whats going in this movie franchise then dont miss it
Feb 7 2016,positive,fantastic flick my early birthday present really enjoyed both sides because of the winter soldier and the one liners were fantastic
Feb 7 2016,neutral,spiderman saves this film otherwise another dull movie about b list superheroes who in fact dont really have any super powers at all is it the first gay superhero film as well the gay undertones between captain and bucky is very strong they should have advanced this part of the story and it would have made it more interesting 
Feb 7 2016,positive,an incredible ride of a movie as marvels most iconic team is sundered apart after the events of the avengers captain america the winter soldier and age of ultron forces the world to put a leash on earths mighiest heroes
Feb 7 2016,positive,they needed a villain but spiderman was cool
Feb 7 2016,positive,its certainly not a new sort of plot because batman vs superman got it first but its a fresh start of something new
Feb 7 2016,positive,took elements from the civil war comic arc and turned in a marvelous movie which is fun to watch and features of the best narratives of any comic book movie  plays to the audiences joy of watching the heroes in action while forever changing how iron man  captain america will view one another after a gut wrenching plot line is revealed for the audience  the movie also establishes two new heroes to the mcu in the form of black panther  spiderman who finally has a home in the mcu  its a great watch and though it doesnt top the original avengers as my favorite mcu film it ranks right up there with captain america the winter soldier guardians of the galaxy  iron man
Feb 7 2016,positive,great action nice twist new characters spiderman was funny
Feb 6 2016,negative,it sucks i spend my money on this crap and i go home without my devolution nothing like the comics forced humor what can i sayit sucks thats it
Feb 6 2016,positive,best marvel movie out there really enjoyed it they did a great job of explaining both sides of the conflict plus black panther and spiderman were awesome
Feb 5 2016,positive,marvel phase 3 starts off here with an awesome huge bang instead of hero vs villain its heroes against heroes scarlet witch vs vision falcon vs spiderman cap vs iron man you name it and daniel bruhl as baron zemos villainy drives the plot through really well enough to being marvels best movie villain since loki and it was awesome seeing another superhero political thriller set within the already expanding marvel cinematic universe
Feb 5 2016,positive,the russo brothers delivered again this movie is electrifying funny when it should be extremely emotional and truly delivers on all grounds new characters were spectacular addition to the already outstanding cast inmarvelwetrust  russobrothers teamcap
Feb 5 2016,positive,the airport fight scene may very well be the best scene in any marvel movie to date
Feb 5 2016,positive,so good the new spiderman really made me fall in love with this movie also antman was hilarious even if you havent seen the other captain americans or other marvel movies go see this one
Feb 5 2016,negative,i thought i was going to see a captain america movie  harshly disappointed snoozeville
Feb 4 2016,positive,fantastic action great characters but for a movie with sooo much going on it moves too slow
Feb 4 2016,positive,my full opinion 8910

Feb 1 2016,positive,the best marvel film  a brutal blockbuster film
Jan 31 2016,positive,great flick that leaves you torn between teams tons of action just the right amount of comic relief overall a pleasant experience
Jan 31 2016,positive,my all time favorite movie everything has purpose and the action is amazing imagine captain america winter soldier on steroids with an amazing and funny spiderman i cant wait for the standalone spiderman film this movie was pure entertainment make sure youve seen winter soldier and avengers age of ultron before watching    dcmarvel as call of duty iwbattlefield 1
Jan 31 2016,positive,as someone who isnt crazy about superhero movies i cant help but be impressed by marvel and just how far their stories and characters have progressed in such a short time arguably the best of those characters is captain america simply because hes the one character people are most likely to relate to the captain isnt a billionaire or a king and he doesnt have super abilities from another planet hes just this wholesome level headed guy who you cant help but like in his third feature film captain america chris evans comes into conflict with other members of the avengers as following a tragedy the world governments decide the avengers shouldnt be free to do whatever they want anymore some of them agree some of them dont and thats where the split occurs leading to one of the best fight scenes i have ever seen when i saw the previews for this film i couldnt understand why the story wasnt used for an avengers film even while watching it i noticed that much of the focus isnt solely on captain america and i became even more convinced this film was not a true stand alone like weve seen in the past and thats because i think it was more of a transitional project than anything else clearly it seems as though marvel is putting captain america on the shelf for a while and trying to draw our attention to the new spiderman series starring tom holland i must admit i have never really liked spiderman i always saw him as bland and weak compared to the rest of the marvel universe but tom holland changed my mind in this film he was all personality in a way that toby mcguire and andrew garfield couldnt even imagine the charisma this good looking young actor puts out there should be enough to get anyone excited for the new series as far as this film goes the story was a bit complicated and in my opinion there are far too many characters involved for this to be titled captain america in that sense i was disappointed because i love the character and was looking forward to another feature film about him on the other hand amazing new characters were added a major story line was introduced into the avengers genre and i got to see the best action sequence ive ever seen so while it wasnt what i expected i still highly recommend seeing this film
Jan 31 2016,positive,best marvel movie yet go see it go see it
Jan 31 2016,positive,great movie best superhero film of the century
Jan 31 2016,positive,this is amazing  this is probably the best movie in the mcu ive seen till now
Jan 30 2016,positive,the new spiderman was the best part marvel sure knows how to make a superhero movie
Jan 30 2016,positive,i liked this but it didnt blow me away also between vision and scarlet witch couldnt this battle of been avoided antman and spiderman were stand out and i have to say captain was quite annoying
Jan 30 2016,negative,seeing somewhat edited version the film early i can tell you that it is indeed very interesting and well made however this film fails to deliver any unique aspects and the audience viewing the film will think they have seen this type of film 1000 times i fails to live up to the hype but enjoyable non the less
Jan 30 2016,positive,an enthralling ride of political tension polished action sequences and all withstanding humanity
Jan 30 2016,positive,civil war plays a major part in the mcu i cant wait to see it im a huge marvel fan and has seen every mcu movie out and future ones too the story the government wants to have full access to the heroes powers until needed this is the effect of new yorkdc and the age of ultron im team iron man because i personally think that buck should be captured because of his assassinations what team are you on tell me on my instagram marvelfanmcu
Jan 30 2016,positive,honestly marvel tends to have some of the best action scenes in film this was no exception the way they managed to have so many characters and give just enough of them all to keep it interesting is something other movies have failed at in the past    i highly recommend this film
Jan 29 2016,positive,if there is one word to describe this movie it is incredible when i saw winter soldier i was blown away by how good it was it was simply incredible i didnt think that that movie could be beat but the russo brothers did it again although the story started out rather slow and i did not enjoy the first action sequence to much the story got better and better and once spiderman was introduced  this movie simply became something else the acting is amazing the cgi is stellar the airport battle may be the greatest action sequence of all time and the story was incredible 1010 best marvel movie of all time
Jan 29 2016,positive,easily the best super hero movie to date marvel presents us with a grounded and emotional film where both sides are not only standing up for what they believe but have logical and understandable reasons for doing so the conflict and the resolution thereof are both well thought out the tone is darker than previous marvel offerings while still managing to maintain marvels trademark humor and family friendliness there is an instance of the young spiderman using the s word that might give parents of young children pause while an excellent movie for fans of the comics and nonfans alike there are so many moments of fannish glee that it is almost enough to distract from the actual movie the only real complaint i would have was some of the fight scene cinematography was jerky i saw the film in large format 3d so i dont know if the 2d offering has the same issues
Jan 28 2016,positive,meh to long battle scenes were just to long and ridiculous
Jan 28 2016,positive,siperman was excellent
Jan 28 2016,positive,the best comic book film since the dark knight
Jan 28 2016,positive,great awesome i could go on
Jan 28 2016,positive,great action way too much exposition
Jan 27 2016,negative,im very sad to say this movie was disappointing especially sense my favorite characteractor is in it robert it wasnt very funny and felt like a repeat of winter soldier
Jan 27 2016,positive,this movie was amazing great movie cant wait for marvel to make more movies
Jan 27 2016,positive,fun movie with some good laughs at parts  overall though the movie doesnt add anything really new that we havent seen before  i wonder if superhero fatigue could be setting in soon
Jan 27 2016,positive,this was a great movie it got right down to fighting and action the fighting was cool the scenery was great as well as the special effects the graphics were great now there are new characters in the movie witch will double the action i like black panther fight buckeye and jumping off roof tops and sliding down buildings and much more there where funny parts in this movie this was a confusing movie with flashbacks in the past ironman man and captain fighting was pretty scary and cool the fight with team cap vs team ironman was existing and cool it just went right dow to a fight    the fight of cap vs ironman was a good fight with lots of aggression and anger was good    the fight with cap fighting ironman  and bucky helping cap that was a dangerous fight    i did not like the ending to this movie because it had so much ministry to find out before the next movie and another reason why didnt like the ending was during the end of the war do they all team up again or do they have a new leader now if you like superhero movies with actionpacked and fighting with teams this could be a good movie to see couse your side team cap or team iron man    the only thing i dont like is the new spiderman why must he be a avenger and i dont like his new suit tom holland is a bad actor for playing spiderman to me spider man is not a avenger ok ok
Jan 27 2016,positive,emotional its not just cap vs iron man its emotion vs logic makes you feel for both sides amazing movie
Jan 27 2016,positive,spoiler alert this movie possibly suffers from the great success of past marvel movies which left very high expectations with me  past marvel sequel movies on the avengers iron man and captain america managed to surpass their predecessor movies if i am honest it was a good movie that entertained and what more can you ask  but somehow i expected to be wowed and i was not  at one point one hero intervenes in the battle between two others accusing them of pulling punches and that is what i feel the entire movie did  the conflicts seemed forced and without good justification    spidermans mantra with great power comes great responsibility was never referenced literally figuratively or metaphorically and i did not see adequate justification for these heros to relinquish their judgement to lesser men and women   without that justification the entire basis of the movie fails     i enjoyed batman vs superman much more and looked for the eventual reconciliation of the heroes that never came  the fate of the winter soldier was not nearly as heart wrenching as the fate of superman and this movie missed the mark that batman man verses superman set  i hope that we have not seen the peak in the marvel movie franchise but if so the dc movie franchise seems to be still going strong
Jan 26 2016,positive,better than age of ultron but not as good as it should have been
Jan 26 2016,positive,slow off start then gets really good mid way through until the end
Jan 26 2016,positive,a classic a true blast
Jan 26 2016,positive,better than avengers 2 age of ultron
Jan 26 2016,positive,loved loved loved it and cant wait for the next marvel installment  saw it 3 times already and probably once more before its gone
Jan 26 2016,positive,not as good as winter soldier but better than batman v superman
Jan 25 2016,positive,some people saying it was just plain fighting but it cracked me up and taught a few lessons to everyone spiderman really got people laughing as well
Jan 25 2016,positive,dope ass movie spiderman is sick great action way better than age of ultron  batman v superman wishes it was this movie
Jan 25 2016,negative,same shit different film
Jan 25 2016,positive,best movie of 2016 so far
Jan 25 2016,positive,civil war was a very good movie and lived up to the expectations i had for it if you were disappointed slightly at age of ultran this movie almost makes up for it its one of the better super hero movies and it was action packed and well made a side from a few unanswered questions and a lot of pointless fights and an interesting ending i loved nearly every moment of it it wasnt marvels best film but it was one of the better ones in recent memory
Jan 24 2016,positive,way better than batman vs superman
Jan 24 2016,positive,just when you think marvel cannot possibly top their last film they somehow do a little darker than previous films civil war hits on some very real issues while sprinkling in enough humor and dishing out lots of heavy hitting action to move every fan of comic book flicks
Jan 24 2016,positive,why is antman on captain americas team  oh and go tony great great movie hilarious especially spiderman
Jan 24 2016,positive,the one movie to start the summer and the one summer movie to beat right now
Jan 24 2016,positive,6 out of 5 stars awesome fantastic does not disappoint very very well done
Jan 23 2016,positive,amazing movie better than expected
Jan 23 2016,positive,up there in the top four marvel movies with guardians winter soldier avengers  jesus its breathtaking
Jan 23 2016,positive,my favorite mcu movies are still guardians of the galaxy and captain america winter soldier but this is a strong third it brings the biggest heros mcu has and gives enough screen time to all of them funny as usually but darker more compelling and emotionally empowering than ever before civil war will please fans and shift the mcu in a new direction
Jan 23 2016,positive,marvel have made one of the best movies this year
Jan 23 2016,positive,i effing loved this  it was amaze ballz times 10
Jan 23 2016,positive,one of the best mcu ever
Jan 23 2016,positive,great movie and surprisingly better that batman v superman
Jan 22 2016,positive,excellent great action very funny at times deals with a lot of seriousness too but doesnt fall into the trap of taking itself too seriously all the time looks at batman vs superman   thoroughly entertained from start to finish spiderman was awesome as was black panther
Jan 22 2016,positive,heartfelt actionpacked and genuinely conflicting captain america civil war demonstrates all the strengths of the avengers while compensating for its weaknesses with added emotional depth
Jan 22 2016,positive,civil war was the usual fun superhero movie that disney has been giving us for the past few years except maybe a bit darker in tone but that doesnt mean the film lacked the humor seen in previous films this was certainly the superhero movie i needed to see after watching the boring and depressing idiocracy known as batman v superman
Jan 22 2016,positive,the russo brothers continue to build their own legacy at marvel entertainment by crafting another excellent addition to the marvel cinematic universe
Jan 21 2016,positive,the russo brothers are amazing at handling multiple characters their relationships to each other and each of their storylines although the zemo story was confusing and not as well done everything between the heroes is amazing from the fight scenes to the character development it was very well done
Jan 20 2016,positive,best movie of the year or even of all time
Jan 20 2016,positive,amazing  the russos have the marvel movie universe in great hands
Jan 20 2016,positive,marvel does it again so its no surprise here i wouldnt call it the best marvel movie either that goes to iron man or guardians of the galaxy but still a step up
Jan 19 2016,neutral,ok but did not like the premise at all very solid performances by all actors
Jan 19 2016,positive,hard to believe but it was superior than the avenger sequel
Jan 19 2016,positive,was a thor away from being perfect
Jan 18 2016,negative,watched it on the plane maybe thats why it was so forgettable for me or maybe because i just wasnt all that interested in it in the first place just another marvel tonne they kinda melted into one big day long movie for me already
Jan 18 2016,positive,this movie is the greatest marvel movie so far it could have easily been avengers 3 with all the star power this film has yet it is very much a captain america film i cant say more about this movie it has action range of emotions from angrylovesadnesslaugh out loud funny you will not even notice time for when it ends you will say wtf that movie went at such a great pace and all the stuff that is in it such as spiderman antman and black panther
Jan 18 2016,positive,the best marvel movie i have ever seen im a huge fan of marvel comics and i was thoroughly impressed with this movie would recommend to everyone
Jan 18 2016,positive,really good for a captain america movie
Jan 17 2016,positive,the battle line has been drawn as our avengers are divided in the first film in phase 3 of the marvel cinematic universe captain america civil war this very loose adaptation of the comic series has it all from an outstanding cast to even more outstanding action sequences while the glamour of this film is outstanding the film also excels in the best story of an mcu film to date and makes the movie one of the best in the franchise    as with any of my marvel reviews this is will be 100 spoiler free and i will only discuss what has been revealed in the trailers so the portrayal of spiderman will be discussed here as well as the introduction of other characters with that said lets dive in    this movie excels on all fronts however the best part of this film is the story due to the amount of weight it has in the franchise as well as its characters the story here is a very loose adaptation of the comic series where the avengers are forced to decide on registering themselves with the government the film takes this idea and applies it to the story of the mcu thus far and makes the avengers take into account all the lives that were lost while they fought in new york washington dc and sokovia tony stark sides with the government while captain america thinks that they should be allowed to operate freely this causes a rift between heroes as they have to choose a side and thus we have our movie the story gives weight to all of the films so far and really plays with who we feel is right in all of this the screenplay shows both sides of the argument equally and actually challenges the viewer to question his or her beliefs not only that but the characters involved have to answer the question of registration as well as other personal issues that arise because of this giving us a chance to see their mindset and learn more about the heroes we thought we knew     it is also worth mentioning here that the screenplay gives each and every character their due and nobody gets wasted at the core of this film despite of the massive cast is a captain america movie we learn more about him as as his view on why the avengers are necessary also we get to see iron man deal with his own personal problems that arise from all this as we get to see some of the characters most meaningful material yet the winter soldier also plays a big role in this as well as the newcomer to the mcu black panther who introduced phenomenally speaking of introductions spiderman makes his debut as well and without spoiling anything you are in for a treat as he is one of the many highlights of this film    the cast here is fantastic with chris evans and robert downey jr reprising their roles as captain america and iron man they both play off eachother perfectly and both deliver their finest performances as the characters to date we get to see more of paul bettany as vision elizabeth olsen as scarlett witch paul rudd as ant man anthony mackie as falcon sebastian stan as winter soldier scarlett johansson as black widow jeremy renner as hawkeye and don cheadle as war machine all giving excellent performances however the standouts of the film are chadwick boseman as black panther and tom holland as spiderman boseman is perfect in this movie as he adds so much to the film in terms of his role as well as his performance anytime boseman is on screen you feel like you are watching the beginning of something great and i cant wait to see what comes from this in his own film holland is just as impactful here as spiderman the pressure was on for him however he pulled off his role in spades i cant say how he ranks in terms of the actors that portrayed spidey so far but i cant wait to see how he grows into the role from here    directors joe and anthony russo are also phenomenal here their eye to detail in this film is remarkable as everything in this movie is relevant from the small intimate scenes to the large scale action sequences you can tell that they genuinely thought about how to construct this movie in a way that will shock audiences and they pulled it off perfectlythey made a statement with captain america the winter soldier but here they show that they are here to stay and give us a glimpse of what they can dow with a cast of this magnitude    my only real gripe with this film is the pacing of the first thirty minutes this film is very slow starting out and had me worried if the film was going to recover while the film clicks on all cylinders after this small stretch it is still worth noting that the pacing is a bit off    overall i loved captain america civil war this is a meaningful film in terms of it being a political thriller but more importantly this grows the mcu in ways that were never thought to be possible while it does drag in the beginning once this movie picks up steam it never lets up i honestly cant praise this movie enough for what it does for the mcu as well as the comic book genre and i strongly urge everyone to see this film also stay after the credits for 2 hints at what is to come in the mcu
Jan 17 2016,positive,a great movie with amazing action and humor everyone shines at least ones in this movie one big problem i had is that i felt there should have shown bigger consequences in each avengers life
Jan 17 2016,negative,dont waste your time this is the result of a company being afraid to leave their comfort zone and not taking any risks   the humor was awful timing in the action all the hits were over emphasized resulting in weak action with no climax or mood poor special effects and terrible filmmaking by the end of the movie i was sick of movies and i love movies      i wrote up a whole thing then bumping cancel when i dropped my phone
Jan 17 2016,positive,not only the best marvel superhero movie but a strong contender for the best movie of the year so far d it has everything action comedy drama politics topped with a fantastic balanced use of about 12 superheroes including the now greatest spiderman interpretation ever huge highlight d  while still being at its core a captain america story special praise to the airport showdown which will go down as one of the best action scenes in film d
Jan 17 2016,positive,not as good as winter soldier but still one of the best marvel movies in their universe the russo are really good at stories that ate relatable to real life
Jan 17 2016,positive,i cant wait for this movie
Jan 17 2016,positive,this movie had it all together right out of the starting gate the plot was well thought out the acting was good and the action was entertaining and meaningful this is in my opinion the best marvel has brought to the table so far im not trying to jab at anyone but the only people that would give this less then 3 stars are trolls and people who have to have everything their way in a movie in order to be happy
Jan 17 2016,positive,great movie the only thing i would say as a con is that it was a little too long but it doesnt take away from the movie  definitely a must see
Jan 16 2016,positive,civil war was freaking awesome captain america civil war is one of the best marvel cinematic universe movies ive ever seen the russo brothers really know how to make a captain america film that really is emotional at some parts knowing that theyre directing the infinity war movies for 2018 and 2019 makes me pumped up spiderman is one of my favorite super heros and it was so awesome to see him on the big screen with iron man and captain america i think the final battle in this movie was super emotional for me though this movie does what batman v superman failed to do have humor make sense and having both sides to each other characters choices i give captain america civil war 5 stars
Jan 16 2016,positive,next to guardians of the galaxy this was my favorite marvel movie
Jan 16 2016,positive,incredible build up and conflict resulting in action packed fun with your favorite supers some characters are there just to be there but who cares
Jan 16 2016,negative,this review contains spoilers click expand to view wow this movie is bad bad bad i am so glad that i got a free pass when the projector broke on deadpool and i used it for this movie as i would have hated to waste my hard earned cash on this garbage longest 4 hours of my life oh what it wasnt four hours you say well it felt like four hours since it was so bad where to start    spoiler if you havent seen it and want to stop here as im giving some things up   bad starts right at the beginning black widow is in an armored vehicle and the main bad guy throws a grenade in there not a scratch on her yes she did use one of the guys to partial block the blast but there would have been some shrapnel that would have hit her speaking of her she also is thrown 25 yards through the air at the airport scene and hits a plane walkway and yet again doesnt even mess up her makeup  un explosion blowing up 12 a buildingjust some dirt on her cheekcome on     the jokes were just bad and inappropriate for the seriousness of the subject matter the only joke that was good was at the end when stan lee showed up in his self gratuitous cameo like he does with every marvel movie     the tunnel chase scene had horrible cgi making them look ridiculous as they were running through the tunnel     bucky blocking machine gun bullets with his hand his hand folks from a machine gun     the un blowing up was stolen directly from batman vs superman when superman was on trial     plot was so predictable a two year old could see what was coming next     a main villain in zero zeno zemooh who cares what his name was he was so forgettable     bucky told to leave no witnesses when he killed tonys parents yet there is a static camera at the exact spot of where the car crashes in the middle of a forest to record it all     spidermans aunt ismarissa tomei huh     the civil war where none of the heroes die war hero breaks his back but its ok with some rehab and stark tech hes back up and walking already by the end of the movie     captain america is willing to turn his back on his country and his friends in the avengers for one friend his oldest bff bucky     ironmans right hand gets squished by bucky yet magically starts working again when fighting captain america     the airport that had zero people in itnot one worker nothingand only like one plane lol smh     this movie is so bad yet the marvel sheep fans will lap it up like its the best thing since sliced bread pathetic r
Jan 16 2016,positive,awesome movie cannot wait for spiderman
Jan 16 2016,positive,damn you marvel you are winning me over
Jan 16 2016,positive,marvels captain america civil war epic feels like the end of a season rather than the start of a new phase and thats its strength the culmination of 13 films of character building which leads to a very emotional and personal climax for the 2 main protagonists  something which the recent batman v superman failed to achieve on account of us not caring in marvel we care as for the action the airport rumble is arguably the greatest fight scene of any superhero film  there is so much going on its in this sequence that we get to see the much heralded new take on spiderman in action and he really doesnt disappoint spinning all the best bits from the sam raimi version into a younger and better hero however the real scene stealer in that sequence is the return of ant man who is all creatures great and small ultimately it is chris evans and robert downey jnr who provide the most drama  both are morally right and wrong and both will never be the same again the finale is rather brutal and at the same time heart breaking or is if you have invested the past 30 ish hours in the marvel cinematic universe that all said this isnt the best marvel that its been touted as the avengers and guardians take some beating and probably not the best cap film winter soldier is a much tighter plot but it does showcase everything that is right able marvel  excelsior
Jan 15 2016,positive,a grand adventure and i have no clue where we go from here
Jan 15 2016,positive,best marvel movie yet
Jan 15 2016,positive,great action and plot line
Jan 15 2016,positive,as a marvel fanboy this movie kept me on the edge of my seat for the whole thing the russo brothers did it again and i cant wait to see what theyll do for the infinity wars
Jan 15 2016,positive,everything i thought it would be looking forward to what the future holds especially with black panther and spiderman
Jan 15 2016,positive,without doubt absolutely fckin amazing the scenes with spidey are brilliant and then antman does his little trick well not so little
Jan 15 2016,positive,well crafted story that fully develops catches us up without assuming that we are idiots nonstop action that leads to future storylines
Jan 15 2016,positive,good but not great action scenes were really cool but overall it left me wanting more and looking for a better plot
Jan 15 2016,positive,the movie was good but the reasoning for their fight is all over the place captain america wants avengers to remain a freelance team of heroes while iron man wants the team to be under the supervision and limitations of the government in order to be more controlled and not put the people in danger then captain america wants to save bucky from the government while iron man wants to make sure that bucky is put in the hands of the government but later just wants to kill bucky because even though he was under the mind control of hydra bucky killed iron mans parents the movie is a great movie overall
Jan 15 2016,positive,my favourite marvel movie to date a believable villain combined with the consequences of free roaming superheroes it deals with those consequences in a way that is unique that gives the film a deeper understanding than two sides of heroes at war
Jan 14 2016,positive,best movie in the mcu for me well see if infinity war can surpass it boy oh boy has civil war set quite the high standard 
Jan 13 2016,positive,arguably the best of the mcu films the russo brothers have done a fantastic job the action is perfect and the comedy isnt overdone the beauty in this film is how well done all the characters are in a film that has so much happening as with the other cap films this film has the most adult themes to date serious enough that younger kids will enjoy the action but may not necessarily understand some of the underlying messaging great film a must see
Jan 13 2016,positive,awesome  spidey and panther stole the show
Jan 13 2016,positive,this really should have been another avengers movie because all the heroes from age of ultron except for thor hulk and quicksilver were in it it even added antman and spiderman to the mix  the story is good and not too complicatated for those of us who have seen all the other movies its also packed with just the right amount of action marvel and disney scores with another super hero movie
Jan 13 2016,positive,good movie with some fantastic action scenes i recommend watching the previous movies before seeing this one that means almost all of the marvel movies in the past 5 years
Jan 13 2016,positive,the fight secne team cap and team ironman was the best part
Jan 13 2016,positive,one of the best super hero movies and certainly the best marvel movie since guardians of the galaxy the russo brothers show again that they make the best action scenes in the mcu and are able to give proper treatment for all the heroes in the movie another stand out are the new comers black panther and spider man that steal the show in every scene they are in dont miss this one
Jan 13 2016,positive,captain america civil war is a fantastic movie its action packed dramatic and amazing
Jan 12 2016,positive,soooooo many fucking characters felt like game of thrones episode   thank god for the combined comic relief of ant man and spiderman wish theyd do a film together great casting call on spidey fortunately seems like we wont have to deal with a third origin story but looking forward to his release
Jan 12 2016,positive,fantastic movie worth seeing
Jan 12 2016,negative,could have been better
Jan 12 2016,positive,another marvel knock out
Jan 11 2016,positive,loved it if i say more about what i most liked about this movie id be giving away spoilers
Jan 11 2016,positive,although the film felt bloated at times with so many characters on screen captain america civil war is one of the best mcu films  perhaps even one of the best superhero films  to date
Jan 11 2016,positive,imo it might be the best movie marvel has put out to this point  it has the right balance of intensity and humor  it has chris evans keeping his mask on because thats what captain america does and not having it fly off every second minute for whatever hollywood preening reason  if marvel is going to make a misstep with having too many characters and not enough movie for them this offering is definitely not going to be the one that offers viewers a look at the chink in the companys armor  there are some pleasant surprises within for comic fans and casual fans alike in here  id happily go to the theatre again to see this and am anxiously looking forward to buying the dvd
Jan 11 2016,positive,captain america civil war is not only a great superhero moviebut also a great movie periodthe only problem that this movie stops it self from being a flawless movieis the movies villain
Jan 10 2016,positive,great action and humor the plot actually made sense and the new characters are great too i am a big critic and this movie was great
Jan 10 2016,positive,awesome vs movie very long yay spiderman 2 post credits scenes
Jan 10 2016,positive,was very good loved spiderman
Jan 10 2016,positive,brilliant movie these captain america movies just get better and better   tom hollands portrayal of spiderman is the best version up to date more like the comic book
Jan 10 2016,positive,one of the best marvel films to date
Jan 10 2016,positive,thought this movie was pretty good for me i preferred captain america the winter soldier more but i did enjoy this my favourite part of the movie was spiderman and im pretty excited for the new spidey movie coming next year teamspidey
Jan 9 2016,positive,there were a lot of good elements to this film especially the government oversight issue too often when the government gets involved too deeply its difficult for justice to be served and situations are handled to get votes instead of to do the right thing tonys character is such a hypocrite throughout that the film can be a little nauseating mostly because he blames everything that he has done on everyone else and doesnt know how to reconcile collateral damage with the number of lives that are saved in contrast this is also apparent during the scarlet witch incident if she had not accidentally killed the numbers that she did more would have died through her inaction lots of moral flaws in this film but the film doesnt look at these flaws as wrong and i think this is where it suffers the most
Jan 9 2016,positive,i think this one was one of the best movies a a lot of action
Jan 9 2016,positive,has one of the best superhero fight scenes ever spider man was finally done right black panther is awesome villain lacked a little but other than that it was one of marvels best
Jan 9 2016,positive,the greatest marvel film hands down perfect balance of action and character development tops avengers for me black panther spiderman and antman are amazing the airport scene is one of the best action scenes ive ever seen in a theater i cant wait to go back and watch it again
Jan 8 2016,negative,im amazed by the outpouring of favor for this movie was it fun yes was it memorable no not enough time was given to the tropes of heroes that graced the screen for any genuine heartfelt development it was like a hot dog with every ingredient thrown on too much i like chile dogs i like mustard and relish i even fancy ketchup and onions but all of it together was a mess
Jan 8 2016,positive,full of humor touching and thought provoking moments whatever side you choose you will feel for both
Jan 8 2016,negative,this is a turd movie the spfx look horrible marvel keeps making crap black looks horrible
Jan 8 2016,positive,a little darker than othersbut just as funny and rivetingcivil war is another excellent installment to the mcu
Jan 7 2016,positive,hands down great having 12 heroes on one screen is pretty badass
Jan 7 2016,positive,refreshing to have the action with story substance
Jan 7 2016,positive,it was ok movie sorry but i feel it could had been much better felt more like avengers civil war  movie was a bit long
Jan 7 2016,positive,typical comedy over substance marvel film
Jan 7 2016,positive,awesome this is easily in my top 3 to 5 of the mcu films while its not my favorite story of the mcu it is the overall best made film in the series i think its always great to see a bunch of heroes battling on screen at the same time which is probably part of why i like the 2 avengers so much too this was easily the most emotionally driven story and it really made you contemplate just whose side you were on i was team iron man the majority of the film but ended up just abut 5050 in the end
Jan 7 2016,positive,it was a struggle getting around to watching civil war and i think in hindsight it was because i am struggling to admit what we all know to be true superhero fatigue isnt just real its right here on top of us despite this being the era of deadpool weve watched age of ultron fantastic four batman v superman and apocalypse four franchise pillars fall anywhere from dull to downright awful well over a billion or two in expenses and if were being truly honest with ourselves not much to show for it characters we love have been reduced to boring stereotypes or countercharacter abominations action sequences have become green screen physics defying cgi affairs with minimal stakes and zero tension quips signature lines and tired storylines are getting phoned in these days and are preceded by trailers so predictive of the film it may not even be worth seeing at all in many ways civil war is the crux of this dont get me wrong the latest cap installment and make up avengers film has better production value effects and story than bvs ever was going to have but at the same time you can tell that the marvel team is getting stale in their own way andor they simply dont have to try anymore because the competition is so pathetic fox is just hugging rights while dc shambles through its half wit schedule like a zombie halfway through no credible villain has emerged halfway through the team is still having nonsensical black and white arguments over nuanced issues that seem easily solved halfway through im less of a team capteam iron man guy and more of a team get me the fuck outta here spiderman is a painful shoehorn while black panther is both a black friend and a confusing bundle of irrational anger and wakandan mumbo jumbo somewhere in this overly polished and mass produced turd theres a floating prison some super soldiers some wierd underdeveloped romance nods and a crazy doctor crossbones is a 30 second afterthought it isnt as packed as age of ultron but in some ways its even flatter no real conflict ever develops because marvel isnt capable of the dialogue to set that up and no one could really die anyhow i wont blame this solely on the russo brothers however as someone managed to right the ship in the last 20 minutes where the movie suddenly regains some of the serious nature that winter soldier had in these waning moments the meat of the movie comes to light the conflict between friends struggling with how to go about doing the right thing unfortunately like so many other films its too little too late captain america is barely fun anymore the movie isnt a sign of superhero fatigue it is superhero fatigue slog through at your own peril
Jan 7 2016,positive,the best marvel movieand action that makes the raid and matrix movies step back best incarnation of spiderman ant man was great and black panther surprised me bucky is always insane fun    cap and iron man were excellent especially iron manbest since iron man 1     still like the dark knight as my favorite comic book movie but if thats 1 this is 1a bravo
Jan 6 2016,positive,nothing is perfect but this was darn near close its causing confusion for me on whether its the best marvel film to date top 5 marvel film top 10 all time movie
Jan 6 2016,positive,great movie way better than batman vs superman sorry dc your movie absolutely sucks balls i see cats fuck better than your movie marvel rules
Jan 5 2016,positive,civil war is so freakin spectacular i cant even explain it couldnt get any better than this definitely became one of my top 5 favorite films of alltime
Jan 5 2016,neutral,that was too much cgi for my liking
Jan 5 2016,positive,i cant imagine a better version of this story for the mcu or a better introduction of two of the most iconic superheroes in history in spiderman and black panther it raises the bar for all comic book movies to come and cinematic storytelling in general marvel continues to create and expand on a world and characters that i cant get enough of the russo brothers have taken the mantle and ran with it cant wait to see what they come up with next
Jan 5 2016,negative,another absolute snoozefest too many characters too much nonsense just too much too long too it really feels like a 25hr endurance event ive ran marathons faster than thisand enjoyed it more
Jan 5 2016,positive,the best marvel movie to date must see it again soon
Jan 4 2016,positive,the end of this trailer hit home with me when capt  america tell iron man hes my friend iron man response is and i thought u were my friendi know the feelingto familiar
Jan 4 2016,positive,well they havent done a bad one yet i was worried with the great critic reviews that it might fall short  it did not what a great balance of action depth of characters and confusion as to the good side all of the characters did a great job and continue to push these story lines and to give us reasons to come back side note the spiderman addition seemed a little misplaced and random though the young man playing the new spiderman seems great im not sure they had to make it fit as well as antman
Jan 4 2016,positive,best captain america movie to date
Jan 4 2016,positive,amazing movie true sequel to winter soldier must watch

Jan 3 2016,positive,overall such a great film there was only a few minor issues that i wasnt totally cool about
Jan 3 2016,positive,excellent movie surprised at the ending
Jan 3 2016,positive,another solid marvel film im gonna forgo any of the plot as to not spoil it for anyone i enjoyed the film it continues the marvel cinematic universe and still has enough surprises to keep the audience guessing this time around theres less of a villain and more of a focus on the inner conflict of the two sides thus the civil war title having read the civil war comic series itself i knew it would be loosely based on it but for what its worth the cinematic version did it justice the film does have some lows still regardless of the rave reviews coming in the central villain is very week especially after you figure out his whole scheme and at times especially near the end i felt like it could have went another 20 minutes to clear up some plot holes a civil war with only one battle cmon haha i enjoyed it regardless especially finally seeing spiderman tom holland join the marvel cinematic universe and also black panther chadwick boseman getting his due regardless of what i write here i know everyones gonna go and check it out still so enjoy
Jan 3 2016,positive,the best marvel and superhero movie to date

Jan 3 2016,positive,it goes beyond the traditional mcu formula and adds so much depth and excitement for these all ready well developed characters
Jan 2 2016,positive,teamcap icandothisallday
Jan 2 2016,positive,different than the usual super hero movie
Jan 2 2016,positive,i love the marvel series and civil war had most of my favourite characters plus a few new ones  the only problem is this feels like a set up for a part 2 yet to come no wrong notes just not enough interesting ones
Jan 2 2016,positive,great and entertaining
Jan 2 2016,positive,awesome  hard to pick a side
Jan 2 2016,positive,top mcu film to date black panther spiderman and ant man are welcome additions to the avengers
Jan 2 2016,positive,marvel does it again can they make a bad movie all of the actors knock it out of the park great action drama and storytelling theyve done the civil war comic justice
Jan 2 2016,positive,best of the captain america ive seen thus far and the only one that i truly liked
Jan 1 2016,positive,after the shortcomings of age of ultro i was a little worried about this one would it be too soft will it feel too much like a disney movie would we be able to get back to the original marvel movies that we come to love the answer is yes  captain america civil war delivers from its first action seen until its last i thought it was easy as picking a side but at the end you realize its far more complicated than that by the end the movie just sucks you in caring about both individuals and the outcome but lets not forget it puts superheroes vs superheroes and the action scenes are incredible the best  you will ever see pop culture kings  youtube facebook tumblr
Jan 1 2016,positive,just not a very interesting stand alone movie
Jan 1 2016,positive,loved the fight sequence black panther was amazing this film left me asking for more great intro to the next couple of movies indeed
Jan 1 2016,positive,kinda felt more of an iron man movie than a captain america moviegreat film ready for the next round
Jan 1 2016,positive,a thrilling action movie with great humor and drama it feels like a mixture of winter soldier and and age of ultron but still enjoyable
Jan 1 2016,positive,joe  anthony russo continue their hotstreak with the third installment of the famedfirstavenger captain america civil war jumpstarts phase three in the marvel cinematic universe with its compelling mix of action humor and drama the films unmitigated attention to emotions and character creates for not only the best captain america film not only one of the best mcu films but one of the best superhero films of alltime 55
Jan 1 2016,positive,this should have been avengers movie more than captain america movie d d i loved this one true to comic book fans and ending was little unexpected but ya it was good d
Jan 1 2016,positive,the most epic movie ever made thank you russo brothers
Dec 31 2015,negative,maybe im being too critical but the plot of this whole movie was them not agreeing on whether or not their battles should be regulated boring
Dec 31 2015,positive,awesome movie two after credit scenes dc comics needs to learn from marvel
Dec 30 2015,positive,one of marvels best movies
Dec 30 2015,positive,smoothly combining the best parts of the marvel cinematic universe into one massive film captain america civil war is arguably the best entry in the franchise it seamlessly bounces back and forth between political thriller and fun action blockbuster allowing you to appreciate both the serious moments and the silly chris evans continues his spoton portrayal of captain america and is supported by a cast of returning actors who are confident and comfortable in their roles newcomer chadwick boseman plays a fierce black panther and is set up well for a solo film a few years from now the runaway star of this already filledtothebrim film is tom holland as spiderman easily the most accurate depiction of the character on screen hollands character is simply a delight to watch captain america civil war has what is perhaps the best superhero scene ever put to film in the form of the airport fight that was teased in the trailers after the adequate avengers age of ultron and underwhelmingly solid antman this is a reminder that the marvel cinematic universe can still deliver
Dec 29 2015,positive,more dialogue than normal but still awesome
Dec 29 2015,positive,what a great fun movie marvel definitely knows what there doing as this is by far the best captain america movie dc take notes this is how you make a great comic book movie spiderman stole the show for me if cant wait to see more of him and i way impressed by the young actor who played him
Dec 29 2015,positive,i enjoyed watching this movie more than age of ultron the effects were better but there nothing keep you thinking about what will happen next
Dec 29 2015,positive,captain america civil war was a very good movie not a great one  the action scenes were very good and eye catching  and did a little to make up for the plot holes present in movie  the overall plan of zemo was a little far fetched and there were too many cogs in it for it to work as exactly as planned but it did crossbones wad a throw away villian and was wasted   even after tony found out about the real plan he went right back to the way he was before he knew the truth  the introduction of black panther and spiderman were done brilliantly   i really enjoyed seeing them in the mcu overall a good movie  loved antman and falcon was a breakout star in this too
Dec 29 2015,positive,the best comic book movie of all time
Dec 29 2015,positive,a spectacular film marvel gas really pulled off the whole crumbling from within idea and its hard to remember that this isnt an avengers film i really liked the backstory with the black panther and the sneaky credits scene that apparently ties in with the gives hints at thor ragnarok     however i wasnt particularly happy with how they included spiderman and antman  spidermans actor was changed again and he was nerdified even more while antman was easily dismissed as a minor character   even when he has his own movie     overall a superb film that i would gladly watch again thanks marvel
Dec 29 2015,positive,great movie  the addition of black panther antman  spiderman was perfect
Dec 29 2015,positive,another great movie from the russo brothers all the characters were great black panther and spiderman were a great addition
Dec 29 2015,positive,yep worth the price of a ticket good story good acting amazing fight scenes
Dec 29 2015,positive,awesome crazy good  fight scenes are amazing love it
Dec 29 2015,positive,once again marvel comics has lived up to the hype unlike dc comics their comic book movie competitor marvel successfully gave us two of our favorite superheroes waging ideological warfare over how to protect the civilians they swore to protect a plot with which batman v superman made a widely known failed attempt     the plot here is less inherently interesting than the sheer intestinal fortitude it takes a studio to produce a film like this civil war undeniably reads as yet another episode in the television show made of movies that the marvel cinematic universe has turned into but this is like one of the really good ones the action is top notch always keeping you on your toes with different fighting styles ranging from captain america to iron man to newcomers like antman spiderman and black panther all of which add their own perfect touches to the fabric of this picture credit goes to joe and anthony russo the directors of this film as well as its predecessor winter soldier they find a way to give every character a moment to shine realizing that all of these characters are someones favorite and deserve their second in the spotlight personally i was delighted to see paul rudds return as scott langantman he has quickly become my favorite addition to the mcu and this film locked that up for me     however its not all perfect as fun as the movie is it weighs in at 147 minutes and it feels it particularly toward the beginning and again around the three quarters mark while the amount of characters involved leads to some of the films best moments it also adds to the bloat and leads to the film being torn between whether it would rather be another captain america movie or another avengers movie its understandable why the filmmakers felt the need to put those two films together but the execution of it perhaps wasnt as clean as it shouldve been     regardless captain america civil war is a fantastic time at the movies and a terrific way to start off the summer movie season this one continues to build off of antman which helped to refocus the mcu after the mixed results of last years attempt to dominate the summer with avengers age of ultron if for nothing else the airport scene which is briefly shown in trailers is more than enough reason to see this movie possibly multiple times this is easily one of the strongest superhero movies to date
Dec 29 2015,positive,surprised me and exceeded expectations black panther was the best thing
Dec 28 2015,positive,this movie is another big success for marvel and it is one of there best if anything the solo films of captain america always seems to be better than the previous films unlike thor and iron man where there sequels are good still doesnt compare to the first captain america civil war has a very serious tone to it the comedy doesnt really come in till we get scenes with ant man  spiderman the russo brothers does a great job on keeping this as a captain america and iron man story rather than and avenger movie the movie continues rate off from the events of age of ultron which where is now at the point people are afraid of the avengers because of the threats that comes there way yes the avengers always manage to save the day but still cant save everyone and cant fix the damaged that has happened to the innocent captain america civil war is not just a story on freedom but it is also can be a story of revenge which is what made a great way to introduce the black panther and to see tonys connection with hydra another great thing about this film was seeing spiderman in an mcu film if anything he and antman were the best parts about the airport scene marvel nailed it with spiderman on his attitude and made the right choice on casting a teenager for this part it was also nice to see that his first costume was crappy looking because he is just a kid that is getting his foot in the door of being a superhero i really think this was sonys wises choice on canning the amazing spiderman series and start of fresh on a new series with the help of marvel because of civil war i am now more looking forward to spiderman homecoming if there is one thing i did not enjoy of this film it was the villain helmut zemo this is not the zemo that people know from the comics in the comics he is captain americas second arch nemesis and is also one of the big threats to the avengers he is smart dangerous involved with hydra and has great fighting skills in this movie he is just smart and wants to tear the avengers apart for the pain they have caused him and by tearing them apart he uses the winter soldier besides from another unlikes villain in this series the movie is still great
Dec 28 2015,positive,very good movie didnt even realize how long it was to good to care
Dec 28 2015,positive,the winter soldier is still the best of the captain america films
Dec 28 2015,positive,this was an excellent movie one of the best marvel movies ever made its a must see you dont want to miss this
Dec 27 2015,positive,greatest marvel movie yet
Dec 27 2015,positive,good form beginning to end from when spiderman is introduced to the end nothing but action and laughs amazing cast and writing stan lee does make cameo just have to wait lol end credit seen leads into a character spinoff movie go see it worth the 
Dec 27 2015,positive,very good long but overall necessary for story build loved seeing some new and old characters and some amazing action sequences especially funny when fedex shows up thats all im saying
Dec 27 2015,positive,the film is full of plot conveniences divices and poorly handled characters but it also has great action sequences and solid direction   grade c  full review at rencatreviewscom
Dec 27 2015,positive,very very good   theyve made a gooden great special fx funny exciting well choreographed fight scenes and i love the new spiderman
Dec 27 2015,positive,amazing was an amazing marvel movie marvel cinematic universe really out did themselves they set the bar high for their other movies but it didnt really follow the comics that much which is kind of meh
Dec 27 2015,positive,lots of characters and action and cgi  if thats for you then go see it
Dec 27 2015,positive,good movie civil war is hurt but it is necessary
Dec 27 2015,positive,maybe the best marvel movie thus far
Dec 26 2015,positive,this movie  was off the charts awesome  i love it
Dec 26 2015,positive,i really enjoy the marvel movies that dont come up with a plot that has a clear cut bad guy and then clear cut heroes i like it when its a little more grey just like this one  each side to this fight has their merit which makes it hard to route for either one but that makes for a more compelling story and also really good dialogue this definitely advances the mcu story into more interesting an serious territory and im looking forward to them
Dec 26 2015,positive,a bit slow but still epic black panther stole the scenes
Dec 26 2015,positive,best mcu movie yet this movie was absolutely amazing
Dec 25 2015,positive,captain americas 3rd installment civil war improves on everything before it the central conflict between team cap and team iron man really makes feel for the characters and makes you understand where each and everyone of them is coming from and why they chose their respective side to keep this brief spiderman is seriously the best spiderman we have ever seen on screen black panther also shines in this movie as do all of the characters my only complaint would be the villian he is the most lamest villian in the mcu by far i really like the dc charactersmovies but dc seriously needs to step up their game just go and see this movie you will not be disappointed
Dec 25 2015,positive,best marvel movie to date this movie really did not need any villains as the conflict between captain america and iron man heats up the screen both men recruit there team and we end up with a huge slugfest at an airport that is brilliant the introduction of black panther finally is genius fantastic character with some bad ass moves and seeing wakanda on screen has got me excited for 2018 and his first solo movie who steals the show well it may be spiderman this looks like the definitive version of the character to date and a great portrayal by tom holland he is on screen for quite some time with and without his mask the rest of the crew are great and the showdown between the two main guys is fantastic this leaves the marvel universe open for some great stories to come awesome
Dec 25 2015,positive,i felt like the avengers were the best part of any man and ant man was the best part of this movie
Dec 25 2015,positive,it is fantastic and black panther is awesome
Dec 25 2015,positive,great film entertaining fun lots of action great cast and good story
Dec 25 2015,positive,loved it absolutely incredible film so glad the russo brothers are doing infinity war everyone get there chance to shine such a great movie yet again from marvel
Dec 25 2015,positive,couldnt have been better than that best action movie of the year
Dec 25 2015,positive,great movie in every way
Dec 25 2015,positive,best superhero movie to date wasnt sure if one could top dark knight or avengers but this one did just that
Dec 25 2015,positive,this movie rocks tops all other super hero movies while age of ultron meet with mixed reviews little did we know that age of ultron was the set up and civil war was going to be the payoff and payoff it did in huge ways this film is 98 perfection with only 2 complaints 1 the fight scene in the beginning was too close up and too fast 2 i didnt like spider mans costume other than that this movie is on point from start to finish with huge expectations and tons of hype this movie doesnt disappoint
Dec 24 2015,positive,marvels latest installment captain america civil war is a fantastic entry in what appears to be the unstoppable marvel machine headed by disney and kevin feige civil war while having all the big set pieces of an avengers movie and the fight scenes that will make any nerd sweaty is more of a character piece that explores the themes of loyalty betrayal friendship revenge and forgiveness but the question of course everyone wants to know is which is better civil war or bvs the answer is civil war but its really not a fair comparison what makes civil war great goes beyond the inner workings of the movie itself rather it is the culmination of the the stories marvel has told about the characters through their shared universe the audience feels like they know tony stark because we have seen him in 5 movies we know who captain america is and what his motivations are because we have seen him in 4 movies because of this civil war is made all the better the movie as a standalone file is excellent in its own right a moral question arises after an avengers mission that asks the question who do the avengers and other super powered beings answer to should their actions be regulated and controlled will that control serve the interest of the common man or the governments that control them and breaks down the very idea of being a hero or a vigilante and what separates the two lets not forget about the performances either black panther is incredible in this movie and i left wishing that movie was coming out alot sooner chadwick boseman was a force in this movie and brings a different tone to the avengers spiderman is also amazing for the time that he is in the film as well final act of this movie is great and provides an unexpected emotional weight that will possibly move you from one side of the argument to the other at the end of the day civil war is probably the best film in the mcu no you dont get that same feeling that you got when you first saw the avengers together but it shouldnt that moment can never be replaced but this movie stands shoulder to shoulder with avengers and dark knight as the best superhero movie ever created who would have thought captain america movies would be this amazing as i was the first person to say nobody wants to see a captain america movie he looks ridiculous marvel so far can do no wrong lets just see how doctor strange turns out
Dec 24 2015,positive,this movie was incredible it blew me away with awesome action and amazing performances by the actors i highly recommend it
Dec 24 2015,positive,captain america was what we all wanted this movie was not like the let down of batman vs supermans 8 minute fight scene but for this it was the whole movie you felt the hatred between all the characters and it was difficult to choose a side but this movie is what i was looking for after bvs 5 stars
Dec 23 2015,positive,awesome i really love the addition of this spiderman lots of funnies and heartache for me i would watch it again and again
Dec 23 2015,positive,its just ok which is a disappointment spiderman is amazing sorry for the pun and the big fight is colorful manic entertainment but its never anything more than a skindeep superhero action flick
Dec 23 2015,positive,marvel once again smashes one out of the park in civil war the excellent cast lives up to the hype and the russos direct an even better film than the winter soldier a lot of the action is perfectly shot but some choppiness does occur even though the plot is filled with a lot of dialogue in the middle its all very well scripted and executed once again though the villains in this film are either underused or dont do enough to make them terribly compelling marvel also takes an unexpected darker take on this film than past movies and it works out to be amazing in the end i can say that marvel has not lost the touch that made their debut film iron man a smash hit it may even have improved on its formula
Dec 23 2015,positive,phenomenal movie from start to finish
Dec 23 2015,positive,freakin awesome the best captain america yet
Dec 23 2015,positive,awesome movie great cast and great special effects a little slower paced then most marvel movies and the villain wasnt very strong the action scenes were very well done and spiderman was by far the best part of the movie
Dec 23 2015,positive,fantastic but extremely long
Dec 21 2015,positive,there are not word or i caint think of them to describe how much i loved and enjoyed it the whole entire movie was amazing
Dec 21 2015,positive,much more of an avengers movie than a captain america movie still this is one of the better actionadventure flicks obviously setting the stage for things to come but totally grounded within itself the tension and emotion were excellent and balanced well with the action and cgi it might be worth a second look just to get all the sight gags and oneliners
Dec 21 2015,positive,sure it may not have been comic accurate but i had a blast
Dec 21 2015,positive,one of the best superhero movies
Dec 21 2015,positive,definitely out beat the other avengers captain america
Dec 21 2015,positive,comic book fans and moviegoers that have enjoyed the great aspects of captain america the winter soldier are going to be bombarded with what captain america civil war was able to do with those same aspects making this the greatest marvel cinematic universe film to date
Dec 20 2015,positive,captain america civil war is an absolutely  blast to watch marvel have yet to disappoint with the captain america film franchise as its quickly becoming the staple of how marvel films should aspire to be with amazing scenes that would make any super hero fan happy in end what is there to say just to say fantastic movie probably the best marvel movie yet
Dec 20 2015,positive,spidey done right well done movie heart wrenching at times but still really good
Dec 20 2015,positive,best comic book movie since the dark knight and one of best movies of the 21st century
Dec 20 2015,positive,best superhero movie ever love the struggle of the characters and their relationships they have with themselves and others it makes for interesting plots from here on
Dec 19 2015,positive,this movie was a thrill till the credits
Dec 19 2015,positive,that scene definitely needed to be shirtless
Dec 19 2015,positive,the best movie of the mcu so far
Dec 19 2015,positive,ive been on my own since i was 18 i never really fit in anywhere even in the army my faiths in people i guess individuals and im happy to say that for the most part they havent let me down which is why i cant let them down either  steve rogers teamcap
Dec 19 2015,positive,captain america civil war get even more serious dark and gritty than its predecessor and this proves that marvel is still the one to beat
Dec 19 2015,positive,amazing movie its funny action packed and emotional all wrapped in a burrito of goodness a few minor flaws but other than that it is an awesome theatrical experience cant wait to see t again
Dec 19 2015,positive,the greatest superhero movie ever
Dec 19 2015,positive,strong storyline great actors fantastic story line and unarguably features one of the best fight scenes to feature in a movie
Dec 18 2015,positive,if you like a load of marvel comic book characters fighting each other in cgi youll love civil war personally i found it a little over the top
Dec 18 2015,positive,action packed stunningly epic visually dazzling
Dec 18 2015,positive,great movie it had everything a action adventure movie could have im going to see it again this is only meant to be seen in the theater
Dec 18 2015,negative,its full of plot holes and boring movie
Dec 18 2015,positive,takes notes dc this is how you do a versus movie
Dec 18 2015,positive,best marvel movie sense the avengers guardians of the galaxy and deadpool
Dec 18 2015,positive,highly entertaining well done and substantive
Dec 18 2015,positive,awesome everything batman vs superman shouldve been
Dec 17 2015,positive,excellent movie this film lived up to the hype and more i will be adding this to my collection
Dec 17 2015,positive,only be cause ant man made an appearance and introduction of black panther  its very slow and too much time spent in fight scenes  one more thing chris evans is still fine as ever
Dec 17 2015,positive,the film has great action sequences along with a strong story and interesting characters civil war is great way to end the trilogy of one of marvels most iconic hero
Dec 16 2015,positive,this movie is not just about super heroes fighting it does have some depth to it about friendship with bucky and captain america and conflict between iron man and captain america also best spiderman to be see on the cinema screens and best choreographed action on a marvel movie
Dec 16 2015,positive,this was a must see great action and fighting too bad it was amongst themselves some friends is just hard to let go cant wait to see how the next one will unfold
Dec 16 2015,positive,captain america civil war one of my most anticipated movies of the year and it did not disappoint this movie was fun entertaining and gritty firstly i wasnt looking to forward to spiderman but after watching this i am confident that this is the best representation of peter parker spiderman ever literally everything that comes out of that kids mouth is hilarious antman as youd expect is also very funny and these two characters bring the most laughs the introduction of black panther was also very welcomed and he really is a bad ass and very noble as well also i think this is the most likeable ive seen iron man as he has more emotion and compassion than in previous films there is one fight scene that i wont spoil but it is one of the best sequences in any super hero movie ever look out for that furthermore unlike batman v superman this film didnt spoil the plot in the trailers so i was actually able to be surprised while watching this i guess the villain could of been more compelling but at the end of the day he did his job as superhero movies go this was one of the most enjoyable in the whole of the mcu and it made some gutsy decisions that will change it forever
Dec 16 2015,positive,i just have one word to describe captain america civil war perfect  1010 all characters were amazing    the russo brothers was the best choice and they should run all the mcu    they are magicians thats how you do a superheroes movie i never wanted to finish watching it its a magnificent piece or art     the only advice that i can give to the people is if you will never understand than comics or books movies will never be adapted exactly you will never enjoy any movie based on that you people need to understand that the mcu and de dceu arent the comics exactly adapted to the movies and it will never be like that
Dec 15 2015,positive,sometimes i want to punch you in your perfect teeth    well here we are    finally civil war is here    and my verdictits good but not as amazing as i hoped it would be    the good civil war is two and a half hours long and somehow manages to include all these superheroes with just enough time deserved for each of them and perfect introductions black panther and spidermanwow just wow i dont even want to spoil it they are amazing additions to the mcu and i am sweating to see what they do next what else is good action pieces are on point the airport scene was humourous and spectacularly flashy and what about the narrativewell heres where civil war shines and dims itself at the same time there are some truly great moments of emotional resonance between stark and rodgers you can see similarities between them and how they are fighting uselessly against a greater hidden enemy their biases     but    civil war can get very messy and constricted the showdown is stuffed to the brim with plot points that it does get uncomfortable to a certain degree and i hated that i want to see them fight for a reason and they didand then it deflates into obscurity  they are both clearly passionate heroes and have massive intentions for action there were just some enraging moments where sections of the film seem unfilled with a competent resolutio and other parts where it feels like the scene was unecessary and used to fill time very annoying     overall i am going to give captain america civil war a very generous 75100 for its highly impressive comic book side and a story which is designed to make you feel uneven being done with such impact is a tough thing to pull off but they manage it just about and thats well done    b    75100
Dec 14 2015,positive,someone should film zack snyder watching cap civil war and right at the end go you see thats how its done    funny smart and great action best marvel yet
Dec 14 2015,positive,phenomenal movie everything i wanted from a superhero flick
Dec 14 2015,positive,probably the best superhero movie i have ever seen
Dec 14 2015,positive,the third film of steve rogers is a smart adaptation of one of the most important events of the modern era of marvel comics with a fully appropriate to its own universe own story including new characters that bring much to the table and spectacular action scenes expectations for phase 3 of marvel they are higher than ever we hope not disappoint us    similarly robert downey jr has changed organically in their way of being tony stark this is not the same arrogant stark revealed to be iron man on the tape that opened the mcu everything that has lived has reformed and damaged from the first avengers and iron man 3 we saw more thoughtful and of course all that burst into age of ultron and although it is still the same charismatic guy tony stark has changed and downey jr has managed to achieve with grace    on the side of the action civil war has spectacular sequences that take advantage of both the current film technology such as the powers of all the heroes to shine and make her feel the original in particular the fight of the airport will most likely be remembered for a long time and a reference in action movies will become    it is very clear that anthony and joe russo brothers dominate the spectacular action movie captain america civil war is a taste of what they will do with the two parts of avengers infinity war the event promises to bring together the full mcu    in the end civil war has everything you can expect from a tape of marvel studios in 2016 great visual effects endearing characters sense of humor and clues about what is to come later in other deliveries
Dec 14 2015,positive,everything bvs wasnt civil war juggles so many elements so expertly that you cant help but sit back and admire how well it all works it also has the greatest action sequence of any superhero movie
Dec 14 2015,positive,didnt like the ending of it 
Dec 13 2015,positive,a great movie  spoiler review ahead    each character is more or less given a reason for choosing the side theyre on which is one of if not the most important part of this conflict to me  i personally would have liked more on the reasons which wouldve strengthened and outlined each characters perspective  the new guys black panther and spiderman were fleshed out well though i didnt really see a lot coming from the leaders of either side captain america and iron man in terms of being advocates for their beliefs    the conflict sort of takes a backseat when tony realizes it was all a misunderstanding and bucky was being framed and then goes on his own to help captain and bucky take down whoever was pulling the strings  to be honest i didnt care for the villain in this he kind of just took up screen time that i wouldve enjoyed better watching tony and steve debating or other more important characters being developed  at the end its kind of questionable why the villain only planned to make tony mad because bucky killed his parents and not something a little more elaborate  im not doubting the motivation for tony to snap and turn on bucky i just dont really get how thats a major move in pulling the avengers apart    where this movie works best is in the fight scenes and quips  each superhero has distinct personalities and theyre all shown pretty well  the fight scenes are glorious the big one being when they all kind of throw down  i say kind of because its all focused on whats happening on screen  its sort of like everywhere else is stopped until the camera shows whats going on  for example i would suspect vision would have incapacitatedtaken out several of captains team though its odd because he doesnt do anything until he is on screen  i also wouldve thought scarlet witch wouldve taken out several of iron mans team but she doesnt do anything until shes on screen  it kind of puts in an unrealistic element of having only some stuff happening at once while everyone pretends to fightnot fight until the camera picks them up  dont get me wrong whenever the fighting on screen happens its amazing but i dont get why nothing else happens until the camera goes to whats next    overall a very solid movie and i look forward to the next installment of the mcu
Dec 13 2015,positive,they made spiderman a tool i disbelieve iron man gave him gadgets and a suit to wear
Dec 13 2015,positive,great story about gray area  things arent always black and white
Dec 13 2015,positive,captain america civil war is not only the best captain america movie yet but it may just be at the very top of the marvel cinematic universe due to its emotionally satisfying themes that may seem like extremely high praise so i will explain why i believe that to be true as well as why i think this is the most mature marvel film to date loosely following the events of both captain america the winter solider and avengers age of ultron while still harking back to previous films from this universe this 13th installment in the ever growing marvel cinematic universe follows the team on different paths as they are once again pulled together     opening the film in the past audiences will be given a look into the life of the winter soldier as his character will later have the biggest impact on the story at hand flash forward to the avengers the team is realizing that the events from the past have killed many innocent lives in the process and they must decide whether or not they want to sign the sokovia accords and be restrained by the government and only released when called upon this divides the team stronger than ever before creating friction as to what the right move truly is then arrives the winter soldier still brainwashed bucky causes steve to go after him a fugitive thus sparking the war of family and friendship within the team this is just the basis there are many levels to this picture including the addition of zemo as the side villain    this character served a very pivotal role in my opinion and definitely does not deserve the flack he is receiving daniel bruhl is terrific in everything he is in and he only justified that more with this character without giving anything away his character is involved with the heart of the story and is the reason for many actionsmotivations this review has been very dour so far and that is due to the fact that the entire first act of this film is extremely sad but enjoyably so unlike certain unnamed films this has a very light tone which elevates enough of the somber moments making for a very balanced film throughout     speaking of the light tone the addition of antman and spiderman was absolutely fantastic and needed for this depressing story it is hard to watch the character having to fight each other especially when you have come to love them over the last eight years so it was necessary to include some fun paul rudd is great once again fanboying out just like audiences and his action sequences are nothing short of crowdpleasing that being said spiderman is still the standout here tom holland gets a very solid introduction as to who he is where he has been and how he got his spider abilities the chemistry between peter and tony was masterful and i could not get enough of it spiderman steals the show with his contribution and i can not wait to see more of him in spiderman homecoming next year    within two scenes of meeting black panther they are able to establish his past why he is present and what his motives are as far as siding with iron man goes no he does not have a clear side but that is for specifics that can not be discussed here chadwick boseman is great his action sequences are terrific and the setup for his future film definitely makes me want to check it out it may seem like this review is overly characterdriven but that is exactly what this film is all about developing character in characters you thought you had already known from front to back the excessive amount of layers in this film work in many more ways than one     joe and anthony russo have proven why they are the best thing that  could have ever been added to this universe directing this film with ease bringing on the directors of john wick chad stahelski and david leitch was an incredible idea as the action sequences throughout this entire film are some of the best you will ever lay eyes on in the marvel cinematic universe and i believe that will be a high standard even for avengers infinity war parts 1  2 if for some reason you walk out of this film disappointed i can confidently say that you are crazy to not be blown away by the action throughout this picture especially the incredible air port sequence     captain america civil war is first and foremost a captain america sequel while simultaneously being a great avengers sequel directed brilliantly terrifically performed all around with jawdropping action set pieces and a very raw emotional core after thinking long and hard about it this film is my favorite marvel cinematic universe film to date hands down simply due to the fact that it has the most emotion energy and characters all put into one film satisfyingly captain america civil war is a triumph in every sense of the word absolutely amazing entertainment marvel continues to impress
Dec 12 2015,positive,awesome movie cant wait to see it again better than i ever expected
Dec 12 2015,positive,a many time watcha notsofunny marvel movie excluding spidey exceptionally focused on bromance cap and bucky and a friendship hanging by a thread cap and tony
Dec 11 2015,positive,a bit sluggish setting up the plot in the beginning but overall a emotionally driven action packed blockbuster worth watching in theaters multiple times
Dec 10 2015,positive,the russos return with a worthy successor to the winter soldier  dc would do well to take notice
Dec 10 2015,positive,captain america was pretty awesome i loved the addition of other marvel universe characters and the storyline was very interesting i just felt at times it was a little long
Dec 10 2015,positive,rating 77 out of 10
Dec 10 2015,positive,captain america civil war is not a bad movie by any means directed by joe and anthony russo its a solid entry in the marvel studios collection of films it just simply doesnt quite live up to the standards of its predecessor captain america the winter soldier     the third entry in the captain america franchise certainly has heart tackles interesting themes and ideas and has plenty of avengeronavenger fight scenes but simply put id rather watch the avengers fighting together as opposed to against each other
Dec 10 2015,positive,ok so my overall thoughts   the directors have a style which works for the mcu it worked for the winter soldier and it works here to top their first effort it tops their first effort by being a better  avengers film than age of ultron  yet clearly this is still a captain america film in how the film is focused on his actions   initially the film is a slower burn despite having incredible action sequences that underused crossbones in one sense but also provide a final push towards the sokovian accords  the initial reason captain america becomes hesitant towards government involvement   while first watching there is so much to take in at this point some character motivations seemed a touch muddled  designed to drive them towards conflict in hindsight this is the best balanced plot of the mcu balancing character development with background story and the addition of new characters right up to the final conflict  yet another game changer moving forwards to infinity war  this is a rare blockbuster with sincere heart  something that batman v superman lacked it held themes of family friendship and revenge inside its narrative and slowly unravelled them with great purpose everything from stark showing a machine that provided a therapeutic memory of his past to the crossbones scenes has a purpose in building to the final conclusion in which characters are forced to make crucial moral decisions and with this many characters it is incredibly hard to believe that no character was wasteful  the new characters are the definitive versions of the characters baron zemo is not the zemo from the comics but his development as a non traditional villain with genuine motivations really drives the plot forward i look forward to more from him black panther is someone i have wanted to see forever and he delivers with the most powerful storyline and spideyperfect the old characters unite in perfect fashion tooant man was a highlight as was scarlett witch and visions dynamic   now for the ugly and necessary comparison to batman v superman its interesting to me that both films deal with what superheroes should be allowed to do in a world challenging terrorism and facing further security governance however where dawn of justice has only one film to draw upon civil war relies on several films worth of material and this improves it dramatically  in short civil war is the best mcu film because it draws on twelve films of history and evolves appropriately some say they have a formula but i would instead argue its more of a solid understanding of the creative process and what is loved about their characters  something lacking from dc and fox save deadpool
Dec 10 2015,positive,best of the series and arguably the best super hero movie made
Dec 9 2015,positive,great romp excellent and fun action not quite spoiled by the rather slow and frankly unbelievable break up of the two big men not marvels best but still marvel
Dec 9 2015,positive,hey you people who do not like this movie can you make a movie that is better then this
Dec 9 2015,positive,marvels finest hour and darkest entry yet built on the same assembly line as avengers the action is on assault on your senses the humour is great and the story is about as good as you can expect from a comic book series another strength is the introduction of new characters in this incredible ensemble of super heroes
Dec 8 2015,positive,as good as i hoped it would be
Dec 8 2015,positive,captainamerica 2 winter soldier will always be my all time favourite but 3 civil war is nicely done exciting hilarious emotional and a bit sadteamcap
Dec 8 2015,positive,awesome fight scenes epic capt ironman soldier 3 way fight  the entire movie was 1 big thrill
Dec 6 2015,positive,awesome movie  possibly the best one yet in the marvel cinematic universe   great action compelling story and easily understood character motivations  fun and interesting new characters and keeps us excited for future story developments
Dec 6 2015,positive,the russo brothers have done it again great movie
Dec 5 2015,positive,awesome movie without being overdone none of the characters were really slighted although its hard to see it as a cap movie
Dec 5 2015,positive,what batman vs superman should have been marvel did it again another great addition to captain americas legacy the movie had great especially the airport scene and it had comedic moments that were great the only thing that made the movie suffer was it had a few plot holes other than that it would be considered a masterpiece rate 910
Dec 5 2015,positive,best one yet watch to the end
Dec 5 2015,positive,i believe they made this movie the avengers instead of captain america not bad but not what i expected
Dec 5 2015,positive,this movie was amazing
Dec 4 2015,positive,this is an dynamic movie that fills the role as a follow up to the captain america and avengers films the presentation mystery and action all complement each other for a well rounded story it covers some deep topics vengeance law and order breaking of friendships protecting others for their own good and the consequences of war among the hard stuff disneymarvelrusso bros have excelled at placing just the right amount of humor where its needed at least two characters will have your sides splitting with laughter my biggest negatives were the cursing and intense physiological violence its pg13 but steps carefully around an r rating at times note for kid viewers if youve seen any marvel movie you should know be now therere not meant for little kids parents should be aware that there are multiple closeup death and torture scenes older kids will get excited when heroes use their powers and team up to fight in captain america civil war
Dec 4 2015,positive,hit all the right notes very fun  the perfect summer movie
Dec 4 2015,positive,captain america civil war was excellent black panther debut was fantastic  new spiderman returning didnt thing had enough crossbones  didnt care the way they used baron zemo to many cities it went as well fight scene between steve vs tony was great highly recommended seeing it would of done so just if one avengers no one really cares about was killed off
Dec 4 2015,neutral,tomatometer is totally broken  civil war is a good cbm comic book movie cbms are a world unto themselves cant be graded same as other movies imo  civil war has some good scenes good action and likable characters  not great  spiderman is great but the rest of it is just good story was weak  conflict between cap and iron man was weak and pointless  does not successfully carry the movie  the bad guy in the movie is a real head scratcher  his motivation the end scene how he spoiler kills some super soldiers that are frozen   weak plot motivation and just pointless  highly trumped airport scene was very cool any spiderman scene was a material  overall better than avengers 2 not as good as winter soldier which i give a   update  i watched it again and like it less    related topic  tomatometer is broken 90 doesnt tell truth about this movie  as of today civil war gets 90  batman vs superman 27  from my viewing i would go 90 bvs a 80 for civil war c  bvs has better characters costumes story action conflict drama  i cared about the whole movie didnt want it to end  civil war got long and story was weak i agree with bvs criticisms about lex yes the plot had holes the editing was questionable but in spite of that the characters visuals action was so powerful it easily overcomes that stuff  loved it saw it 5 times own it   civil war i couldnt sit through it a second time  90 vs 27  totally wrong
Dec 4 2015,positive,better than the previous captain america movie and superior to the two avengers movies which wouldnt take much civil war is entertaining yet didnt win me over due to too much time spent talking up all the characters and action pieces with long periods of dialogue at least it was easy to follow all the main players and understand what was going on with each one yet at some point these comic book movies need to rein in the nearly 3 hour runtimes
Dec 4 2015,positive,this was cool better then 2nd avenger
Dec 3 2015,positive,the wait was worth it this movie deserves five star spiderman and antman stole the show cant wait for the next avengers movie
Dec 3 2015,positive,a real exciting movie it kept me on my toes
Dec 3 2015,positive,awesome in imax   best avengers movie yet 
Dec 3 2015,positive,what an outstanding film     best marvel studios film to date 
Dec 3 2015,positive,probably the best movie of the franchise disney continues to  dominate the comic book landscape i think the best part was the introduction of spiderman to the mix at the correct age and character the plot seemed evenly paced and the special effects and fight scenes were beautifully done two big thumbs way up probably going to come to this and the new star wars for top movie of the year
Dec 2 2015,positive,it will be the best marvel movie captain america has fought and brought damage to citys of sokovia new york washington dc he has unlimited power and no supervision captain america is trying to save his friend buckey as well both are very bad to the public thats why iron man is here iron man is no better than bad guys to cap cap doesnt want to fight tony but the time has   come to choose a side someone hurts     warmachine now tonys mad cap         started a war tony was wrong about cap the whole world was wrong about cap choose teamironman or teamcaptainamerica   teamcaptainamerica   scarletwitch  wintersolder  falcon   hawkeye   antman  agent13  teamironman  thevision  blackpanther  warmachine  crossbones   spiderman   baronzemo     whose side are you on
Dec 2 2015,positive,great movie awesome action scenes
Dec 2 2015,positive,a fantastic entry to the marvel universe a mini avengers movie with cap as the centerpiece who is trying to hold the group together ultimately for whats right  there are some really good themes entertained which i loved  there was emotional depth to what was a fantastic action packed film  things like friendship morality anger and doing what is ultimately right at the end of the day    iron man and captain america square off as the avengers comes under fire for recent violence they have cased  cap wants to keep the avengers going without un intervention while iron man thinks things need to change    as always with these movies a dynamic opening scene sets the tables and segues nicely into the themes the movie is shooting for  seeing all the superheroes on different sides was very fun and some of the battle scenes were just plain epic  there were action scenes that gave goosebumps while the story held steady  i liked this better than the winter solider due to the perfect blend of action and story      there were also some pleasant surprises to be seen  fantastic movie that sets up for the future of marvel films  movie also had good humor especially from paul rudds ant man
Dec 2 2015,positive,great ensemble film that showcases a strong story of the breakdown of the frayed bonds between the leading avengers captain america  iron man over the fate of bucky barnes in the wake of captain america winter soldier
Dec 1 2015,positive,with a better premise than most recent marvel efforts and some great thoughtprovoking drama civil war capitalizes on its political and moral dilemma to deliver a solid film that may be the best marvel film so far it adds humor with its abundance of characters and though it does get a little distracted by its massive superhero battle but still maintains its focus on its main characters and conflict
Dec 1 2015,positive,you watching zack snyder because this is how you do a superhero brawl   honestly civil war has 12 superheros while dawn of justice has 3 with 3 more making cameos in footage and it still managed to be a coherent story that made sense  the great thing about civil war is it manages to show you both sides of the argument i mean i was expecting and still am team cap but i was also expecting to just call iron man a dck   but no they do a good job of showing his side of it and theyre both doing what they feel is right    also if youre a spiderman fan youll be happy tom holland is the best spiderman yet hes got that right combination of wit and dorky charm that maguire who was certainly a dork and garfield who very witty just didnt have  some may be wondering shouldnt this technically be avengers 3 and not captain america 3   i disagree cause cap is the one the film focuses on and he is painted to be the protagonist    plus its his friendships with tony starkiron man and bucky barneswinter soldier that are in the forefront   and this has replaced winter soldier as my favorite mcu movie suppose thats a good sign the captain america movies are better each time the first avenger  the winter soldier  civil war   normally for most franchises the opposite occurs lol
Nov 30 2015,positive,easily the best superhero movie of its era but does that make it a good movie overall that im not so sure while the action was fantastic the addition of spider man was great some things seemed to not fit with previous movies   for example   1couldnt wanda just mind control everyone for the big fight scene and stop it before it starts pretty sure she did some of this in avengers 2 2speaking of her how is it that her actions are forgiven in avengers 2 while under evil influence but not winter soldier when hes being mind controlled   3 it only took one or two movies for ironman to be totally okay with the government controlling him in both iron man 2 and avengers 2 he seemed to refuse to give up control of his tech i guess we are supposed to believe this is him growing even though hes the same arrogant stubborn child about everything else
Nov 29 2015,positive,iron man stay downfinal warning  cap i can do this all day    theirs always been those types of marvel movies that are outstanding in action and story telling this marvel movie is truly that walking into this movie i was so excited about it i knew if had to good because of the rotten tomatoes score on it and my expectations are correct this is truly the avengers movie we should have had this movie nails it with no only the story but with action spiderman and heck even antman does awesome in this movie this is a truly terrific marvel movie and if you have not seen it you are missing out
Nov 29 2015,positive,another great captain america movie by the russo brothers
Nov 29 2015,positive,a little bit slow at first but then kick ass
Nov 29 2015,neutral,i was not impressed i really was expecting much better but this is not as good as the other capt america  besides of the fact having new characters movie was lack of excitement too bad
Nov 28 2015,positive,warning this review contains possible major spoilers id advise you not to read this until youve seen this movie anyways hell yeah captain america civil war is another great example of how the marvel cinematic universe is perfectly progressing with many great films in their library such as this one this is more than just captain america vs iron man but its a movie that tells the story about the government officials want to but a law on the use of the avengers superpowers due to the amount of death and destruction in the process of them stoping villains like loki or ultron on one hand you have tony stark who feels that this is a good idea and supports this idea and on the other you have steve rogers who rejects this idea which slowly but eventually leads the avengers to split apart meanwhile steve rogers is trying to protect his friend bucky the winter soldier from being prosecuted and taken in for his acts and crimes against the people and this along with the disagreement on the governments new law causes a civil war between the avengers this story can be pretty hard to execute for a movie but since this is marvel were talking about they know how to get the job done perfectly along with a great cast and some awesome action scenes captain america civil war perfectly kicks off phase 3 of the mcu and i can only imagine what awesome films they have to offer in the next coming year ps team cap
Nov 28 2015,positive,great movie overall thematic elements play well with the individual actors and their strengths great addition to a franchise that just keeps getting better
Nov 28 2015,positive,it was great wanted to see better
Nov 27 2015,positive,mind blowing if your looking for action this is your film
Nov 27 2015,positive,okaythis is definitely a movie that needs to be seen multiple timesto full appreciateand once fully appreciatedit is one of those very few movies which deliver things that fans wan at the same time making everything seem purposefullthe movie had alot of depthand the ending is one of  if not the best ending in any superhero film everthe characters were amazingblack panther was flawless spiderman was fantastic antman was mindblowing and every heros were off the chainsthe final fight was in everyway a scene that we feel emotionally investedtheis movie like winter soldier had the uncommon balance of plot and drama humor and seriousness character development and actionwhich so many movies lacki think this is the best superhero movie to dateand hands down one of the best comic book movies of all timetop 3 for surethe script was one of the best in the comic book movie genreand everything felt in placethere are of course some barely noticable flawsafter a deep thinkingbut what movie isnt without flawsand surprisingly the villain was greatand he was excelent compared to the typical marvel villainshis motivations were crystal clear as were everyone elses motivationsand so overall i put my hands down and give this movie a 1010as i gave it to winter soldier alsoand as much as i loved winter soldier and civil wari would definitely say that civil war is better than winter soldier but not by a long waybut by a few small steps
Nov 26 2015,positive,very entertaining if superhero movies are your type of thing one of the better marvel universe films with an ensemble cast of likable characters
Nov 26 2015,positive,this movie was fantastic
Nov 26 2015,positive,thought it would have more action
Nov 25 2015,positive,this movie is excellent the whole movie is about the government pushing for an antihero registry act backed by tony stark aka ironman but steve rogers aka captain america believes that saving the world is daring enough and cannot rely on the government to protect by world
Nov 25 2015,positive,i think this is the best mcu film that i have seen to date spiderman black panther and antman shine throughout this film the conflict in this film is real instead of just a guy and an alien hating each other for dumb reasons
Nov 25 2015,positive,easily one of the top 3 mcu films todate wow
Nov 25 2015,positive,all the people who are giving this movie shit reviews because they wished that bvs success was better stop no one payed critics because this movie is fantastic all the characters get a good amount of time the spidey and panther are great the story is good and it has some of the best action in a superhero film the only thing i could say negative wise was that the villain wasnt that great and i was really excited for zemo
Nov 25 2015,positive,great story amazing action worth a repeat
Nov 25 2015,positive,phase 3 starts with one of the best films in the mcu to date it is basically marvels version of bvs and even the writers said the civil war movie only exists because of bvs but civil wars tone is so much lighter for the kids thanks again disneynot adding spiderman and black panther who both make great first impressions and fit perfectly almost instantly into the mcu just a shame one line from vision completely ruined the timeline and now doesnt make sense the plot was very good but again it was like bvs in more ways than people realise i was worried with the amount of superheroes on show it would get over crowded but they all had enough screen time and they also have one of the best comic action scenes to date but most of the humour during this epic fight did ruin it in a way as we know no one is going to get killed off thanks to the whole tone of the scene the effects were brilliant yet again i cant comment on the 3d as i watched the 2d version but its not really essential theres some pretty good shocks and moments no one would see coming which all work well the whole plot of the film eventually comes unraveled and just when we think its going to be a huge showdown it flips it on its head but another epic fight between iron man the winter soldier and captain america makes up for it theres a few plot holes in the story but it all made sense if you dont look too far into it although its like bvs more than you think this this film gets more praise for some reason because the tone is so much lighter and appeals to more people dceu is for hardcore comic fans marvel films are popcorn flicks made for the casual audience i know im talking about bvs allot but they are so similar and bvs got slated
Nov 25 2015,positive,best captain america movie yet
Nov 25 2015,positive,phenomenal period best marvel movie to date
Nov 25 2015,positive,yayyyyyy captain america civil war is fun and a truly entertaining film it tells a great story with compelling characters who share different political views causing them to go at odds at each other and it actually works thanks to previous installments that set up the characters for each and new movie that told a unique story about themselves marvel was able to have each character acquire enough amount of screen time getting across their motivations without feeling underdeveloped nice job    the film has nice visual effects it has engaging characters that share chemistry and it has good choreographed action thats a joy to watch its great film definitely check it out    oh and marvel studios version of spiderman is not only cool but is incredibly dorky and witty like the comics but hey marvel knows their characters better then anyone we all knew theyd get him right    marvel you did it again     910
Nov 25 2015,positive,action packed and surprisingly nimble considering the number of characters being shoehorned and a slightly melodramatic tone does raise the question whether the next avengers movies will prove too clunky to ever work
Nov 25 2015,positive,another great movie from marvel the fight scenes are excellent and the story is good as well worth watching
Nov 24 2015,positive,i think this new spiderman is right for the job
Nov 24 2015,positive,so far the bet super heroes movie out there for the full experience please watch iron man or the incredible hulk
Nov 23 2015,positive,super freaking awesome
Nov 23 2015,positive,great action and character use weird and awkward story line
Nov 22 2015,positive,captain america is a bad ass and hes played so well by evans im not a huge iron man fan and i find batman boring but ive always been a sucker for captain america and superman real superheroes if you ask me
Nov 22 2015,positive,good but not the best captain america movie
Nov 22 2015,positive,this movie is awesome its the best marvel movie yet
Nov 22 2015,positive,this is the most incredible imax 3d experience i have ever witnessed another superb epic and a comic book triumph there are some parts i could not take my eyes off of moments that will be emotional to fans and this very film will be the one fans have been waiting to see and as always go team captain americateam captain america
Nov 22 2015,positive,i dont normally like marvel but this was really good
Nov 21 2015,positive,a serious story with only good occasional laughter civil war is one of marvels best movies to date
Nov 21 2015,positive,darn near perfect   minor gripes   during battle scenes the whole sorry im not really against you but im against you let them fight  no decent villain again they do get away with it  no consequences no trimming the fat what did aaron taylor do to pss off the powers that be just when its perfectly set up for someone to hit the end of the rhode marvel pulls its punch
Nov 21 2015,positive,undoubtedly the perfect mix of everything superhero first movie where i looked forward to the dialogue scenes vs the action cap kicks so much ass  russo brothers have mastered the comic book movie these critics who are throwing out rotten ratings are click bait   marvel movies ranked  civil war  the avengers  captain america winter soldier  iron man  guardians of the galaxy  the avengers age of ultron  antman  captain america the first avenger  thor the dark world  iron man 3  iron man 2  thor  the incredible hulk yawn
Nov 21 2015,positive,always teamironman âï
Nov 20 2015,positive,marvel accomplishes yet again what dc wishes it could perfectly paced amazing confrontation of themes one of the best
Nov 20 2015,positive,this is batman vs superman done right you understand every character the action is tons of fun the stakes actually matter even though theyre intimate to the characters rather than world ending very well done
Nov 20 2015,positive,great  cant wait for more
Nov 20 2015,positive,the russo brothers bring the most mature marvel movie to date characters are wonderful and their actions are completely justified i cant wait to see whats next i loved this movie
Nov 19 2015,positive,while enjoyable i thought batman v superman was dramatically and visually a far superior movie in civil war you knew none of the avengers were really going to get hurt and war machine doesnt count he is a b squad avenger scarlett witch was the most realistic character acting wise spiderman was shoe horned in at the last minute and it was obvious 3 stars
Nov 19 2015,positive,quite possibly the best marvel movie yet right up there with avengers and guardians of the galaxy spidey steals the show
Nov 19 2015,positive,greatest marvel movie of all time spiderman was amazing and just overall the humor and all of it was just perfect a must see
Nov 19 2015,positive,hands down the best marvel film it definitely makes up for the divided opinions from avengers 2 civil war is more serious and gritty than all of the marvel films while keeping the humor that we all come to expect the avengers have been divided up due to the fact that the government doesnt feel that the avengers shouldnt be a private group therefore the plan is to have the avengers setup as a task force for the un captain america doesnt appreciate the idea of being exploited by the government therefore he disbands along with his allies iron man supports the government plan due to the mistakes of the past the backstory of the winter soldier is somewhat the focus of this film  civil war is pretty much avengers 3 sans thor and hulk the film plays out as if it would be the last marvel film this film goes out with introducing new characters and bringing along beloved superheroes if avengers was the film we all dreamed of civil war takes it a step further the battle between team cap and iron man is one of the best action sequences in superhero film history the russo brothers did a good job with winter soldier civil war has proved them to be worthy successors of joss whedon theyre really good at translating the comics to film great sequences that span across the globe the film is chocked full with effective drama and tension during the battle of iron man cap and the winter soldier it really feels like one of the heroes was going to die  the black panther is badass during the first fight sequence when we are introduced to the character  the ruthless winter soldier has met his match bozeman did a great job of bringing this highly anticipated hero to life and spidermanwith sony constantly revamping the franchise to bring a crowd pleasing adaptation this incarnation of the webslinger should let sony know that they should just revert the rights tom holland did an excellent job and i look forward to his new film his spiderman is funny and annoying but in a good youthful way paul rudd once again does a great job as antman its funny seeing the character in this film who has to assist in the battle while at the same time surprised to be fighting alongside and against the avengers  out of all of the villains in the marvel cinematic universe daniel bruhl does a great job as zemo while his character does not posses the superhero strength or power of the latter his hunger for revenge makes him powerful bruhls portrayal of the villain adds a layer of maturity to the film as zemo has lost his family in the battle from avengers 2 he concocts a plan to destroy the avengers from within zemo is not seeking dominance over the world or trying to become an all powerful supreme being his character is focused on destroying the avengers to avenge the deaths of his loved ones this was a great idea amongst the filmmakers  this film is a breath of fresh air to cover up the stink from batman v superman both films focused on the casualties of battle and how it affects our heroes however the ultra serious tone in bvs failed to produce the same effect of civil war the build up worked in favor of this film due to the lead up yes the sequences in new york dc and sorkovia were spectacular however people have died during those battles this film is focused on the negative backlash from those prior films therefore villains and negative perceptions  arise from said conflicts ones hero may be perceived as the enemy this film explores that to the fullest which is why a film like bvs that was so focused on being an adult philosophical look at superheroes failed civil war allow us the audience to understand the views of the heroes and villains we can understand the actions of the villains and why they feel that said actions are justified when compared to dc marvel is seen as playful and lighthearted however when it comes to films tackling the subject of different perspectives amongst our superheroes civil war knocks it out the park
Nov 19 2015,positive,quick review of civil war it was epic jarring and wonderful all at the same time and yes spidey steals the show
Nov 18 2015,positive,great movie want to see it again
Nov 18 2015,positive,spiderman is in tha house
Nov 18 2015,positive,cant get enough of this franchise visually amazing funny fun and great characters
Nov 16 2015,positive,my fav of the series yet a must see
Nov 15 2015,positive,its definitely not flawless but neither are the characters this movie had my heart pumping from start to finish i was never once bored during this film
Nov 15 2015,positive,marvel and its cinematic universe seem to be a powerhouse at the moment they are on fire having said that ill start with the issues the cuts in the opening fight scene is a little slap dash and borders on using too much shaky cam but that doesnt ruin the overall enjoyment of the film also the main villain zemo is underdeveloped and his main storyline is a little flimsy now lets move onto the positives everything else this is how you do a massive ensemble film what joss whedon set as standard for avengers the russo brothers take it onto a new level yes not all the characters get a lot of screen time this is after all a captain america film not avengers 25 so they are in the background a lot the action scenes are brilliant the all star superhero fight at the abandoned airport is a standout with a lot of surprises and easter eggs if you are a comic book geek the newcomers black panther and of course spiderman steal the film in every scene they are in take note sony that is how you do spiderman properly and as we wont be getting another origin story for his solo film in a few years time story wise i wont go into anything as itll spoil it for you but there are a few things you will probably guess correctly before they happen but again it doesnt ruin the enjoyment civil war is one of the most epic comic book storylines but dont expect that level in this film as it has to fit in with the mcu and it does it in a fitting way both sides of the argument are voiced brilliantly and your loyalty does sway during the film i cannot wait for the next films in phase 3 this is a good time to be a marvel fan
Nov 15 2015,positive,captain america civil war takes its first real serious plot and makes an all around entertaining comic book film while also still having its clever heart and humor that the previous films had but still satisfies its fanbase
Nov 15 2015,positive,how a serious superhero movie should be exceeded winter solider as the best marvel offering in the mcu
Nov 14 2015,positive,reasons behind the schism are hard to buy into despite the title this should have been a de facto avengers 3 yet felt like an extended cut of winter soldier with random black pantherspiderman tieins  action is great though despite an underwhelming climax
Nov 14 2015,positive,amazing this captain america even surpasses the superb winter soldier full of dazzling action and resonant emotion
Nov 14 2015,positive,well the summer movie season is finally under way and what better way to start it off with yet another superhero movie this was my most anticipated movie of the year weve had two of these movies already and both have really impressed me it was also going to feel more like an avengers movie but instead having thor and hulk as part of the ensemble we have black panther antman and spiderman and they will be battling against each other in a civil war oh boy was i pumped for this movie just like everyone else    it would be pretty difficult for them top something like the winter soldier which is my favorite mcu movie they did pretty much everything right with it but after watching this movie im honestly not so sure which film is better now captain america civil war was amazing i cant believe how much these films continue to impress me this is the movie that shouldve been batman v superman like its predecessor there are some big similarities with the dc comics film that came out before it this film also follows a conflict between superheroes who are realizing the fact that theyve been unintentionally killing many civilians and the government wants to put an end to it im starting to get the feeling that marvel seems to be learning a lot of mistakes from dc unlike batman v superman there is so much more meaning behind the situation i understand what theyre going through and i can easily can get behind their motivations because theyre so clear both steve rogers and tony stark make very legitimate points as to what they think should be done and its so interesting seeing these two conflicting with each other which would ultimately lead to a battle the conflict gets even more intense when the winter soldier bucky gets involved stark is against him but rogers is defending him and for good reason he had saved his life from the last film and they were once very close friends but stark is rogers friend too so youre really wondering whose side he should choose now that is great conflict    i dont usually do this with a new released film but theres a scene that i want to talk about and its going to be giving a lot away so if you havent seen the movie yet and you dont want to know what happens skip to the next paragraph major spoiler alert towards the very end of the film they show a huge revelation to tony stark we know that his parents were killed in a car crash but we dont know who caused it here they show that it was bucky who killed them but whats even more shocking is that captain america was already aware of it you really feel the rage that stark is feeling he was with the person that killed his parents through the whole film without even knowing and he also felt betrayed that his friend never told him about it youre just waiting for stark to lose it and go in for the kill but its totally understandable but rogers wont let stark kill his friend and so the three of them fight each other after that very intense and brutal fight between them captain america ends up defeating stark by penetrating his chest plate and disables his armor which is what keeps him alive i thought for a second that captain america may have actually killed iron man buti guess not for some reason stark says to rogers that his parents made that shield and that rogers doesnt deserve it realizing he made a valid statement rogers leaves his shield behind with stark i mean wow what a powerful scene everything makes sense you understand everything thats happening the motivations are perfectly clear and you really feel something for these characters    this movie couldve easily been a convoluted mess with introducing new characters into the ensemble like antman black panther and even spiderman you would think that it would just be another avengers movie with all these characters in one film but as it should it mainly focuses on captain americas side but each of these new characters were perfectly set up in the film and all seem to have some sort of purpose it was so cool to see all of the comic book heroes on the big screen fight each other the part where they battle at the airport was one of the most entertainingly fun action scenes ive seen in a comic book movie or maybe in any movie it makes me so excited to see these characters in their own films    let me talk about spiderman for a little bit he is actually my favorite comic book character of all time and the portrayal of this character is outstanding in this film with just a couple scenes we learn virtually everything there is to know about the origin of spiderman we didnt need to see another whole movie to tell us his origin again you completely understand his character in just a couple of scenes that is excellent writing every moment hes on screen both as spiderman and peter parker just put a huge eartoear smile on my face i thought that tobey maguires spidermanpeter parker would always be my favorite but after seeing tom hollands performance he might actually be my new favorite incarnation of the hero he was everything that peter parkerspiderman should be and hes not some actor in his mid20s playing a teenager hes actually a teenager playing peter parkerspiderman that is so refreshing to see i cant even begin to tell you how happy i am to see spiderman as part of the mcu and how excited i am to see him in his standalone film    is there anything in this movie at all that keeps it from being a perfect comic book movie well yes i do have a couple of issues one is the main villain this is a movie where you didnt need a villain the conflict is between the ensemble and should stay focused on them overall he didnt really have any significant point to be in the film anyway he almost couldve been left out of the film entirely and one other thing is that at the end after we see some of the heroes almost beaten to death they seem to have recovered fine already i thought maybe at least one of them would die especially since how intense and serious the action has gotten it just seemed like nothing really happened but thats literally the last few minutes of the movie    its weird that the one superhero who would seem the least interesting has had some of the best movies in the mcu they knew what to do to make this character interesting and it really delivers after we saw how great the winter soldier was i didnt think marvel could top it but with civil war when i come to think of it may actually be my new favorite mcu movie to date i honestly cant believe how great this film is is it perfect not exactly but its pretty close they just put in so much meaning and intelligence to this one and its executed so well id say go see it but lets face it you probably already have you know what just go watch it again i know im going to    oh in case you were wondering im rooting for team cap    grade a
Nov 13 2015,positive,lots going on throughout the movie just sit back and enjoy
Nov 12 2015,positive,really fun actioncomic book movie  loads of good action nice pacing lots of funny moments marvel has become a master at sprinkling throughout its action sequences best live action spiderman  hard to buy into the villain though  the climax had me on the edge of my seat too  definitely worth checking out while in theaters
Nov 12 2015,positive,so much better than ultron the cap movies never disappoint highly recommend this one for the diehard and casual fan
Nov 12 2015,positive,some interesting new characters good effects and a few good jokes a little long for my liking and the fast action fight scenes just dont work in 3d the frames are jittery and out of sync but its still a fun movie
Nov 12 2015,positive,quite possibly the best marvel so far  hands down
Nov 11 2015,positive,the story starts kinda slow then all in a sudden it becomes explosive hilarious and exciting
Nov 11 2015,positive,so many parts that make this whole movie great
Nov 10 2015,positive,they did almost everything right they should have waited till after sony made their decision about spiderman because spiderman could have gotten a bigger part
Nov 9 2015,positive,i loved the winter soldier its probably my favorite marvel movie and one of my favorite superhero moviesperiod so i was beyond excited for this but i was left semidisappointed i still dont know what but it felt like there was something missing marvelthe avengers are great at witty banter back and forth between characters but the many attempts at jokes fell pretty flat for me except for antman i am even more excited for his next movie there are many powerful moments and the last 45 minutes are awesomeintense dont get me wrong i really enjoyed civil war its a good time at the movies but with the high expectations after winter soldier and cw basically being avengers 3 i was left wanting more
Nov 9 2015,positive,better avengers movie than ultron spider man ruled villian motivation weird and uninteresting dialogue better than the past 2 marvel movies 2 post credit scenes
Nov 9 2015,positive,loved this movie they did a great job with the story line took my kids ages 5 and 8 and husband to see it for mothers day and we all loved it would definitely recommend seeing it
Nov 8 2015,positive,a must see action packed movie long as hell though but worth it
Nov 8 2015,positive,the russo brothers are writing history with their take on super hero movies they created a flawless flow throughout the movie and did a perfect job of building nonstop tension between the avengers team i got to say too that spiderman and black panther fit into the story perfectly tom holland is by far the best on screen spiderman to date and chadwick boseman is a total bad ass as black panther the russo brothers flawlessly created the perfect clash between super hero movies this movie is everything batman v superman should have been
Nov 8 2015,positive,i can see the great story strong cast and confident direction yet i cant help but feel ive seen this formula before and more than once
Nov 8 2015,positive,this was epicthe definition of epic movies is made to define this particular oneit was greatso emotionalso painfulmt babies fighting each other was really painful to watchthe amazing direction made everything even harder to watchsteve and tony are actually the ones that are against each otherand it all started with buckyit really ruined me emotionallyi still cant pull myself together or control my emotionsmany twiststhe ending just killed me and really i just cant turn my head away from marvelwhich little by little manages to grasp my attention and now owns my heartperhaps the greatest superhero movie ever made
Nov 8 2015,positive,once again marvel proves that louder does not mean better its about time the dcu got with the program teammcu
Nov 8 2015,positive,its freaking incredible its so remarkably well done so much fun and so worth seeing as many times as possible the action was the best in any marvel movie the emotional buildup was intense and satisfying  and it has a great plot and great dialogue the disagreement between the two teams was well laid out and you believed it spiderman was spectacular black panther is wonderful antman has some great scenes and everyone else is simply awesome i cant say yet where it falls in my all time comic book movies but it will be close to the top
Nov 7 2015,positive,best marvel movie since iron man
Nov 7 2015,positive,best one yet love the new characters airport scene is amazing
Nov 7 2015,positive,watch all the marvel movies before you watch this one its to die for
Nov 7 2015,positive,i loved it so much i went back a saw it again and it was even better
Nov 6 2015,positive,the cap movies are the only mcu that are consistently great standing on their own
Nov 6 2015,positive,as always love marvel but it should of been named an avengers movie instead of captain america
Nov 6 2015,positive,probably the best avenger movie so far
Nov 6 2015,positive,its just a great movie full with action and emotions
Nov 5 2015,positive,people with land on either side team cap or team iron man i personally sided with iron man overall this film is up there with winter soldier as quite possibly the best marvel movie to date
Nov 5 2015,positive,it was pretty legit but wayyyyyyyyyyy over hyped it had me expecting a little more
Nov 5 2015,positive,the best marvel ever made so far all the characters were great and the story will never end
Nov 4 2015,positive,the best marvel movie yet youve gotta catch this in theaters more than once
Nov 4 2015,positive,great movie full of action a bunch of battles
Nov 4 2015,negative,this movie was poorly put together it was awful who wants to see the avengers turn on each other total nonsense and corny im so disappointed i expected so much from this movie i dont know what movie everyone else saw because this movie really sucked
Nov 3 2015,positive,fast paced with a few holes in the plot but well done
Nov 2 2015,positive,teamcap down with the accords spiderman will return
Nov 2 2015,positive,one of the best comic book films made civil war pits characters weve known for years against each other mainly by their own personal objectives never overly heavyhanded this film breezes along to an amazing battle scene and a more impactful end fight
Nov 2 2015,positive,first off i just wanted to say i liked this movie it was very well written and the cast and crew did an amazing job making this film secondly the newer cast did amazing antman and spiderman are really funny but i gotta say from what i was expecting from the comic this movie fell a little short i still liked it but didnt love it like how i did with captain america the winter soldier
Nov 1 2015,positive,was pretty good also spiderman was awesome and funny  14
Nov 1 2015,positive,great movie very entertaining and fun to watch
Nov 1 2015,positive,great movie and action go see it
Nov 1 2015,negative,pretty boring  snooze
Nov 1 2015,positive,wow thats all i got
Oct 31 2015,positive,i was really excited to see this  the flashbacks and all were ok the early action scenes were regurgitated scenes just to kill some civilians off the story isnt believable all of a sudden the world wants to lock them down  ironman becomes the crusader of world legislature  civil war no one is fighting to kill anyone in this movie  just some fancy one upping each other pretty basic movie
Oct 31 2015,positive,this is by far the best marvel movie to date spiderman was awesome a great superhero trilogy
Oct 31 2015,positive,i finally got to see this one tonight and it was really good  though not as good as winter soldier it held its own but it was more like an avengers sequel than a captain america one  this movie is not without its problems  i didnt like the zemo villain at all captain america has so many good villains like red skull and pierce but to turn the avengers against each using the winter soldier wasnt like the zemo on the comics  plus crossbones wasnt in it long enough and i didnt like the way the character went out  second i thought they shouldve killed off a few of the heroes the one thing about the heroes is that they can always be resurrected so maybe rhodes or hawkeye or even cap couldve been killed off and been resurrected in the next movie the pluses in this movie was the addition of spider man and black panther  panther was bad ass and i cant wait for his movie  spiderman was cool too and so was antmangiantman  i loved tony starks role in this movie he is always the more rebellious one and this time hes more of the protagonist in this one  there is a lot of back story for him and his parts in this movie deliver  we really need another iron man movie because i never tire of robert downey jr  he was cool and i cant wait for his next movie  all in all its worthy of another billion dollar entry of the marvel universe and im sure there will be more to come with xmen and dr strange
Oct 31 2015,positive,it was a greatest marvel superhero movie ever of captain america civil war
Oct 30 2015,positive,from the preview i didnt really expect much from this movie when i saw it i absolutely loved it one of the best mcu this far
Oct 30 2015,positive,to be perfectly honest marvel is on point with all the new movies and the universe hopefully dc will follow suit no hate just to be a happy fan oh what a time to be alive
Oct 29 2015,neutral,burnt out on these characters and loud random punching
Oct 29 2015,positive,great movie cause usually most movies with superheroes fighting each other most likes fails but civil war great and funny but they have more scenes at end and after the credits its with every marvel movie
Oct 29 2015,positive,thoroughly enjoyed civil war loved all the action and spiderman was superb cant wait for homecoming
Oct 29 2015,positive,granted im a bit bias due to my love of superhero movies but i loved this movie it was two and a half hours which is longer than any other movie in marvels current story arch but it didnt feel like there was any part that was droning on or wasnt necessary the movie was exciting throughout and there were a lot of cool fight scenes if youre a fan of the other marvel movies youll probably enjoy this one too keep in mind however it is the darker portion of the story arch but they do a good job of keeping the characters lovable while also showing the darker conflict
Oct 29 2015,negative,its just another marvel movie
Oct 28 2015,positive,as great as advertised
Oct 28 2015,positive,captain america civil war is the russo bros attempt to top their first captain america sequel winter soldier and wow do they deliver again civil war is not quite up there with tws but the directors proof they can work extremely well with ensamble casts as they give just the right amount of screentime to a ton of characters and still manage to make an extremely intriguing story whos central character is clearly cap and his relation to bucky it pushes the limits in action and specual effects and superbly introduces us to spiderman and black panther who deliver just as amazing acting jobs as the main cast we know and love
Oct 27 2015,positive,awesome but i didnt like it when zemos origin story
Oct 27 2015,positive,traditionally the larger the ensemble in a superhero movie the more prone for error it is  spider man 3 for example loaded itself with way too much and proved burdensome to watch  civil war on the other hand shows exactly how to put a lot of characters on screen give all of them time and not feel like the film is an endless series of bounces from scene to scene or a burden to keep track of  we start with a lot of guys we add a few more and it just seems to fly along hitting home runs with both its action sequences and its reallife feeling plot  civil war brings the classic comic storyline to the big screen in a very different way than it played out originally  the casualties in the comic were in fact much greater than those given on screen and it was not an international incident  but the way things play out here it is retold perfectly with the exact right touch that brings black panther into things without it seeming forced  the heroes ideologies show early on and we see that this is a moral interpretive disagreement as much as anything and that is a great way to keep our empathy on board with everyone whether we choose sides or not  the action as with all marvel movies is fantastic  it is not an exaggeration to state that the sequence in the airport is the greatest superhero fight ever put on film  the characters are all over it the stakes are high and as is integral they hit the mark with some humor to keep things on a fun playing field  a review of this film cant go without talking about spider man who finally winds his way into the mcu and after there now having been three actors playing him finally is characterized in the perfect way  just a bit insecure smarmy and nerdy all in one package that can kick ass without breaking a sweat  tom holland was a good choice and the writers nailed it  the best part of this film is that it leaves a lot of threads hanging for the future installments that are due in the next few years  phase 3 has been laid out and it is clear to see a number of the paths that the universe will be taking as it moves towards infinity war  the russos have once again captured marvels essence telling a terrific story grounded in character with the perfect amount of humor alongside action that works at breakneck speed taking the superhero movie to its next level  the next film will have a lofty standard to live up to
Oct 27 2015,positive,hands down one of the if not the best thus far in the mcu film series well written directed and the fight scenes were incredible the movie felt raw with emotion and maturity
Oct 26 2015,positive,i love it its amazing
Oct 26 2015,positive,who would have thought that after the first captain america movie that the next two would be the best movies in the marvel universe this movie incorporates everything thats happened so far excellent job introducing new characters as someone else put it that was the shortest 25 hour movie ive seen
Oct 26 2015,positive,words cannot describe how great this was definitely a must see
Oct 26 2015,positive,cap fights back in civil war this was movie was god
Oct 26 2015,positive,excellent movie lots of sub plots and side stories introducing several new characters even with all this going on the movie still flows nicely and hardley slows down
Oct 26 2015,positive,teamiron teamspiderman me encantoooooo
Oct 25 2015,positive,packs nowhere near the emotional punch of either winter soldier or first avenger but an entertaining if meandering superhero teamup movie overall the highlight for me was getting to see tom hollands spiderman the kid completely blew me away also seeing anthony mackie and sebastian stan interact oneonone was hysterical
Oct 25 2015,positive,the best super hero movie that ive seen yet
Oct 25 2015,positive,love it i mean wow
Oct 25 2015,positive,awesome action  plot had holes  overall fun movie but felt like someyhing was missing  also had a weak ending without any kind of resolution
Oct 25 2015,positive,captain america civil war successfully pulls off the balancing act of being both actionpacked and emotionallycharged its a wonderful spectacle that doesnt shy away from heavier themes but also never lets you forget that this is a superhero flick and therefore its supposed to be fun all the actors in the film new and returning deliver topnotch performances
Oct 25 2015,positive,this movie was extremely good it lived up to the hype and was super exciting to watch i would recommend that everybody watches this movie the actions is incredible and the story is incredible too go see this movie
Oct 24 2015,positive,all these new super hero movies with the added in super heroes are all basically the same now you have some sort of issue and the all of a sudden everyone comes in fighting each other you have some smileable one liners a couple hours and a half with your butt in a seat and you go home entertaining to some point but the people up and down the stairs to the bathroom easily distracted me from the story line i still enjoy the chill of the movies on the oh screen though the magic lives on
Oct 24 2015,positive,top to bottom this film is amazing the directing acting stunts the russos do it again  the film is so emotional and but still so much fun   chris evans has been brilliant as captain america and he took it to another level in this film and downey was great too you could really see both sides of the argument  i cant wait for what the russos do with the next avengers films
Oct 24 2015,positive,awesome movie one of the best marvel movies
Oct 24 2015,positive,thoroughly satisfying despite the enormous expectations the best parts of the movie are when spiderman and antman are on screen     works really well as the center piece of the future mcu as well tying all previous movies in to a nice little bow     the movie comes second only to the avengers and guardians of the galaxy
Oct 24 2015,positive,loved this movie an awesome addition to the mcu favorite character is winter soldier
Oct 24 2015,positive,everything is good the best way to start phase 3
Oct 24 2015,positive,great movie dont even feel the 2 hours of action from beginning to end of the film
Oct 23 2015,positive,so amazing blew me away great balance of action story and comedy marvel delivers again
Oct 23 2015,positive,captain american civil war is a blockbuster smash thanks to the direction by anthony and joe russo this time around team captain american duke it out with team iron man on whether or not superheroes and shield should be limited and controlled by a governing body after it is proven all the damage they cause and the lives they take    theres a perfect blend of storytelling and incredible action sequences that explore the deeper beliefs of our beloved superheroes and while theres plenty of captain american and iron man present there is also a proper amount of time dedicated to exploring the newer characters like black panther and spiderman
Oct 23 2015,positive,you go captain another great movie
Oct 23 2015,positive,this movie is a movie you want to watch 25 times its that goodand personally its my favourite movie and super hero movie ever madethe russo brothers did a great job putting together such a highly anticipated movieeveryone had their moments and the story was awesome and the way they put it in the movie was spectacular
Oct 23 2015,positive,was fine but just seemed an excuse to have all the characters beat the snot out of each other for no good reason
Oct 23 2015,positive,definitely a fullride adventure it is not the best marvel movies but it produces such thematic flow regarding friendship and order
Oct 21 2015,positive,better than dawn of justice by far
Oct 21 2015,positive,in the hitandmiss track record of the marvel universe this is a gem
Oct 21 2015,positive,i can easily say this is marvels best movie is has great characters fantastic chemistry and some of the best fight scenes of all time it has a great soundtrack and i think they finally found the definitive spiderman
Oct 20 2015,positive,entertaining but a bit predictable the giant ant man stunt was just stupid
Oct 20 2015,positive,it has all the action giggles and personalities from your favourite characters to make this mpvie amazing however there was something missing to make the movie seem meh
Oct 19 2015,positive,take notes dc  this is how you develop a plot and characters while including exhilarating action sequences and uniting a universe  the leaders at the center of the conflict captain america chris evans and ironman robert downey jr arrive at their quarrel in the fulfilling and natural way  rest of the cast was great with particular kudos going to the new members of the mcu spiderman tom holland and black panther chadwick boseman  edges out winter soldier to become my favorite marvel film to date 55
Oct 18 2015,positive,thank god for spiderman and ant man this was cliched to the max and just boring why does captain america just have so much trust in bucky its cause he loves him come on marvel just let them come out as gay lovers 
Oct 18 2015,positive,solid movie lots of feeder information for the rest of phase 3
Oct 18 2015,positive,in top 3 marvel movies everi guess dark knight will always be the pinnacle of super hero movies but this was pretty great
Oct 18 2015,positive,enjoyable fun divergent from novel in many ways but a good adaptation
Oct 17 2015,positive,captain america civil war is a film that is able to take two conflicting sides and make audiences see both points of view putting viewers in a moral dilemma the balance of action and thought provoking ideas makes captain america civil war a movie that is much deeper than what is on the surface everyone gives great performances particularly chris evens as rogerscaptain america robert downey jr as starkiron man and chadwick boseman as  tchallablack panther though i do like captain america the winter soldier slightly more civil war is one of the best mcu films to date
Oct 17 2015,positive,amazing film  i loved all the characters  greatest spiderman on film yet   black panther and ant man were awesome another entertaining movie from the marvel cinematic universe very cohesive story line and some of the best action scenes i have seen in a superhero movie to date a very deserving 5 out of 5 stars 
Oct 16 2015,negative,all a bit meh too much going on but somehow really boring too except spidey  ant man
Oct 16 2015,positive,possibly the best marvel film so far
Oct 16 2015,positive,a cinematic experience that is candidly critical and subversive while not shying away at humor the russo brothers prove that sometimes sequels of sequels can be moving entertaining and franchisepromoting at the same time cant think of a iii that is nearly as good outside of toy story and godfather will update after seeing again
Oct 14 2015,positive,i just want to start off by saying i am in no way a hardcore fan of marvel or know every story and character originpast it has to offer in fact i knew very little about some of its biggest characters such as zemo however its safe to say that no matter how much you do or do not know going into this movie you will have not only one of the best superhero movie experiences you will enjoy a truly great plot ripe with interesting and compelling characters top notch action sequences and a balance of tragedy comedy and spectacle much to my surprise the new spiderman not only worked well in the movie he was the highlight of the movie there is no question that tom holland is the spidey weve been waiting for his solo film of course will be released mid 2017 black panther is also introduced in this 2 hour and 22 minute film and he is integrated smartly and seamlessly you should come for the action and stay for the story 455 stars
Oct 14 2015,positive,it was a  w  e  s  o  m  e  i think there is enough storylines and action for it to stand alone but if you are a marvel fanatic like me you might want to rewatch the last captain america and the second avengers  i did miss one or two avengers in this flick but they did something to make it up  i cant wait for more marvel
Oct 14 2015,positive,i enjoyed this super action movie i just hated how long it felt and the plot to me seemed to have a bunch of holes  my favorite new character was the black panther who i thought they did a great job embodying and incorporating seamlessly unlike spiderman  though i thought spidermans lines were some of the best   i dont understand why everyone seems to live this movie
Oct 14 2015,positive,i hate the cursing wow why do they do that great movie horrible mouths i dont remember super heroes cussing when i was growing up
Oct 14 2015,positive,well planned well executed
Oct 13 2015,positive,geek out heaven this was amazing
Oct 13 2015,positive,saw captain america civil war last night  a great movie  yeah  one of the best superhero movies of all time  yeah  is it better than batman v superman  batman v who    some parts early on in the movie reminded me of a slow burn jason bourne movie but the pacing accelerates towards a truly satisfying and totally unexpected conclusion    im not totally nerdgasming over civil war  to me it is less an amazing spectacle that blew my mind as a standalone movie as it is a well crafted narrative step in the overall marvel cinematic universe that i am heavily invested in as a fan  im totally pumped for the next instalment
Oct 12 2015,positive,not as great as winter soldier but its definitely on par
Oct 12 2015,positive,a blast the movie that batman v superman tried to be and failed miserably at
Oct 11 2015,positive,tight story great action and rdj is amazing
Oct 11 2015,positive,dont be dumb this is the best
Oct 10 2015,positive,definitely one of thee best movies this year so far
Oct 10 2015,positive,i loved it it was exciting intense it had me on the edge of my seat its now my favorite marvel movie yet
Oct 10 2015,positive,great film stay to the end one cut scene a minute after one right at the very end of the credits 
Oct 9 2015,positive,easily the best and most enjoyable superhero movie i have ever seen civil war neatly picks up and continues steve rogers search for his childhood best friend and bring him back from the brainwashed assassin hydra had turned him into some 70 years earlier despite the inclusion of a number of other avengers there is never any doubt that this is a steve and bucky story the russo brothers along with writers markus and mcfeely dos their best to honest trailerproof the story and it shows the plot is easy to follow even if you are not familiar with all their back stories the action sequences are intense and made even better with the witty banter between the characters as steve says i could do this all day
Oct 9 2015,positive,i really expect a war but really was solved oneonone without bucky unnecessary bromance     definitevily black panther was the best appearance in the movie and spidey with his mask on   thanks robert you make this one entertainment
Oct 8 2015,positive,the perfect civil war movie  its big shoes to fill trust me i went in expecting to see some weird story arc to pit them against each other but with resounding applause at the end of the movie i showed my praise by clapping as hard if not harder than anyone else the movie was just plain fantastic in every way fleshed out characters deep story emotions that feel genuine and real powers felt more down to earth and visceral and at its heart a great story of friendship the relationship between bucky and cap drive this movie and without spoiling anything ill just say that friendship is the whole backbone to this movie character depth and exploration had been scarce in these movies but each one builds and expands on the last and really with this movie i feel that i know the avengers truly its amazing to see old generations and young enjoying this movie its transcendent lets talk action there is more than anyone can ask for its crazy awesome  effects galore and also a nice blending of reality to make it realistic and not so obvious
Oct 8 2015,positive,great movie all the way around
Oct 8 2015,positive,love it it was amazing
Oct 7 2015,positive,excellent not quite as good as the original avengers film or captain america  the winter soldier but a must see for marvel cinema fans
Oct 6 2015,positive,the best nonavengers marvel cinematic universe film by a mile even though it kind of is an avengers movie in a sense it still works perfect well as a separate stand alone film that gets everything right its an absolute must see
Oct 6 2015,positive,you must know going into this movie that it is first and foremost a captain america movie  theres part of me thats a little disappointed in that i kind of wish the civil war storyline had been done as an avengers movie rather than a captain america movie  having said that as a captain america movie this thing is great  it reminded me an awful lot of batman v superman dawn of justice and not just because its two titans facing off against each other but because of how big this movie is and how much stuff it crams into it  unlike bvs though it never feels overstuffed or confusing  the closest it comes is with spiderman who feels like a shoehorned last minute addition because thats exactly what he is  i didnt like how abruptly he shows up and how equally abruptly he leaves and his motivation for joining team iron man seems mostly motivated by how starstruck he is by meeting tony stark more than any ideologies  having said that the mere nature of seeing peter parker interact with rdjs rendition is so surreal that im easily able to forgive this  i never thought id get to see spidey in the mcu so when it finally happened i could forgive a lot  speaking of additions black panther is great  seeing him pop on screen for the first time gave me that same sense of joy at a new character joining the marvel movie world that i got in the early days of seeing phil coulson find thors hammer  i havent had that feeling in a long time and it was great to get again  hes also just a fantastic character  he doesnt feel forced in hes and integral part of the story and a wonderful character with some truly badass moments  this is mostly captain americas movie but every avenger has a moment to shine  my one major gripe with this movie is that it can start to lull a bit and it takes a while for its main story to really get going  i also wasnt crazy about the villains who have always been a weakness in the marvel cinematic universe movies with the exception of loki of course  still the true antagonists of this story are the conflicting ideals and emotions of these characters who used to be friends and the lulls in action are only there to build on these moments  not to mention when the action does hit it hits hard  there was one scene in particular that had me cringing and holding my breath it was so tense and the climactic airport battle is just an absolute blast  i bounced around in my rating for this movie for a while before ultimately coming to the conclusion that the only thing holding me back on this was that it wasnt an avengers movie  yeah i wish civil war had been an avengers movie but its not fair to rate this based on the movie i wanted  the movie i got is still too damn good to ignore  caps story here is still a good one and the continuing saga of the winter soldier is damn interesting  having civil war as the cherry on top of this is just a bonus to what is already a great third chapter to the captain america story arc that began in first avenger  captain america civil war is emotional intriguing and a helluva lot of fun
Oct 5 2015,positive,great movie with all out amazing fight scenes and great plot
Oct 5 2015,positive,awesomeeverything you love about a marvel movie
Oct 5 2015,positive,what an awesome movie great effects throughout  i will have to say that this oviedo was by far the best of all the captain america movies
Oct 5 2015,positive,the deepest of all marvels movies so far
Oct 5 2015,positive,very good where will the avengers go from here
Oct 4 2015,positive,dayum iron shade errywhere
Oct 4 2015,positive,awesome start to marvels phase 3 tons of action funny spiderman was a great addition to the mcu there are 2 credit scenes make sure to stick around
Oct 4 2015,positive,probably the best one in the series for me think it does a good job setting up future films including infinity war remember there are 2 after credits scenes if you like marvel films definitely a must see
Oct 4 2015,positive,disney is the home for marvel
Oct 4 2015,positive,great flick would had preferred if it had ended how i wanted
Oct 4 2015,positive,best movie so far in 2016
Oct 4 2015,positive,good movie only thing i didnt lik was spiderman wasnt the best one
Oct 3 2015,positive,honestly this movie without a shadow of a doubt is the best marvel since ca winter solider and it is on par with the the avengers the introduction of spiderman was excellent tom holland captured the spirit that the web crawler possess also chadwick boseman as black panther was wonderful the movie showcased every characters side in the argument perfectly the airport scene only would give all comic book fans a nerdgasm  multiple times
Oct 3 2015,positive,a comic cook hero masterpiece the film has been stitched together in exquisite fashion layering in a bounty of heroes without feel like too much a perfect balance between comedy and seriousness and some of the finest acting in a marvel feature magnificent
Oct 3 2015,positive,great movie but winter soldier are still number one for me 
Oct 2 2015,positive,an emotional roller coaster
Oct 1 2015,positive,captain america civil war redefines the russos steadfast potential to enrich the post avengers gallery as their intensely psychological adaptation of a classic comic book storyline  and its villains are agreeably necessary
Sep 30 2015,positive,475 stars  i really enjoyed this movie  some really good battles between the heroes we all love  marvel keeps killing it with their super hero movies  i thought the story was good although it was quite a bit different from the comic  just imagine all awesome it would have been if marvel had the opportunity to use all of their characters  i highly recommend this one
Sep 30 2015,positive,wow that was an amazing superhero movie a lot of things have been building up to this movie and the story juggles it all very very well every character felt like they got screen time and you could feel the tension building with every argument as a viewer you see both sides and how both sides are right and wrong this is a movie where choosing a side actually matters and can make you debate why for quite a while this is a big turning point for the avengers and is packed with amazing action heart felt drama and some serious ideologies full of comic info and previous movie build up along with whats to come fantastic movie
Sep 30 2015,positive,captain america is definitely the best  comic book trilogy for me after this movie  marvel has a good grip on captain america than any other superheroes  a very matured plot  thrilling encounters makes this definitely the best movie of marvel  black panther and spidey have been excellent additions to the movie  black panther is a standout  character  the russo brothers again prove their potential   downey  evans and scarlett johansonn perfomances   need no special praise because they always are a treat to watch
Sep 29 2015,positive,steve rogers sorry tony you know i wouldnt do this if i had any another choice but hes my friend   tony stark so was i    are we suffering superhero fatigue that seems to be the hot question that has been beat like a dead horse as of lately and one that really needs to be dismissed immediately
Sep 29 2015,positive,captain america civil war is a game changing movie for marvel 
Sep 29 2015,positive,a great gamechanger in the mcu
Sep 29 2015,positive,it was everything i want out of a super hero movie  a good mix of action and humor with a little bit of meaningful smart drama thrown in as marvel acknowledges the thousands that probably die every time the avengers spring into action    grade a
Sep 28 2015,positive,one of the best superhero movies that i  have every seen plenty of action great story and castgreat directors the russo brothers this movie was never disappointing like early superhero movie this year batman vs superman dawn of justice i hope dc movies can get get their act together like marvel movies last superhero movie i seen that was this great wasthe dark knight it would be hard to chose which one is  them is best movie between them it is that close i  would highly recommend this movie
Sep 26 2015,positive,this movie is so like batman vs superman it is not even funny it works a little better because almost all the characters involved have had enough screen time in other movies the it is easier to accept them being shoehorned in  in trying to keep both side the good guy they make the same mistakes i personally liked both movies but find it funny how much better the critics are treating this one
Sep 26 2015,positive,nonstop action constant plot twists and a thriller for all ages
Sep 26 2015,neutral,i think i might have grown out of marvel films
Sep 26 2015,positive,compelling and thought provoking civil war blends the best of superhero action with political thriller to produce an exhilarating film that boasts a well rounded cast and a smart storyline
Sep 26 2015,positive,great movie and oddly enough did not feel overstuffed spiderman and black panther were great it leaves us off in a very weird place though as tons has happened and i am not sure what comes next i am excited for everyones next outing
Sep 25 2015,positive,the cap movies just keep getting better
Sep 25 2015,positive,not as good as the previous captain america films although still nice to see the different plot of them fighting each other as well as fighting a different evil
Sep 23 2015,positive,this movie is so damn dope go watch it now
Sep 23 2015,positive,this was great  i so wish batman v superman was this good  the action was great there was humor the intro of spider man and black panther was great  its worth catching in the theater
Sep 23 2015,positive,there was only one part i didnt like and i must say i agree w hayley atwell 100 percent
Sep 23 2015,positive,pretty good movie   gets you ready for the next one coming
Sep 23 2015,positive,everything i expected only problem it could have been 4 hours longer lol
Sep 23 2015,positive,am i slightly marveled out enjoyable and like so many films these days forgettable
Sep 22 2015,positive,get rid of the blasphemy
Sep 21 2015,positive,loved it cant wait to see whats in store next in the mcu going to interested in how they play every thing out heading into thor and avengers
Sep 20 2015,positive,this film has me even more pumped for black panther and spiderman homecoming
Sep 20 2015,positive,now this is a movie
Sep 20 2015,positive,eliminating the slightly clunky start which was needed to avoid glaring plotholes later on this is a great movie  it follows the same route as winter soldier  you can see the russo brothers amazing skill in juggling so many chracters age of ultron though not bad couldnt get this right  spiderman is just awesome and the addition of black panther couldnt have been more masterfully executed   i think we can expect great things from their solo movies
Sep 20 2015,positive,fantastic new marvel universe adventure that could be the studios best film to date filled to the brim with exciting action and intellegent scripting this is the years summer blockbuster to beat  after another incident involving the avengers results in collateral damage political pressure mounts to install a system of accountability headed by a governing body to oversee and direct the team the new status quo fractures the avengers resulting in two camps one led by steve rogers and his desire for the avengers to remain free to defend humanity without government interference and the other following tony starks surprising decision to support government oversight and  accountability  returning winter soldier directors anthony and joe russo prove yet again that they can balance complex plot with brilliantly edited action the action sequences on display here are top notch an airport showdown when the divided avengers plus some new recruits go toe to toe needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible and could be the mcus most thrilling sequence to date  another neat trick the film pulls off is that with its complex plot and large number of characters it never feels over stuffed like age of ultron each character has a moment to shine and in some cases steal the film more on that later  the well written script does well to show both sides of the arguement and although this is a captain america film both he and stark are morally right in their actions stark is trying to make amends for ultron and rogers is rightly nervous about government control  downey jnr evans and the rest of cast are all great in their now familiar roles but as good as they are the film is stolen by the new characters black panther and spiderman black panther in particular is the stand out chadwick boseman is brilliant in the role and he has a handful of exciting set pieces as well as looking very cool great african accent too and tom hollands spiderman is easily the best version of the web slinger seen on screen and hes only in a handful of scenes they both leave you craving more and the thought of upcoming solo films for them both is exciting  kudos to daniel bruhl too as main villan zemo his motivations are freshingly basic no world domination plans here and bruhl has a handful of sinister moments  forget batman v superman here we get iron man v captain america antman v black widow war machine v falcon black panther v winter soldier and too many more to name this really is as good as it gets in terms of summer entertainment and could be impossible to beat for quite sometimewell at least until the avengers return in 2018
Sep 19 2015,positive,phase three of the marvel cinematic universe begins with a political and actionpacked thriller in the form of captain america civil war the story is more sophisticated than age of ultron and the fight scenes are amazing though some of the light tone is lost which is acceptable the characters are topnotch and especially robert downey jr who gives an incredible performance as iron man and cap as always is stern but kind spiderman is a good newcomer along with black panther  and all the returning avengers step it up as for the villain zemo is not as good as ultron or lokie and the end is good just not as epic as avengers 2but the airport scene in imax  is incredible and the best fight ive seen in a while as for the comparison to batman v superman i liked both b v s had better visuals but not as good of a story while civil war felt like a more complete story its hard to favor one over the other as they are somewhat different captain america civil war is the best marvel movie yet and the story never relents unfortunately its two years until infinity war where the loose ends are tied but ive got this movie to watch over and over which is fine enough
Sep 18 2015,positive,this was a great movie i dont feel like it should have been a captain america movie although the story centered around steve and his long lost friend it felt slightly forced civil war was so much bigger than just the mentioned avengers and extra heroes its tough to capture every little detail from the comics but civil war should have been saved for its own movie it was still fantastic i really enjoyed black panther his role was very important and tony can learn a lot from him antman was funny by his character seemed different this time around almost in an annoying way all that being said i am no critic i just love marvel last thing stan lee had a great cameo
Sep 18 2015,positive,i agree with others that say this is the best marvel movie but it doesnt deserve a perfect score in my book  it was a fun action packed affair but was a hair long in the tooth  black panthers debut was awesome and spider man looked miscast  definitely worth checking this out
Sep 18 2015,positive,great movie the action was amazing and the story was awesome
Sep 17 2015,positive,more like avengers civil war probably the best avengers movie iron man is still my least favorite
Sep 16 2015,positive,highly entertaining interesting and well put together this is a great and energetic addition to the marvel films ps iron man spiderman and ant man are the best of this one
Sep 16 2015,positive,another great movie from marvel
Sep 16 2015,positive,while im not a fan of these movies and not a fan of movies where you dont know who to root for  i gotta admit this was an entertaining popcorn flick
Sep 16 2015,positive,no question this the best marvel movie yet great story and action with some good humor the airport fight scene is jaw dropping and i was never bored throughout the movie im glad the directors the russo brothers from captain america 2 the winter solider returned to direct it black panther is awesome and tom holland as spiderman was the best interpretation of the character yet oh yeah its a million times better than batman vs superman and its my favorite movie of 2016 sorry deadpool
Sep 16 2015,positive,one the best super hero movies ever made
Sep 15 2015,positive,civil war does a great job introducing new characters to the mcu does a great job displaying the motivation behind each character and gives almost all the characters an equal and important portion of the action a different kind of villain but certainly not the most compelling and the movie does feel lengthy
Sep 14 2015,positive,its more another avengers but i get it likely one of the if not just the best of the lot
Sep 14 2015,positive,it was one of if not the best superhero films to date the casing and acting was spectacular and spidey was awesome cap also started to have more of a character
Sep 13 2015,positive,well done just tired of superhero movies
Sep 13 2015,positive,best marvel film ever awesome fight scenes
Sep 13 2015,negative,not that good takes itself too seriously
Sep 12 2015,positive,great story and what a great build up to phase 3 of the marvel cinema universe
Sep 12 2015,positive,i cant believe this has only got 91 on rotten tomatoes this is hands down the best superhero movie made even better than the avengers
Sep 12 2015,positive,pleasantly surprised
Sep 11 2015,positive,movies from the marvel cinematic universe franchise have always been good some reached the fivestar level iron man the avengers guardians of the galaxy others just reached 4 12 stars but this superhero landmark film is the next big thing its make up everything that batman v superman dawn of justice got wrong captain america civil war is not just your typical superhero movie its an all new generation of heroes civil war is probably not just the best captain america movie its one of the best mcu movie yet    taking place after the events or avengers age of ultron steve rogerscaptain america played by the amazing chris evans again is working with his own avengers team to stop evil doings but the result leaves with more explosions and casualties the secretary of state william hurt and the united nations think it would be better if the avengers could help save the world when they want them to help rogers disagrees and thinks that the avengers should be free to defend the world without government interference but tony starkiron man robert downey jr who will always be the perfect iron man agrees with the secretary of state let the battle begin    civil war feels like a third avengers movie but with no thor or hulk to bring more excitement to it but thats ok thanks to the amazing directing of the russo brothers anthony and joe who directed the previous installment captain america the winter soldier and an amazing story by screenwriters christopher markus and stephen mcfeely who stayed with the franchise since captain america the first avenger have brought this movie to life and added some very dramatic depth to it    its team cap vs team iron man you pick one on the captains side is the marvelous scarlet witch elizabeth olsenthe awesome falcon anthony mackie the arrowshooting hawkeye jeremy renner and the hilarious and lovable antman a neverbetter paul rudd on team iron man hes got help from the beautiful and strong black widow scarlett johansson his friend war machine don cheadle vision paul bettany and our brand new friendly neighborhood spiderman a perfect performance by tom holland thanks to holland spiderman in this movie is way better than andrew garfields two spiderman movies but its not close to topping tobey maguires spiderman yet    we also got a new recruit on iron mans team this hero deserves more praise than some heroes and his name is black panther chadwick boseman in his best role to date after 42 and get on up aka tchalla tchalla has a problem with bucky barneswinter soldier a perfect sebastian stan the captains best friend who was brainwashed by the movies infamous villian zemo daniel bruhl who is coming back after his shouldve been oscarnominated performance in rush steve wants bucky to be free but tony will stop at nothing to kill bucky its one of the superhero movies you really need to see     thanks to the russo brothers markus and mcfeely civil war will remain as mcus best for a long time that is until all four of them finish shooting the twopart avengers infinity  war movies which is said to have a total of 68 characters but until that day comes captain america civil war will blow people right out of their seats and leaving the theater with something that will stick in their heads for a while civil war is one of the movies this year that youll have fun watching
Sep 11 2015,positive,not a bad flick for being one of the many thousands of marvel films out there but the uniqueness of everyone several heroes playing together in one film is getting old why does dc have this much success
Sep 10 2015,positive,the third film is not only the best nonavengers avengers film but its also arguably one of the best marvel films since the winter soldier
Sep 9 2015,positive,this movie is action packed spiderman was in the wrong movie lol
Sep 8 2015,positive,there was a time when i just want to watch a fun film a film that would give me its true purpose escape escapism has been offered by movies for the longest of time but even before some filmmakers have stepped forward and blow reality on our faces we have experienced delight anger pain among other emotions as we watch great varieties of films some movies get us invested in heavy plots as others would focus on characters or their environment but only very few films can have people experience so much and yet remained focused and so delicately balanced    it is admittedly hilarious when one would say captain america civil war is one of those very few films after all its a comic book superhero movie    well one of the greater things that the marvel cinematic universe has pulled off is their ability to focus on character development and personally im a character guy i seldom care about the plot be it heavy or light be it weird or straightforward i care about how the characters react to situations how they decide or reason how they show their humanity or their ideals how they convey their thoughts and gestures the marvel cinematic universe has developed and focused on their characters so patiently well that when they came together for the first and second and now the third time we already know how these characters would interact and it has been fun    the avengers and avengers age of ultron were both fun movies theyre cool theyre witty and they simply offered what most fun movies do escape but it was not always fun seeing the avengers together especially when they argued it was just too comical that their arguments were never taken seriously josh whedon has brought the audience the kind of fun we want in movies but he didnt bring anything that the audience should think about after the movies were finished    then came this movie from the russo brothers captain america civil war a movie that is so jampacked people might think its avengers 25 the crazy thing about it is that it remained focused on the clash between two sound and supported ideologies this is a thinking mans movie when these characters argue you understand it because you already know them then you start to think this movie offers a big politically philosophical question that when the movie finishes you are still asking yourself which is the better choice which side am i on but instead of being vexed it provides you the moment to think on yourself thats not the kind of thing people used to experience in these sorts of movies    the supporting character zemo had done his part really well he didnt feel like just a tool because you understand his motive you understand why hes there and you understand why he has to do what he did the russo brothers brought out as much humanity to this character as needed and not make him another of those businessmen or worldconquering lunatics which made him relatable    i personally think that the airport scene is by far the greatest action sequence i have ever witnessed this might just be the greatest action sequence for me and thats movies in general the addition of tchala black panther and peter parker obviously spiderman was such a treat as well    my favorite part though would be the last fight between capt rogers and tony stark when he found out that bucky barnes was the one who killed his parents this was the time when idealisms were set aside and let their characters simply react it was painful and beautiful it was the most human most grounded scene the mcu could ever pull off you know why theyre fighting and you know whats at stake every blow hurt and every time these characters get a closeup you see the anguish    after the figurative heartbreaks and literal punches i got out of the theater with this big smile on my face still couldnt believe that ive seen all of it and felt all of it what an interesting fun moving smart movie if there is a definitive avengers movie this might probably is it a wellbalanced movie about interesting characters in an intriguing plot that has remained grounded and yet provided a fun escape
Sep 8 2015,negative,little disappointed i wish see more from vision his powers and talent on big screen but nope hes always missing or cooking also i think hulk or red hulk would be a amazing addition but never happens no hulks in this movie spider man its awsome and black panther its better then i imagine     zemo  fail dont take me wrong the actor is terrific but he looks like a random guy from sokovia no costume no power didnt make much different than connect some scenes     the ending is super poor robert downey jr looks old i understand in this movie why he want to retire from iron man he doesnt look healthy and ready to go without the iron man suits in the final scene when tony stark is fighting with capitan america look like a young man cap fight with very old man with iron suits     finally my family and i find the movie bored at the beginning and in some others parts too much bla bla bla    german airports its the best scene after that you can literally go out of the theater and save time
Sep 8 2015,positive,captain america civil war is the 13th film of the marvel cinematic universe and it stars mostly the avengers in a superhero film about the winter soldier turning back into bucky barnes sebastian stan and hes a criminal which the government wants him dead or alive so captain america chris evans is trying to protect him no matter the cost with some friends that support him and from his other friends that opposes that decision ever since the russo brothers were announced as the directors of this movie this is one of the most anticipated films of the year since their first marvel film captain america the winter soldier was a fantastic film and one of marvels most serious films i couldnt imagine what they would bring for their next one since they also have the same screenwriters from the winter soldier for this one too we know that something like joss whedon with the avengers has been done before in like the sequel for it turn out to be not as good as the original based on almost everybodys opinions but for this it may not be the case as captain america civil war is actually a little better than winter soldier and it shows that the russo brothers are the best directors that can handle marvel films so far the acting is usually great as they been playing these characters for a long time but lets get to the newcomers here chadwick boseman as black panther is a terrific choice and there are enough information that you sort of know about the character as it leads to the black panther movie that im very much looking forward to tom holland as peter parkerspiderman is surprisingly better than i thought was going to be and was actually better than tobey maguire and andrew garfield combined which i hope that the writers john francis daley and jonathan goldstein and director jon watts do justice to the character like this movie did when spiderman homecoming comes out the action scenes are always entertaining to watch in a marvel film and the effects are usually astounding to look at there are some twists in there that i actually didnt see coming and i find the villain to be memorable even though the character may be the weakest part of the film but i wouldnt say that the character is generic as hes not nor necessary as he kind of is necessary the writing is well done and the humor is very funny in this surprisingly serious film the airport scene is one of the best parts of the film as we come so far with 13 marvel films that i got to know them and find it very fun to see the heroes fight each other captain america civil war is honestly one of the best marvel films that ive seen so far and its one heck of a starter for marvels phase 3 series
Sep 7 2015,positive,take notes warner bros this is how you make a cake
Sep 7 2015,positive,does anybody have any orange slices
Sep 7 2015,positive,cool flick cool character interaction  development within the teams spiderman def was great black widow really came into her own in this this almost could have stood its ground as another avengers moviealthough if its a taste of whats to come the next avengers movie will be amazing
Sep 7 2015,positive,this movie is the best out of them all
Sep 6 2015,positive,it was a great watch
Sep 6 2015,positive,i dont give movies 5 stars easily but this one deserves it the action and fights were great they really did black panther well there were changes from the comic story line but they worked well in the film they finally showed a characters other power and it was bad ass they showed falcons abilities better than they do in the comic there is a character that i originally did not like the casting for but i think he was very true to the comic the best rendition yet this movie is going to make a lot of money i am definitely going to see this again
Sep 6 2015,positive,liked it better than age of ultron not as good as winter soldier to sum up a fun movie definitely worth the watch however it didnt really add to the marvel universe story
Sep 6 2015,positive,thrilling characterdriven action flick with style and substance in equal measure an impressively subtle villain and tom hollands spiderman was everything weve been dreaming of
Sep 5 2015,positive,this series just keeps getting better   enjoy it now before marvel sells out their full character base and implodes it
Sep 5 2015,positive,i like most of the movie dont see way remove some of the choices they made on the other hand i really like seeing visions and ant man again ben chadwick bozemans black panther looks like its going to be great he had another one out of the park the perfect mix of jackie robinson meets james brown while kicking ass i also really enjoyed seeing spiderman that doesnt suck it gives you hope for spiderman homecoming overall definitely buying it on bluray we give it three and a half out of 5 overall
Sep 5 2015,negative,just really shit no art involved here
Sep 5 2015,positive,really good movie a must see
Sep 5 2015,positive,not the same without hulk and thor but black panther was amazing
Sep 5 2015,positive,something in this film was very off not including the weird kiss between peggys niece and cap we get it you have a 80 yr old bone for her but truthfully who cares i cant put my finger on it but i throughly enjoyed it im a little sad they couldnt have put everything from the comics in there but it was great regardless
Sep 4 2015,positive,grade  b  captain america civil war is one of the better marvel films to be released in recent years its no winter soldier or iron man but it serves its purpose and does so with surprising character depth i wasnt anticipating
Sep 3 2015,positive,amazing story and action
Sep 3 2015,positive,while showcasing incredible action sequences as well as a surprising amount of characterbuilding civil war has a feeling of being nothing more than a conveyance to move us toward the next avengers movie this is why i believe the mcu to be such a doubleedged sword  individual movies and their story exist only to serve the larger story woven throughout the disneymarvel universe as a longtime fan of both the source material and the mcu this film had a middlechapter feel make no mistake civil war was a very good movie that provided a lot of drama energy and emotion if youre a fan it is a must see while i dont believe that i wasted my money or time there is a slight tinge of disappointment in my mind perhaps that   tinge is mixed with a bit of longing for the next chapter
Sep 3 2015,positive,didnt expect that ending
Sep 2 2015,positive,great movie though it doesnt pack the same narrative and emotional heft as the winter soldier nor does it completely feel like a cap movie it still had some interesting story choices fantastic action sequences both the visual effects and direction and good performances from its cast especially boseman holland and rudd
Sep 2 2015,positive,great movie action packed from start to finish better than avengers 2
Sep 2 2015,positive,quite simply one of my top 3 superhero films in the interest of not spoiling anything for viewers i will only say that the balance of action and story and character development created a new take on comic book cinema go when you are in the mood for explosions a fist fight and junk food 
Sep 2 2015,positive,as much as i understand they make almost every right choice i dont like some of them
Sep 2 2015,positive,everything about this movie works it takes what batman v superman has and amps it up to a thousand the cast works the story works the villain works the new spiderman works
Sep 2 2015,positive,amazing amazing  loved it yes captain yes 
Sep 1 2015,positive,best comic book movie ever
Sep 1 2015,positive,one of the best movies marvel has made thus far and all things considered that is very impressive
Aug 31 2015,positive,very good movie  i would definitely recommend this movie to anyone
Aug 31 2015,positive,cant think of a single bad thing to say about this movie because it is so great loved tom hollandspiderman and chadwick bosmanblack panther paul rudd was a great addition and we even got giantman anthony mackiefalcon was used well with his new drone and is always great for one liners there were certainly a lot of characters but it didnt seem crowded and anyone complaining about teasing or setting up future movies needs to stop complaining because it was done well unlike say age of ultron and that is just the way its going to be now with marvel movies theyre all connected so there has to be parts of movies that connect them i cant wait to go see it again spoilers one thing i really liked that has become a rarity in marvel movies is that the bad guy wasnt killed off in the end i dont know that future of baron zemo but if hes still alive then hell probably be back again even if he isnt his character and motivations were fleshed out even better than other villains so hes still really good one
Aug 30 2015,positive,restores my faith in the mcu after the bleh of ultron
Aug 30 2015,positive,it was alright well done movie
Aug 30 2015,positive,with low expectations comes mild entertainment
Aug 30 2015,positive,this movie manages to bring together a lot of different people and plots in not only an entertaining way but really in a way that proves this type of movie works this is caps story for sure and he iron man and the winter soldier are the 3 main pieces but every character gets a moment to shine not in a forced way either each action set piece is informed by the story not just action for actions sake the airport scene is the scene we will remember for a long time but its the smaller more intimate moments that ground this story and make it more than another super hero movie spiderman and black panther are standouts and offer very different perspectives and performances my only complaint is the main plot point doesnt quite get enough attention in the end but thats forgivable after everything that comes before it
Aug 30 2015,positive,boasting a decidedly mature story and a welcome change of pace for the marvel cinematic universe as a whole captain america civil war delivers the goods not just in drama but with a healthy dose of action and a desire to see more
Aug 30 2015,positive,really theres nothing to complain about here still not necessarily my favorite marvel movie or the best in my opinion but an awesome awesome film that does a nice job balancing so many characters with a story that is devoid of holes and engaging i cared the whole time it was so comic booky and so so so so so so enjoyable throughout
Aug 30 2015,positive,this movie will change the entire marvel cinematic universe and it will be more awesome than the past mcu films i hope that i wont get disappointed at this movie and i know that the russo brothers really do this for the audiences who wanted to watch this film possibly this will be the blockbuster superhero movie of summer 2016
Aug 29 2015,positive,absolutely spectacular honestly im speechless this movie exceeded any and all expectations i had going into it it forces you to see it again and again they was the russo brothers juggle this all star cast is nothing short of epic you feel every hit every punch and every single one is meaningful the best part is that your torn in half at the end trying to decide whos right and whos wrong i dont want to give any plot details because im afraid ill cross into spoiler territory but please trust me as a hardcore comic book fan or just the average movie goer this movie will not let you down in any way
Aug 29 2015,positive,simply the best marvel movie made to date the directors did a great job with all the characters they all had a fair amount of screen time and the development wasnt pushed antman steals the show in his brief appearance with two teams of equally matched heroes black panthers introduction is welcomed looking forward to his own film in the future and of course spiderman was done proper justice by marvel studios whether you are team cap or team iron man you will walk away from this film amazed compared to warner bros early summer release of batman vs superman marvel a great start to phase 3 you got this in the bag take a bow
Aug 29 2015,positive,one of the best comic book movies ever stands with the likes of iron man the avengers and the dark knight it has the action that marvel movies always bring but with a dark dramatic tone that rivals that of the afore mentioned iron man and batman begins with an abundant amount of characters and a story that has depth this is one you dont want to miss a top10 of the year
Aug 29 2015,positive,just saw it loved it going to see it again
Aug 28 2015,positive,incredible piece of storytelling good sequences between leading male actors action sequences well done nice plot twists  one of my favourite marvel pictures
Aug 28 2015,positive,captain america loves peggys niece the creep iron man has a baby face for a while thats pretty good black widow crushes with thighs winter soldier never gets a haircut falcon flew around a bit i guess war machine is secretly a turtle scarlet witch and vision i ship it hawkeye is very sassy because he knows hes just a dude with a bow antman more like giant man black panther has a very big statue of a black panther compensating finally spiderman is a neerrrrrrddddd lol get rekt
Aug 27 2015,positive,all about bucky and tchalla best superhero appearance has got to go to giantmanantman
Aug 27 2015,positive,it was good not a lot more to say other than iron man was less powerful
Aug 27 2015,positive,marvel never fails at anything with this franchise this movie is going to make history
Aug 27 2015,positive,i really enjoyed this movie  not my favorite marvel movie or even in my top 3 or 4 but still enjoyable to watch  i loved the airport scene and the spiderman scenes were fun to watch  it was a tad darker than your normal marvel movie but that tone was warranted  it still had plenty of humor considering the tone  looking forward to the next set of marvel movies
Aug 27 2015,positive,decent i like how they are pulling in characters from so many different series
Aug 27 2015,positive,a little dry in the beginning but definitely worth seeing
Aug 26 2015,negative,while it may have my sisters bã i feel like this series is dragging on
Aug 26 2015,positive,it has many flaws its a dumb fun movie though dc did it better
Aug 26 2015,positive,ive been waiting forever to watch this the first week it came out but couldnt because of such a busy schedule however i just saw captain america civil war today and though i might be late i am extremely happy i got to see it    captain america civil war is probably the best superhero movie in the marvel franchise though this is a super hero movie this film is a pure masterpiece what makes this film pure excellent is the terrific action sequences in it and there is not one slow moment in the film in terms of action also what i love about this film is how not only do we have every super hero in it but we are also introduced to a couple of new characters to the avengers franchise such as black panther chadwick boseman agent sharon carter emily vancamp brock rumlow frank grillo and evert ross martin freeman and they all do a great job with portraying their characters     captain america civil war is a phenomenal film with a top of the line cast what i love about this film is not only does it provide excellent action but it also will make you have multiple questions through the films  2hr and 26 min run time and whats great about the films that all your questions get answered and there is a big twist at the end of the film which you did not see coming i dont think there is one thing wrong with captain america civil war and to be honest if i could give it more stars on here i totally would i watch a lot of movies and let me tell you usually when directors start to make trilogies they start to suck after the first film however the captain america trilogy just kept getting better after its first film captain america civil war ties with deadpool 2016 as the best superhero movie ever captain america civil war is a phenomenal well done film that is a great way to kick start your summer if you wet disappointed with batman vs superman dawn of justice 2016 which to my understanding most people were than see this film also this film has so many cliff hangers i cannot wait till avengers infinity war part 1 and 2
Aug 26 2015,positive,phenomenal the hype is reall
Aug 26 2015,positive,thought it incorporated everyone very well excited for the spinoff solo movies
Aug 25 2015,positive,absolutely the greatest marvel cinematic universe feature to date if not the greatest superhero movie as well
Aug 25 2015,positive,action drama and politics  all in one  nothing is as it seems  spectacular  9510
Aug 25 2015,positive,love it bmvssm has nothing on this and black panther and spiderman was epic
Aug 25 2015,positive,nonstop action great story line
Aug 24 2015,positive,underwhelming suffers from being overstuffed with new characters like ironman 2 the villain is a weak stereotypical one dimensional eastern european the scale of the conflict is unambitious and small considering the source material new characters are second rate specifically crossbones black panther and spiderman spiderman ends up being nothing more than an afterthought and should have been left out entirely returning characters like vision and scarlet witch are uneven and out of place like they were written by someone else robert downey jr continues his slide into johnny deppjack sparrow caricature everything about captain america and winter soldier excels paul rudds antman steals the show and adds much needed humor to a film that lacks energy or excitement throughout
Aug 24 2015,positive,well done love the introductions of black panther and spidey
Aug 24 2015,positive,the overall plot of the movie is shown in trailer but the actual movie goes far more in depth the mere idea of captain america and iron man fighting is enough to fulfil a great story but the story really shines in the parts of the movie the trailers dont show  though the over all plot of the civil war is the thread that keeps the plot moving the personal stories are equally intriguing the writing of the movie deserves a lot of credit giving each character an arc while fulfilling the promise of a civil war and two character introductions is no easy task the writers managed to pull off all of that while still having the dialogue feel natural and in character the dialogue was really where the writing shone each character had their own personality and talking style    differentiating a large number of characters in such a full movie is clearly difficult but each characters motivation was developed it was clear that no character was completely on one side the shades of grey in the characters motivation was really what made each character click this movie had some of the strongest performances seen in the mcu to date robert downey jrs performance as tony stark was one of the stand outs the character was very broken yet he was still tony stark out of the side characters elizabeth olsen and paul bettney were the strongest olsen had to bring vulnerability to an extremely powerful character and bettney had to bring emotion to an literal robot both did well in their roles but did best when put together each actors performances were great chris evans continues to improve and evolve as steve rogers this was the most emotional weve seen steve and it allowed chris to truly shine this is also the best weve seen from sebastian stan sebastian has taken bucky a notably forgettable character and made him into a conflicted and fascinating character both of the new actors deserve praise chadwick bosmen brought the perfect gravitas and regality to black panther proving he will be able to carry his own movie in spades tom holland brought the perfect mix of nerdy charm and youthfulness to peter giving us a spiderman that finally felt truly like spiderman the one character that didnt connect was of course zemo the character felt useless and since his motivations arent revealed until the end of the movie there is no reason to be invested in the character throughout the movie    the russos direction of this movie cant be over looked juggling seemingly dozens of separate stories and character arcs is difficult enough as is while having to introduce two new characters and continue the over all story of the mcu is seemingly impossible yet the russos were some how to pull of all of that nearly perfectly theyre also great comedic directors much of the comedy in this movie would have fell flat without theyre direction they also have solidified that they can handle many characters while still having a central plot proving theyre the right men for infinity war     the visual effects were typical marvel therefore great because they typically go unnoticed the movie is so immersing that scenes that typically would seem unrealistic feel like theyre natural in this world the cinematography was great as well it was quick without being disorienting for hand to hand combat scenes and was epic and sprawling for the epic and sprawling scenes the action in this movie was some of the best in the mcu to date each character had a unique fighting style that is represented in their scenes of corse the airport scene was incredibly and epic but many of the other action scenes should not be over looked the final scene may not have vast epicness or scale of the airport scenes but was still epic on a far more personal scale the music was very similar to captain america the winter soldier to the point of using the same theme but still served its purpose of establish tone for the scene    overall this movie was great as with most marvel movies it had a poor villain and a few story issues but still was an incredible movie that paved the way for a new wave of quality comic book movies proving as long as characters are focused on and evolved the genre can remain fresh and thrive 910
Aug 24 2015,positive,captain america civil war is a comic book masterpiece that has revolutionary action and characters that all feel relevant and have clear motivations its the best marvel movie of all time and the best comic book movie since the dark knight
Aug 24 2015,positive,this is an awesome movie although i would almost call it an avengers movie lots of action and a good story line
Aug 24 2015,positive,if you seen batman v superman it vary close
Aug 24 2015,positive,one of the reasons i loved the dark knight and the original iron man is because of the realism present this is what superheroes would be like in the real world and that opening terrorist attack scene from iron man just blew me away i just loved the movie and then we got joss whedons destruction porn its not that it was bad it was a very good film i just couldnt take it seriously but with the aliens and and portal openings into space it just kind of rubbed me the wrong way i guess thats just why i fell in love with christopher nolans dark knight trilogy let me clear one thing up civil war keeps all of that action humor and terrific effects of many of the other marvel movies but also makes it a serious and adds that drama and noncartoonishness that ive been wanting for so long if you dont go see this movie on the big screen its a sin its still not my favorite superhero film im sorry russo brothers that feat goes to the dark knight but you have made me love marvel again cant wait to see whats next
Aug 24 2015,positive,best marvel movie so far
Aug 23 2015,positive,a great movie unlike batman v superman this movie didnt just introduce some new heroes that have never starred in a movie before this movie was amazing and leaves us exiting for more marvel movies in the future this movie also with fix you up if you were upset with batman v superman this movie will get an a
Aug 23 2015,positive,good movie although i feel this was almost another avengers movie with there being a lot of other appearances from avengers
Aug 23 2015,positive,go teamcap the epic ending arc of the captain america trilogy with more superheroes than the first avengers movie spidey and black panther are fantastic additions robert downeys cryface almost made me switch sides he killed it will definitely be seeing this one in theaters again
Aug 22 2015,positive,the russo bros have full comprehension that this film centrally focuses on cap  bucky friendship is tested along with vengeance overshadowing certain motivations chris evans sebastian stan and robert downey jr yet again deliver solid performances along with countless other familiar faces portraying their respective heroes black panther was brilliant portrayed by chadwick boseman spiderman was spectacular pun intended tom holland completely owns the role excited to see their solo films overall this movie was a visual spectacle containing a cohesive story and strong character arcs the film may be subtitled civil war but theres so much more to it
Aug 22 2015,positive,pretty good one of my least favorite among the marvel movies but still a great movie
Aug 22 2015,positive,great action and a story that makes you think twice about force as a solution to justice
Aug 22 2015,positive,great movie and well written directed edited acted etc i liked this plot a lot and it really sets up the future marvel movies by the way black panther is awesome
Aug 22 2015,positive,far funnier than i expected  it made me want to go back and watch some marvel movies i missed
Aug 22 2015,positive,great movie from beginning to end must see
Aug 22 2015,positive,this movie was soooo good the antman spiderman and the winter soldier was the best
Aug 22 2015,positive,it does everything bvs didnt do have joy the story was thought provoking and the action was paced perfectly while tony stark and caps feud takes the forefront the supporting characters black panther and spiderman really steal the show while doing another thing bvs didnt getting the audience excited for their next personal installments
Aug 22 2015,positive,great special appearance
Aug 22 2015,positive,at the end spider man eyes turn cool so i wanna watch this team captain america reason why well ant man in the team
Aug 22 2015,positive,the russos are the perfect directing team for the marvel universe an incredible balance of so many ideas places and characters
Aug 22 2015,positive,captain america movies are the best solo marvel movies hands down marvel did spiderman right too
Aug 21 2015,positive,incredible film great superhero on superhero fights both points of the argument are sympathetic very hard to pick a side imo spidey is great antman powers is a great bit cant wait for more black panther go sea this movie
Aug 21 2015,positive,amazing movie and i think tom holland was great as spiderman because he and paul rudd could crack jokes and be funny during serious times in the movie
Aug 21 2015,positive,the russo brothers have done it again this movie is incredibly well done spiderman and black panther are introduced incredibly well i look forward to watching this again
Aug 21 2015,positive,epic in every way civil war provides stunning visuals characters and well told story that fixes previous mistakes in marvel movies
Aug 21 2015,positive,this isnt heroes vs villiansthis is heroes vs heroes and sometimes disagreements take a while to recover from unfortunately what i always found interesting is that cap who usually is a rule follower goes against the accords because he sees whats in his mind are red flags yet steve never betrays his moral rules and on the other hand tony who usually doesnt always play by the rules decides that they need watchdogs because he believes that it can help defend everyone from the bigger threat that is beyond earth but tony still finds the need to control an outcome to his favor there is no right or wrong side but purely just a disagreement this is great character growth for the two avengers
Aug 21 2015,positive,excellent different than the book if you can get over it and take it for what it is then youll love it
Aug 21 2015,positive,marvel knows how to make great and fun super hero movies this was amazing
Aug 20 2015,positive,dc take notes superheroes done right best movie to feature superheroes ever period    
Aug 20 2015,positive,it was great still liked batman vs superman better
Aug 20 2015,positive,a gosh darn masterpiece
Aug 20 2015,positive,this is excellent filmmaking that is fun expertlywritten and viscerally directed with an intense devotion to character simply put this epic work of movie magic makes you laugh cry and unlike another superhero epic that pitted heroagainsthero care this movie makes you care
Aug 20 2015,positive,fuck you batman v superman this is how its done
Aug 20 2015,positive,what can i say action packed with the best action marvel has to offer yet a simple but smart story and very funny in the second half leaves marvel captain america civil war the best one yet everybody had a good amount of time to shine especially spiderman who was funny as heck and black panther who is the sht in this film ant man was very funny and black widow hit harder than the dudes in here damn excellent film
Aug 19 2015,positive,this movie was awesome marvel did it again and also proved we can have a amazing vs movie it was awesome and tom holland and spiderman killed it and so did boseman as black panther and daniel as baron zemo the new character where awesome and so were the old this movie was a emotional thriller
Aug 19 2015,positive,team black panther let them try
Aug 19 2015,positive,awesome movie but still say toby maguire is the best spiderman and andrew garfield is a close 2nd
Aug 19 2015,positive,captain america is proving to be the most interesting of the marvel movies really well executed however a couple of things keep this one from being that much better spiderman seems thrown in for no other reason than to kick off his own series black panther on the other hand was much better handled the real frustration with this though is the absence of any real lasting consequence to the conflict
Aug 19 2015,positive,the past several marveldisney films have been made with such care and maturity  civil war is no exception  the story line is is so enriched with suspense and excitement take note dc comics and warner bros
Aug 18 2015,positive,yet again no shocker another great marvel movie lots of action and comedy through the whole thing the beginning was a little slow giving you the backstory and building it up but once it gets going its great loved seeing all the characters back together felt more like an avengers movie then a captain america movie missed seeing thor and hulk also did a good job incorporating new characters love how in the fight scenes they all play off of each other only complaint was i wish they didnt fight through the whole movie i wish at the middle they could have come to an agreement and then of course fight the bad guy of the film but im sure marvel knows what theyre doing worth seeing in imax 3d and dbox seats oh yeah and teamironman
Aug 18 2015,positive,it wasnt that great like i tot it was but i was fun and enjoyable i liked the story
Aug 18 2015,positive,amazing the film consistsed of not a single dull moment the entire movie was action packed and jammed with stunning cgi and action scenes you will talk about for days
Aug 17 2015,positive,this movie did have some slow moments but the addition of spiderman  black panther was awesome i enjoyed the well rounded story line with funnysarcastic  heartfelt moments definitely a must see
Aug 17 2015,positive,it was just really good  go see it  expect the next great installment in the neverfailing marvel universe and be entertained  have fun
Aug 17 2015,positive,everything i wanted batman v superman to be and better congratulations marvel you win at everything captain america civil war is actionpacked good acting fantastic showcase of the new spiderman and great character skill
Aug 17 2015,positive,great movie had a little bit of everything and a good storyline two things i would have liked a little more focus on the vision especially in the battle scenes and cut the movie by 20 minutes loved it though
Aug 17 2015,positive,best marvel movie ever made would be the best superhero movie ever made if it was not for the dark knight it also brings up the point of how we should govern the world we live in very fun movie but also extremely relevant in todays political circles this movie has everything you want amazing
Aug 17 2015,positive,so flippin awesome
Aug 16 2015,positive,amazing  you would think having all of these heroes in one movie would be complicated to explain in captain america they showed why every hero was in this movie and it made sense
Aug 16 2015,positive,spoilersspoilersspoilers  the best avengers movie so far the weakest overall comic adaptation yes i am fully aware that this is a captain america movie  for the latter im pretty grateful  although i loved the overall tone of the civil war comic i wasnt pleased with the ending i wasnt overwhelmingly thrilled with the end here but i can live with it  marvel definitely played it safe with this one as there were none of the characteristic risks that we have come to expect from the russos and their overlords  pretty much all of whedons influence is gone  dont get me wrong the snarky banter and razor sharp wit was all there but where theres  no risk theres no reward   one might argue that it was edgy to kill off crossbones in the first 15 minutes my response is to what end  it is quickly forgotten and pointless to the endgame  tonys anger at falcon for roadies injury is out of line because it was due to his order and visions errant shot   time after time the characterization s became more and more unlikely and less believable luckily for marvel it was a great movie anyway ultimately cap should have been assassinated on his way to trial by a still living crossbones however that didnt happen and well have to see what the overlords at marvel have in store oh i almost forgot this is still a solid number three in the captain america trilogy
Aug 16 2015,positive,amazing movie really liked it and looking forward to see the black panther and advengers infinity war part 1 and part 2
Aug 16 2015,positive,not just all about iron man and cap all of the other avengers hold their own place too vision spiderman and ant man were the best
Aug 15 2015,positive,awesome movie and the action sequences were so fun i cant wait to see it a second time
Aug 15 2015,positive,this was a good film plenty of action
Aug 15 2015,positive,it delves into darker themes while still keeping the feel of the marvel movies we all know and love  excellent movie
Aug 15 2015,positive,more panther please
Aug 15 2015,positive,excellent movie might be the best marvel movie so far
Aug 14 2015,positive,a solid meh the beginning dragged and the plot was very thin for once however i can say that i liked spiderman
Aug 14 2015,positive,lots of great moments action comedy character development
Aug 14 2015,positive,yeah that was just awesome underoos
Aug 13 2015,positive,pro black panther and spiderman good to watch ill watch it again and again    con i thought this was a captain america movie
Aug 13 2015,positive,already know this movie is gonna be amazing so
Aug 13 2015,positive,extremely overrated i cant beleive im saying this but batman v superman was better in my opinion and i thought that movie was just okay i actually found this movie boring at times spidey was good and the airport fight scene was really good the zimo was a failespecially because he is one of my favorite villains in the marvel universe  i cant beleive what they did with him here
Aug 12 2015,positive,the best sequel ever
Aug 12 2015,positive,loved it much awaited introduction for black panther
Aug 12 2015,positive,just watch it already
Aug 11 2015,positive,thats how you do a superhero movie
Aug 11 2015,positive,same old stuff good story lots of superheroes enjoyable
Aug 11 2015,positive,just saw captain civil war and omg it was so awesome i kept switching teams but im loyal to iron man omg that was so good
Aug 11 2015,positive,civil war opens new emotions for the marvel universe the only movie at least in the mcu to have my heart beat to a million per second tom holland exceeded my expectations as spiderman and chawick boseman more so theres still humor in this movie but its the darkest marvel movie to date it was just awesome still thinking about it
Aug 11 2015,positive,yeah sure its good whatever superhero movies are a plague but this one isnt half bad
Aug 10 2015,positive,the best superhero movie to date and the best marvel movies yet
Aug 10 2015,positive,well made but too many things going on and too many characters
Aug 10 2015,positive,just like the last one this film is bigger and better than the previous installment the storys compelling has the best characters we know and love to give us one of the summers best hits it has a steady pace which leads up to an emotional ending this movie is superior in every way and is a fun time at the movies
Aug 10 2015,positive,just one word amazing best marvel superhero movie of all time great job russo brothers
Aug 9 2015,positive,movie was great loved spiderboy  when are we going to see better women super heroes 
Aug 9 2015,positive,awesome as usual   dont forget to wait for clip after the credits
Aug 9 2015,positive,several drawn out scenes that got sighs of is this still playing  characters are as defined before but the movieplot seem stretched  someone was paid by the finalrelease minute  this is half the movie of ultron
Aug 9 2015,positive,the movie takes in somethings and with so many characters that was terrifying but it raise to the occasion    thus far is the best marvel movie and super hero movie    a smooth and well perform presentation of the new characters
Aug 8 2015,positive,recommend it for anyone
Aug 8 2015,positive,intense dramatic and charming at the same time captain america civil war begins phase 3 of the mcu with sky high expectations and proving once more that they are the masters at modern superhero movies
Aug 8 2015,positive,this is one of the best marvel movies of all time you understand both sides of the battle all the characters had a moment to shine and the new ones introduced were amazing definitely worth seeing and buying when released
Aug 8 2015,positive,captain america civil war feels a little bit more like an avengers movie than a captain america movie but thats not necessarily a bad thing   this movie was entertaining to see it was well acted and had some really nice action on it the airport scene was interesting to watch and the introduction of this version of spiderman in the mcu universe was really good to see   the thing about this movie though is that it doesnt have any stakes and in the end as entertaining to see as it is it doesnt feel it did much on the universe   i like it a lot but its hard to care about a little problem between this characters we been watching for a while now and end up in basically in the same place which ends up making the whole conflict pretty much unnecessary as well made as it is it needed to have stakes something the mcu is really really avoiding
Aug 7 2015,positive,every once in a while a film comes out and completely changes everything you thought was possible  it builds upon the strengths of its predecessors and delivers plenty of fresh action to hold nearly anyones attention  captain america civil war is a remarkable film  every frame is expertly crafted  the story and conflict are built from 2 master filmmakers in the russo brothers   this film just might be the best marvel movie ever made thus far in my opinion next to the original iron man guardians of the galaxy and the first avengers film and quite possibly the best comic book film ever made
Aug 7 2015,positive,best movie of the summer
Aug 7 2015,positive,saw an early screening last night in dallas the movie is incredible lived up to the hype and more finally a great peter parker black panther and spidey definitely steal the show antman follows right behind them fantastic airport fight scene the most fun you will have in the theater this year the russo brothers did a perfect job with all of these characters 3 more weeks until i can finally watch it again
Aug 7 2015,positive,excellent 8510  the best mcu trilogy   as expected it was a great thriller   casting of new characters was perfect
Aug 6 2015,positive,while its not perfect captain america civil war has become the marvel magnum opus by its own terms and definitely one of the movies of this present decade that will be remembered for a long long period of time the key of its success lies in the colossal storytelling of its plot having astonishing visuals and being very clever when portraying the characters
Aug 6 2015,positive,captain america civil war addresses the same serious themes of power action and consequence as batman v superman yet manages to have sooooooo much more fun doing it with big battles of special guest heroes that will make comic fans grin from ear to ear bring on the black panther and spiderman solo movies yesterday
Aug 6 2015,positive,loved it toni stank
Aug 6 2015,positive,still team iron man you dont do that to your friends f you cap it was very emotional and im glad they are including the romance between scarlet witch and vision im now sold on tom holland as spiderman
Aug 6 2015,positive,much better than batman vs superman and great to see the an all round good spiderman
Aug 6 2015,positive,phenomenal the avengers sequel we wanted
Aug 6 2015,positive,incredible addition to the mcu cant wait to see where they go from here
Aug 5 2015,positive,the russo brothers have crafted yet another marvel masterpiece mixing the right blend of action political tension and character development to keep even the most cynical comic book fan happy apart from an underused villain and some slightly sluggish sections towards the middle of the film this was a lesson in how to make a thrilling superhero movie
Aug 5 2015,negative,peter parker and spiderman stole the show  i really hope they do a stand alone movie  but skipping a lot of the story we already know and doing something new  awkward teen just getting used to his powers    otherwise just fighting and it was obvious they had all had the same fight training  the other guys didnt fight back and stood there waiting to be hit 
Aug 5 2015,positive,more of an avengers movie than a captain america movie but plenty of action and one liners has some serious emotional weight to it a an excellent segue from the previous movies to the next chapter 
Aug 4 2015,positive,this was one of the best movies of this year that i have personally seen this is defiantly a dropper movie considering that you would think you i know the ending but every corner there was a blindside i al aye was torn which side to pick this is a mustsee movie and will really open up marvels playbook
Aug 4 2015,positive,captain america civil war manages to juggle an overload of superheroes plot points and thoughtprovoking themes together the result is a breathtaking nearperfect experience
Aug 3 2015,positive,moving funny and startlingly mature civil war is a culmination of the marvel cinematic universe in a way that pays off though it does feel rushed at times
Aug 3 2015,positive,overrall a very good actionsuperhero movie but i cannot give it a perfect 5 stars because i hate the grainystyle that the action scenes are filmed in
Aug 3 2015,positive,gravity defying battle sequences check properly developed storyline check whilst at times it has seemed attritional welcoming in all these strands of the marvel comic universe eg age of ultron it pays off with this story every part seems necessary nothing superfluous  weve bought in its all sewn together even the introduction of the latestcutest  evolution of spiderman is deftly handled a far cry from the mess that was batman v superman a great film for superhero fandom
Aug 2 2015,positive,great movie exceeded all expectations black panther introduction rocks and for the first time since i was 7 i actually like what they have done with spiderman nailed it recommend imax 3d if you are able
Aug 2 2015,positive,awesome movie action from the beginning and it didnt let up this movie is very much an avengers 25 and ironman 4 as much as it is a captain america 3 antman spiderman and the black panther were great in their roles and i didnt feel force fed in accepting them in the movie they were all nicely intertwined in the movie well not so much antman but he has a great part in the movie
Aug 2 2015,positive,it was a great story with humor and excellent action scenes
Aug 2 2015,positive,great film to start off the summer of 2016 plus you have to see it in imax theatres since it was filmed with imax digital cameras
Aug 2 2015,positive,amazing in 3d at the imax
Aug 1 2015,positive,45 stars great movie i just felt like they fought for a stretched out reason
Jul 31 2015,positive,enjoyable and fun just thought spiderman was completely unnecessary for the film but well worth going to see
Jul 31 2015,positive,spectacular marvel has done it again so many emotions so much fun jaw dropping i absolutely loved every second of it
Jul 31 2015,positive,5 stars might be the best movie of the year
Jul 30 2015,positive,the action and characters are all pretty cool however the story line is subpar and the villain is bland and uninteresting
Jul 30 2015,positive,excellent movie im going to see it again soon and will pay full price when its released for streaming
Jul 30 2015,positive,one of the best marvel movies ever made
Jul 30 2015,positive,best captain america movie yet
Jul 30 2015,positive,spidery was hilarious
Jul 30 2015,positive,best super hero action scenes ever it was the  of all s
Jul 29 2015,positive,captain america chapters are my favorite marvel movies this one takes its time setting up the story then the fun really starts to take place     cant wait for spidermans adventure he about stole the show in this one
Jul 28 2015,positive,energetic as always with these marvel movies though they can only pull this formula so many times before it becomes a bit annoying
Jul 28 2015,positive,the action sequences in these movies have devolved into banal prek acrobatics
Jul 28 2015,positive,very very good movie and action all the way through never boring ó 34
Jul 27 2015,positive,loud  lots of stuff blows up it was ok
Jul 27 2015,positive,spiderman and black panther do their best to steal away the thunder from cap and ironman    if you go into this movie expecting to be either one of team cap or ironman i guarantee you that you will flip flop at various parts of this movie no matter how big of a fan boy you may be    this movie had my highest expectations and it still managed to exceed them    the russo brothers just get it when it comes to this genre    the airport fighting scene is the 15 minute sequence every super hero fan has been waiting for since we were kids playing with toys with our huge imaginations
Jul 27 2015,positive,this is how you do a vs movie plenty of action and several fights antman was awesome again vision was as well black panther was awesome and lived up to the hype spiderman was also great and dare i say the best one yet once marvel can get the rights to xmen and add wolverine and hopefully fix the problem with the movies it will only get better
Jul 27 2015,positive,beautiful just beautiful spiderman and ant man stole the show in comedy love the references and drama every character is so well developed in this movie and is emotionally attached to the story
Jul 26 2015,negative,very disappointed  i dont like superheroes fighting each other  are they copying the dc comics formula  its morally reprehensible  real heroes would never intentionally threaten each others lives  i wasnt convinced that the fighting was necessary at all    it gets one star for being visually stunning and having great humor  worth a single watch but wish i waited for the dvd     it would be nice if captain america had more american themes as well   it seems that they are too afraid of that
Jul 26 2015,positive,this is by far the best superhero movie ive ever seen and definitely the best movie to come out of the mcu it mixes great direction and phenomenal acting scenes with a deep plot that brings together every character without it being forced a
Jul 26 2015,positive,a truly great epic movie we enjoyed it in 3d very much
Jul 26 2015,positive,pretty awesome flick  i was worried about the spidey inclusion but they pulled it off
Jul 26 2015,positive,at first it was like several of the previous films but once they started fighting each other i really began to like it a lot the first group fight is probably the single best comicnerdy action sequence that ive seen in a comic book movie also i now have high hopes for the next spiderman reboot he was great in this flick
Jul 26 2015,positive,very good movie with lots of action and fast pacing the humor felt right and was awkward like a lot of marvel movies and the scenes felt very tense everything was exceptional except if you ask me the behind the scenes villain who i wont name but this didnt really take away from the film in any way great set up for phase 3
Jul 26 2015,positive,all i can say is awesome best movie of the year cant wait to see how they follow this one up
Jul 25 2015,positive,the avengers film that age of ultron wasnt allowed to be a few silly bits but its a marvel film so what do you expect vision woefully underused
Jul 25 2015,positive,excellent  great action story and drama  this is how super hero movies should be done
Jul 25 2015,positive,it was meant to be a game changer something much larger and impactful instead we have an ideologically driven film with one powerfully emotional scene a hugely epic sequence and a few other cool action scenes here and there even though there were parts that were still brilliant i felt like this movie was a let down it is far from ambitious but still a fun film  incredibly over rated right now which is ironic because batman v superman was incredibly under rated both films offer very similar amounts of joy to a comic book fan like myself but in very different ways they both deserve a four star rating since they both have some major drawbacks  for a big captain america fan its ironic that antman and spiderman were the highlights for me in this film but bucky has grown in to a real favourite of mine black panther didnt feel out of place either and i liked his character but he did feel slightly one dimensional  there are some scenes in this film that dragged it down but the airport scene makes up for all of that it really did have me grinning from ear to ear
Jul 24 2015,positive,amazing a must watch
Jul 24 2015,positive,one of the very best films ever produced by marvel the russo brothers continue to prove they know how to handle these characters better than anyone thrilling funny poignant and emotional this movie more than entertains
Jul 24 2015,positive,which side are you on both sides have their pros and cons its a real dilemma further complicated by the two lead protagonists taking the opposite side to the one you think theyd take     and its the emotion of the issue their struggle with the issue and the prospect of the team breaking up that provides the winning formula for this film     of course theres 3 kickask action setpieces and theres lots of humour thrown in but for once the enemy is not going to destroy the world just their world     all of this  plus the storming debut characters of spiderman and black panther  that makes this film quite possibly the best from marvel and a clear winner over dcs blockbuster of the year     in short i loved it
Jul 24 2015,positive,basically an avengers movie not as enjoyable as the 1st but better than the second captain america tends to get the best solo movies and this was no exceptions the best parts were when all the avengers were together fighting each other or not i was getting a little confused with the other flashbacks and villains
Jul 24 2015,positive,im waiting for this action pack marvel movie
Jul 23 2015,positive,i watched this last week but couldnt add my review crowd pleasing the action was intense and tight anyone remotely aware of our current political landscape will get this movie one of the best made super hero movies to date
Jul 23 2015,positive,this movie was epic in every single aspect it delivers conflict in every single level emotional physical philosophical remarkable action scenes eventhough if you are not a fan of all the standalone movies you still will appreciate how meaningful this conflict actually is for each one of them ive got no doubts on giving this movie a 55
Jul 23 2015,positive,everything the movie shouldve been and in my opinion the best spiderman to date marvel has kicked off phase 3 with a bang and leaves fans thinking what could happen next
Jul 23 2015,positive,this is a great movie to see i saw it during the nightthis is great teamwork against each otherthey are going to make another movie
Jul 22 2015,positive,visually stunning and edgeoftheseat storytelling civil war delivers an effective depiction of both internal and external conflict in characters
Jul 22 2015,positive,solid end to the trilogy
Jul 21 2015,positive,well done  unlike the other new movie with a similar storyline there actually seemed like a justified reason for the conflict   the movie is a bit sloppy in spots but it more then makes up for it on creativity action special effects and a good use of its cool heroes     not much use of 3d even though it was an action film
Jul 21 2015,positive,lets just start of by saying it is excellent    what a relief to have such a big face off and so many characters to juggle and all within the confines of a 226 hour screen time to share marvel and the russo brothers have exceeded expectation and delivered on their promise    this is not the civil war from the page but it is the civil war the marvel cinematic universe was heading towards and needed    the film is very much a captain america tale and continues with the tone from its predecessor everything in the movie is placed in order to build towards the overall story chris evans and robert downey jr are both fantastic and fully realized characters comfortable in these roles but growing with each feature that comes along    the rest of the cast are all brilliant and have their moment both in a comedic sense and a more action orientated way the reason they align themselves to each side is logically and fulfilling    spiderman is a particular high the acclaim that tom holland has received is justified and well deserved he moves looks and feels like the spiderman we all know from the pages he was introduced on he also finds time to add comedy at the best and worst of times marvel know how to handle their properties correctly and everyone will be looking forward to spiderman homecoming next year  black panther is also a very refreshing energy to add to the mcu he is also fully realised with his own unique fighting style and his motives are well fleshed out and omnipresent again his solo outing is eagerly awaited    the airport fight sequence in germany is comic book heaven    what makes this movie  and something that bvs was truly lacking in is the humour and comedy marvel just want to have fun  and by doing so also invite you along for the ride they balance all of their key story lines and action sequences with humour in just the right places and with gravitas when its required     you will leave with a huge smile on your face and with the knowledge that the mcu is in the right hands and heading in the right direction
Jul 20 2015,positive,awesome well worth the wait
Jul 20 2015,positive,captain america has become one of the best parts of the mcu and this film is no exception this film is packed without becoming overstuffed
Jul 20 2015,positive,fun movie but it has some big problems in the story with such a great comic as base they should adapt better the universe situation
Jul 20 2015,positive,this movie is amazing
Jul 20 2015,positive,awesome  surprised how much i loved it
Jul 20 2015,positive,this is what a superhero vs superhero movie is supposed to look like  excellent
Jul 19 2015,positive,marvel should just let the russo brothers handle all of their movies amazing job this easily and quickly climbed up to be my favorite marvel movie so far once again this movie exceeds every expectation i ever had its nearly flawless and just an absolute blast to watch fan or not tom holland steals every single scene hes in and did an amazing job as peter and spiderman it was short and sweet but enough to push your excitement for homecoming    and holy shit giantman sorry      2 after credit scenes    all hail king of wakanda  1010    loving the fanboy hate 3
Jul 18 2015,positive,very likely my favourite mcu movie to date mature and intelligent story great acting with real consequences
Jul 18 2015,positive,everyone in this movie has an understandable motivation making all characters right in a certain way but disagreeing on a certain issue thats stopping them from working together making instant drama in addition the captain america movies are the only movies in the marvel cinematic universe where each film improves over the last also any of you stupid ass retarded fanboys say this movie sucked because it wasnt 100 accurate to the comic book which ive read myself need to shut the fuck up because you should have known coming in that it wouldnt be exactly like the comic book for many reasons but most notably the fact that major characters in the comic like the fantastic four and xmen wouldnt be there because of the whole rights issue thing
Jul 18 2015,positive,amazing characters great engaging story all your favorate characters and a few new ones if bvs turned you off hero on hero action this is the movie to rekindle your rumble loving ways
Jul 18 2015,positive,watching this movie i went in thinking that im only seeing this movie because it got a good rating and because ive seen all the marvel movies i didnt want to see this movie because i honestly hate captain america he irritates me with his combed hair and his need to boss people around because he is the first avenger i think you wouldve guessed by now that i am team iron man i just want to note that i like chris evans just not cap i loved him as johnny the human torch anyways this movie as amazing i liked almost everything about it cough cough cap i really liked spider man it seemed more practice that tony stark gave him the material need to pull off his unitard after all what kind of teenager would have access to zoom in lenses and skin tight thick battle material however andrew garfield is still my favorite spider man but he is definitely a close second hes definitely better than toby the moral of this movie is to never give up on what you believe in and i think everyone needs to learn from that this movie was great i love the mash ups of multiple marvel movies it reminds me of the old disney show mashups like the suite life of zack and cody mashed with raven and hannah montana
Jul 18 2015,positive,spidey making star wars jokes yeah definitely best spiderman ever and the movie best marvel movie ever
Jul 18 2015,positive,from what im hearing im going to love this a ton
Jul 18 2015,positive,rating 100  powerful captivating actionpacked and emotional captain america civil war is by far the most superior superhero film to have ever been produced
Jul 17 2015,positive,loved it black panther was such an awesome character to bring into the series and so was spiderman and the casting for these characters is awesome this is the first great superhero film of 2016
Jul 17 2015,positive,i thought it was awesome it never got boring
Jul 17 2015,positive,a fantastic start to marvels phase 3 and a fantastic end to caps trilogy of solo films  featuring some great acting done by a huge ensemble of a cast some of the best action sequences yet in the mcu and some new welcome new additions to mcu in the form of black panther and spiderman civil war is one of the mcus best yet next to the avengers guardians winter soldier and iron man
Jul 17 2015,positive,would love to see the avengers on the big screen yet again tony vs steve style
Jul 17 2015,positive,as the end credits rolled i was shocked to remember that this had been a captain america movie and not an avengers theres so many characters involved here including a lot of new introductions that it doesnt feel particularly focused on cap     at times the number of characters involved feels too much although there is a certain joy to be had in abandoning yourself to the fact youve got 10 of the superest super heroes on screen kicking butt at one time but then the same could be said of the story in general theres so much going on that it feels almost impossible to follow all the threads and as ever theres an underlying gnawing suspicion that none of this is really making much sense     all you can really do is sit back and enjoy the action the humour and the crazy thrill of it all
Jul 16 2015,positive,i really need to catch this one again
Jul 16 2015,positive,one of the best captain america movies
Jul 16 2015,positive,big als movie review    captain america civil war     captain america and iron man come into conflict when a united nations ordinance attempting to control the avengers activities causes the superhero group to fracture beyond repair     loosely based on one of marvel comics most beloved storylines captain america civil war delivers what was expected a high octane superhero brawl with a heart and while ca cw may not be as intelligent as its predecessor winter soldier returning director brothers anthony and joe russo manage to sagely balance the iconic characters personal ideals and perspectives in what amounts to be a difficult family quarrel with extensive consequences the biggest flaw of this blockbuster film is the deus ex machina like villainnot a bad performance just not necessary     grade  b    big al says see captain america civil war in the theatre
Jul 16 2015,positive,started off great then got boring and more boring then action came and then more long shots then action end
Jul 15 2015,positive,well written i must throw in that that the introduction of black panther was executed perfectly   from start to finish my high expectations of the movie was filled   marvel you are the best
Jul 15 2015,positive,well done i enjoyed it
Jul 15 2015,positive,captain america civil war yet again proves marvel is still at the top of their game when it comes to filmmaking after the events of the avengers the winter soldier and age of ultron the government suggests that all the heroes need to be put in check i wont share any other story details as that is the best way to enjoy it but civil war is definitely stepping even further in the right direction a much darker and more mature movie than its predecessors civil war also evolves in many other ways like opting more for brutal handtohand combat rather than just explosions and what not all the cast are great as usual and somehow enough time is found for all the characters to flesh them out enough to warrant having them in the movie tom holland as spiderman has some great potential and plays the role incredibly well and i cant wait to see him in other movies civil war is probably one of the best marvel movies if not one of the best movies of the genre and puts another film of heroes clashing to shame so what are you waiting for go out and see this film
Jul 15 2015,positive,the most enjoyable of the marvel studios so far
Jul 15 2015,positive,an explosively emotional quick whited yet darkly political blockbuster juggernaut civil war kicks off marvels phase 3 in a very course changing pace for the mcus future and i am beyond satisfied while nowhere near as flawless as its predecessor  the damn near perfect winter soldier this film is most definitely the more exciting event that age of ultron absolutely should have been every single character gets their moment to shine through and through including the brightest stars birthed from this film with bosemans black panther and hollands spiderman  the action is a truly spectacular feat from the thrilling opening to especially that airport sceneby god the airport scene never did it feel like the punches were for the sake of mind numbing entertainment every single hit was driven and earned through emotional stakes pushing these heroes to such rigorous measures right down to the final bought between our two leading protagonists and unlike another certain vs movie for every action there are an equal amount of complex philosophical consequences that leave us questioning even after the movie is overwhose side are we on  russo brosdamn fine work here gentlemen i am beyond confident that they will deliver an astounding conclusion with infinity war
Jul 15 2015,positive,not as good as i expected it was built up like an avengers film and it wasnt it was definitely captain america 3 it didnt feel like a superhero film and lacked emotion a decent action film nonetheless
Jul 14 2015,positive,definitely better than batman vs superman fights are very well choreographed and they managed to link the previous film to the this one very well
Jul 14 2015,positive,best marvel movie yet
Jul 14 2015,positive,they kill it every dam timelove this shit
Jul 14 2015,positive,absolutely marvelous a wonderful film filled with action comedy and most importantly heart an ingredient that batman v superman failed to include civil war is breathtaking and each character shines in their own unique way i wanted to see it again as soon as the credits rolled one hell of a good movie
Jul 14 2015,positive,excellent plot and dare i say acting this is better than avengers 2 i think black widow deserves a standalone series
Jul 14 2015,positive,well this was damn cool except for a few thingskilled off some cool people way too fast black panther best character in the whole movie antman still awesome definitely check it out for sure
Jul 13 2015,positive,ambitiously grand and undeniably wellcrafted
Jul 13 2015,positive,best marvel movie yet some things feel forced in but everything was great
Jul 13 2015,positive,great cast and very enjoyable story some slow scenes but for the most part it was great
Jul 12 2015,negative,very expected nothing new coming from marvel some ole forumla
Jul 12 2015,positive,batman vs superman was better
Jul 12 2015,positive,5 stars great movie great action good plot line wanna see it again
Jul 12 2015,positive,really cool only disappointments spiderman felt shoehorned in and i cant believe they cast marissa tomei as aunt may way too hot to be aunt may
Jul 12 2015,positive,you need to have some knowledge of several marvel films to fully appreciate this but thats how this works its long form storytelling by design and this is where is pays off
Jul 11 2015,positive,its good but seems to fall into a formula yet again
Jul 11 2015,positive,the best captain america movieperiod
Jul 11 2015,positive,captain america civil war was well worth the wait for a film that is jampacked with all of our favorite heroes it never feels too crowded everyone shines when theyre on screen especially the new spiderman played by tom holland whether you walk in as team cap or team iron man this movie will have you questioning who is right through out the film highly recommended
Jul 11 2015,positive,awesome just like i knew it would be
Jul 11 2015,positive,i loved pretty much everything about this need some time to form coherent thoughts and not just gush embarrassingly
Jul 10 2015,positive,it puts batman v superman v audience to shame but everyone proclaiming this is marvels best yet or even going so far as to say its the best superhero movie ever madelets everybody calm down take a breath and go watch superman the movie the dark knight spiderman and the avengers again    but damn that airport scene was great
Jul 10 2015,positive,very good movie  spiderman stole the show black panther was superb casting was great
Jul 10 2015,positive,captain america civil war was so awesome its so action packed and very interesting to all fans of marvel studios a must see movie for the whole family and a must see movie for 2016
Jul 10 2015,positive,i cannot wait it has lots of new characters that will be amazing
Jul 10 2015,positive,story is a tad worse than i expected spiderman was great
Jul 9 2015,positive,an enthralling blockbuster film that excites from end to finish captain america civil war continues marvels win streak of comic book movies in their latest film i think at this point it is safe to say that marvel is the pixar of comic book films every character was handled well with excellent balance for the massive cast of heroes the conflict and plot made sense and every characters motivation was fully understood delivering few plot holes so minor that they did not distract from the film the introduction of new characters black panther and spiderman were definitely highlights as their brief introduction promises exceptional movies in the future chadwick bosman tom holland and surprisingly paul rudd had stand out performances throughout the film and had the most memorable aspects of the film the airport battle is hands down one of the best fight scenes i have seen in a marvel film to date all in all i had no complaints with this film at all and can safely say it is the definitive popcorn summer blockbuster
Jul 8 2015,positive,chris evans is absolutely superb as captain america and i thought civil war was by far the best movie to date in the marvel universe
Jul 7 2015,positive,one of the best marvel movies ever made great character development and action the amount of characters they had is the movie was done perfectly i love this new spiderman
Jul 6 2015,positive,super excited for this i hope spiderman will be in it but if he is it wont be andrew garfield
Jul 5 2015,positive,you know it was alright for someone who didnt read the comic books i didnt really understand what the whole issue was hah
Jul 5 2015,positive,i was jusg a little sad on the ending is all other then that great
Jul 5 2015,positive,what a great movie you find out what happened to tony starks father  mother there is a lot of action from start to finish
Jul 5 2015,positive,third act very slow other than that great fighting and arguments
Jul 5 2015,positive,loved and hated it all at the same time loved cause hey its the avengers loved the unexpected appearances loved the action hated it cause theyre friends and fighting and its the end for one character in the series i saw it in 3d which i enjoyed but is not absolutely necessary
Jul 5 2015,positive,amazing marvel has outdone themselves with this one
Jul 5 2015,positive,good plot and both sides have their reason
Jul 5 2015,positive,this is what bvs was missing character  development focused storylines and overall a sense of satisfaction
Jul 4 2015,positive,fantastic the culmination of 8 years of work put to great use cant wait for whats next
Jul 4 2015,positive,pretty cool movie could have been shorter but i think that about all avenger movies best parts were spiderman and black panther
Jul 4 2015,positive,words cannot express how much i love this film
Jul 4 2015,positive,i agree with the other outstanding reviews  this movie had interest and plenty of action  bringing in antman and spiderman were a huge plus
Jul 4 2015,positive,rating any movie in the mcu i always want to give it a high rating but i wouldnt do that i try to be unbiased now heres the thing with civil warits not a bad movie not at all the problem is its like being forced to watch your own children fight beating themselves down to a bloody pulp when its all said and done though and im able to reflect and get past those emotions you begin to realize how fantastic a lot of the movie was with so many characters new and old they manage to keep the story still intact the introduction of black panther and spiderman was amazing black panther is a killer fighter spiderman was great as well different for sure i was so use to an older spiderman but with such a great casting job all my worries of spidey being terrible began to wash away not only was the story fantastic but it set up so much awesomeness to happen down the road for the mcu
Jul 3 2015,positive,brilliant storytelling is evident throughout
Jul 3 2015,positive,amazing movie because of spider man
Jul 1 2015,positive,yes it could have been better but it was another fantastic marvel movie
Jul 1 2015,positive,this is the best marvel studios movie yet captain war civil war is way better than aou because the characters are balanced in this film and they all have great amount of screen on time the fighting scenes in this movie is pure marvelous and brutal the best part of this film is black panther and spiderman some how i really liked baron zemo because you can understand his motivates and where he came from this is the best makeup work from aou
Jul 1 2015,positive,tied for my second favorite marvel movie excellent
Jul 1 2015,positive,loved it it met my expectations and beyond
Jun 30 2015,positive,not up to the level of winter soldier but adding antman and spiderman really ratcheted up  the humor since tony starks brand of humor is starting to get a bit stale
Jun 30 2015,positive,not as good as i thought
Jun 30 2015,positive,the highlight of the film for me was spiderman and black panther  the rest was fine but those two made the film for me
Jun 30 2015,positive,great movie with humor action and drama
Jun 30 2015,positive,awesome  definitely worth seeing 3 times
Jun 29 2015,positive,okay so i loved the movie great acting great story but manif im being honest that was some of the worst cgi ive seen in a recent film
Jun 29 2015,positive,freaking awesome great follow up to the winter soldier great film must own
Jun 29 2015,positive,coming of the underwhelming batman v superman my expectations for this movie to be better grew more and more and i can honestly say this is the first time my breath has been taken away by a superhero movie just as winter soldier the russos direct another film that will be considered best in the marvel cinematic universe worth more than the price of admission worth seeing twice in the theatre and worthy of the expectations this film had to meet and surpassed
Jun 29 2015,positive,absolutley astounding the russo brothers hit an out of the park grand slam with civil war the action is incredible and the airport fight scene is the best fight scene ever done in film history ladies and gentlemen spiderman is back tom holland is peter parkerspiderman he is the greatest film incarnation of the webslinger ever the whole film is super kickass i give it 5 stars due to the action and story line i give tom holland and infinite amount of stars bc he is sooooooo perfect as spiderman
Jun 29 2015,positive,spiderman was the best part tom holland rocked it also good to see giant man and black panther
Jun 28 2015,positive,loved the movie âïtm much better than superman vs batman was
Jun 28 2015,positive,cant wait for the next one
Jun 28 2015,positive,as good as cap2 but more fun and even more action   loved the new characters they were all done very well  great story and  the movie ties to virtually every other movie in the franchise   go see it
Jun 28 2015,positive,believe the hype that was awesome  stay until the very end of the credits
Jun 28 2015,positive,this film is everything ive ever wanted in a comic book film it is fun smart emotional and entertaining as all hell i cannot even begin to describe the roller coaster of emotions and the smile that was constantly plastered on my face this film truly is incredible it manages to juggle so much all while remaining entertaining and doing justice to newcomers like spiderman and black panther marvel again manages to do the impossible and top itself if you are a fan of comic book movies action films or just a flat out good moviecaptain america civil war is for you

Jun 25 2015,positive,now what no more captain
Jun 24 2015,positive,marvel keeps raising the bar on supper hero movies they just get better
Jun 24 2015,positive,special effects were so real it blended into reality unfortunately the super human behaviours were at some scenes a tad unbelievable     great storyline and definitely opens up the franchise for more thrilling stories
Jun 24 2015,positive,better than barman vs superman
Jun 23 2015,positive,this film was absolutely amazing actionpacked funny great storyline and full of heroes that made it a great team up movie so many surprises as well extraordinarily well done allaround great movie
Jun 23 2015,positive,omg everyone was so amazing i was so sad when it finished
Jun 23 2015,positive,i wont give you a long winded review so ill just say in my opinion this may just be the best marvel movie to date great action great heart and the right amount of humor a humor enhanced by the presence of spiderman
Jun 23 2015,positive,i remember when marvel movies were fun just look at last years antman all of the infighting in this movie is decidedly a drag it has funny parts but its mostly takes itself too serious i can see kids being bored by all the politics the ending is anticlimactic
Jun 22 2015,positive,a cinematic event that culminates in a marvel universe masterpiece that has been 8 years in the making although the story deviated from the comic event the films action scenes are off the charts
Jun 22 2015,positive,the greatest superhero battle movie ever conceive this will quadripple your fantasies
Jun 21 2015,positive,possibly the best mcu film yet it was refreshing to have a super hero movie that didnt have the big bad that is destroying the world
Jun 21 2015,positive,freaking awesome movielove captain americaand tony was wrong
Jun 21 2015,positive,amazing in all ways funny emotional and action packed
Jun 20 2015,positive,so good cant wait for the new spiderman
Jun 20 2015,positive,excellent super hero film a worth successor to winter soldier does the best job at keeping several different story lines running in the marvel world since xmen 2 far better film than avengers age of ultron
Jun 20 2015,positive,for a movie with so many characters they did an amazing job  usually movies with so many main characters fall flat  this didnt happen here mostly because the character development was done in prior movies other than the two new main characters   they spent a good amount of time looking at each character but because there were so many of them it felt a little like we didnt get anywhere  sure there was progress on the plot but the plot wasnt significant because they had to look at each of the characters    also the underlying message was a bit concerning  captain america is arguing that he doesnt need international supervision because he the best hands are his own  sure that sounds great but remove the word captain and suddenly im not so sure  should america really be trusted to make international decisions  as the captain said its run by people and people have agendas      anyway the movie was quite entertaining and worth the watch
Jun 19 2015,positive,not the best of marvel films but really loved black panther intro and looking forward to infinity wars
Jun 18 2015,positive,i loved every moment of this movie never dull and not one plot hole the story was handled so well the action tension suspense idealsand we get to see other marvel heroes not fond of teen spiderman but still enjoyable one of the best of the best marvel movies thus far looking forward to more
Jun 18 2015,positive,the best superhero movie yet cant wait for the new spiderman movie
Jun 18 2015,positive,great movie love all the heroes but wish they kept spiderman out of it
Jun 17 2015,positive,this movie was amazing i wish it was longer
Jun 16 2015,positive,awesome drama and action
Jun 16 2015,positive,ironman and spiderman make this movie awesome
Jun 16 2015,positive,wow the emotion the action the cameo lol
Jun 16 2015,positive,fantastic from beginning to both endings
Jun 16 2015,positive,i wasnt going to write a review until i see dumb reviews with half stars if you just grading it that because you dont like superhero movies why waste your time and get on here    and if someone is dumb to vote high because someone else said so they are dumb to    this movie is an awesome movie the russo brothers did an outstanding job i play video games and i feel comic book movies are treated in the same fashion    like there cant be a compelling story in a comic book movie or video game this isnt art it is just something that the studios made to put asses in the seats and that could be nothing further from the truth if you are making lackluster video games or comic book movies these days you arent trying or you just arent good at filming making or in the case of fantastic four green lantern terrible direction and script bvs wasnt a horrible film but wasnt the expectation fans had for the film     captain america civil war could have been the culmination of the mcu and i would have been content if i didnt know anything about infinity wars it was done masterfully bring all the movies we have watched over this almost decade together cacw is the movie comic book fans can show off to critics and it stand on its on with other movies at award shows civil war is our revenant
Jun 16 2015,positive,weird how you run into people at the airport
Jun 16 2015,positive,best superhero movie to date from marvel i believe the airport scene is off the chain  really good and entertaining defo go watch it
Jun 15 2015,positive,a fabulous piece of superhero cinema and one of the best ever even beating out age of ultron in my opinion brilliant writing brilliant acting brilliant directing and overall a beautiful yet emotionally destructive movie    see full review on 
Jun 15 2015,positive,i call it a gateway movie as theres many movies spinning off from this one lol
Jun 15 2015,positive,best thing thing in the history of anything
Jun 15 2015,negative,not much plot not much intrigue no compelling bad guy not remotely as profound as it pretends to be i was bored a huge swing and miss for marvel
Jun 15 2015,positive,iron man vs captain america almost like war vs peace yet it was mostly control vs freedom it seemed to end a bit unexpectedly from my view with the story but quite unpredictable and a fine continuation for the avengers squad it seems to prove that there will be another buildup to something even bigger in the future antman makes his first debut in joining the gang as well as a couple other new heroes making their first appearances as well its obvious enough to know this film as captain america 3 and not iron man 4 i was fairly entertained as usual with the action scenes and overall it was a pretty unexpected and yet also an expected enough complex story that in hope will be a seriously memorable time for the avengers group and also hopefully a lesson well taught
Jun 15 2015,positive,the movie is a ton of fun spidey is amazing the airport scene is one of the best ive seen great action and some hilarious moments so much better than age of ultron
Jun 15 2015,positive,was flat out boring but good fight scenes
Jun 14 2015,positive,awsome movie seen it in 4dx i recommend it  will see the movie again
Jun 14 2015,positive,i had to wait with my little review after the world premiere so i dont spoil it for anybody i dont know how its possible that captain america films are actually the best ones from marvel cinematic universe while the first one was okay the second one was critically acclaimed and the third one was just brilliant if this was the last iron man film it would have been a decent send off certainly much better than iron man 3 and as we all know iron man will be in spiderman homecoming so  yaay anyway the best thing for marvel films as they are becoming repetitive now was spiderman and ant man  that was fun bujaaaaa
Jun 14 2015,positive,i might need to see this movie again to decide but this might be the best captain america movie and the best marvel movie  it is a top five marvel movie and it lived up to the hype  and there is one iconic shot in the movie that gave me chills  and antman has the big special effects suprise  it is a movie that has a story that could actually work without the superheroes it could be a spy thriller war story or political thriller  the movie does a good job at being fair to both captain america and iron man  you can understand both of their views and see that they both are trying to do what they think is right  this is a movie that gives you two viewpoints  do you trust private organizations like charities and businesses more or do you trust public institutions more like the government  are you more concerned about security or freedom  you can compare it to global politics  should america determine its own policies and lead the fighting of terrorism or should it lead from behind and allow global originations like the united nations to determine how we fight terrorism   again it is fair to both points of view there is a major twist to the story and while i saw it coming it was worth the wait in the end it comes down to something more personal friends and family vengeance and forgiveness
Jun 14 2015,positive,pains me to say it but this is far better than bvs great action and an amazing new spiderman to boot dc are still a long long way from this
Jun 14 2015,positive,do you even remember them  i remember all of them    this is the best marvel movie ever it was the perfect mixture of internal and political conflict the battles that the characters fought were both personal and political when the fighting wasnt happening you were either laughing or feeling all of the feels translation you were feeling conflicted sad suspenseful empathetic etc   watch this movie now
Jun 14 2015,positive,fantastic movie best marvel project yet cant wait to see it again
Jun 14 2015,positive,not too shabby cant wait for the others to come out
Jun 14 2015,positive,the critics got it right for once that was the best superhero movie to datesensationalthe airport sequence was amazingand they nailed it with new spiderman
Jun 13 2015,positive,this is the best marvel movie since the first ironman movie two thumbs up
Jun 13 2015,positive,whilst the action scenes were enjoyable and the introduction of spiderman into the marvel universe both a well done and welcomed one i couldnt help but feel captain america was a bit of a passenger in his own film there for the convenience of other characters relevance rather than his own     not as good as winter soldier in my opinion but better than age of ultron
Jun 13 2015,positive,absolutely class love the new spiderman and buzzing got to ant man go to giant man one of the best marvel movies so far if not the best
Jun 13 2015,positive,this movie had surprises and intrigue around every corner i absolutely loved it and was transfixed throughout you have got to see this on big screen what a story
Jun 13 2015,positive,epic marvel is running shit in the live action movies dc better step its game up teamblackpantherspiderman
Jun 13 2015,positive,one of the best movies ive seen hands down a must watch
Jun 13 2015,positive,from 1 to 10 this movie was 100 perfectly done humor great thought out plot the right mix of action and leaves you not only fully satisfied but wanting even more must see
Jun 12 2015,positive,this movie is amazing nonstop action never a dull moment my favorite marvel movie thus far
Jun 12 2015,positive,best comic book movie of the year
Jun 12 2015,positive,yup you saw that right 5 effing stars this is officially the best marvel movie ever made
Jun 12 2015,positive,all action and full of surprises
Jun 12 2015,positive,good  too many noisy people in the theatre
Jun 12 2015,positive,after the original avengers the best avengers andor captain america movie  great plot action humor drama cgi and editing made this a 4 12 star film  be sure to listen to the homage to a famous scifi sequel from 1980 the original came out in 1977 and stick around until the first part if the credits have run  otherwise you will miss an important part of the movie
Jun 12 2015,positive,top notch action with the greatest superhero throw down ever with emotions completely driving the story and the consequences of the past 12 movies all leading into this and then there was spiderman and black panther who were phenomenal and i loved them in this movie thank you marvel
Jun 11 2015,positive,it looks like a great movie if i could see the trailer
Jun 11 2015,positive,still cant stop smiling after seeing this movie  everything batman v superman tried to do and got wrong this movie got right  cant remember a time when i felt so much conflict as a viewer for the character on screen  the bar continues to be raised  job well done
Jun 11 2015,positive,with dennis macquarrie its okbut the near ending is better
Jun 11 2015,positive,really really good with some serious flaws at pivotal moments as a moviegoer less familiar with the comic book the movie falls way short of making it clear what the motivation is behind antman hawkeye and even spiderman to join the fray it is really weak plus the most compelling story in the movie the one between zemo and bucky is totally underplayed and would have made the ironman vs cap murica plotline so much more believable and heartbreaking but the action is great  the best of any marvel movie black panther is terrific so are the spiderman scenes
Jun 10 2015,positive,was an amazing movie i liked how spiderman and black panther was played and over all was awesome the story line was good i liked how they changed it from the comic books
Jun 10 2015,positive,fantastic edge of your seat action that is a joy to watch weak villain and his subplot but overall very good and satisfying perfect spiderman
Jun 10 2015,positive,awesome movie well worth seeing in the theater
Jun 9 2015,positive,everything i was hoping for  nothing more than whats expected from mcu
Jun 9 2015,positive,marvel backslid with this convoluted mess the first 23 had me but the tacked on plot that restarts the conflict between tony and steve was nonsensical and undermined the character of tony stark as established in this film series spiderman and giant man are the only reasons im giving this three stars instead of two utterly disappointed
Jun 9 2015,positive,brilliantthis is definitely how to do ittake note dc loved the new characters
Jun 7 2015,positive,one of the greatest super hero movie scenes of all time wrapped in two additional hours of boring shit
Jun 7 2015,positive,marvel can do no wrong shut up and take my money
Jun 7 2015,positive,everything a superhero movie should be plus a whole lot more
Jun 7 2015,positive,might be the best mcu movie to date
Jun 7 2015,positive,great movie cant wait to see the new spiderman movies this new guy is funny
Jun 6 2015,positive,captain america civil war was good even really good but it is far from great the new spiderman not being a huge spiderman fan myself and seeing a live action the black panther are the best parts im borderline between a 3 and a 4 of 5 so ill round up    5 loved it 4 really liked it 3 liked it 2 didnt like it and 1 hated it
Jun 6 2015,positive,amazing movie certainly one of the best thus far coming from the mcu
Jun 6 2015,positive,incredibly awesome smart funny unbelievably action packed black panther is the shit spiderman was spectacular fucking amazing 9510
Jun 6 2015,positive,i thought it was well done and the story line was goodi think they are taking stark and rogers to the extremes in their characters and i thought bvs was betterjust saying
Jun 6 2015,positive,whereas a great director in sam raimi couldnt balance 35 character arcs in spiderman 3 captain america civil war successfully balances 711 stories iron man captain america black panther spiderman the vision scarlet witch and the winter soldier and to lesser degrees black widow rhyno hawkeye and antman and it is probably the best character development in the marvel cinematic universe especially when it comes to newbie black panther only rivaled by captain america the first avenger but its even better than that movie in other departments namely the action setpieces two of the main three spectacles stand out in the mcu and indeed all of comic films in that they no longer feels like video game levels they feel like legitimate conflicts where each character has their own emotional motivation and their thoughts and feelings progress throughout the fighting most important civil war brings what is quite possibly the debate of 21st century american politics  freedom vs security  in a very intelligent twosided discussion bringing valid arguments of both sides in manners typically storydriven minimizing the necessary amount of dialogue that would contribute to the argument the movie flies through its impressively short runtime outside of the ending finally the plot twist  holy crap go see civil war it is the first movie in this shared universe series to earn its high tomatometer rating
Jun 6 2015,positive,this movie may have just created the next great step into the superhero movie genre the way it tagged multiple superhero movies into one mindblowing its a push and pull even harder at your thoughts type of movie my god is this a absolute 55
Jun 6 2015,positive,one of the best marvel movies if not one of the best superhero movies ever made with a great cast that is also visually stunning and great twists and an amazing story arch captain america civil war is one of the best movies ive seen this year
Jun 5 2015,positive,maybe not as incredible as everyone is making it out to be but an absolutely awesome fight scene maybe the best one in a marvel movie but the movie is exciting fun dramatic and every character gets a cool moment super fun and sad at moments but has a lot of dull moments the villain is boring and ultimately the climax of the movie can be anti climactic
Jun 5 2015,positive,one of the all time great films of our time
Jun 5 2015,positive,actually enjoyed it was pleasantly surprised by turn of story
Jun 5 2015,positive,ive waited a year to see this movie and ill say i it was worth the wait great flim
Jun 5 2015,positive,marvel has done it again great movie it was very emotional and had a lot of excellent actions
Jun 4 2015,positive,even better then the winter soldier
Jun 4 2015,positive,fantastic from start to finish the fight scenes were great  ant man and the new spider man were excellent a must see if you have no plans today go see it trust me you will be happy that you did
Jun 4 2015,positive,excellent movie a lot of action that has you at the edge of your seat it was a very well put together movie
Jun 4 2015,positive,action packed amazing funny spiderman  black panther were awesome and this is the best marvel movie since the avengers
Jun 3 2015,positive,absolutely the best yet total action
Jun 3 2015,positive,great film has the best superhero fighting scene to date both spiderman and black panther are great addition to the marvel cinematic universe 810
Jun 2 2015,positive,solid ensemble cast movie i want to give it 45 but there were many things it did wrong
Jun 2 2015,positive,civil war offers are much more emotionally powerful film than any installment in the mcu and you cant help but care for these characters it also allows the audience to develop their own opinion on who is right or wrong without forcing you either way you understand where every single character is coming from their are no mindless evil plots to destroy the world or cliche powerhunger evil villains that was what civil war really did well and i loved that aspect my problems were with the action sequences those scenes themselves were extremely shaky and hard to follow especially with the insane stunts that were going on but mostly i didnt like how frequent they were this movie couldnt wait to blow stuff up when i cared infinitely more about the story and characters it was actually becoming frustrating only 2 or 3 action scenes were necessary when they had almost triple that
Jun 2 2015,positive,in my humble opinion this film absolutely lived up to the hype it blended the story and the action together spectacularly with just enough humor spaced throughout to avoid the film feeling over saturated of it the movie was well paced with action from start to finish keeping the viewer wondering what would come next both sides are clearly defined but in a way so the viewer can empathize with either of them as with any war each side takes significant losses and this civil war is no different while there are victories on both sides they are not without their casualties which reminds us that conflict of any kind comes with its costs i look forward to seeing the future of the franchise and the ramifications of this movie in films to come
Jun 2 2015,positive,i thought id be falling asleep in my recliner chair late night on a week day but that was not the case time flew by tons of action great character integration highly recommend my 14 year old son loved it too
Jun 2 2015,positive,solid marvel installment with some good doses of humor and action the story was interesting but a bit convoluted and am tired of the bucky focus new characters were really good and looking forward to their next installments
Jun 1 2015,positive,quite possibly marvels best movie to date everything about this movie worked and worked great the new editions of black panther and spiderman were fantastic arguably the best on screen portrayal of spiderman so far after seeing this im super excited to see solo black panther and spiderman films as always cap gives this movie a lot of heart but downey jr also brings a lot to it this time around paul rudd was great again as antman and paul bettany brings great human qualities to vision im very excited to see how these events will shape the mcu going forward i highly recommend this movie check it out
Jun 1 2015,positive,great movie loved it
Jun 1 2015,positive,good movie  not the best marvel movie ever but it was decent  4 out of 5 for me  not better than bvs lol
Jun 1 2015,positive,i just got to watch an advanced screening of captain america civil war and before you continue you should know there will be no spoilers just general thoughts about this film   okay lets begin shall we   so before the movie even started   ready  wait for it  chris evans and sebastian stan who play the two main characters in civil war captain america and bucky barnes show up to the theater to welcome us and yeah did i mention life changing   on to the movie   the movie starts and within the first 15 minutes i already want to rewatch everything ive already seen they throw you into a political war film and you feel it heat from both sides you understand why they are fighting and you never quite know who to root for because they are both right from start to finish this movie is a heart wrencher and when i say that i mean parts of the film literally had my heart beating 110 mph   not to mention the fightaction scenes in this movie are the best action scenes in any super hero movie if not the best of all time i know what youre thinking all time whatever but just wait youll understand from the introduction of black panther and antman into this family of heros to the best spiderman we have ever seen on the big screen this movie will have you locked in for the whole two hours and thirty one minutes and leave you asking where did the time go   so there you have it captain america civil war  if you were wondering what was bad well    nothing   it joins the 55 club possibly topping the avengers and becoming the best super hero movie of all time possibly ill let you know after my 15th watch
Jun 1 2015,positive,theres only one word  captastic  and spidey is ok
Jun 1 2015,positive,batman v superman cant hold civil wars dk   civil war amazing
May 31 2015,positive,arguably the best marvel cinematic universe movie to date if youre a fan of these movies you will really enjoy it highly recommended
May 31 2015,positive,i loved the fight between the two teams at the airport that was brilliantly done every character was great there i found myself switching from team cap to team stark as the film went on which surprised me i wouldnt say this is the best mcu film so far though  probably top 5 maybe top 3 but still not as good as avengers assemble or guardians
May 31 2015,positive,good setup and did not overdo all the characters
May 31 2015,positive,so i believe a movie sequel should be able to hold its own without having to see the prequel this movie definitely doesnt having missed some of the films i found myself lost at what was going on luckily chris evans made it better by just being on screen decent film outside of the extreme confusion from not being a marvel super fan
May 31 2015,positive,if you like marvel stuff youll like this shaky cam throughout  because the scenes are so fast moving you dont notice it as much as expected great movie introducing a couple of new characters
May 31 2015,positive,the best mcu fight scene ever this movie in light where it needs to be dark where it needs to be and it sucks you into this conflict thats going on it rewards you for watching the mcu movies before it creates characters for which you feel their agony and pain and creates a conflict which has part of you divided
May 30 2015,positive,i thought the beginning of this movie was so slow until about an hour in once the gang got together and they introduced the new spiderman and brought in ant man the movie got 100 more interesting
May 30 2015,positive,here it is if you dont want to see anything that could count as a spoiler then you should look away right now go on  still here okay here we go i warned you    wow dare i say this is the best movie in the mcu to date writers chrstopher markus and stephen mcfeely along with tier one directors joe and anthony russo have topped their excellent work with winter soldier this is how you handle multiple heroes dont be fooled though  this isnt avengers 25 although youll probably take this one over the clunkiness of age of ultron any day at the heart this is caps movie and chris evans has never been better in the role adding surprising new depth is robert downey jr as tony starkiron man it was hard to imagine downey breaking new ground with a character hes played for 6 movies now sans cameos but here we see tony at his most vulnerable and possibly darkest winter soldier gave us more of the manoutoftime view with cap now its how does a man with an unwavering moral compass fit into a world where governments are under constant scrutiny and collateral damage to super hero fights is a very realworld situation with dire consequences these are just a few of the hardhitting questions the film asks and never gives a black and white answer in a year where were getting multiple hero vs hero films this film treats the setup with more maturity most times were given situations where if the heroes just sat down and talked all the fighting could be avoided that isnt the case in civil war both views are discussed multiple times sometimes with each side seeing why the others view is appealing however once the action kicks in youre invested the film shows that fighting while the last resort is the only tactic left for either side    then theres the new players chadwick boseman as prince tchalablack panthers role isnt always at the forefront but his presence always feels motivated as does tom holland as marvels most popular character spiderman holland does what the previous actors struggled with  finding the balance between peter parker and spidey from the moment hes introduced you believe he is the nerdy techsavvy teenager whos been given these incredible abilities his intro is funny endearing and a fantastic handling of the character and once he dons the red and blue tights spiderman steals the show spidermans scenes arent essential to the plot and the movie still works if you cut him out entirely but damn if he isnt fun to watch welcome home spidey youve been sorely missed    without giving it away the ending is vastly different to any of the mcu films that have come before the same can be said for the whole film one downside to these films with the exception of tom hiddlestons loki is that marvel films suffer from onedimensional villains however the villains simple motivation works to advance the plot audiences arent coming to see some master manipulator  they want to see these heroes weve watched over 12 films now wow fight it out and these are some of the most brutal fights ever captured in these films    in short civil war has so much going against it that it shouldve fallen apart however it finds the perfect method of balancing multiple characters i think the most thatve ever been in a marvel film while still remaining a captain america story at heart its hard to talk about sebastian stans bucky barneswinter soldier without giving anything away so ill stop here go see this film and spring for imax  the airport fight scene will amaze you in the biggest format available
May 30 2015,positive,full of twists and turns civil war tells its story perfectly and keeps a perfect balance of emotions adding humor and comedy relief right where its needed
May 30 2015,positive,the biggest and best marvel film yet just missed the hulk for me
May 30 2015,positive,pretty freakin good
May 30 2015,positive,five stars and above marvel movies never fail to entertain
May 30 2015,positive,more like avengerscivil war
May 30 2015,positive,really good movie characters were great good actors in the ending is really emotional
May 29 2015,positive,great addition to the storyline loved the new superhero additions to the lineups
May 29 2015,positive,so good they brought in some of my favorite characters
May 29 2015,positive,well another avengers movie i didnt like it as much as my grandson the airport fight scene with the humor of ant man and spider man was great but i really couldnt follow the background not having seen the winter soldier
May 29 2015,negative,so many missed story opportunities filled with little appeal    im a comic book fan but im more a story fan than the type that goes crazy over seeing spiderman with tony stark  there was no real reason for this movie other than to make a deal with sony and marvel the better story from the comics was completely lost
May 28 2015,positive,awesome non stop action well done and will see it again
May 28 2015,positive,amazing i didnt expect anything less
May 28 2015,positive,enjoyed black panther and spiderman  emotional story  rdjironman got emotional in this story  nice change instead of constant cockiness
May 28 2015,positive,captain america has not disappointed me yet wow
May 27 2015,positive,great version of civil war russo brothers have succeeded
May 27 2015,positive,thats how a super hero conflict movie should be made
May 27 2015,positive,nice job    very well done like how they tied in that bucky was the one responsible for tonys parents death
May 27 2015,positive,amazing loved it
May 27 2015,positive,another great movie by marvel studios
May 26 2015,positive,just simply amazing perf ft for what youre looking for in a movie not just a super hero movie a great time fun action adventure a twist a few surprises and just great characters and fights cant wait to see where they go next
May 26 2015,positive,another classic from the house of marvel
May 25 2015,positive,what an incredible movie the story was awesome and the characters were great this was the best story line of the mcu this movie is gonna make some money
May 25 2015,positive,theres a lot to be said about this movie but bottom line is it is absolutely fantastic after being disappointed with a recent superhero duel dawn of justice i was relieved to see a fight that actually had meaning to it and reasons doing so the villain zemo was a little weak but the appearance of spiderman made up for it as hes welcomed into the marvel cinematic universe in grand fashion tom holland practically steals the show and i cant wait to more of his interpretation of spiderman in homecoming
May 25 2015,negative,spoiler alert      this film was so crap people were queuing up outside the cinema for fertiliser full review to come when i recover
May 25 2015,positive,it truly was iron man 4 great cast of characters great locations  a great story background for the main villian
May 25 2015,positive,i think its safe to say the russo brothers are a force to be reckoned with what a complete movie for the life of me i dont understand how you can have so many complex characters to deal with in just one movie and nail it like this this makes batman vs superman look like a made for tv movie by far the best marvel film ever made
May 25 2015,positive,superhero movies dont get better than this pure comic book gold another slam dunk by marvel
May 25 2015,positive,it was really good i cant wait for the next movie
May 25 2015,positive,emotionally loaded heartpumping action and characters you can get behind go see this in imax
May 25 2015,positive,it was decent not the best of the avenger movies this movie really seemed to be a setup for marvel movies to come a foundation movie its difficult to be overly thrilled when a movie has no real villains everyone in the film is a hero with differing points of view
May 24 2015,positive,extraordinary leaves you wanting way more in a good way
May 24 2015,positive,this movie is the best marvel super hero marvel cinematic universe film of all in my opinion the roles for all the characters the cgi and the story was just so superb i just dont know how else to say it joe and anthony russo had a great direction in this and hope they do just as great in avengers infinity war
May 24 2015,positive,best superhero movie since the last batman movies spiderman appearance cant wait to see the upcoming movies in this series
May 24 2015,positive,very very cool loved what they did wth spider man
May 23 2015,positive,good solid movie nothing amazing but a good performance from the cast with a good written story     the movie presents two compelling opposing views which sets the stage for our heroes the story is held together throughout the movie with the personal stories and issues of both captain america and iron man from beginning to end it is a good story for our time considering it touches on issues of security vs personal freedom     i recommend this film for any comic fan and those wanting to get a good story
May 23 2015,positive,words cant even describe wow i could write an essay about this flawless movie but im just gonna sit back and let it sink in best mcu no superhero no movie possibly ever imo
May 23 2015,positive,great movie great cast would like to see more of the webslinger in future avengers movies enjoyed it from the beginning all the way to the end based on this movie i kind of already know how the next avengers movie expected to be released in 2018 is going to play out only negative is that it seemed more like the avengers and not a captain america movie 455
May 23 2015,positive,if i could i would give this movie more than five stars tom holland plays a way better spiderman than tobey maguire and andrew garfield did
May 23 2015,positive,good movie i feel like spiderman may have been portrayed a little to young and starstruck good mix of action drama and comedy otherwise
May 23 2015,positive,a overall awesome movie very balanced and spidey was amazing looking forward to spiderman homecoming a must see
May 23 2015,positive,another near flawless masterpiece of casting storyline and special affects the juggernaut marvel continues to dominate the industry heres a suggestion for movie makers if your film opens the same weekend as a marvel flix  change the opening date
May 22 2015,positive,good not my favorite perfectly fine within series would definitely watch again but not sure its a need to own for me
May 22 2015,positive,captain america civil war 2016    this was such a good movie this was the 2nd avengers movie we should have have had instead of age of ultron this is the redemption avengers film after seeing age of ultron this is a film where everyone will find something to like     this is probably this best captain america film because this film helped to develop characters the most of captain america as well as the surrounding characters this movie also went into directions you would never suspect it to go     it was great seeing the development and interaction of characters you were not exactly sure which direction they would go and to see this in this film is what we all want to see     this film also goes into the loss factor and     i loved seeing antman and had the special surprise of turning gigantic    i surprised by how rhodes and how vision got involved     i was interested in how they developed vision     i loved the actor who played spiderman in this film he had some great lines in this movie i loved his introduction with tony stark i was not sure about it because i was skeptical about the look of the costume looking too much like the 1960s version     i loved the early tech in peter parkers room to show what kind character he is     this film just has me much more excited to see what we see next in the super hero films     this film film travels all over the world and i was not expecting that this film actually travels to more parts of the world than seen in any of the super hero films including age of ultron but this film does a great job of not spending too much or too little amount of time in each location     i was not expecting the twist of black panthers costume being made out of the same material as captain americas shield     this film does fail to answer where is thor hulk or nick fury are in this film nick fury is not even mentioned in this film     after seeing this film i just want to see and understand to know more about black panthers origins and what drives him     i was surprised to hear bucky was not only brain washed by the nazis at hydra modern hydra and now we learn he was also brainwashed by the ussr communist this only makes you feel more sympathetic towards bucky     this film did a great job of explaining how tonk stark and steve rogers could flip on one working for the global government under contract vs making the decisions for themselves     i think this film went further in much more depth as far as relationships and loss     the russo brothers did a great job on this film on all cylinders making this a great film but also being able to make you invest in why they are on the side they are this film also felt the most like a captain america and a avengers film more so than any other film     you felt invested in the conflicts but you also did not want to see anyone get hurt in this film in this film we see people we care about get hurt such as iron man bucky barns captain america rhodes the entire stark family and agent carter     what i think is interesting is in this we finally see what exactly happened with the stark family and who was tonys mother i was not counting on seeing that in this film    this film did a great job showing what tony stark looked like younger back in 1991 amazing     i enjoyed this film and it is one i will buy     i wish we got a little more from agent carters niece i did not get enough character development from her in this film      i wish that there was less hand held and quick cuts in the action sequences it looked sloppy and it was difficult to even follow what all exactly was going on in this film     i did love the action sequences in this film and how each sequence in this film you were very much character and emotionally invested in the scene     i loved the tunnel chase it was awesome i also enjoyed the final fight between tony bucky and steve rogers    i was not exactly sure how that was going to be pulled off in this film as far as how come they would go at each others throats but this film did it well   it may be possible to say this battle may even be equal to the final conflict between luke and vader in empire strikes back     every conflict in this film is invested at the heart     i think it is interesting how it is black panther at the end of the day who is the one able to clearly see how to deal with the bad guy not captain america or iron man an interesting twist i did not foresee     i love the two end credit sequences     i loved how spiderman is the one who makes the remarks about the atats in the empire strikes back     what i think this film did a great job at concerning the timing and introduction of each character this film gave each charter a good introduction and they were not all introduced at once but were given their due they appear in the film where you are super excited when they finally do appear in this film     this film does take an interesting twist making aunt may young rather than old also the home looks different and more comforting than seen in previous films     this film i felt like this film was much better than age of ultron however i think this film needed more work on the motivations to the villain it was mentioned but never gone into enough in emotional depth     i think that this film got more out of bucky and steve rogers characters background and past than had been done and told before in previous films which helped me to better invest in the characters more    i think it was interesting how we thought about how many civilians do super heroes kill or harm while trying to protect the greater whole     this film also got me back to being invested into rhodes character once again after seeing the first iron man film honestly i have not really been invested in the character of rhodes at all since the actor change this film brought back the heart of tony starks relationship once again particularly after seeing what vision does     i think what i think this film was missing is seeing more switching within the film of sides i was expecting more switches within the film of hawkeye scarlett witch vision rhodes antman spiderman black panther captain america and iron man like i was expecting that within the film all of these characters would continually switch sides based upon perspective     i think that this film takes an interesting choice when it comes to the the musical score this film does not incorporate any of the established themes from the previous films but instead goes more towards following the emotional rout
May 22 2015,positive,overall the best marvel movie yet but i feel it had a lackluster main fight and a few letdowns
May 22 2015,positive,excellent i really enjoyed it although i did feel that they played certain elements a little safe
May 22 2015,positive,a very epic awesome movie better than the winter soldier for sure worth seeing in the theaters 2x
May 22 2015,positive,i give this movie 5 stars but really the title of this was an upset marvel and the russo bros tried to give  us an adaptation of the comic with the same name but instead feels like a direct sequel of the winter soldier that was my only concern out of that the movie is amazing it have too much characters but never felt ovestuffed all the characters shine in this one being the more surprising the new characters of the mcu the russo gave us an excellent drama with excellent action in this one i cant wait what marvel have in stuff for the next few years
May 22 2015,positive,loved it even though there were inaccuracies that were in the comics but not in the movie or things that were in the movie but not in the comics all in all its an epic movie
May 21 2015,positive,best marvel movie ive seen so far everyone is awesome and spiderman steals the movie
May 21 2015,positive,could of did better with the villain
May 21 2015,positive,best movie ever made  teamcapistherightchoicetomake
May 21 2015,positive,its off the chart worth watching over and over again
May 21 2015,neutral,a big let down after the last one dont think i get the super hero v super hero genre
May 21 2015,positive,absolutely amazing and one of the best films ive ever seen
May 21 2015,positive,exactly what a superhero movie should be
May 20 2015,positive,for the most part this was fun but there are some really dull moments winter soldier is better but this beats out age of ultron
May 20 2015,positive,impressive shocking great cast on point
May 20 2015,positive,nonstop action and the pacing was really good  cool to see new characters like black panther and spiderman in the marvel u
May 20 2015,positive,standard marvel greatness cant wait for more
May 20 2015,positive,strong work by the leads best integration of new characters black panther and spiderman ever
May 19 2015,positive,captain america civil war was everything i wanted in a marvel movie
May 19 2015,positive,um can you say black panther the tiein towards the final sequence was perf  however with all the cameos and addons seemed more like an avengers 3 than a captain america movie  kind of sad steve cant even be the star of his own film
May 19 2015,positive,im a dork and biased but i just loved how almost everyone was in the movie and how it introduced new characters
May 19 2015,positive,starts out kind of slow but the movie was mostly about iron man and captain american and the winter soldier   overall it was not a bad movie
May 18 2015,positive,much better than i anticipated since i wasnt trilled about seeing infighting between my two favorite marvel heroes they did a great job with the build up for seeing why they were on opposite sides and kept this long movie moving along    the one thing i disliked was how additional marvel characters somewhat abruptly came in and out at times generally it made sense but would think slightly more build up within this long adventure     solid marvel movie though
May 18 2015,positive,can not express in words how amazing this movie is
May 18 2015,positive,one of the best marvel movies
May 18 2015,positive,loved this movie great action and battles the tension between rogers and stark had been brewing for years spiderman and antman were a pleasant and funny surprise
May 18 2015,positive,this one is up there with guardians  the avengers originalnot as good as those but better than the winter soldier
May 18 2015,positive,a best damn movie of the year no question
May 18 2015,positive,best marvel movie to date
May 17 2015,positive,good but not winter soldier good
May 17 2015,positive,great calibration of all heros in one movie and way better then age of ultron a2
May 17 2015,positive,this review is likely to contain spoilers captain america has always been my favorite marvel hero he does good for the sake of doing good and he was always the moral center of everything captain america civil war goes back on everything the mcu has built tearing it down brick by brick and breaking that moral compass in the process this time around our heroes come face to face with the government and each other as they pick sides of a new legislation that dictates how the avengers operate this isnt typical hero fare the russos have continued their phenomenal rebirth of captain america and have decided to take a more mature route not darker because there are plenty of moments of levity but definitely one that might leave the little ones scratching their heads or yawning until the fisticuffs are thrown down the story gives ample time to the avengers letting us get inside their heads so we can see what makes them tick we get a lot of new revelations about these heroes and some astounding acting really helps bring this home especially chris evans and robert downey jr if it wasnt impossible to picture anyone but them in the role it is now we get a side we dont often see in our heroes today fear fear that the choices they make no matter what are the wrong ones this is beautifully portrayed by the cast and the exceptional writing gives them plenty to work with and as for the acting the returning players are great but we have two newbies to welcome black panther and spiderman chadwick boseman makes for a fantastic black panther despite being his introduction we already get a perfect sense at the type of man he is which will make for a very compelling solo outing and then theres spidey this is our third spiderman in less than ten years which makes me even happier to say that tom holland is the definitive wallcrawler hes the right age cor starters but we finally have a spiderman who we believe is capable of everything he can do and his chemistry with the cast is already extremely evident im just going to say that he is our definitive spiderman i would also like to point out the fantastic and jaw dropping visual effects especially a particular scene in the beginning i was stunned by the jungle book last month and im still stunned by the wonders visual effects can do still side notefun fact they used rotoscoping for giant man which is so awesome pardon my inner film school nerd at the end of the day civil war divides a house that has been built over the course of eight years there are no easy answers or sides to choose but there is two and a half hours of the best superhero film ever made
May 17 2015,positive,the development of the marvel cinematic universe brought new life to the super hero film genre injecting it with the sequential grandeur heart global and historical perspective and yes occasional mediocrity that have been present in comics for decades in the eight years since the first iron man marvel has constantly redefined its own universe breaking ground on new ideas and concepts and minus a few halfduds age of ultron most notably has really only had its genre supremacy challenged by itself and deadpool all of that being said this is by a wide margin the best marvel studios film to date taking the crown of guardians of the galaxy and running so far away from it that groot and crew cant hope to catch up until next years volume 2 of course the perfect blend of political drama social commentary perfectly balanced and at times laugh out loud comedy deep character development for basically every member of the massive cast and some of the best fight choreography seen outside of japan in quite a while the russo brothers have officially raised the bar not only for themselves and their work on the upcoming avengers infinity war duology but for every phase 3 marvel movie that follows     oh also spiderman is in this movie so bonus points right off the bat for that
May 17 2015,positive,really good with lots of action
May 17 2015,positive,freeking awesome i mean really zero complaints go ahead spend some of that hard earned money and take the family to see this one boom
May 17 2015,positive,the greatest comic book movie ever made very emotionally powerful characters and a story that you care about great new characters with black panther and the best on screen spiderman to date
May 17 2015,positive,marvel has created yet another hit this one fires on all cylinders it has it all brains heart humor and insanely entertaining action scenes theres so much that works in this movie that id like to get through the minor flaws first i think the movie has a lot of characters so at times its tough to give everyone enough time to develop which only somewhat hinders some of the overall pacing of the movie also like every marvel movie after the avengers the villain isnt particularly great but his motives are clear and  this type of movie doesnt really heavily rely on a great villain since both sides are the protagonist and antagonist now that thats out of the way what i liked and oh boy there is so much going into this movie i was team captain america all the way walking out i still leaned toward his side much more than iron man however throughout the movie i could see pros and cons of both characters clashing ideologies when a movie can make you do that you certainly respect it every character is entertaining in their own way and the new additions are all excellent including a standout portrayal of spiderman from newcomer tom holland the best portrayal of the character ive seen and ive been a fan since i was five years old the action scenes in this movie are so well put together and so much fun the finale takes an approach i did not see coming and it really does pay off emotionally dont get me wrong though there is plenty of the marvel style humor weve come to expect and as always its just the right amount the movie ends on a thought provoking note and i am so excited to see where the marvel cinematic universe goes next go see this movie its what blockbusters are meant to be like it is definitely among my favorite marvel movies so far
May 17 2015,positive,this movie just stomped on me as i watched in awe of how great super hero movies can be
May 17 2015,positive,waring spoilers      the movie was great and i think many would enjoy it but during the battle scene i saw some cgi problems then when tony broke his arm he went into battle and his arm wasnt broken so four and a half
May 17 2015,positive,hands down the best marvel movie yet with the greatest super hero beat down and probably one of my favorite action scenes of all time this one is going to be tough to beat every other move this summer
May 16 2015,positive,amazing well done  loved seeing new characters and others as spide man and ant man play around great effects and story a
May 16 2015,positive,it wouldve been 5 stars but i shouldnt be attracted to spideys aunt may it makes me feel old
May 16 2015,positive,awesome  loved spiderman   finally seemed like they got him right
May 16 2015,positive,i love the captain america movies and this is another solid entry
May 16 2015,positive,awesome superhero movie
May 16 2015,positive,totally an awesome movie super funny and great action spiderman and black panther are amazing
May 16 2015,positive,amazing from start to finish
May 16 2015,positive,i wonder whatll happen in the next movie
May 16 2015,positive,unlike zack snyder and wbdc the russo brothers and marvel know exactly what they want to do and how to execute it properly they do an excellent job of building up the tension between the 2 heroes and the whole time you feel conflicted with what is right and wrong and for what each hero is fighting for unlike batman  supermans battle which has no substance or reasoning that makes any sense this battle is emotionally and physically intense the airport battle scene is also a memorable fight sequence that fans will be talking about for years  this is hands down the best marvel film to date
May 16 2015,positive,awesome nuff said i cant decide which side i want to be on
May 16 2015,positive,quite the best marvel film that theres been
May 15 2015,positive,this movie was a blockbuster yes the dialogue could have been better at times but i mean the action sequences in this movie a fucking plus
May 15 2015,positive,great movie wish they followed the comic
May 15 2015,neutral,winter solider i gave a 5 because i was always on the edge of my seat the first avenger i gave a 45 because it was a backstory i already knew but this one had moments i wasnt paying attention and cooked a steak while glancing every few seconds and using facebook it was a let down maybe after watching it a couple more times i may give it a 3 but no more than a 4 and thats being kind it is overrated and hyped up as ive been told and read i dont think its any better than blade 2 i would rather watch thomas janes the punisher
May 15 2015,positive,the most anticipated movie of the year for many is captain america civil war does it live up to the hype it indeed does this is an action thriller that is one of the best superhero films we have had to date only flaw 20 minutes of the movie go to showing everything going against the avengers at the time it dragged a bit in my opinion great movie other wise
May 15 2015,positive,slow pace after the opening action sequence but the pace quickens nicely in the second half great action new characters surprises and lots of funny oneliners pay no attention to the gaping plot holes not one but two additional scenes after the credits
May 15 2015,positive,i really enjoyed the dialogue and action from start to finish
May 15 2015,positive,the captain america films have always been my favorite and in my opinion the best of marvel franchises from the first avenger to the winter soldier and now civil war this comic hero story is as close to flawless as marvel is ever going to get the russo bros succeed in combining heart racing action and comic relief while not  overshadowing comprehensive sequences that require a slower pace the stunts the fight choreography and the visual effects did a great deal in enhancing the movie experience so to simply phrase it this movie is awesome
May 15 2015,positive,i loved to watch the marvel superheroes fight each other
May 15 2015,positive,spoiler free   went in with high hopes came out loving the film   spiderman  black panther  antman were brilliant   still gonna stick with teamironman
May 14 2015,positive,we have all felt the buildup of the events that are captain america civil war over the past year between the trailers photos rumors to the reveal of spiderman coming back to the mcu to the addition to an unknown in black panther the hype for this film couldnt have been greater and it worried many including myself praying it would come out as good as i wanted it to i can honestly say now after seeing it at the thursday night showings that marvel couldnt have done a better job of bringing in the russo brothers to do this film and set the tone for the forever changed avengers and marvel cinematic universe    lets start with the plot and writing because with a film of this magnitude better have a plot that doesnt fail unless the movie tile is bvs sorry i had to do it you get the gist of whats going to happen its titled civil war for christ sakes iron man and captain america are at their differences which could be seen building in the previous avengers film stark thinks that the avengers need to be put in check to reduce collateral damage in their missions cap thinks differently that they shouldnt have to be called to help people that it is in their hands only ultimately this leads to a battle between friends theres so much more that goes on a couple big plot twists towards the end to really raise the bar of the fight but i wont reveal that since im always spoiler free but with so much going on in this film it looked like there was no way it would come out ok and not a jumbled mess of super heroes there was just enough introduction to the teams if you will to make it ok enough to get by because lets be honest we just wanted to see some action and turmoil between friends the russo brothers who directed this and captain america the winter soldier did a fantastic job they bring a tone to marvel films that isnt really the trademark for them and it works its more political not as cartoony its a tad darker and touches on deeper elements of emotion that most of the mcu films do but it works and yes there is jokes of course it wouldnt be right it they were absent but just at a slower pace it will be exciting to see where they take the infinity wars films with the more complex direction theyre headed here    no more messing around lets talk spidey its the moment all marvel fans have been waiting for the glorious return of marvels golden child in the proper form back to the mcu ill touch base on a few characters but thats it otherwise it would be the longest review ever tom holland teenage actor brought in to fill peter parkers high school tennis shoes and web slinging onesie over the years i wouldve put money down on tobey mcguire being the best parkerspiderman we will see until the mcu brought this kid in hes everything you want from the role smart funny quick with his words completely oblivious to the danger hes in when he is on a roll and loveable the future is bright for spidey in the mcu and it is because of the scene stealing web shooting tom holland bravo kid and welcome home my personal favorite black panther a king driven by angst and revenge and a complete badass all together this is the stand alone films im probably looking forward to the most and chadwick boseman you definitely suit this role obviously downey jr evans johansson stan rudd and everyone else are great they wouldnt have the job still if they couldnt be great so i wont get into detail about the whole cast    overall i cant give it a perfect 55 i wish i could but i cant and its not because i dont want to its because it wasnt perfect it has its flaws some have said not enough action too much dialogue i say bogus the only thing i think i dont like about the film was i was kind of expecting a major death of sorts which is fair id say considering the novel and the fact that if you die in the mcu youre not really dead coulson bucky loki but overall it may be the best ensemble marvel film to date not overall but ensemble film its neck and neck with the avengers but its definitely in the top 3 overall i would say just seeing it all kind of come together makes a guy all giddy and warm inside but maybe im just a nerd looking forward to the upcoming marvel films in the forthcoming years go see it go see it twice you know you want to just be ready for a whole lot of fun and you wishing spidey was in it more 455 jd
May 14 2015,positive,i enjoyed the film superhero movie by the numbers which marvel do so well spiderman definitely stole the show despite only briefly appearing 
May 14 2015,positive,captain america civil war is not only the best captain america movies but possibly the best marvel movie the writing and the acting are spot on which compliments the fantastic actors robert downey jr and chris evans if that wasnt enough the action sequences are some of the best with one in particular standing out unlike some marvel movies the actions in this movie will affect the ones to come
May 14 2015,positive,so comparatively speaking this movie was waaay better than its dc counterpart  great visually great character building great story and consistent motivations across the board  it really made it hard to pick a side in this civil war  i ultimately fell on the side if iron man  for me best of all was the introduction of the black panther  marvel kept it completely 100 with their depiction of the wakandan king  his demeanor  his costume was just awesome  chadwick boseman portrayed him perfectly  the introduction of spiderman the russo brothers have my complete faith as they undertake the next avengers project  theyve proved to me that they can make an awesome movie that just happen to star super heroes  this if my number 1 superhero movie of 2016 hands down
May 13 2015,positive,best movie so far this year great story  the greatest action ive seen in years everyone killed it
May 13 2015,positive,best superhero movie ever
May 13 2015,positive,stop reading and go see itnow
May 13 2015,positive,this is a fantastic movie its really marvels golden age
May 13 2015,positive,captain america civil war is marvels most mature actionfueled and emotional film yet a tourdeforce of acting and drama another reason why superhero films can be something special
May 13 2015,positive,i loved it sooooo much especially when we got to know about winter during his active days
May 13 2015,positive,balances the huge cast much better than avengers age of ultron giving everyone a chance to shine while adding some perfectly cast new blood to the mix  there is so much manpain on display in the main storyline which builds to an intense climax  my only complaint is that the villain is rather forgettable existing only to advance the plot
May 12 2015,positive,i would like to add two more âïâï
May 12 2015,positive,really good film marvel not disappointing at the moment   great story although a little slow at points  they could have cut at least 20 mins out of this film   dc this is how you make a superhero film
May 12 2015,positive,captain america civil war was amazing the best marvel movie ever it was great to see spiderman and to see how he played into the civil war i love how he swings in and says the funniest things like the time a court bucky barnes metal arm you have a metal arm thats awesome dude and the spider suit is way better than the original black panther was amazing as well loved his suit and i liked how he knocked down bucky when everyone else couldnt and and i liked how how he played into the civil war as well the russo brothers are doing so well keep it up thank you
May 12 2015,positive,tough to top they did a great job of bringing in new characters with out loosing the plot great flick all around paul rudd is hilarious
May 12 2015,positive,best cap movie top 3 favorite marvel movies
May 11 2015,positive,captain america fighting head to head against their friends in this epic film was in my opinion the best marvel movie to date after the guardians of the galaxy enough said
May 11 2015,positive,it was amazing it was everything and more i expected from the russo bros  great cast great action it was almost flawless my only complaint is the same with all movies in the superhero genre it is that to much time is spent setting up the next movie and not enough on the film at hand it was still an excellent movie though and i am looking forward to see whats next
May 11 2015,positive,wow no words can describe this cinematic achievement while it isnt perfect when its flying high its nearly out of orbit phenomenal job
May 11 2015,positive,i watch all the marvel movies but a super hero movie ceiling is a c this one was funny and like that they fought more than once
May 11 2015,positive,thats a really great movie
May 11 2015,positive,outstanding film loved every second even when my heart was breaking
May 10 2015,positive,very good movie lots of action and comedy and lots of unexpected super herod in the film
May 10 2015,positive,marvel does a fantastic job of clashing the good guys against each other in a film that actually makes sense take a note dc  sure the spectical is as absurd as always but its just so much damn fun  the introduction of new characters into the avengers universe is also handled seamlessly  in all another crowd pleaser composed by marvel
May 10 2015,positive,i like this movie i was not looking forward to some civil war movie among the characters but i was impressed after i watch the movie the acting is top notch and the specialeffects are off the charts i like the story line and the character development i liked all the humor and the production  direction is good all the actors are in good form and it was a nice block buster movie start to the summer i think the new spiderman is a good addition and casting with this new young actor i look forward to the next one
May 10 2015,positive,fantastic  loved this movie   enough twists to keep it interesting and dine character development even with all of the characters   a solid addition to the series and one of the best
May 10 2015,positive,the captain america movies seem to me to be the best series of all the marvel movies
May 10 2015,positive,battle scenes were epic  black panther is my fav new superhero
May 10 2015,positive,the movie was mind blowing amazing
May 10 2015,negative,its good but captain america civil war suffers from being more of a promotional advertisement than a stand alone marvel film
May 10 2015,positive,one of the best films in the mcu so far
May 10 2015,positive,my brother inlaw and i got tickets for the night befor it comes out so excited to see it
May 10 2015,positive,2nd place aint bad
May 10 2015,positive,well yet again marvel up the game on the comic  movie franchise and show dc how a multi character film can work unlike batman v superman did we are finally introduced to black panther and spiderman not entirely sure why we needed a new actorreboot the film is wall to wall action and is well worth anyones hard earned money and time flys by without an ounce of boredom by the way im team captain america âº
May 9 2015,positive,civil war tackles some pretty heavy issues while still being a fun action romp despite the film having practically every avenger in it it actually manages to not feel bloated and unnecessary something  age of ultron couldnt quite get a hold on tom holland makes an outstanding spiderman and i cant wait to see what else hes got up his webshooters chadwick boseman also makes a great debut as black panther with so many characters to keep track of and so many storylines the mcu is becoming almost to grandiose for some filmmakers to handle but the russos also directed the winter soldier have now made two of the best mcu films to date and i am so happy they are charge of the next avengers film because they are 2 for 2
May 9 2015,positive,fabulous want to see it again
May 9 2015,positive,great marvel movie cant wait till the next
May 9 2015,positive,very disappointed with this one thanks to the trailer i knew all the big shocks and reveals and is pretty much seen the fight sequences that define the movie the only part then worthy of watching was the post credit sequences its a shame as going in blind would have made this movie great but the trailers marvel released were too much footage and not enough tease shame
May 9 2015,positive,much the way wonder womans benevolent presence centers batman v superman its the gee whiz entrance of marvels recaptured from sony spiderman which lops a good bit of heaviness off of civil war hes helped in part by the arrival of ant man whos lost none of the sardonic charm from his own run     civil war is top middle and bottom heavy with these cameos and guest shots and it would be easy to bill this avengers 3 or some new all hero configuration yet oddly enough the film rises and falls in evans and his stalwart portrayal of cap all good intentions and sturdy compass like bvs marvel too has come to ask about the collateral damage of superhero and here as there it falls to the american dreamiest of the characters to stand up for the price of heroics  marvels strength lies in the morally ambiguous in betweens here represented by the enduring of bond of steve and bucky the winter soldier whose dark history complicates all the other relationships in this story chiefly between the captain and iron man      if downey has seemed a bit weary of these enterprises lately civil war turns that weariness into its own mini opera a lear surveying the hellish landscape and regretting the path to victory the conflicts set up here tear at the foundations of the marvel universe and that really speaks to why the comic book franchises have shown more staying power than many would have guessed  few big entertainments especially with this many installments have nearly as much at stake    that said more than the other parts of the mcu captain america has produced a string of top flight well made stories that both serve the greater narrative and stand well in their own  in the longer run its whether the others rise to meet them or muddle along that may be the real test of how this comic world lives or dies on film
May 9 2015,positive,interesting storyline well acted and directed
May 9 2015,positive,the russo brothers show us once again how amazing the mcu can be and how captain america is actually an interesting character whenever cap feuds with iron man and an entire scene dedicated to the avengers fighting steal the show easily with great characters like black panther spiderman and a pretty solid villain
May 9 2015,positive,civil war is just deeper than previous colourful marvel movies russo brothers know how tell a story that encase so many characters without underdevelop any of them expecially new entries spider manantman and black panther among all
May 8 2015,positive,an overall solid movie but the more i think about it the more and more it kind of ticks me off the movie wasnt even about the accords it was about bucky and neither side acted like heroes at least the airport fight was cool
May 8 2015,positive,awesome cant think of any other word or words other then awesome
May 8 2015,positive,this was the best marvel movie because it was fun and entertaining to watch
May 8 2015,positive,wow this movie is so epic action packed with some comedy i love this movie
May 8 2015,positive,hits every mark that bvs missed great movie in all aspects and without question the best superhero movie of all time
May 8 2015,positive,marvel really nailed it  this is easily oneof marvels best movies spiderman was great but black panther was simply incredible   ill definitely be seeing this multiple times
May 8 2015,positive,too much good they dont screw up as opposed to age of ultron
May 8 2015,positive,one of the best movies i have seen in a while simply stated
May 8 2015,negative,campy marvel has arrived worst superhero movie since daredevil ya know there is a limit on humor in a action flick and this surpassed it to stupidity
May 8 2015,positive,the role of the blackpanther was awesome he needs his own movie and animated cartoon i will go see it again
May 7 2015,positive,i highly recommend for any marvel fan it was great
May 7 2015,positive,while it may not be up to the standard of the winter soldier civil war none the less proves once again that it is possible to make a good film out of the superhero genre instead of just churning out popcorn entertainment civil war is sharp smart in addition to being fun managing to tackle the issue of government regulation of private citizens with intelligence its easy to overlook the 180 in personality from tony stark and the bloated cast of characters as pretty much the entire marvel universe is given screen time the writers and filmmakers some how manage to make it all balance out with chadwick bosman making a strong case for his upcoming black panther film and tom holland almost making a case for not automatically writing off our 3rd spiderman film in the last decade even so civil war would have greatly benefited from editing out at least half of the character and allowing those left a chance to breathe and you know have more than a couple lines and an actual story arc but despite this major issue marvel has once again managed to elevate captain america from simple prous propaganda to give us a thinking blockbuster
May 7 2015,positive,this movie is fantastic and really well written marvel knows how to introduce new characters properly have multiple heroes in a movies and not take away from the story line
May 7 2015,negative,was excited about the movie until the released that awful spider man look too cartoony doesnt match at all the feel the other character display who ever thought of that appearance should never ever have any input on any other movies honestly that costume beephope marvel changes that before movie release else they just lost a ticked sale  imagine im not the only one
May 6 2015,positive,good movie great action sequence awesome storyline and character building the only flaw is the script lots of miss emotion moments that could of been fixed with a simple sentence or two other than that awesomeness
May 6 2015,positive,i have to hand it to marvel they really nailed it with this one the action storyline drama and good ole surprise was really good ole cap and iron man went to war with the help of some friends the only problem that rubbed me the wrong way was the spidermonkeyboy and they didnt bring back the original mccoy all in alljob well done with that one glaring exception go check it out kirrapproved civilwar
May 6 2015,positive,loved it best one yet
May 6 2015,positive,the greatest superhero film to date perfect in every way
May 6 2015,positive,loosely based on the comic material for new style new themes surprising character development and a hilarious spiderman
May 6 2015,positive,i watch this movie yesterday and i loved it one of the best mcu movies so far for phase 3
May 6 2015,positive,wow  where do i begin on this  i absolutely loved this movie  the story the themes the characters i could go on for ages  potential spoiler ahead so beware  this film introduces black panther and spiderman to the marvel cinematic universe and let me tell you they did it beautifully  spideypeter parker is perfect  if youre familiar with him in the comics im sure youll see exactly what i mean  thank heaven marvel got the rights to him back  the action sequences are even more spectacular than ever before black widow  greatest female action character of all time just sayin  if i wrote about everything that was great in this film id be typing for another few hours so ill end this by simply saying incredible  cant wait to own the bluray
May 6 2015,positive,it was okay good effects the script seemed hurried at the end overall enjoyable movie just a step down from singers movies
May 6 2015,positive,a film split into three very distinct sections political thriller comedy horror  the political thriller first 90 minutes sets up the concept and allegiances the comedy brings more jokes in half an hour which all land hard than most comedies manage in 2 hours then the horror of seeing characters youve come to love fighting because of a differing opinion    it may be a little disjointed but i cant deny it has everything you want from a film
May 6 2015,positive,marvel nails it again
May 6 2015,positive,best marvel film yet  outstanding
May 6 2015,positive,my new favorite teamcap
May 5 2015,positive,fun action packed and thrilling civil war boasts incredible action sequenceschoreography an outstanding balance with its hefty amount of heroescharacters and explores deep themes of friendship family and vengeance all while remaining a funny  entertaining blast from beginning to end
May 5 2015,positive,good action great story
May 5 2015,positive,i like the movie a lot and i enjoy superhero movies but there is no way captain america civil war is that much better than batmanvsuperman in ratings dont know if one should be higher or one should be lower all kinds of weirdnever mind just enjoy the movie spiderman was best parts
May 5 2015,positive,entertaining but doesnt move the story much at all
May 5 2015,positive,great shock scenes but why are the good guys trying to kill their friends
May 5 2015,positive,very good film but i still think winter solider was better you would think in a captain america film youd be rooting for cap but i have to say i was team iron man all the way while i appreciated caps loyalty i just feel he wasnt seeing the bigger picture i guess thats why i feel the winter solider film was better i want to cheer for captain america i just couldnt in this film dont get me wrong the film is really good and better than batman v superman i really hate admitting that btw    though a tad slow in the beginning the build up to the main fight and ending fight was worth the wait standouts for me were antman rudd is just hilarious the new spiderman so looking forward to homecoming and the black panther who was just awesome i also really liked the main villain zemo too it was a nice change to see a manipulator instead of just maniac wanting take over the world    it seems like marvel cant do no wrong highly recommend this flick
May 5 2015,positive,most incredible thing ive watched in a long time
May 5 2015,positive,once again marvel shows that you can mix philosophy action drama and comedy to create a film of substance  while a little disappointing in places due to a need to build up future galaxies in the mc universe captain america gets a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy  whether you believe that you have to protect your friends at any cost or that actions have consequences you either learn to live with or weigh you down civil war has a little bit of everything  and a villain who actually has a lot of meat instead of being just window dressing
May 4 2015,positive,at first i thought it was vacuous and pointless  boy i was wrong putting captain america against iron man with new characters is the most invigorating thing marvel has done to date and may be their most rewarding whilst it has the captain america name slapped on the front its like a paradoxical avengers film seeing other heroes like antman spiderman and black panther in here is refreshing and you just wish they could have gotten more screen time it gave spiderman and black panther the accentuation they need for their upcoming standalone films allinall captain america civil war was a great financial and lionized success
May 4 2015,positive,actionpacked and exciting captain america civil war is an energizing start to the summer movie season  movie review captain america civil war  date viewed may 6 2016  directed by anthony russo and joe russo you me and dupree and captain america the winter soldier  screenplay by christopher markus and stephen mcfeely based on the marvel comics created by joe simon and jack kirby  starring chris evans robert downey jr scarlett johansson sebastian stan anthony  mackie jeremy renner don cheadle paul bettany chadwick boseman paul rudd elizabeth olsen william hurt tom holland emily vancamp marisa tomei frank grillo and daniel bruhl    captain america civil war is an energizing start to the summer movie season not only does it feature great action sequences it also wants to acknowledge that thousands of people died all for the sake of creating blockbuster entertainments a morally difficult choice fractures the avengers into two opposing teams one led by steve rogers aka captain america and one led by tony stark aka iron man even though this is another captain america installment it feels like another avengers movie if you look at the ensemble cast civil war also marks the exciting debuts of two new superheroes chadwick boseman as the black panther and tom holland as the new spiderman  both will have their own feature films in the near future    after the disappointing smackdown between batman and superman the showdown between captain america and iron man is worth seeing because civil war tells a compelling story and gives the many characters in this movie room to develop  one year after the avengers defeated ultron the superhero team gets involved with another international incident which results in extensive collateral damage the latest incident involving the avengers puts the us government under pressure to find a political solution thats where former general and now secretary of state thaddeus thunderbolt ross william hurt reprising his role from the incredible hulk comes in    he comes to avengers headquarters to inform that the un is preparing to pass legislation known as the sokovia accords this will give governments from around the world the right to oversee and control the avengers this issue heavily divides the avengers while steve rogers chris evans still believes his own judgment in doing the right thing tony stark robert downey jr surprisingly supports the legislation because he feels responsible for creating ultron and for the destruction of sokovia    suddenly a bomb explodes at a un conference in vienna killing king tchaka of wakanda the man who was overseeing the sokovia accords security footage reveals that the winter soldier aka steve rogers former friend bucky barnes sebastian stan was responsible for the attack and tchakas son tchalla aka black panther chadwick boseman vows to take him down with his friend now on the run captain america has to make a difficult choice turn over bucky to the authorities or help him in eluding capture    while bucky returns to his normal self he is now a internationally wanted man and he and steve must go to a siberian hydra facility where more brainwashed winter soldiers like him are being kept in large cryogenic stasis  thats the place where theyll find helmut zemo daniel bruhl a former sokovian colonel now turned terrorist who is obsessed with tearing the avengers apart because his family were among those killed in the destruction of sokovia unwilling to wait for authorization to go after zemo captain america goes rogue by recruiting his team bucky barnes sam wilson aka the falcon anthony mackie wanda maximoff aka scarlet witch elizabeth olsen clint barton aka hawkeye jeremy renner and scott lang aka antman paul rudd to stop captain america from making a bad situation to an even worse one stark assembles his team as well by recruiting james rhodes aka war machine don cheadle black panther natasha romanoff aka black widow scarlett johansson the vision paul bettany and peter parker aka spiderman tom holland    by having thoughtprovoking themes such as accountably for so much destruction and many innocent lives lost captain america civil war is the most mature installment yet in the marvel cinematic universe it may lag behind captain america the winter soldier in terms of being overstuffed and overlong but nevertheless its still an entertainingly smart summer blockbuster steve rogers and tony stark are at the heart of this story because their friendship and teamwork helps the avengers stay united if they are divided the team gets crippled directors anthony and joe russo who both did captain america the winter soldier do a complex job of holding a great story and compelling drama together while having a dozen comic book superheroes in the same movie    chadwick boseman who in the past few years has played jackie robinson and james brown tremendously well on the big screen is just outstanding as the black panther i really enjoyed tom holland as the new spiderman his gleeful tone in civil war is just perfect for the webslinger his terrific appearance makes you cant wait for the upcoming spiderman homecoming which is due out next year    actionpacked and exciting captain america civil war proves that you can make a movie about superheroes fighting each other smashingly well as long as you strike all the right notes
May 4 2015,positive,spiderman black panther captain america iron man all in one movie it was beautiful may just be the best marvel movie ever made to the infinity war we go
May 4 2015,neutral,it was so well done but at this point im so lost in the marvel cinematic universe because there are so many movies that i cant remember most of them i cant remember what happened in the last captain america because that was like two iron mans and an avengers ago or something anyway there was a lot of star power i hate that theyre rebooting spider man so that took a whole star off this rating by itself
May 4 2015,positive,i really really enjoyed this i know everyone loved the spiderman cameo but antman stole the show for me even though his screen time was limited
May 3 2015,positive,mcu keeps topping themselves just when i thought they couldnt
May 3 2015,positive,i love it antman is so freaking funny
May 3 2015,positive,who would have thought the best marvel movies would be captain america movies awesome new characters and the trailers do a real good job of saving the big surprises unlike b v s i cant wait to see it again
May 3 2015,positive,great movie with mixed issues on both ends loved the way they introduced new characters yet kept the movie moving forward way to go marvel it was like an avengers 25
May 3 2015,positive,i find myself legitimately worried that marvel wont be able to top themselves after this spiderman steals the movie and black panther helps
May 3 2015,positive,best superhero movie ever  amazing the second time and ready to watch the third time  team cap
May 3 2015,positive,whether or not this film is great depends largely on if the actions in this movie have any lasting consequences in the mcu if they do then wow what a great movie    if they dont then what an actionpacked waste of time and potential spidey is awesome though
May 3 2015,positive,actionpacked movie with a good storyline excellent movie best movie of the year
May 3 2015,positive,the feels it hurts
May 3 2015,positive,great movie action packed
May 3 2015,positive,best action pack marvel movie  captain america 3 is the best    first i have to say big thanks to the russo brothers for doing a fantastic job directing this film as this film contain lots of very good action pack scenes mostly the fight and chase scenes and bring lots of marvels top characters together for one of marvel big comic issues    the russo brothers did a great job turning captain america saga around with the huge success of captain america 2 the winter soldier and now this film big time    marvel have once again done a great job with bring their version of peter parker aka spiderman as he is so funny and half the time is so childish because of his age and just stupid kids are going to love spiderman big time so please if you have kids go and take them to watch this film big time in the comics and the animated fox kid show peter parker is very childish and likes captain america and also likes tony stark i was so wrong and glad as tom holland does a great job acting as young peter parker and spiderman    also marvel thank you for selecting chadwick boseman to act as black panther he was very good had some good fight scenes between him and the winter solider    oh man and how can i forget paul rudd who acts as antman he was just as funny as he was in the antman movie i loved that part where we get to see antman bigger    the main reason to watch this film is for the big marvel battle the battle of freedom between captain america and iron man tony stark vs steve rogers chris evans and robert downey jr are very great at acting together and bring both these two marvel characters to life having read the graphic civil war novel and watching this film marvel have take some elements from the comic and put it in this film the fight scenes between captain america and iron man was just too good for me and stress as one minute it looks like captain america is going to win and in the next minute iron man is going to win the amount of emotion thrown into this film pretty much told the story of this film we can to see a more serious tony who does not want to do this but has no choice while captain america does not want to follow the new rules and always goes by his gut feeling    do you need to watch all marvel films to understand this film  yes and no you only need to watch captain america to know who steve rogers and bucky is in captain america 2 you find out that shield has gone down and you learn that hydra have always been there and you really do understand why he is against tony in this film you should watch iron man 1 to know who tony stark is and also watch avengers 1 and 2 to know who the rest of the characters and to fully understand what the government takes action against the avengers    i am going to give this film 55 stars as this film was brilliant and awesome
May 3 2015,positive,this might be the greatest action packed event of the marvel cinematic universe setting up a serious plot and also adding humor to it and having everything extremely well balanced with its huge amount of characters and subplots
May 3 2015,positive,correct me if im wrong but i thought this was a captain america movie and not an avengers film dont get me wrong the movie served its purpose for the most part but it just didnt quite feel right to close out a captain america trilogy if you ask me so the film captain america civil war is loosely based off of marvel comics major comic book event civil war from 2007 the plot entails in the comics that after the superheroes saved the world so many times they leave behind a lot of collateral damage in their wake which catches up to them after the un government wants every super powered person to register to the government so it puts the general public at ease an absolutely retarded concept but marvel had to come with something for a story this plays out the same way in this movie only this time cap has to help the winter soldier after he is framed for murder and even though the movie deviated from the original marvel comics storyline by a considerable amount one of which being 10 superheroes fighting each other onscreen as opposed to the 100 characters in the comics which i can understand i still felt like it could have done better    the actors in here were fine and did their part when it came to their roles especially robert downey jr and chris evans who do a phenomenal job with their respected parts but when they brought in tom hollands character as spiderman i felt he was a little rushed with him at times even though his wise cracks did make me chuckle another disappointing part was that there were next to no supervillains in here at all sure they had crossbones for all of five minutes and helmut zemo was nothing more than a whiny little bitch who just hated cap and the avengers i mean in the comics he was a formidable enemy to cap as he is a highly skilled swordsman and assassin but in here he is just the complete opposite not to mention the actress who plays sharon carter is briefly here and there at times but felt more like a throwaway character its like batman v superman all over again where the side characters who are a part of that one main superhero superman are either killed off or tossed to the side thats what i think when they did was do the exact same thing to caps side character friends not to mention that despite this being a captain america movie they focus half the time on pretty much everyone else which it does work in here the overall manhunt type story was interesting but they really didnt do that much sleuthing like in the previous cap movie where in this one some computer tells cap or iron man that so  so did it and they are all like huh one of the best parts in this movie is the superhero brawl fest at the german airport where all the commercials kept highlighting that on tv and the twist near the end which makes iron man want to kill winter soldier even more is awesome as well but overall this movie made me feel the same way how i felt about dawn of justice in which it is a two hour and forty minutes worth of okayness with a bunch of superheroes coming together for a meet and greet with their fists which is why i give this movie a three star rating
May 3 2015,positive,would have been excellent if captain america died
May 3 2015,positive,pretty amazing teamcap
May 2 2015,positive,captain america civil war was everything both fans of the comic and fans of the movie could have wanted and then some the story was great and fresh for the mcu it was gritty the fight scenes were beautiful the humor never missed a mark the pacing was perfect and it was just down right fun from beginning to end im a huge fan of so many of the marvel movies but this was by far the best one my favorite of course was tom hollands spiderman great reintroduction and great performance to get us by until homecoming
May 2 2015,positive,amazing spiderman antman kills it again i dont know how they are going to top this movie batman v superman who
May 2 2015,positive,who wouldve guessed all it took to fix the avengers was to remove thor hulk and joss whedon     i did
May 2 2015,positive,i  think the best super hero movies so far awesome
May 2 2015,positive,love it this may be the best marvel movie ever a must see
May 2 2015,positive,very good movie only problem was the kid that played spidermanpeter parker not as good as andrew and toby
May 2 2015,positive,this is a thrilling emotional journey about power and the power of friendship alternately serious and seriously hilarious civil war raises the bar for blockbuster filmmaking it succeeds because marvel has taken their time to create this vibrant world and the patience more than pays off it also helps that the new spiderman was so incredible and full of so much promise keep it up marvel ill be first in line
May 2 2015,negative,this movie was a huge let down and i dont understand the high rating
May 2 2015,positive,not as traumatic as i feared lots of story maybe a bit much at times but pretty dang solid i am satisfied with what i saw
May 2 2015,positive,i was not looking forward to this avenger vs avenger is wrong and apart from peter parker being a toddler its an awesome movie teamcap
May 2 2015,positive,not necessarily the best marvel movie out there
May 2 2015,positive,made more sense for why they should be fighting each other over batman vs superman spiderman was great cap movies are always more focused on stories which i appreciate
May 2 2015,positive,five star instant classic best marvel studios movie by far both avengers movies are left in the dust by this one of course theres a certain magic that we all go through with the first avengers film  seeing all 4 heavyweights iron man hulk thor captain america on the screen at the same time has a true historical feel that cant be replicated  but this movie has been building for 8 years and it has an undercurrent and emotional weight that i have never experienced by any film franchise including star wars the force awakens we pick up where age of ultron left off with cap leading his quirky quartet of falcon black widow and the scarlet witch on a covert ops mission to take down brock rumlow now operating as a terrorist named crossbones and his flunkies in lagos spoiler alert the team is successful in their mission but heres the problem there are casualties  thats what made stan lee and jack kirby visionaries every action has an opposite and sometimes equal reaction  in the avengers we had an alien invasion in nyc that caused billions of dollars in property damage and an untold amount of lost life in captain america the winter soldier we saw 3 hover crafts crash into the potomac river over dc also costing untold amounts of damage financially and existentially finally age of ultron saw a foreign nation rise above the earth only to crash catastrophically back to the planet with a fatality rate too morbid to comprehend throw in the tragedy in lagos and you get the point that the public is terrified of these heroes and want them to be held accountable for their actions  in the comics it was the super hero registration act in this film it is the sokovia accords the point is that the marvel cinematic universe has laid out this question in every film that they have released the good guys arrive to save the day but at what cost and just how much is the collateral damage  those questions are why dcwarner bros is getting their asses handed to them its why sony had no idea what they were doing with spiderman and why they had to allow marvel to fee manage the character in movies its why universal missed the boat with the hulk and has the audacity to try and recreate the magic with their monsters dracula frankensteins monster the wolfman the mummy the invisible man hell throw in the creature from the black lagoon while were at it fox figured it out with the xmen but that was after they screwed up with x3 and xmen origins wolverine theyve just recently hit home runs with xmen first class days of future past and deadpool their poised to hit another homer with apocalypse with all that said they grossly missed the boat with the most recent iteration of fantastic four  and do i need to even begin to talk about batman vs superman  in a world where we are forced to suspend our disbelief and accept supersoldiers men of iron notso jolly green giants and norse gods  it is still a world that is so much like our very own there are consequences for these actions there is a price for global conflict are our heroes willing to pay that price  that is the central theme of civil war that theme is what leads to our conflict between steven grant rogers and anthony edward stark we saw the rivalry begin all the way back in the first avengers we are now placed smack dab between these two polar opposites in a very controversial issue they are both right and they have every reason to disagree  but whatever happened to tony starks parents this movie answers that question its why cap and tony have the best superhero fight scene i have ever witnessed on film its why the movies third and final act is a complete triumph its why this movie deserves every accolade it has achieved all parties involved deliver as they should onscreen from everyone that we already know they all remind us why we like them so much  which brings us to spiderman and the black panther all i have to say is that it is obvious that those two characters will be the cornerstone of phases four and five of the mcu and i cannot wait to see their films  but back to captain america i honestly believe that this is the greatest superhero trilogy ever produced and it is a perfect ending if it is indeed that to this initial story arch regarding chris evans interpretation of the star spangled patriot the first avenger was a solid world war 2 movie the winter soldier was an unbelievable spy thriller and i had no idea that it would be that good this film was the perfect finale for this three part saga ill even go so far as to say that this is the best 3rd installment film ever made and i am comparing it to return of the jedi matrix revolutions spiderman 3 x3 iron man 3 the dark knight rises and any other movie you want to throw up there in the conversation i cant begin to say enough about this film and i have typed up way too much but it was really that good and i cant find anything bad to say about it  again instant classic  icoulddothisallday
May 2 2015,positive,absolutely awesome movie
May 2 2015,positive,the best marvel movie since the last captain america romp spectacular wellscripted gives everyone something to do its only flaw is its tieeverythingneatlyupwithabow ending
May 2 2015,positive,i got to see my all time favorite childhood superhero spiderman again that reason should be  enough to watch it youcryingnowzack
May 2 2015,positive,i enjoyed bvs but civil war did it right and was way more entertaining best marvel movie yet
May 1 2015,positive,i have seen this movie three times i love it every time one of my favorite marvel movies
May 1 2015,positive,the comic book movie we all need unlike the faliure of other competitors captain america civil war truly shows what the russo brothers and casr are capable of doing as well as introducing phase three of the mcu the character development and action sequences was welldone as it dosent fall into an avengers 25 movie it focuses more   on the situation with steve rogers and the sakovia accords in addition the new characters that were introduced spiderman and blackpanther these two only were the supportive characters and judging by their performances they are capable of pleasing audieneces when their solo films comes soon to wrap up the whole experience i enjoyed watching the humor and emotional conflict between each character this is what the audienece expects the fun comedic and well executed action sequences
May 1 2015,positive,it was a solid movie  had many more slow parts than some of the other avenger movies  i would say overall i liked it the least of them all but even at that its still a good movie
May 1 2015,neutral,felt its length the shaky cam was rampant and there were many pacing problems and inconsistencies however it was still enjoyable enough to recommend
May 1 2015,positive,this movie was fantastic and surprisingly so i was generally expecting your average watered down bland marvel movie but this was not the case for this film this gave me everything i wanted from a movie like this and more a lot of people are comparing this to batman v superman dawn of justice and i can see why there is one major difference between the two films however and that is quality everything bvs did wrong this did right i hope that the rest of the upcoming mcu films follow in the footsteps of this movie and improve even more in quality definitely go see this as soon as you can its a ton of fun also spiderman and black panther were fucking awesome
May 1 2015,positive,black panther and iron man awsome
May 1 2015,positive,spidey and ant man steal the show
May 1 2015,positive,outstanding  entertaining  by far one of the best marvel superhero movie
May 1 2015,positive,i dont think anything can top winter soldier
May 1 2015,positive,this is a story largely about collateral damage of previous films while the action and plot play out fine im worried going into infinity war that there will be more focus on fate of ancillary extras rather than the fight against thanos which would likely have more collateral damage than weve seen thus far in the marvel cinematic universe as for the elements of this installment spidermans introduction to the mcu was brilliantly played in the end the theme about not allowing vengeance to consume you make this film poignant in a world where emotions can be manipulated to elicit a certain outcome
Apr 30 2015,positive,totally awesome just a great movie
Apr 30 2015,positive,no spoilers but any fans of the marvel cinematic universe need to get out and see this not quite up to par with the first avengers film but better than the second a great flick overall and as always stay through the credits
Apr 30 2015,positive,this was amazing way better than that batman vs superman
Apr 30 2015,positive,i thought it was excellent movie  i will watch it again
Apr 29 2015,positive,captain america civil war takes place in a world where youd want an independently wealthy and powerful individual made dictatorforlife because you can trust powerful people to be above the petty agendas of us mere mortals and you must just grieve never seek justice for the innocent victims killed by the actions of the powerful    in the moral universe of this film you have to assume    1 warlevel combat among powerful forces accountable to no one is a fact of life literally everywhere     2 innocent civilians casualties are an inevitable consequenceeverywhere     3 national and international governing institutions cannot be trusted to shield civilians from these conflicts because their leaders have agendasie politics vested interests human desires and needs    yes this is an imaginary world a fiction an escape    but this isnt exactly a film about unicorns finding that love is magic     this is explicitly a film about power and accountability and id argue it says trust the powerful you dont need accountability    spoilers follow    one of the worst moment for me was when chris evans mutters about the agendas of governments like a rightwing radio host and no one calls him on it i wanted to say it loud everyone has agendas steve having an agenda means having interests having wants and needs it means not being dead    as i suppose that implies i dont really believe in selfless heroes even the people i admire have needs wants flaws interests agendas     i believe in us checking one another when we overstep    of course its a lot harder to check a billionaire tech genius armored against the world or teams of supersoldiers created to physically dominate any kind of battlefield    so i felt most touched by the journey tony stark has traveled in these films when we met stark he was a selfabsorbed tech billionaire who bragged to lawmakers that hed privatized world peace instead stark now realizes that he just pioneered a new kind of war to his credit stark faces up to the casualties of that war and agrees to be held accountable     of course the decision costs him much more emotionally than if hed just kept telling the world to just deal with his unilateral power    interestingly as tony has grown a conscience steve has actually sunken into himself and the past the onetime soldier and symbol of a nation now only has faith in himself and his one sole surving war buddyno matter who that buddy has killed cap waves away civilian casualties as collateral damage like a donald rumsfeld    after all the shooting is over we leave the theater for the real world of sharp power distinctions     but power here takes the shape first of wealth above all organized into corporations designed to extract profits from the earth and us power also exists in the form of massproduced weapons used by invading armies by police more trained to punish than protect and by hatedriven vigilantes finally power often exists in the form of governments captured by wealth by military juntas or by parties of hatred     for the past 100 years powerless people worldwide have found their best defenses against powerful predators in organized collective resistance and democratic selfgovernment a gathering of political equals where both guns and bribes are banned allows us to check one anothers agendas and gather our strength against the agendas of the powerful more than one or two people are needed to move a piano as civil war oddly chooses to have an old king put it    democratic governments can empower us against wealth military force and tribal hatreds democratic governments can turn wealth and force into tools for defense and growth and shield us from becoming the casualties of warlords or slavelords    when the powerful try to wrest democratic institutions away from us the best first answer is not to try to become a millionaire or a vigilante or a warlord in a civil war     the best first answer is to reorganize the vast numbers of the powerless to control the powerful and shield our loved ones    i think of all those first responders those public servants who struggled to subdue their hero and role model captain america in the civil war comic seriesbecause the cap had lost perspective and his war against the government was causing civilian casualties selfrecognition set in and he stood down    but what does this movie say about powerless people about civilian casualties about accountability
Apr 29 2015,positive,wow best marvel movie of the year so far action packed
Apr 29 2015,positive,so funny loved the battle scenes too
Apr 29 2015,positive,its doesnt get a five because of the villian baron zemo he outsmarted all the good guys but thats it the original civil war didnt end this way oh well maybe im being picky
Apr 29 2015,positive,alright movie fun at the most
Apr 29 2015,positive,team captain america all the way  this 3rd installment is probably one of the best from the captain america series it was flawless the action the funny the characters etcthe plot wasnt lost at all notwithstanding the plethora of superheroes
Apr 28 2015,positive,well made cant wait for the next one
Apr 28 2015,positive,great movie full of action
Apr 28 2015,positive,dense but never messy civil war surely stands as one of the best marvel films not only by virtue of spectacle but also in the presentation of a rich yet tragic story this along with phenomenal performances from castmembers both old and new make this an occasionally somber and yet somehow frequently hilarious viewing experience
Apr 28 2015,positive,captain america civil war is a superhero vs superhero movie thats actually good
Apr 28 2015,positive,overall i thought it was a very good movie my only complaint is the fight scenes the camera work was so jumpy almost made me nauseous i hade to look away a couple times because of it  but good movie nonetheless
Apr 28 2015,positive,its the best mcu movie to date it is exciting it is emotional and it is funny its covered all aspects that it needed to cover in that it was able to introduce new characters excellently spiderman was on screen for about 45 minutes and he easily stole the show this is a great superhero movie this is a great action movie but best of all its a great movie in general
Apr 28 2015,positive,definitely not better than winter soldier but definitely better than age of ultron spider man was fun and it was just your typical marvel movie with sweet action and cheesy jokes
Apr 28 2015,positive,one of the best super hero films
Apr 28 2015,positive,is not as good as winter soldier a real criticism civil war was a good film but it didnt manage to sell its whole conflict of ideals as well as it could have i suppose it would have needed more than two hours to tell that kind of story properly as such they were forced to make compromises that damage the films potential the issue at the core is better developed than bvss really confusing clash of nearidentical identical motivations and modi operandi buckys story is similarly developed properly and given room to grow its just that these two plotlines dont always mesh together right and that means they need to force the narrative a little and provide us with a relatively cheap solution    not that the film does nothing good it gets quite a lot right the thoughtful take on superhero responsibility is a good one even if tony doesnt seem the natural character to handle most of the serious lines the action scenes are first rate theres a big airport battle about halfway through the film that gives us everything we could possibly want in terms of varied fighting styles antman in particular works much better than you would expect and shows us that hes not limited to fighting villains with the same powers he has the new spiderman is great and really steals the show once he shows up and starts well being peter all over everything seriously its funny how little you realize what an oddball he is until you see the reactions of characters you already know to his appearance kinda a neat bonus to introducing him this way black panther the other new hero introduced here is similarly great they manage to juggle a potentially difficult blend of nobility rage and compassion without ever seeming forced or patronizing    performances are generally excellent i was never that fond of his bucky barnes but sebastian stan is really milking this winter soldier thing in exactly the right way im really enjoying scott lang here as he steals the show with most of his lines possibly thats helped along by an unusually subdued tony who barely does any wisecracking and instead seems to be trying on his big boy pants it worked here but i hope they let him loose again in infinity war tony needs to be a smartass given how much else is going on in this film its amazing how much character work they actually manage to pull off here the film manages to introduce black panther introduce spiderman establish the villain of the piece tell us where everybody stands on the issues and why set up an entirely different style of government organization to shield pursue two main plots in parallel delve into tonys backstory resolve some of steves plot threads and do all this while giving us some excellent action scenes iron man 2 struggled to pull off setting up a villain giving tony an insecurity to overcome and establishing that shield is still interested in tony civil war pulls off much more than that even if the cracks sometimes show heck it manages to introduce more than bvs did what did that film really set up beyond the fact that bruce and clark hate each other for some reason and that other superheroes exist without seeming half as forced or bloated as that movie    so yes its a good film given the constraints its operating under its possibly even a great film if it doesnt always juggle its vast assortment of plot points successfully we have to recognize that it would have taken a miracle for it to do so they dont quite pull off a miracle but they come damn close
Apr 28 2015,positive,not since the dark knight have i seen a comic book film this extraordinary its an action masterpiece with familiar faces and welcomes new ones best on screen spiderman ive witnessed the emotion flows until the very last scene after a sightly disappointed avengers sequel this marvel adventure not only tops that one but soars as the greatest film so far in the studios history a new chapter is in preparation
Apr 27 2015,positive,next to guardians of the galaxy this is the best superhero movie i have seen so far5 out of 5 stars
Apr 27 2015,positive,good story with great action
Apr 27 2015,positive,marvel has proven to make the better superhero vs superhero movie the action was thrilling the characters though many were memorable and it managed to keep an adult tone while also throwing in a few humorous and fun moments
Apr 27 2015,negative,its bad sooooo disappointed
Apr 27 2015,positive,a few dumb things for comedic value
Apr 27 2015,positive,a phenomenal edition to the marvel cinematic universe with incredible action sequences and an emotional and compelling story that will invest you for the entaining  and fun ride
Apr 27 2015,positive,i expected a bit more honestly the civil war was pretty forced the movie was rushed and the best characters are barely in the movie the acting directing action all were stellar but theres this part of me that cant help but feel like this movie could have been much better and much more focused on adding to the marvel cinematic universe but instead it feels like a slight cash grab not nearly as bad as batman v superman but it felt sort of rushed in the same way that movie did still fantastic in its own way 810
Apr 27 2015,positive,no go back to being in the 90s
Apr 27 2015,positive,another great movie by marvel
Apr 26 2015,positive,excellent very well balanced  amazing action sequences
Apr 26 2015,positive,marvels best story so far
Apr 26 2015,positive,hands down the best superhero movie ever    political pressure mounts to install a system of accountability when the actions of the avengers lead to collateral damage the new status quo deeply divides the members of the team captain america chris evans believes superheroes should remain free to defend humanity without government interference iron man robert downey jr sharply disagrees and supports oversight as the debate escalates into an allout feud black widow scarlett johansson hawkeye jeremy renner war machine don cheadle and falcon sam wilson must pick a side  wow what an awesome superhero film as a huge captain america fan i wanted so badly to like this new movie but after having been let down by the notasgoodasitcouldhavebeen age of ultron last summer i was truly afraid that my enthusiasm would be met with disappointment once again here man am i glad to say that isnt the case civil war is fantastic a superhero movie that tackles serious issues successfully integrates and uses a comicbook full of characters makes sense storywise uses comic relief in just the right places and isnt a huge downer check check and check if you are a fan of captain america iron man or just superhero movies in general you will love civil war i cant wait to go back it is hands down the best superhero movie ever
Apr 26 2015,positive,dc take notes marvel is the best
Apr 26 2015,positive,spectacular action set pieces witty dialogue and a strong emotional and somewhat thoughtprovoking narrative at its core civil war ranks up as one of the best the mcu has to offer    55 stars
Apr 26 2015,positive,another kick ass movie by marvel
Apr 26 2015,positive,should really be called avengers civil war
Apr 26 2015,positive,there are a lot of interesting ideas at play but there could easily be another 30 minutes to further explore those ideas b
Apr 26 2015,positive,this movie did a fantastic job of showing two equally well reasoned sides of an argument  uniquely this huge cast of dynamic characters  balances the time spent with each of them artfully allowing the audience to both get to know the new characters while spending time with the ones we already love  marvel also held up its reputation of balancing comedy action and drama and there is no better example than the 20 minutes of splash page we are given in this movie
Apr 26 2015,positive,no spoilers an enjoyable ensemble piece  all the established characters have moments to shine that feel true to their personalities with black panther and spiderman welcome additions this is very much avengers 25 rather than captain america 3 though and the good captain is rather lost in the mix another miss was that this entry into the marvel cinematic universe lacks a strong genre identity which has been a strength of earlier outings eg captain america the winter soldier which plays as a political thriller with superhero shenanigans thrown on top civil war has a generic superhero movie feel to it rather than a distinctive voice of its own the pieces take a while to come together and inevitably the plot has to go to great lengths to get our heroes in conflict with one another but overall the results are satisfying and the humour strikes its mark the winter soldier stands as the superior captain america outing but there is lots on offer here and plenty of setups for future outings 45 stars
Apr 26 2015,positive,so many questions to be answered so little time awesome possum
Apr 26 2015,positive,this will contain mild spoilers assuming that you read this and have the ability to infer what may happen if you dont want to know anything why would you read this with captain america civil war i feel like i can now safely say that marvel cinematic universe is past its prime for a movie that builds itself up for its eventstatus quality and introduction of new characters themes and story arcs its an oddly subdued and safe movie im not saying that everything has to be 2001 a space odyssey this is a movie that has a good grasp on its humor and often times its selfawareness and some genuinely entertaining scenes and for that i cannot call it a bad movie that doesnt stop it from feeling like a missed opportunity though and despite its occasional fun the movie feels somewhat inconsequential here is where i would ordinarily put a logline but you already know what this movie is about if you care in fact youve probably already seen this movie so my voice is rather futile anyways i have to say that i enjoy the slightly political angle that these movies have been taking as of late the themes on the table here are timely engaging and present an interesting break from the blockbuster norm the way in which the characters defend their actions and ideologies are understandable and sympathetic and of course the actors do a good job for what this movie entails in terms of more traditional blockbuster fare captain america civil war also has some fun action sequences sprinkled about at a rather even rate theyre well choreographed paced anddespite some distracting handheld camerawork at timesare nicely shot the russo brothers have demonstrated their ability to balance humor with action with captain america the winter solider and their abilities generally carry on here with these aspects i was mostly enjoying the movie however its the last hour or so that begins to show how constricted these movies are by their studio formula kevin feiges obsession with only creating a cinematic universe instead of movies that work well on their own is really starting to catch up with him and its becoming more and more apparent why edgar wright left antman of course theres the obligatory issue of wait what is happening and how are all of you connected but ive come to accept this flaw in this sort of franchisebased filmmaking this isnt as messy or crowded as avengers age of ultron but it still exhibits some of those same issues they arent as pervasive but instead rear their head towards the end suffice it to say that the climax doesnt do nearly as much with its potential as it could have it appears to have some punch when youre watching it but when the resolution comes about you realize that not much has changed and that the stasis is pretty much the same as act one it plays it safe which is underwhelming when this movie could have been somewhat of a gamechanger within the marvel cinematic universe it ends up being more of the same and the amount of humorous moments alone cant make it feel like more than it really ismore of the same captain america civil war allows itself to surpass the previous entries of the mcu but this entry seems to further establish that these movies are just getting bigger and more populated as opposed to newer and more exciting it knows how to balance its humor the ingredients are there but when you sidestep the available opportunities for the sake of introducing more characters and maintaining the franchises relevance in an evergrowing scape of superhero blockbusters its undeniably disappointing even if it isnt bad 610 okay one thumb down average etc
Apr 26 2015,positive,captain america civil wars emphasis on themes and characters makes it far more interesting than most other marvel films albeit not quite as groundbreaking as it wants itself to be because we have gotten to know most of these characters fairly well over the course of several films the conflict is delivered with genuine weight and tension as far as the hero characters go nobody is really a hero and nobody is really a villain and this moral dilemma is perhaps the films greatest strength furthermore civil war also is surprisingly funny at times its action sequences for the most part are terrific and yes spiderman absolutely steals the show unfortunately the ending of the film felt a bit rushed and unsatisfying and the first twenty minutes or so are pretty rough however once the movie gets going it keeps getting better and better as it goes along overall it is probably one of the better entries in the marvel cinematic universe in quite some time maybe not groundbreaking but it does renew my excitement for these movies at least a little bit
Apr 26 2015,positive,answered many childhood what if questions of heroes fighting each other one of the best marvel movies till date pacing of the movie was good too
Apr 26 2015,positive,this movie really held up to its predecessors but wasnt quite as enjoyable as the avengers movies with a lot of down time in the movie and not as much humor as the marvel movies have been delivering lately it just cant make it all the way to 5 star rating for me however the character development and the causeandeffect progression was very effective for growing the marvel cinematic universe to include new heroes and villains cant wait to see the next big one
Apr 26 2015,positive,it was really awesome totally better than bvs i loved how the fights lasted longer than bvs and it actually made me and everyone in the salon get exited hope you people enjoy
Apr 25 2015,positive,civil war is a complete package great action interesting characters emotional investment funny quips and the amazing debut of spiderman and black panther this one is a must see 4755
Apr 25 2015,positive,spider man  black panther  ant man awesome great movie must see
Apr 25 2015,positive,good overall movie with one amazing fight scene but not much else after that
Apr 25 2015,positive,good though why they chose to identify the automatic weapons at the beginning of the movie as ar15s is beyond me  ar15s are not automatic weapons  but it does fuel the hype against ar15s
Apr 25 2015,positive,the tension between iron man and cap both in costume and out was intense the addition of black panther and spiderman were highlights for me
Apr 25 2015,positive,loved it action packed great storylinestand out characters are the winter soldier and black panther
Apr 25 2015,positive,pretty good movie kinda hard to understand by not watching other marvel movies though
Apr 25 2015,positive,great movie very entertaining probably the best if not the best one of the captain americaavenger series
Apr 25 2015,positive,biggest superhero movie uptodate live up to the hype in every way we can imagine too bad weve had so many others before
Apr 25 2015,positive,this movie was great
Apr 25 2015,positive,unbelievably good the story is engaging and the action doesnt disappoint
Apr 25 2015,positive,i would give it a 65 but iron man didnt kill cap and bucky 
Apr 25 2015,positive,amazing movie from start to finish
Apr 25 2015,positive,honestly i was blown away while watching this movie the russo brothers are back at it again with an amazing captain america movie from the action to the acting i was on the edge of my seat the whole time in the theater i give civil war 45
Apr 25 2015,positive,one of the best marvel movies in so long
Apr 25 2015,positive,great story with a lot of action of a lot of differentnew superheroes team captain america all the way
Apr 25 2015,positive,the best marvel movie to date an amazing thrill ride from beginning to end and the best portrayal of spiderman on film the russo brothers are kings of the marvel movies
Apr 24 2015,positive,absolutely loved this movie ive seen it twice already and i loved it even more the second time i strongly recommend seeing it in theaters be advised of 2 end credit scenes and tom holland as spider man will make you forget about tobey maguire and andrew garfield holland is the perfect spider man
Apr 24 2015,positive,good movie  action humor more action  black panther was super cool
Apr 24 2015,positive,his is honestly the best marvel movie the performances are fantastic and the humor is great the action sequences were awesome and exhilarating i like how you see the characters become emotional and realize that they need to be put in line   overall this is awesome and i totally recommend seeing this
Apr 23 2015,positive,the a good marvel movie spidermsn was flipping amazing in the movie and so was iron man
Apr 19 2015,positive,the best superhero movie of all time my favorite part is when captain america  iron man fight 910
Apr 17 2015,positive,i dont think ive put anything particularly spoilery in this review but dont come crying to me if you read to the bottom and say ive spoiled it because youve been warned    so civil war to me it was perfect like i have nothing to gripe about some questions perhaps but not questions in a bad light just more something im interested in    what works about civil war is what youll have seen in reviews time and time again none of the main players in this film are heroes nor are they villains regardless of whos team you choose youll still see the others point of view and understand why they think that way there is a villain in this film but you even stop and think through is motivations and can actually empathise with why hes doing what hes doing even if his plan is slightly convoluted it still works very well    the mishmash of characters and personalities in this film gel very well and they all play off each other in a really satisfying way you more or less get a different interaction between every pair of characters at some point and they all fit so well to the characters they are that was one of the big highlights for me theres a lot of comedy between them all but its not as excessive as iron man 3 or avengers age of ultron it fits in all the right places    thank goodness for chris evans as cap though the guy nails it every time i find it difficult to put into words what i thought of his character development i could just totally buy it it fits his character so well he was loyal to his friend no matter what anyone else said and his ideals were about doing what is right morally rather than logically it just totally worked for me and i couldnt be happier     besides cap who is of course my favourite one of the best characters in this film for me was scott langantman he was just a joy to see whenever he showed up on screen and his oneliners absolutely slayed me every time and he does have one of the biggest moments in the film which is mindblowing and hilarious at the same time    tom holland as peter parkerspiderman he absolutely killed it i saw someone say he embodied each of the parts of the tobey maguire and andrew garfields versions that made them great and i completely agree i cant wait to see more of the mcus spiderman his chemistry with tony stark is amazing though im very glad theyve cast rdj in spiderman homecoming    tchallablack panther was excellent though more of a man of action than words he has the occasional laugh but is mostly a stern character driven by his emotions which is great by the way because thats the type of character hes always been his action scenes are some of the most kickass stuff ive seen from superheroes in film im very excited for his solo movie now    tony stark has gone through some serious character development since he nearly destroyed the world in age of ultron hes still very cocky but much less so than before hes moved much closer to the tony from the comics who sometimes the line between being a herodoing what he thinks is right regardless of the costs blurs a little his motivations scream logic and at the same time hes suffering some personal problems hes a very broken man in this story and kudos to rdj because it really shows looking at it as someone who agrees with caps views he is irritating and whiney but it just helps the story along and by the end of the film you can see why hes taking the actions he takes and you half root for him but you also wish hed stop    natasha natasha oh how i weep for natasha shes back at full strength just like she was in winter soldier there are hints towards the atrocity of what was done with her in age of ultron but nothing thatll carry over in the future but i weep for her because shes so conflicted in this film shes trying to do what she thinks is right the path of least resistance but at the same time her heart is strongly with steve shes there for him when he needs her and its beautiful but you can tell she really wishes hed just go along with tonys ideals for his own good once steve breaks the rules she does come across slightly as tonys bitch but i think thats just because steve has made things much worse and shes pissed that he wouldnt trust her advice as a friend there are also a few good references to her strong friendship with clint too its just a shame that she vanishes from the film at the end of the second act but overall i was happy with her portrayal here    i thought scarlet witch and vision were super cute throughout although there is a point where vision gets this creepy overprotective twilight vibe to him which feels a little gross but it doesnt last long hes like an awkward teenager around her still struggling to understand what his emotions are it was actually one of the funniest parts of the film wanda is in a similar conflict coming to terms with what she is all of the power inside her and how dangerous she can be i think thats what connects them quite well im hoping itll build towards something for them in the future    surprise surprise clint has very limited screen time but i think what we see if him is some of the best hawkeye material weve had in the mcu hes becoming a much more rounded character each time he wasnt afraid to tell tony what he thought of him and as in the comics hes pretty funny theres still small reference to his miraculous family from age of ultron but they kept in his fatherlike relationship with scarlet witch which i thought was nice you can also tell that he still platonically loves natasha to bits    sam wilsonfalcon is another comedy powerhouse in this film and the way anthony mackie delivers oneliners just had me in stitches every time at the same time there is a lot of emotion there hes totally a loyal righthand man to steve and hes not afraid to tell him when he doesnt agree his chemistry with bucky is phenomenal too i loved their banter so much id love to see more of that in the future    bucky was another highlight for me in that we get to see a much more of him as a person again which is a delight the chemistry between stevebucky and sambucky as i already mentioned were both great theres a scene where steve and bucky have a small moment which feels like youve jumped back to them in the first film i was really happy with that hes not the same though having gone through brainwashing by hydra hes much more solemn and broken as a person which is heartbreaking even more so because hes still willing to follow his best friend into battle as he always did  the climax of his story here is both happy and sad at the same time its not the ending i wanted but it works    this is clearly a film where best friends have heartbreaking stories because rhodey remains a serious character throughout he has a couple of funny lines but i found him to be a small voice of reason the trailer teases some bad stuff for him and what that leads to i thought was very sad    sharon carter has limited screen time in this film i was quite happy with her she didnt annoy me and she was genuinely loyal to steve it didnt feel just shoehorned to me the chemistry between them isnt massive but i thought it was enough for them to earn what they got there is a moment between them and you then see sam and buckys reaction to it i thought it was so funny because it was something i could really relate to from steves point of view  there is definitely a small progression in their relationship since winter soldier but i hope we get more because i found it very interesting in the comics    the airport fight scene is amazing ive felt that reviews havent done it enough justice which isnt surprising because when it comes the feeling of awe and excitement is indescribable just seeing these characters marching towards each other slowly getting faster just keeps building it up to this spectacle that just has you excited at every turn wondering whats gonna happen next truly the best superhero action scene in film to date    and the final fight we come to a revelation that if youre a big fan you can probably guess already when it happen i loudly went oh noo its an emotionally charged slugfest which batman vs supermans final face off wishes it was tonys motivation for it is completely sound but steve just feels he has to do what he believes is right youre not sure who to root for because in a way theyre both right i found it absolutely satisfying as a fan though    i would easily recommend this film to anyone though
Apr 13 2015,positive,im planning on watching it again butit didnt give me the wow winter soldier had and while the fights and visual effects were intense too many characters made it busy stan lee was awesome
Apr 12 2015,positive,best super hero movie ever lol
Apr 12 2015,positive,something different but can be seen to be much great movie for me could make it better but this normal thing well done a bit asleep
Apr 10 2015,positive,what can i say about civil war well itwasfucking awesome o my god this was probably one of the best movies that marvel has ever made two teams fighting to death including blackpanther antman and a new spiderman what more could you ask for in the end i defiantly recommend seeing captain america civil war now
Apr 9 2015,positive,civil war has managed to up the ante in a universe where the ante is upped every movie it has also managed to develop all the characters and give us the best action in any superhero movie ever the airport scene is the greatest action sequence of all time  a
Apr 7 2015,positive,an incredible marvel film that nails everything involved
Apr 4 2015,positive,captain america civil war blew my mind now being the best movie in the mcu
Mar 21 2015,positive,captain america civil war review    the good  this movie is fan freaking tastic if you are a true fan of comics marvel or dc you should be able to see itâ     everyone gives a great performance and gets their own moment to shine    captain america and iron man are the leads and are great as always and their back and forth not just fighting but talking about their different ideals you see why they believe in their own agendasâ     the winter soldier is great once again i feel sebastian stan gets better in each cap film    chadwick boseman kills it as black panther he is such a badass and has his own motive to fight    tom holland as peter parkerspiderman even though he is in it for a good 30 mins he owns it as the character this is the truest from comic book â cartoon â video game to big screen ever cause hes actually a teenager being a teenager not a grown man pretending to be a teenager plus he doesnt cry or turn emo    antman is just great he is just giant fantastic     the airport scene is the best suoerhero action scene ever its fantastic cant spoiler much    a much better story than the civil war comic    great visual effects    probably funnier than guardians of the galaxy and antman    great funeral scene     some great stunt work and camera workâ     helmet zemo you understand why he is doing what he is doing it took me time to realize that    overall i love this movie it could be the best marvel movie of all time â need to see it a gain it definitely helped black panther and spiderman have hype for their own movies thisbis better than both avenger films  and is the best marvel trilogy    overall grade a     this is my favorite movie so far in 2016

Feb 24 2015,positive,near perfect sequel continues the story and restarts the story of several marvel franchises pretty well id recommend watching all the previous films prior to seeing this one in order to have each story straight in mind special effects are top notch my personal feeling is that it is better to see this in 3d however it wouldnt make too much difference if one saw it in 2d judge for yourself
Feb 16 2015,positive,such an amazing movie i got slightly disappointed when by the end no one actually dies like was said spider man is amazing in this film until i watched this i didnt really enjoy spider man but now im soooo exited for spiderman homecoming holy s what do i do now spider man  i dont know hold them off or something tony
Feb 14 2015,positive,greatest marvel movie ever loved it tom holland as spiderman was great
Feb 9 2015,positive,even though they fought they brought peace within each other at the end
Feb 7 2015,positive,even friends can be your biggest enemies    captain america civil war is behind iron man winter soldier and guardians of the galaxy of being the best movie in the marvel cinematic universe or mcu for short the movie has its flaws but that doesnt stop me from liking it i dont know about you but the captain america series are the only movies in the mcu that actually get better with its squeals the action the effects the humor the characters and its stunt work has improved from the first movie    what this movie dose so well is that its really hard to pick a side because both sides have a very good reason to be at each others throats one minute im rooting for tony and the next im rooting for cap its conflict like this that i couldnt decide for myself on who side i was on or who was right but thats just the fun of it    tom holland as spiderman might be one of the best adaption of the character that weve had sony studios has made over five spiderman movies and the two actors who played spiderman maguire and garfield did their very best of what their got but didnt quite capture the character that we know and love but the spiderman in this movie has a screen time of 30 minutes or more and holland managed to capture the character so perfectly that it makes sony studios look lousy he was excellent in the role and i would go as far to say that he was a billion times better than maguire and garfield in my opinion i cant wait to see more of him in spiderman homecoming thats out next year    speaking of good casting  chadwick boseman was pretty damn awesome as black panther boseman can basically play anything and im not kidding you when i say that as he played jackie robinson james brown and now black panther chadwick boseman has some crazy talent and him as black panther was spot on casting im looking forward to seeing his solo film coming out in 2018    if you thought the stunt work in winter soldier was outstanding then wait until you see the stunt work in this movie as it was justincredible all the heavy praise belongs to the stunt team for doing the impossible    now for the problems daniel brühl is a boring villain i honestly cant remember much about his character in the movie and thats because he was pretty forgettable that came across a bit too harsh didnt it it really sucks for me to say that because daniel brühl is great actor and sometimes he can be the saving grace for a movie thats either good or bad he wasnt awful or anything like that its just that i didnt find him treating at all    martin freeman is a great actor and im glad hes getting more meaty roles but he doesnt do anything special or interesting in this movie yes i know his character is probably going to developed more in the next movies but my problem here is that he really felt out of place in this movie at times the movie itself completely forgets about him so every time he popped back up on screen i was like oh martin freeman is in this movie i totally forgot about that but thats just me    the story was a bit meh and there was a little bit too much quick cut edits in the fight scenes that i couldnt get all that infested with now dont get me wrong i like the airport fight and the iron man v cap fight because those scenes didnt have stupid quick cuts and i could easily see whats happening i think its the handtohand combat fights that are too cutter for me to see whats going on thats just my opinion    overall captain america civil war lives up to the hype of being a great superhero movie and being a good movie on its own marvel is having a great track record thus far with the box office success great reviews and many upcoming spin offs civil war is most likely going to win every fanboys heart and its not hard to see why
Feb 3 2015,positive,some parts in the story were totally unbelievablelike how would cap know about tonys parents deaths also why the hell did zemo kill the other winter soldiers shouldve totally used them
Feb 1 2015,positive,the best marvel movie in the mcu
Jan 30 2015,positive,civil war is the next step of making a quicky comic book movie  to an evaluation to its not about people in spandex but more about people and lifes to be risked    also tom holand the best spiderman next to toby mugire
Jan 30 2015,positive,captain america civil war is a superhero greek tragedy but in the absolute best way possible also it really says something that this superhero film is probably deeper and more moving then anything else well see this year
Jan 26 2015,positive,without the distractions of a huge alien invasion the avengers are featured in a much more grounded storyline that sees them divided over the sokovia accords a bill that plans to see them monitored a policed     featuring a great cast and one of the best action sequences in the mcu ever the film at 2 and a half hours never feels like a drag a great ending to the captain america trilogy and a great start to phase 3
Jan 19 2015,positive,darker complex and poignant captain america civil war is a gamechanging follow up to both its predecessor the winter soldier and avengers age of ultron that breaks free from usual marvel studios formula raises stakes and ultimately delivers a lot of spectacle to accommodate its strong script making for an rewarding film going experience
Jan 17 2015,positive,wow that was amazing marvel knows how to make crowded movies work so well as cap says theres a lot going on that you dont understand and like the sub conflicts the mesh with the main conflict and how its resolved it was perfect it was just like and was so freakin i cant even make a comprehend able sentence about it but my gosh best spiderman ever scarlet witch vision  black panther were also some of my favorites and they used them so creatively
Jan 17 2015,positive,after dc showed us that two idolized comic book characters that conflicted with one another couldnt somehow work marvel had to take that responsibility of doing that while still setting up the later films introducing new characters and being enjoyable for the fans and after age of ultron disappointed in a hard way for the fans even for director joss whedon does the russo brothers fill in for that gap and continue their other successful captain america film winter soldier yep they sure as hell did this duo has proved that their work on television shows like community and arrested development has payed off immensely cause civil war not only doesnt just feel like avengers 3 and a continuation of winter soldier first but also did what sadly batman v superman failed to do give us a reason for these characters to fight and do it so that it makes sense the positives are this its well acted both from the primary and secondary characters the action is well directed and well made with the exception of some obvious cg put here and there the cinematography and direction are as good as winter soldier the jokes were all well put together and some made me laugh out loud a very surprisingly  well done pace that fleshes out each character and set piece  the conflict and plot are reasonable and well executed and the new editions like black panther  spiderman were fantastic to see and makes me anticipated for their future films slight issues however can come from the movies safe ending rushed character intros or deaths shaky cam action that gets a bit nauseating at times some jokes were hit or miss here and there and it did have a very underdeveloped but still decently made villain other than that civil war shows that not only is marvel setting up standards pretty well but is also giving us a reason to come back and see their movies now while it isnt up to the standards of their other film winter solider which in my opinion is the best mcu film since iron man it is still something to check out    score 85  10
Jan 16 2015,positive,captain america civil war is the latest marvel movie and the start of phase 3 this time anthony and joe russo return for this film after their fantastic job on the winter soldier captain america civil war is a fantastic movie and it might just be the best marvel film yet civil war has one of the best ensemble casts of the mcu and there are too many to talk about so ill quickly list them off robert downey jr and chris evans are both tremendous in their roles and continue to be the definitive iron man and captain america chris evans continues to be an incredibly likeable and absolute badass robert downey jr gives his best and most human performance since the first iron man movie it could have been so easy to make iron man completely unlikeable but hes still very likeable downey jr has so many great little moments like when he stops bucky shooting him as shown in the trailer the look on his face is just brilliant and he has lots of great subtle moments throughout chadwick boseman is brilliant as black panther hes an absolute badass and i cant wait to see him return sebastian stan is excellent as bucky and i didnt hate him which was great scarlett johansson and jeremy renner are both great with black widow being great as usual and hawkeye continuing to become more and more likeable and interesting anthony mackie and don cheadle are both great although at times war machine feels a tad sidelined same can be said about paul bettany as the vision who while still badass is doesnt get as much to do as he did in age of ultron and doesnt have as great a moment as his big one in age of ultron elizabeth olsen has gotten a lot better since age of ultron and her character is much better paul rudd is utterly hilarious as ant man its great to see him return and he steals the show along with tom hollands spiderman this is in my opinion the best spiderman weve seen hes hilarious hes likeable and i am so excited to see him return for his own film anthony and joe russo return to direct and they did an excellent job we have here a perfect blend of humour and action and this film is in no way boring the writing here is great theres a few plot holes here and there but for the most part no scenes feel pointless this film is technically amazing with great editing dynamic cinematography that makes the action set pieces look flawless the sound mixing and lighting is all perfect the cgi is amazing and i dont think theres a bad effect in the film daniel bruhl plays zemo and although people could think that hes a weak villain zemo is an excellent villain he may not be the most physically imposing villain but hes a great manipulater and i think hes the best marvel villain behind loki the action set pieces here are fantastic there are lots of gritty hand to hand combat sequences in the first half of the film the action is great but the highlight is the truly amazing airport sequence its one of if not the best action scene in a superhero film there are so many brilliant moments i dont want to ruin but its just amazing the end action sequence is emotional gritty violent and at points heartbreaking the ending of this film is the best of any marvel movies and i cant wait to see the impacts of what it will have on the rest of the mcu films one of the great things about this film is just how not black and white it is going in i was rooting for captain america but there is no point during the film where i hated the other side or was only rooting for one side in contrast with batman vs superman where both characters where dicks i actually cared about who won and was really invested the ending is nail bitingly tense and i was actually on the edge of my seat as for problems i have very few the biggest one is that great actors like frank grillo and martin freeman are quite wasted but thats really it for problems overall captain civil war is a near perfect comic book film with great action funny moments a dark story high stakes and lots of great chemistry between our actors i loved this film and i cant wait to see it again a
Jan 13 2015,positive,i know im really really late on reviewing this movie ive just been really busy but here it is captain america civil war is my second favorite mcu movie with captain america winter solider being my first the russo brothers did it again i believe that they will do it again with infinity war part 1  2 i still wish that they would have waited a little longer to make this movie because i wanted a really big battle like in the comics well  this movie isnt the comics in fact its actually different in many ways but in its own great way the action was incredible this movie contains one of the best if not the best fight sequences in movie history lets just say when they hit up a airport things get wild ive seen this movie in theaters twice now both times in imax the only way i recommend seeing this movie not imax 3d just regular imax and i will say i eat it all up the standout superhero in the movie is defiantly black panther if this movie doesnt get you existed for the black panther movie the i think youre tripping they nailed black panther from his personality to his costume his agility strength speed all that he was just fantastic chadwick boseman did a great job everyone here did fantastic everyone was concerned this was just going to be an avengers movie just me its not it really is a captain america movie you can feel the tense between steve rogers and tony stark they both give fantastic performances as usual but the chemistry between these two is good that when the downfall goes through you feel it lets talk about another character they nailed spiderman oh man they absolutely got peter and spiderman perfect it was so awesome to get the spiderman all us kids who grew up watching the cartoon and reading the comics knew and loved this movie contains so much and the russo brother did what josh whedon couldnt do in his second time directing make time for everyone then again there was a lot of conflict between whedon and marvel who knows what happened either way i really didnt think age of ultron was that good a lot of people are hating on the villain but im not sure why i thought he actually was a fantastic villain his motivations are clear and his actions speak one of the best villains in the mcu i absolutely love this movie ill be seeing it again one more time go see this movie if youre a superhero man marvel fan dc fan marvel and dc fan film fan just go see this movie its fantastic
Jan 10 2015,positive,the best out of all of themso far the plot id well written and the acting i greatit is a must see movue for fans
Jan 9 2015,positive,take the directors of the film that turned captain america into one of the most popular marvel heroes on film and add many other characters we all and love and what do you get a great movie that not only guarantees action but amazing drama coming from great actors
Jan 7 2015,positive,its like a mini avengers movie which i consider a good thing the added characters of spiderman black panther and baron zemo are all fantastic there are a lot of great action scenes and all the superheroes each get their moment to shine
Dec 29 2014,positive,great  movie  all the way
Dec 28 2014,positive,one of the best super heroe movies ever made it has a lot of action it has great acting awesome plot and so much more this is a must watch
Dec 20 2014,positive,had the best time ever
Dec 14 2014,positive,i thought this was another really enjoyable captain america film that was also a lot more about the winter soldier than the last one good action and humour as usual the former was more intimate and satisfying especially the finale that didnt feel drawn out looking forward to seeing how the mcu now plays out after this shakeup
Dec 9 2014,positive,this movie was pretty good i loved it just a couple of scenes were bad its between a really like and really love anyways i loved how there were so many characters in the movie i wont spoil alert anything btw new stuff this movie will tell how the next avengers were of course and also this movie shouldnt be called captain america civil war it should be just avengers civil war or marvel civil war for ages 12
Dec 8 2014,positive,it was so expect i could not tell who was the good guys from the bad guy so much action it was so cool can wait until it comes out on dvd and the next avengers movie or other captain america movie that are wicked cool movie this movie was that wicked cool
Dec 7 2014,positive,no spoilers here id say teamcap and teamironman to me feel like the current political climate in that one wants control over all of it teamironman while the other stresses choice and freedom teamcap i will always side with teamcap anyhow i loved every single minute of captain america  civil war and there is so much action so many surprises and its all so awesome and well tied together that i simply must watch it again     âoh and stay for 2 scenes in the end one before the credits and another after the credits
Dec 3 2014,positive,i felt a little miffed about this film i was expecting a winter soldier story carry over from the best marvel film ever winter soldier but what i got was avenger 25 that isnt a bad thing except the story line gets overloaded with a few too many characters this movie should not have jumped to such an important comic story line ironman did not need to be in this movie it could have graciously introduced panther and webhead without making the film so thin
Dec 3 2014,positive,i wanna watch it again wait i can
Nov 30 2014,positive,too many characters but brings up an interesting debate
Nov 30 2014,positive,superb start to marvels phase 3 slate of films spiderman and black panther are excellent additions to the mcu and the airport fight scene is one of the best youll ever see in a superhero film
Nov 26 2014,positive,definitely the best captain america movie
Nov 23 2014,positive, this review contains spoilers  fantastic awesome marvel movie starring mostly ever   avenger ever except thor and hulk its cool how iron mans team and captain americas team are just awesome like when vision likes or hits on scarlet witch and they probably love each other because vision always helps scarlet witch than his own master iron man its sad that all of captain americas team ends up in jail but cap sent a letter to iron man about if you need us implying if iron mans avengers need caps team they will come and put aside there differences i need to talk about spiderman and black panther spidermans introduction in this movie will be the same scene from spiderman homecoming i bet he acts like a teenager wanting to go to school and just plays around and gets starstruck by every avenger in this movie i hope his movie doesnt suck like andrew whats his face movies aka amazing spiderman series that was terrible black panther in this movie was awesome tacular i thought he was always the black panther but nope he was just training to be black panther and his dad was black panther or he appointed someone to be black panther it will be cool how his movie turns out because his villain was already in avengers age of ultron and he was cool because ultron ripped off his hand off the best part about this movie was when they fought and when antman turned into a giant aka andre the giant if you get my reference i thought somebody would die in this movie iron man bucky or captain america its sad that bucky is going back in his freezing cold cell and will be asleep for probably 50 years and his arm comes off by iron man ripping it off it was freaky how it came off but by far everything i said scarlet witch was my favorite
Nov 23 2014,positive,its one of the biggest comic book ideas it has iron man in it so what does that tell you
Nov 15 2014,positive,best marvel movie ever i wish i can give it 10 out of 10 stars
Nov 14 2014,positive,this is easily marvels most adult movie as it does not provide all the answers in a clear fashion it also spends more time talking about the topic at hand rather than giving actions sequences however when the action happens civil war is a thrill to behold and it is dramatic as well as intense due to the character motivations say for a few are clearly addressed this is if batman v superman had several movies to build up to and the motivations were clearly stated in other words if it was good
Nov 6 2014,positive,a great movie spiderman was really good in it
Nov 6 2014,positive,over the top action and well scripted very entertaining one of the best super hero movies ever
Nov 6 2014,positive,91  boasting an incredible assortment of classic comic book characters captain america civll war subverts marvel expectations to deliver a fun thrilling and wellearned experience    v 81
Nov 2 2014,positive,captain america civil war begins phase three of the marvel cinematic universe with an explosion of thrills action humor and very effective drama and unlike batman v superman the film provides lots of fanservice while still being a great movie its the best captain america movie and one of the best comic book movies ive ever seen yeah im talking avengers good
Nov 2 2014,positive,i have been on board with the marvel bandwagon since the original iron man and while iron man was more my favorite as a kidalthough still not my favorite character in general the captain america films have easily become my favorites in the mcu lineup and civil war is by far the best in my opinion at this point now to be honest if you want to but pick this could just have easily been called avengers 25 as the movie feels like a direct sequel to age of ultron in many ways but it definitely picks up where winter soldier left off as well this movie is awesome pure and simple the characters are all given the proper screen time the actionholy crap is phenomenal the new additions to the cast were greatbest onscreen spiderman to date trust me and black panther was fantastic too and the story was very well done and thoroughly entertaining all in all if youve enjoyed any of the past mcu entries you should enjoy this one go check it out on the big screen while you can
Oct 28 2014,positive,a  rivals the first avengers as marvels greatest film
Oct 28 2014,positive,best marvel movie in history wow just wow the action sequences were incredible all the characters brought something hugeeee to the film  captain america more violent than ever i thought i was gonna die i just cant find myself thinking another thing about this movie just wow
Oct 24 2014,positive,the movie was just alright the only reason im giving this movie a 4 star rating is because of the superhero fight with captain americas team and iron mans team the part of the movie was brilliant and funny at the same time
Oct 24 2014,positive,what a great movie  lived up to all my expectations great feud between iron and capt as well as introducing the other characters for the next part of the series
Oct 19 2014,positive,absolutely loved it
Oct 19 2014,positive,captain america civil war is the crem de la crem for the marvel cinematic universe and is easily the best film since the russos last entry winter soldier and arguably the true sequel to the original avengers having to deal with newly minted supervision from the un council after the disbanding of shield and having to deal with all of their aftermath for all of their battles to date captain america goes against the grain and rebels especially when the latest target to be brought to justice is his former colleague bucky barnes aka the winter solider himself also realing from all the wracked guilt for the casualties from their heroic dearing do and potentially the break up with pepper potts iron man immediately signed up to the newly minted slovokia accords for supervision and guidance the tension is real and plays a lot like the marvel version of the dark knight in terms of feel most defintely quality  and also continues the tips of the hat to 70s political thrillers as well the introductions of the black panther the tom holland spidey and baron zemo are very fleshed out and acted well and the set up or inuendo of their now officially being two separate teams after the fall out of civil war is extremely enticing also some of the visual gags hinted at in the trailers play out extremely well  the mcu are in great hands of the russos after the departure of whedon and for that i am really thankful 
Oct 16 2014,positive,its not an exaggeration when i say this latest marvel installment is one of my favorite comic book films ever  just like with captain america winter solider the russo brothers do a fantastic job balancing plot character development thrills fun humor and action  unlike another comic book film that came out this year that involved hero vs hero the disappointing batman v superman this one lays out clear motivations for both sides without making either one essentially wrong  it also does a solid job in introducing new characters like black panther and spiderman making me all the more excited for their respective future films  spiderman especially will have you laughing every time he is on screen  oh and the massive battle royale between the heroes  was everything this diehard comic book nerd could hope for  highly recommended for the whole family
Oct 13 2014,positive,the best captain america movie so far
Oct 10 2014,positive,one of the best marvel films ive ever seen along with deadpool 2016 has been a great year
Oct 4 2014,positive,not bad but whats up with all this good vs good
Oct 4 2014,positive,while this is definitely marvels best film it may be the best superhero movie ever made
Sep 11 2014,positive,with the unprecedented success of captain america the winter soldier it was a nobrainer that directors anthony and joe russo would be back for the sequel while it doesnt quite live up to the tight thrilling plot of winter soldier civil war is a fun actionpacked characterdriven film    there are plenty of opportunites to show the central conflict of the film steve and tonys disagreement while forceful never amounts to bitterness resentment or hatred despite the fact that the movies contains many many characters comparable to the avengers it does not feel overstuffed everyone gets their moment to shine    the characters are what drives this movie this is the first time i have really seen tony stark be more memorable than iron man while it is ostesibly steve rogers movie it really feels like more of an ensemble piece i dont know if the movie can justify its captain america title it definitely feels like avengers 25 but i do enjoy a good ensemble piece    i have spoken at length about many of the actors who have inhabited these superhero roles for years so i will instead focus on the newcomers chadwick boseman gives an incredible amount of nuance for a supporting character emily vancamps agent 13 gets a little more fleshed out although in a true captain america movie i would expect more focus tom holland was a terrific choice for peter parker i eagerly anticipate his upcoming film martin freeman puts on a ver convincing american accent and i also want more of him finally daniel bruhl plays a great softspoken baron zemo    as i mentioned it does note quite reach the lofty heights of its predecessor but only because winter soldier was so good marvel is not showing signs of slowing down and this movie is the culmination of eight years of stellar filmmaking
Sep 10 2014,positive,spectacular amazing fantastic i cannot wait to see this again
Sep 3 2014,positive,i liked it fun action packed blockbuster movie with even more heroes in one place black panther and antman stole the movie with new spiderman following closely fighting was again coreographed really good too bad crossbones didnt last longer all that secrecy while filming was a waste
Aug 24 2014,positive,another fantastic marvel film did extremely well very familyfriendly better than deadpool or the other crap that century fox video
Aug 24 2014,positive,a step down for marvel studios after the incredible winter soldier remains an enjoyable disappointment
Aug 19 2014,positive,it looks like marvel has made their finest film thanks to the russo brothers strong direction and an awesome script that knows its characters well
Aug 17 2014,positive,well written   great action  best spider man
Aug 13 2014,positive,not only a fantastic and entertaining superhero movie but its simply nothing short of being a spectacular film in its own right     the russo brothers deliver on a strong emotional story with dark themes while also staying true to the wonder and magic of marvel with great humour incredible action and amazing introductions to certain new characters
Aug 11 2014,positive,a complex compelling story that blends fun and humor with drama and gravitas captain america civil war ranks with the best of the marvel cinematic universe
Aug 8 2014,positive,an excellent comic book movie that continues to show why marvel dominates the comic book movie universe great fight sequences with an intriguing plot and lots of emotion
Aug 6 2014,positive,bloody marvellous
Aug 4 2014,positive,not as enjoyable as i thought it was going to be but i still enjoyed it nonetheless i think having built it up since its announcement meant that the film had a lot to live up to and this may have had an affect on my viewing the introduction of the new characters was done well and i am now counting down the days until spidermans debut marvel film the inclusion of so many characters did mean that some were given less character development than others but this is inevitable in this type of film i still believe they managed to do the best they could with all the characters they had my main criticism might be the end of the film where despite all the hype it doesnt really feel like too much has changed you could argue that the team being split is a difference from the start but to me this was an expected minimum going into this film
Aug 4 2014,positive,captain america civil war is a triumph in all sense of the word it is a pure marvel no pun intended to behold in all honestly it has to be one of the greatest comic book movies weve ever gotten no joke what marvel has crafted here with their cinematic universe is astonishing and with 13 movies in how they manage to all stay so great still shocks me some of them may not be as great as the others but theres no denying their entertainment value and the fact that were getting all of the heroes whether it be the ones we know and love or new and unique ones on the screen and then were getting them all together its truly astonishing what marvel is doing and they have undoubtedly changed the comic book movie landscape forever there were so many things i loved about this movie and lets dive in on all of them first up the characters and the actors who portray them of course we all know who captain america and iron man and chris evans and robert downey jr have fully committed to these roles and they will be the only ones ill ever see as these heroes are and we all know the supporting avengers like black widow and hawkey falcon or war machine to name them and here they are of course kicking ass and being better than ever vision is still a bad ass as is the winter soldier scarlet witch and vision are quickly becoming two of my favorite avengers the one who really shines here is paul rudd as antman he brings the right sense of humor in every scene hes in and not to mention antman is a total bad ass rudd is honestly the perfect choice to play antman and that is on full display here no doubt chadwick boseman is also fantastic as black panther and black panther is absolutely awesome and is a total bad ass i cant wait for his solo movie its going to be fantastic mainly because chadwick boseman is fantastic as the character whether is elizabeth olsen paul bettany anthony mackie don cheadle sebastian stan jeremy renner or scarlett johansson these actors are perfect in their roles and all fit them wonderfully now to talk about the one who weve all been waiting for tom holland as spiderman i honestly didnt have a doubt he wouldnt be great and my thoughts were correct holland is the finest portrayal of the webslinger weve gotten onscreen this film just made me even more excited for his standalone movie marvel has finally done the character of spiderman right and i cant wait to see what holland is going to take the character the russo brothers really know these characters and thief crafted yet another thrilling marvel film they especially seem to know the character of captain america very well because even though there are other avengers in this film this is definitely a captain america movie my fear before i saw this movie that the civil war wouldnt be very high stake and it would feel like a sort of scrimmage but no this was a war and all of the avengers had motives that made sense and real reasons why they had problems or were mad at each other you could tell they were all out for blood and that the fighting was for real the stakes were high in this movie and you could feel it and the airport scene is  one of the greatest action sequences in any comic book movie ever and probably one of the greatest scenes in any comic book movie ever period i dare say possibly in any movie ever its 15 minutes of non stop thrilling action that never let up as for action the movie is filled with it and it is all stunning and fantastically filmed and choreographed my only complaint with the film is that the villain zemo isnt very fleshed out and hes very underdeveloped i understood his motives for not liking the avengers i just didnt think he was all that menacing and the one scene crossbones was in he was pretty bad ass i wouldve liked to see more of him or maybe even have him as the main villain overall captain america civil war is in my option the finest film marvel has put out and my personal favorite of the entire 13 film marvel cinematic universe i cant wait to see this film again and i cant wait to own it so i can rewatch it endlessly one of the greatest comic book films we have
Aug 3 2014,positive,the best movie from marvel so far heights of epicness must watch for everyone
Aug 3 2014,positive,it was a really great funny and actionpacked marvel liveaction adventure it had really stunning cinematography really awesome action really exciting adventure really well done costumes really great special effects really good music really well humor really great characters and a really good story this is the best marvel movie ever made this year ive seen this movie in imax 3d i strongly recommend this movie to old and new captain america fans
Aug 3 2014,positive,first we need to understand that the movie is not like the comic if you dont want to open your mind to a new story please leave the room but if you want to see one of the best or maybe the best movie that marvel studios have made please go and see captain america civil war
Jul 31 2014,positive,loved it  just a fun ride and the product is on autopilot these days
Jul 31 2014,positive,with a deep focus on thoughtprovoking themes and a great sense of maturity captain america civil war brings a new level of impressiveness to the superhero genre the action scenes are technically well put together as well as motivationally thrilling thanks to an incredibly well balanced script that gives each character the amount of time attention and depth they need and deserve in order to shine not to mention the miraculous balance of seriousness and humor that that keeps the audience engaged and entertained  45 web shooters out of 5
Jul 29 2014,positive,wow the final fight scene was epic the acting in this movie was flawless rdj kills it they all do the action was non stop also spider man changed the mood of the film during the airport scene overall great movie seen it 2x already going for a 3rd 2nite
Jul 28 2014,positive,loved this just loved this
Jul 28 2014,positive,i keep trying to but i cant seem to find a single thing wrong with civil war
Jul 27 2014,positive,a fantastic film with wit and smarts one of the best superhero films ever made and defently at the top of the mcu they did spiderman perfectly he is worth the admission alone
Jul 26 2014,positive,although not as engaging as the winter soldier this is a really solid movie with a decent story this is by far the best franchise in marvel universe much better than the avengers
Jul 25 2014,positive,captain america civil war is by far the best comic book film that the marvel cinematic universe has to offer this film proceeds past avengers avengersage of ultron ironman and winter soldier this is the best comic book movie that the russo brothers pulled off
Jul 24 2014,positive,another phenomenal entry in the marvel cinematic universe not gonna go into much detail because honestly it just calls out to be seen by everyone  everyone who enjoyed the first avengers movie some of the reviews i came across well the titles and main point didnt want to risk spoilers were right that this is what age of ultron shouldve been this is a worthy successor to the avengers except its a captain america movie and it really is  yes it has been said its like avengers 25 but the core of this movie is still cap given the circumstances surrounding bucky  it has action yes but it doesnt overload your senses  its got drama yes but it doesnt make you feel down  and its got comedy sure but it doesnt overtake the story      all the actors gave their agame for this one  the russo brothers are also 2 for 2 with their entries to the mcu first was the captain america sequel winter soldier  they show that the third avengers film is in very capable hands    and this isnt spoilery anymore really i think everyone is very aware of a certain superhero making his debut in the mcu but spiderman was amazing  and even though there wasnt much of him antman was still great and when not if you see it youre gonna get a major kick out of it all about i think midway i didnt know what time it was since i didnt want to reach for my phone to check time also black panther was awesome and now i look forward to his solo film in february of 2018    also the theater was pretty packed i like to have almost a row to myself i didnt i was third row to avoid people but kinda hard when a lot of people wanted to see this and while some people still left before the very end scene there are two postcredit scenes the initial after end title sequence then one at the very end after the credit roll like there typically is when i got up there were a shit load of people also just leaving so i think after 8 years people are finally wising up about these movies mostly having additional scenes  also the crowd went crazy  there were a lot of cheers when a superhero did something spectacular and applause at the end  ive been to movies where that has happened before deadpool but this seemed much more prevalent  so sounds like the audience i was in loved the movie too     i plan to see it again in 2 days which will mark the first time ive ever seen a movie twice in the same week  i also want to see it at least one more time after that when the crowds die a bit so i can enjoy it more without all the cheering and laughing not that that is an issue probably just looking for an excuse to see it as often as i can honestly  its that good    and as always loved stan lees cameo 
Jul 10 2014,positive,captain america civil war is flat out fantastic it combines the best parts from winter soldier and the avengers while adding the new stand out characters spiderman and black panther the directors the russo brothers did such a great job stuffing the film with awesome comic book moments while keeping the film fluent and comprehensible best mcu film to date     9810
Jul 9 2014,positive,this is easily the best marvel movie since the first avengers
Jul 4 2014,positive,im sure everyone will love this movie even robert downey jr
Jun 30 2014,positive,dc and warner bros need to take a good hard look on how marvel is doing it cause they just hit a grand slam civil war is a long time coming with 13 movies now and 8 years to build these characters up an advantage bvs didnt have this feels like a culmination of alot of things and despite everything it needs to accomplish it all comes together in what is undoubtedly marvels finest film     relationships are at the centre of this movie whether its cap and buck tony and cap wanda and vision i could go on forever but it works cause you have been with alot of these characters for so long and the rusos take full advantage even new faces like bosemans black panther are introduced wonderfully and dont feel shoehorned in speaking of new characters i know everyone has said it but this is the best on screen spiderman and one of the best things about the movie holland somehow makes a character we have seen countless times now feel fresh and above all fun     this is marvel at the top of their game with action the airport scene in particular felt like that earned culmination marvel has been building towards and its nothing but pure jaw dropping spectacle     and despite everything happening it never feels overstuffed like ultron did and feels miles more grounded than bvs did its intelligent emotional and above all fun this is as good as summer blockbusters get and the best superhero movie ive seen since the dark knight dc you need to rethink your strategy cause marvel just kicked your ass
Jun 26 2014,positive,interesting long build up to the point of the movie loved the weaving of all the characters from marvel
Jun 26 2014,positive,not only is captain america civil war one of the most entertaining mcu movies so far but along with the winter soldier it is the most mature and thoughtful there are many storylines and characters in civil war yet the russo brothers do a fine job at weaving all the elements together despite some occasional missteps in contrast to most recent mcu films in which the fate of the planet is at stake captain america civil war tells a much more personal story that makes for a nice twist and allows the filmmakers to address the aftermath of the previous films while also delving into some deeper character conflicts and exploring themes like revenge     for the most part civil war feels very much like a continuation to the winter soldier it has a more grounded almost thrillerlike tone than the avengers movies robert downy jr and chris evans carry the movie both delivering very strong performances civil war puts them at odds with each other while also making you understand their motivations there is no clear right or wrong side most of the avengers fit naturally into the story and they are all given things to do and moments to shine that being said some characters were clearly shoehorned into the movie so they could join the big fight dont get me wrong its nice to them here but there is hardly any setup as to why the came tom holland in particular kills it as spiderman     like youve come to expect by a marvel movie there is tons of great humor moreover the action scenes are top notch they are all very well filmed and choreographed and the stunt team deserves big praise the airport sequence is a standout it is extremely entertaining and they did a pretty good job at keeping up with all the characters it does however feel a bit out of place as if the movie took a sidetrack from the more serious drama to this large scale and humor filled action scene the most tense and emotional sequence takes place in the last act finally while the story is more engaging than your average marvel flick it isnt without its questionable moments and i wouldve liked if they had made some bolder choices     overall captain america civil war moves the mcu forward in new and interesting ways it keeps its characters at the forefront while telling a mature and emotional story at the same time it makes for great popcorn entertainment and contains some of the best action sequences in the superhero genre
Jun 23 2014,positive,2008s the dark knight is my second favorite film of all time
Jun 17 2014,positive,one of the best super hero movies ever
Jun 9 2014,positive,a blockbuster in every second of the movie
Jun 8 2014,positive,my only disappointment is that it didnt happen sooner
May 30 2014,positive,42217  avengers disassemble weve seen the avengers fight two faceless armies so now its time for them to fight each other before that we start with winter soldier sebastian stan going on one of his brainwash missions where we learn how hes used and see just how strong he is when he sends a car into a light pole with his bare hand fastforward to the present in lagos where the avengers are assembled scarlet witch elizabeth olsen and black widow scarlett johansson cover the ground while falcon anthony mackie takes the skies when they realize their target is headed somewhere else enter captain america chris evans who kicks butt and after a cool fight sequence crossbones frank grillo sets off a suicide bomb but scarlett witch throws him up and a building gets blown up after that shes confined to the new avengers facility and what follows is batman v superman if it had had 12 previous movies and 120 episodes of television under its belt the consequences of vigilantism and the russo brothers do an amazing job of presenting both sides of the conflict where nobody is right or wrong just bringing their viewpoints to the table vision paul bettany brings a logical view based on calculations while captain america makes it clear that their hands are still the safest to be in all this leads to the airport battle promised by the promotions then the real climax which takes a long time to get to however the plot is coherent and you know whats going on and why the effects are once again stunning especially at the airport fight but its the conflict thats at the heart of this henry jackman also does another great job with the soundtrack which captures all the appropriate emotions such as winter soldiers eerie motif which comes into play when hell be the most dangerous to anyone despite all the darkness marvel still brings some good laughs so we dont forget theyre human beings at the center of the conflict at the end of the day they also use saltier language than most of their movies but its all called for overall civil war is a reminder that actions have consequences and adds a layer of reality to this universe by having that be the case   5717  may 2 2008 iron man is born june 13 2008 the hulk comes out of the shadows to be part of the avengers may 6 2011 thor descends from another realm july 22 2011 captain america wakes up after being frozen for 70 years may 4 2012 the avengers assemble when a wormhole is opened above new york april 4 2014 hydra reveals itself within shield and try to kill anyone who might get in their way may 1 2015 the avengers reassemble and expand when ultron wipes out sokovia may 6 2016 all hell breaks loose  marvels latest in the neverending cinematic universe opens with steve rogers aka captain america chris evans and fellow avengers natasha romanoff aka black widow scarlett johansson wanda lehnsherr i mean maximoff aka scarlet witch elizabeth olsen and sam wilson aka the falcon anthony mackie track down and capture exshield agent brock rumlow aka crossbones frank grillo and his hydra remnant whatever they are theyre up to no good in lagos nigeria and after a thrilling opening we end it on a tragic note wanda sends crossbones into the sky to avoid him blowing up and killing everyone on the ground but instead everybody in an adjacent building is blown up this ignites a flame thats been heating up for four years since everything changed in earth 199999 marvels designation for that part of the multiverse the avengers are now considered to be a group that needs to be regulated according to secretary of state thaddeus ross william hurt after nearly 8 years off the marvel cinematic universe screen which tony stark robert downey jr agrees needs to happen when he learns of one of the innocents who died in sokovia captain america cant see this ending well and when the sokovia accords are to be ratified in vienna by the avengers and by king tchaka john kani of wakanda an explosion marks the beginning of a civil war among the avengers friends like wanda and vision paul bettany are made enemies when vision is put in charge of keeping her in the avengers base after her mishap in lagos hawkeye jeremy renner and black widow are pitted against each other when they disagree on the accords and captain america and iron man are made enemies when winter soldier sebastian stan is labeled the perpetrator behind the vienna explosion my only problem is that this is slower than the winter soldier the russo brothers previous captain america movie mostly because they have every avenger except for hulk and thor in it it is amazing theyre able to keep this as mostly a captain america thing because bucky is the suspected bomber which is how it works im still penalizing it though maybe my expectations were too high for a brisk pace but i should have known politics is like an iron ball chained to your leg because it slows everything down for the worst thankfully i feel both sides of the issue are observed well and given their own section 315 look it up the character cast is great and not just in the big name avengers chadwick bosemans black panther is introduced and the black panther origin story for those in the know is skimmed over which also bothers me because this is captain america not black panther i felt that was another pacing issue ross is a new man whos no longer green with envy but red with rage over captain america being a pain in his language back to the pacing issues i found tom hollands spiderman to be the best one yet tobey maguire was a crying meme andrew garfield was less mematic but poorly handled tom holland is the spiderman this audience has always wanted and the one we needed after the amazing spiderman 2 but again pacing issue because caps story was slowed down i never checked my watch though it works but now i see why these characters stood on their own in those previous standalone movies anyway the russo brothers have directed another fine picture they had to use more cgi between iron man war machine don cheadle antman paul rudd scarlet witch vision and spiderman but it was all seamless henry jackman returns to score yet another great score winter soldier theme returns and everything else is brand new despite the darker nature of civil war the usual marvel humor is found to be a bringer of civil humor mostly spiderman in the big clashofpoweredpeople as he is introduced to this larger world of heroes language is saltier than winter soldier and other previous installments but given the intensity cut them a break civil war is ultimately one of marvels best to date winter soldier is faster paced and avengers is inner 8yearoldsquealingwithdelight but is slower than its predecessor all thats left is this whos side are you on
May 30 2014,positive,it will be the best
May 24 2014,positive,while not without a bevy of incredibly wellcrafted action scenes and marvels signature style of humor captain america civil war is the franchises most mature movie to date chockfull of characters with understandable motivations and complex emotions
May 23 2014,positive,captain america civil war is not only one of the best marvel films but its also one of the best superhero films ever made period it hits all the right notes and gets everything that its supposed to correct there are so many elements to why this film is excellent that it is almost impossible to list them all marvel mostly has great cast members in their films and thats no exception for this movie everybody gives a powerhouse performance and are all given a chance to shine the direction is impeccable with the russo brothers proving once again that you can blend comic book fun with layers and depth into the same movie the action is amazing and not just the civil war scene pretty much every action sequence is jaw dropping and puts you on the edge of your seat the initial civil war action sequence is one of if not the best superhero throwdowns ever made for film its so insanely entertaining and i couldnt believe that i was actually seeing this war come to life the two sides are presented in such a way that you are constantly changing your own opinion and there is not clear wrong or right side the villain is surprisingly good and ended up being one of the better mcu villains to have graced the screen the new additions to the mcu are fantastic such as black panther and spiderman i cant wait to see more of black panther and chadwick boseman knocked it out of the park with his performance tom holland may be the best spiderman to have ever been portrayed as this finally feels like the peter parker i know and love from the comics this movie almost felt like more of an adaption of the civil war comics then a true captain america movie but thats ok since i absolutely loved that comic series i cant think of a film that feels more like a true comic book adaption then this flick marvel has completely outdone theirselves and i dont know how they can get better then this this is a 1010 superhero flick that deserves to be seen by all and not just superhero fans this is so much more then a comic book film and you should see it if you enjoy incredibly well made action thrillers and all around fantastically crafted pieces of cinema
May 18 2014,positive,it was like avengers 25 like looking into a comic book put into a movie exactly what i wanted to see awesome super heroes  great actors marvel knows how to do it
May 18 2014,positive,the best captain america by far overall in reviewsratings according to rotten tomatoes they added ant man played by paul rudd black panther chadwich boseman and teenage boy spiderman i like the ending when steve rogers shows up to rescue wanda falcon bowarrow guy out of prison  they mostly fight each other trying to convince steve and his group which includes antman which blows up to giant antman in the airport it is the last one for captain america but not for avengers movie franchise
May 6 2014,positive,does this surprise anybody though
May 6 2014,positive,captain america civil war is hilarious action packed and a emotional roller coaster
May 4 2014,positive,i went in team cap and i came out team olsen not the skinny pale on the verge of death vampires theyre passing off as the twins
May 4 2014,positive,extremely awesome and just what i wanted out of it marvel fans drama fans comedy fans watch this movie as soon as you can fun fact when trailer 2 came out i almost cried when i saw it this is my favourite movie of all time if i were to compare this avengers age of ultron  ant  man civil war would crush the other two an extreme must watch and hoping for avengers infinity war to make us absolutely forget about this mind blowing movie
May 3 2014,positive,awesome superhero movie it has taught provoking ideals one of best action scenes between heroes the best movie spiderman a great introduction to black panther and a decent villian a
May 2 2014,positive,no words this was almost lotr like my fav film from marvel
Apr 29 2014,positive,i waited over 2 years for captain america civil war so i without a doubt had high expectations and worried about overhyping the movie   when i say that this movie exceeded expectations know that it truly does there were only two or three very minor things i could classify as wrong with this movie everything else was pretty much perfect the action scenes were perfectly placed and the story never lost its way despite all the stuff that was crammed into it as the movie went on the stakes were continually being raised and the story got more and more intense all the characters had great dynamics specifically steve bucky and tony they each had terrific arcs black panther and marvels version of spiderman were given possibly the best introductions they could have been given in a movie as crowded as this   this is also a much more mature marvel film and easily the best to date for someone that loves the marvel universe civil war was a more than extraordinary feat for the general audience id say that its still pretty damn spectacular having seen the prior films definitely makes civil war a much more powerful and personal film but even as a standalone it still manages to hold its own   civil war isnt a film you want to miss i promise you that youll be more than impressed   tldr do yourself a favor and go see the movie its amazing
Apr 25 2014,positive,wow this is the avengers sequel ive been waiting for and yes i said avengers sequel because i dont care how much the studio lies and says its a captain america sequel this is straight up avengers 25 all heroes were great black panther and spiderman steal the show the story is multilayered and very personal and the action scenes were epic the airport fight scene alone was worth my money excellent excellent excellent movie
Apr 24 2014,positive,i laughed i cried i was left in awe
Apr 18 2014,positive,very very good this was everything batman v superman the dawn of justice couldve been reached all my expectations so enjoyable a must watch for all marvel fans everywhere and action movie fans to
Apr 16 2014,positive,filled with great moments but lacks the emotional punch it goes for
Apr 12 2014,positive,a solid movie but it has its flaws it felt more like a iron man movie than a cap movie it also goes bad with comedic relief sometimes there is just too much especially for the kind of movie it is the hype will be unreal with people saying its the best movie to date but its not   not as great as batman v superman but it isnt behind by much at all still liked it a lot issues i has with bvs were one thing and here its another as well the movie had a major issue when it came to the overall tone and it felt like two different movies
Apr 11 2014,positive,awesome movie can not wait for the black panther movie from marvel
Apr 7 2014,positive,awesome black panther its the best
Apr 6 2014,positive,there arent enough words in the english language to describe how incredibly great this movie is guess ill just have to watch it again and again
Apr 5 2014,positive,team spiderman nuff said
Apr 5 2014,positive,excellent movie  spidey was awesome
Apr 5 2014,positive,even better than i thought it would be
Apr 5 2014,positive,the best captain america film so far
Apr 5 2014,positive,best action pack movie period
Apr 5 2014,positive,as heroes fighting each other goes this works quite well its the overall story that glues the film together and instead of the forced humour that struggled in age of ultron it feels very genuine this is very much an avengers film say what you will about it being caps adventure the film isnt really all about him antman really found its energy and that carried into this film im a huge dc fan but dip into marvel with its brilliant shared universe batman v superman mainly struggled because the vengence in batman wasnt deepened enough here tony stark has every reason for fighting the film is full of characters but doesnt feel forced its just a long journey with a compelling argument spiderman is awesome and will hopefully this over to the next film he is definitely the best peter parker  spiderman out of the whole 3 actors this is the film we deserved instead of age of ultron it just works so well my main issue was performances and the initial setup for the film there were some clunks but after that the story just kept twisting until the epic confrontation the loss from the comics was skipped which i felt defeated the purpose of the storyline there wasnt that death scene to shock the audience or to teach the avengers about loss worthy additional to the canon and places characters in interesting spots for the rest of the series seen this opening night     i have just revisited this film and dropped my rating to a 4 like most marvel films you watch them at the cinema and love them but revisit them a year later and discovery it is an empty shell the stakes arent as full proof as youd hoped silly story and not a great film by any means 29042017
Apr 4 2014,positive,it was epic i loved it very much
Apr 4 2014,positive,omg that was amazing if you didnt plan to see it go anyway you wont regret it if you planned to youll love it and just a heads up their are 2 bonus sceens 
Apr 3 2014,positive,what a way to start the summer you gotta hand it to the guys at marvel seriously they knock it out of the ball park with this one the narrative the emotional impactful story line the action the pace the amazing spider man holy cow hes great in the film best super hero movie ever
Apr 1 2014,positive,though the beginning was a little slow it was all worth it to see the outcome of our favorite heroes fight this is the best superhero movie of all time
Mar 31 2014,positive,captain america civil war is fucking spectacular best marvel movie ever the action was fucking amazing black panther was awesome spiderman was fucking amazing best spiderman ever he for me steals the entire movie and also this captain america movie is the best of the trilogy
Mar 30 2014,positive,absolutely incredible best marvel film yet
Mar 30 2014,positive,words cannot explain how amazing this movie was to me
Mar 29 2014,positive,amazing they managed to balance more cast than batman vs superman bring tears suspense legitimate concern and comedy under one roof expertly marvel is  dc
Mar 26 2014,positive,plot and characters both were handled with care the division amongst our heroes left you justifying the reasoning of both sides however it still felt like something was missing when the screen went black and this stems from the fact that for such an intense movie the climax was lacking spolers follow plain and simple to be such an intense movie why didnt a hero die plenty of other deaths but nothing of meaning felt like they were on the right path here but failed to follow through for whatever reason
Mar 25 2014,positive,there are different views on a film thats in one hand considered a treat to the converted target audience and on the other hand as just another movie to enjoy casually broader audience in general the opinions of the converted goes in two ways the films safe in one way if the converted like anything from the particular franchise but only if it maintains the major quality and met the expectations otherwise itd faltered itself below this can be seen in the comparison in the marvel cinematic universe benchmark franchise between the avengers and the reassembled mission in age of ultron and thor the dark world standing next to the rest different creativity of each films would reach at the franchises enjoyment level that they would probably meet at the exact or exceed it while some raised it adding into the complex narrative puzzle    now a convert would enjoy the franchise genre conventions particularly the superhero genre towards the action characterization and other fun stuff that were written for the story the films running on watching those films through the lens of a regular moviegoer is on how the film functions for the broader audience than just being a treat for the converts whose excitement would determine the rating to be just perfect the latest mcu addition that starts the next slate of films captain america civil war continues the wellmaintained yet typical 5star run since its solocentric predecessor the winter soldier it may be an example like the avengers being valued in excitement whilst at the same level of hardtopick on which one is best till putting the other hand together with that hand shows that it values in the art of the cinema fashioned under the superhero genre  marvel to be exact    one year after the avengers thwarted ultrons attempted reign of terror under world correction captain america leads the newly formed avengers as they continue their efforts of protecting lives but until their latest mission resulted in another collateral damage the international politics could no longer tolerate their actions going freely so they issued the sokovia accords aka the superhero registration act a system of accountability that would oversee and direct the heroes actions the heroes are divided into opposing sides  one led by stillguiltridden tony stark and the other by steve rogers the attention shifted to the international manhunt for bucky barnes the winter soldier who got framed for a terrorist attack on the united nation with the ongoing intersected events the manhunt and the civil war a new foe is pulling the strings    the returning directors from the winter soldier anthony and joe russo directed the third and final captain americacentric cinematic storyline setting another game changer as an emotional culmination of the previous films that led to the registration act thus dividing available filmic heroes on earth  minus the hulk and thor the russo brothers directed the first avengers transition into the modern time with subtexts that are the remains of his time and political themes that hed face during a crisis as a core that hell only agrees whats right for freedom while the directing duo were at that to his character as a storys core they would turn his solo ride with some avenging assistance that shares his views set as a 5 installment between the avengers teamup films as their experiences apparently grown through the complexity on the assortment and handling the balancing scale of the whole civil war is said to be a taste of their direction for the infinity war films that are a culmination of the three phases and their directorial skills    now speaking of which the russo brothers directorial skills are fully acknowledged in civil war by how theyd handled the balancing scale on such storyline with available characterization given individual arcs being equally wellnarrated through the contexts in the writing of the action and the direction of the cinematography as those are the important elements that were assembled and carried throughout those were the qualities that ive considered to be the art of the cinema fashioned under the genre it goes from the masterful direction to bring out the elemental intensity into the performances of the cast with assistance from the defining score that also expresses the power the best element from their direction is the aforementioned balanced handling in the writing to the narration that explored individual arcs with cinematographic depth to simplify this praiseful compliment of their directorial skills the russo brothers would be interesting contenders for best director    as briefly discussing the direction represents the latter other hand on a nonconverted function of cinema art in the superhero genre the former hand of the converted rested on how one would watch this film based on my view as a convert myself civil war is more into being thrillingly powerful that values the art of the cinema in comparison to the excitement felt in the avengers and fun in couple others even though the humor element got reused to lighten some space up this is actually a more serious installment that focuses on the consequences of the avengers actions while inadvertently bringing in casualties and financial crises then the realization through the accords divided all the heroes to the point they started fighting against each other with a negative aura this culmination shattered the heroic relationship that grew in the films but left with possible healing patches while some are still with each other with unchanged belief for what they stand for in response to the accords the dynamic separated from the division and culminating inclusion ie antman are still the sources of the excitement within the characterization next to the exquisitelychoreographed stillstylishly sharp action and the accompanied visual effects    the best aspect of the excitement from the film for the converted is the intros of two wellknown marvel characters black panther and spiderman chadwick boseman 42 and get on up as black panther and tom holland the impossible as spiderman both did great on portraying their respective characters that fitted well into the film without needing a solo intro film before their actual solo outing their character arcs were both really well told sporadically throughout the plot particularly how energetically the webcrawler returned to marvels grasp and got the chance to stand sidebyside with the avengers the latters origin story was instead got demoted as background info under familiarity through watching the previous cinematic iterations their wellwritten and wellportrayed introductions gives us a sense of who they are and a hint of their origins while concentrating on the present situation and what world theyre now involved in    there are a few parallel similarities when attempting to compare this film to batman v superman dawn of justice under the superhero vs superhero drama at different notions and motives on each side with a foe pulling the strings mostly its the parallel method of the two heroes arcs and what motivates them but its somehow different in each films batman v superman has the parallelness of compromising between the two heroes and making unpredictable outcomes when adapting one of their most wellknown comic storylines each in a perfectly fresh fashion while the parallelness in civil war is at a supposed equal amount behind the two heroes motivations however the writing in civil war shows more depth and intellect with clarity while the other film although exquisite missed points to the logics when focusing on reaching the potential and laying the groundwork its clear on whos the winner between the two    captain america civil war improves upon age of ultron while furthers the style in its solo predecessor the winter soldier with depth in the coherent writing and cinematography as well showcases the russo brothers directorial skills on handling such scale in preparation for the bigger event its turned out to be more thrilling and sometimes gripping than being much exciting like its leapfrog partner the avengers while at the same level with a pretty fresh balance between superhero conventions and cinema art that the film values seems similar to the dark knight in some way based on how much gamechanging civil war brought in to the mcu and being deemed as the taste of the trilogic phases main climax it seems infinity war is going to be pretty interesting than whats already being though about a    teamcap
Mar 23 2014,positive,greatest superhero movie to date unlike and action scenes you have seen before and spiderman kicks ass in this movie
