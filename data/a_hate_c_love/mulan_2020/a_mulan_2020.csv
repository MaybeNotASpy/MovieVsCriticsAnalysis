Apr 13 2024,negative,i hate mulan 2020 according to the video the video said that there is a chinese police and its very unacceptable and its bad and they removed mushu
Mar 22 2024,neutral,disneys liveaction reboot serves as decent entertainment on its own but falls short in terms of charisma and fun  compared to the 1998 animated tale  but also as an action flick its a long distance behind the best in its genre
Feb 21 2024,negative,decent live action though not so faithful to its orig source
Feb 11 2024,negative,if i could give less i would i would be ashamed to have my name associated with this the girl did fine but they completely took out some characters and opted out of the songs im sure they did it all in the name of  creativity how can you have mulan with our mushu but nooooo lets have a phoenix you can be creative with the back ground and outfits dont try mess with something good you only make it worse none of the original humor lifeless dull if anything this is geared to the brainless and the left have fun with your brainwashing cinema
Feb 4 2024,positive,a very visually stunning movie liu yifei is a beauty and a sight to behold i loved the costumes dont listen to the shallow people who say its bad because of no songs or mushu it is better than the animated
Jan 13 2024,negative,i really hate this why did they made an liveaction to the original one
Jan 13 2024,negative,the worst disney movie ever
Jan 11 2024,negative,so much of the original is missing not only the humor but also any character development has fallen by the wayside in the production overall the movie is boring and gives the impression that it was only produced to cash in on nostalgia a complete disappointment better watch the original movie
Dec 11 2023,negative,ive tried to like this movie but it completely lacks any of the charm that made the animated feature stand the test of time
Nov 28 2023,negative,someone should tell disney that mulan is not a superhero
Nov 28 2023,positive,its wonderful so impressive
Nov 24 2023,positive,first of all i found this movie visually stunning and it stayed true to the original chinese fable and the soundtrack hits the hardest 
Nov 21 2023,negative,started regretting watching it the moment my nephew put it on  doesnt feel like a live adaption of the original at all
Nov 21 2023,negative,mindnumbing cash grab save your timethis is several hours of your life you will never get back
Nov 15 2023,negative,this is a lifeless subpar action adventure on its own but a terrible remake overall the acting isnt good the biggest problem is mulan herself is so boring emotionless invincible and so uninteresting as a character everyone else is just ok and suffers the same issues for the most part save for some scenes of the squad she trains with who show emotion every now and than literally 98 of scenes that the camera is on mulan she just has a dead face emotionless blank stare the entire time when shes fighting also she has that same expression and its so boring this leads into a big reason why the cinematography isnt good either despite a lot of great production value set design colorful costumes and great practical effects and digital its because its always focused on boring characters especially mulan who is so lifeless on top of that half the time the camera never takes full advantage of the massive scale and scope of fights or sets and only shows nice establishing shots for a second before cutting back to blurred out background shots with dim lighting nothing in this pops longer than a second the music is just ok and boring generic and forgettable which is a big sin considering the animated one wa a musical which had great lively numbers the editing isnt bad though and even with the extra added scenes it never really feels bloated or unfocused and actually does a half decent job weaving the tale of war and mulans personal journey together which is bizarre because this isnt a well paced film because the one thing lacking is there is no personal character growth imagine star wars 1977 with the same plot points just without any of the down time scenes of character devlopment which is missing as well as anything resembling emotion this is because she starts out as a super warrior right from the start and we never see her really grow she becomes a hero granted but its a hero we dont care about and really its just a title because she is still the same person there is hardly any humor in this also and the phoenix that replaces the dragon sidekick does almost nothing in this i dont understand why this was made it adds nothing at all besides making it in live action skip this at all costs and watch the 1998 animated classic
Nov 9 2023,negative,it is the worst version of mulan i have seen so far  costumes and make up are terrible
Nov 4 2023,positive,although it has many different with chinese culture but still can feel the sincerity from the creative team just focus the film itself its a good commercial film
Oct 30 2023,negative,my girlfriend is mad because mulan did not sing reflections from the original movie
Oct 27 2023,negative,dishonor dishonor on you dishonor on your family dishonor on your cash cow by the way you are better with the original animated movie trust me on this one
Oct 26 2023,negative,boring and story is bad
Oct 22 2023,negative,the only reason i gave it one star was because mushu was missing
Oct 18 2023,negative,should fire the screenwriters only conchita was missing flat terrible acting dissapointing and completely unrealistic fighting scenes lack of comic relief non sense additionscould go on even if we forget the animation which is a gem this movie is terrible from start to finish no emotion whatsoever just lazy
Oct 18 2023,positive,i watched the disney animated mulan today and the live action     frankly if you were making a film to insult people the animated version was just that what few parts that were good were completely wrecked by racist and sexist elements the animated version was no better than song of the south while the animation was superb that writing was sloppy and half baked     the live action version of mulan fixes a lot of the problems gone are the talking dragon and the useless lucky cricket the love interest is quick and not overly dramatized like the animated version and she bested him in a fight good it was awesome     the director of photography had his pick of beautiful scenes each lovingly crafted the costumes were well done everyone was on their aaa game for this movie     look i know some of yall like eddie murphy in everything but the truth is adding his character to the story felt like someone at disney didnt think a story about a strong young woman would be good enough disney fortunately fixed this     mulan the live action film felt like a chinese film with excellent wire work outstanding action sequences and showing that sometimes the bad guy ends up grasping empty air     she is truly heroic
Sep 29 2023,negative,save your sanity troll 2 was a significantly better movie which is impressive considering that troll 2 is an antivegetarian propaganda film and the directors son later went on to make a documentary about it called the best worst movie
Sep 18 2023,neutral,good movie  but not the disney mulan experience you lost me at no mushu  no mushu no thanks nostalgia glass wasnt just half empty it was completely empty  it might as well not have been mulan  why does disney continue to dangle the nostalgia carrot and then not deliver with these live movies  changing key characters or leaving them out completely  i want to know what the process is to green light these live action let downs
Sep 10 2023,negative,this is how you ruin a classic animated movie known across the world changing the story suddenly adding a witch and removing characters relevant to the story this isnt the true mulan
Sep 4 2023,positive,loved it lots of action gently done with an emphasis on virtue and being true   and great costumes and settings   liu yifei and going li are great and  donnie yen and jet li who i struggled to recognise do what they need to in order for the two women to shine
Aug 29 2023,positive,it was quite good but it was a bit sad not having lishang and mushu
Aug 28 2023,neutral,the story is just as strong and the more serious tone could have worked but it lacks the disney magic of the original  its visually stunning with big production values plenty of vibrant colours and oriental style but overall its lacking in heart and soul  the attempts at humour fall flat the acting isnt particularly great the side characters are less distinctive and the subdued soundtrack and slow pacing makes it dull at times  the fast and acrobatic fight scenes are great and entertaining but the snappy editing makes them feel rushed and whilst the villain was good it lacked true menace due to the age rating
Aug 27 2023,negative,there isnt much to be said about how abysmal this film is that hasnt already been said in previous comments what i must add is just how insulting it is to the essence of the story of the original mulan that they cut the epic scene of mulan slicing off her hair with her fathers sword so that later in the film she could emerge as a woman in the middle of a battle scene with her artificially curled hair supposedly having been concealed for weeks on end under a helmet with scant washing swooshing around as she rides a horse and uses magic to throw spears at the enemy     this film brings nothing to the world and its just sad that there will never be a good life action remake of mulan because we tried one and it fucking sucked
Aug 23 2023,positive,this is much better than the animated version for starters this protagonist is actually a brave warrior unlike the cartoon version the conclusion is also much better because it does not follow the typical disney formula where the only happy ending  accomplishment fit for a disney heroine is getting her man
Aug 10 2023,negative,burdened by lack of depth and uninteresting plot the mulan remake is dull boring and an embarrassment to the original
Aug 8 2023,negative,one of the worst movies i have ever seen they ruined one of the best stories ever told
Jul 25 2023,negative,the animated was excellent should have left it at that banked the money and moved on but no    had to do a live action version this movie in spite of its cast was a complete fubar i cant think of anything that was done well  other than the casting if i were a cast member id want my name pulled from the credits and replaced with alan smithee way to go disney just destroyed another potential franchise the company is in a selfinflicted death spiral
Jul 17 2023,negative,i respect how it wasnt exactly the same as the original and it was certainly bold of disney to separate itself so far from the animated version i just cant see why its missing so many important parts of the original movie for example the grandma in the original was such an iconic part of the story and to replace her with a sister who has barely any significance given that she hardly ever talks is so annoying also where is mushu being such an iconic part and being a main character youd think theyd add something more then a bird who just kinda flys around to remind mulan that shes there is certainly an interesting move along with that it was just so uninteresting to watch i got bored and mainly annoyed so many times although i said i respected that it strayed away from the original i just kinda wished it kept some things similar specifically the characters
Jul 13 2023,negative,while i can respect it for at least differing from the original which ranked it higher in my mind compared to most remakes but overall the additions were worse than what they took from the original
Jul 10 2023,negative,a movie adaptation thats not just unfaithful to its original it also supports the genocide in xinjiang great work disney
Jul 8 2023,neutral,okay  its okay but  where is mushu
Jul 7 2023,negative,tried to watch this five times fell asleep within the first four and the first time being only ten minutes in
Jul 2 2023,negative,thats not mulan thats it
Jun 26 2023,positive,compared to disneys other liveaction remakes mulan deviates the most from its source material and if we could forgive it for being the movie it could have been does feature some great costumes environments and cinematography
Jun 26 2023,negative,pretty to look at but this remake feels severely phony with its fake girl power messages
Jun 19 2023,positive,i enjoyed the movie of course its not historically accurate but if you want historical accuracy then mulan cannot be han chinese the mulan story is from the northern wei dynasty which was not a han chinese dynasty at that time what is now northern china was a xianbei kingdom from normadic mongolrelated people who became settled the ballad of mulan itself refered to the emperor as khan  a giveaway clue that her country was not han chinese but rather more related to the mongolians    the rourans were another mongolian tribe that ruled the area approximately of modern mongolia and they did war with the northern wei    so all those han chinese complaining about historical accuracy you cant even claim mulan as one of us yes im han chinese myself so just give it up and enjoy the movie
Jun 8 2023,positive,melhor live action da disney 
Jun 7 2023,positive,acting was first rate
Jun 5 2023,negative,it did nothing to improve upon the animated film taking out everything good about it the most successful disney films are its musicals and to unmusicalize something seems like a social crime it abuses chinese traditional concepts like qi and social honor by mixing them with western sensibilities that dont work and cheapen the relationship between the film and chinese heritage
Jun 3 2023,positive,mulan is a misunderstood remake of its classic predecessor mulan 2020 steers more in the historical direction rather than recreating the 1998 animated classic mulan
Jun 2 2023,negative,the movie is so terrible that i couldnt get myself to finish it nothing what made the animated one so beautiful is used the fx look terrible and the setting is horrible lack of acting miscasting why was this even made how do so many people who can act cant get a role and then people like this get disney movieswthll
Jun 2 2023,positive,it was a great movie and i loved the acting all the actors where perfect for the roles one thing is though is that the storyline changed at the end a bit but overall still an amazing movie
Jun 1 2023,negative,terrible movie contrived bad acting american accents in emperial china
May 30 2023,positive,no music which was a bit sad and at first took a bit of the enjoyment away however after trying to look at it through the eyes of a disney remake i was able to see it as its own movie after that everything fell into place and i really started to enjoy this family drama with some great action scenes it really is a beautiful and engrossing movie with great acting and directing
May 29 2023,negative,just an absolute bomb compared to the original  mulan is supposed to have a story arc of struggle and overcoming  not this modern just believe in yourself nonsense
May 29 2023,negative,horrible adaptation tried too many things at once and removed all the heart from the real story realistic doesnt always mean better
May 28 2023,negative,disney does it again ruin a classic i dont understand why they didnt make it a musical like the original animated movie the weird birdwitch thing was so unnecessary and strange at best not a good movie
May 28 2023,positive,one of the best live action remakes for disney in my opinion very unfortunate covid prevented many from seeing it in theaters
May 27 2023,positive,the movie is great but i wouldnt say is for children because the colors arent so bright as expected for a child movie tho is very nice to watch
May 27 2023,negative,disney thanks a concentration camp for letting them film in china
May 26 2023,negative,i was so excited for this movie but it really fell short i feel like the message that i got from the origional was totally lost it wasnt about mulan using her smarts to overcome adversity and defeat the bad guy its now just magical attributes magic went from being a supporting character to the catalyst for everything not fun
May 26 2023,neutral,honestly who wrote the story lmao
May 23 2023,negative,where is the music disney cant compete with chinese movies
May 22 2023,negative,very disappointing lacks any charm or magic
May 22 2023,negative,made an account just to warn people not to watch
May 19 2023,negative,this movie was horribly written all the charm from the 1998 film wasnt there and the movie was so boring i turned it off after just 20 minutes please for the love of god do not watch this movie
May 14 2023,negative,wtf am i watching theres no humor no respect to the original animation no other characters from the original in the live action and how embarrassing either the director or the crew to not have japanese language thats very respectful
May 12 2023,negative,horrible just horrible but the worst is that they can add a witch with magic that transforms and they can cut mushu like wtf
May 10 2023,positive,mulan is my favorite disney cartoon but i didnt really like the movie i think that there are extra characters for example the witch and mulans sister na  in my opinion it was better if  instead of sister was replaced by  grandmother mulan as in  cartoons the film also looks a little empty lacking an emotional connection with the characters but the actors played beautifully wonderfully unbelievably
May 10 2023,negative,boring didnt honor the original total disappointment
May 2 2023,negative,just terrible watch the original instead so much better like night and day
May 1 2023,negative,easily the work live action remake on earth
Apr 25 2023,negative,i dont know what to write here it has none of the spark of the original all of the good characters and comic relief is gone the new actress who plays mulan is very bland and mulan doesnt learn and train how to be a soldier she is just born special which makes her cocky throughout the movie just watch he original it has better action characters and story while im writing this i really think its one of the most worthless pieces of content out there
Apr 25 2023,negative,a soulless mess that teaches no lesson whatsoever
Apr 24 2023,positive,i like oreas they taste like chocolate but mulan kissed
Apr 15 2023,negative,a movie that does everything wrong  boring to death culturally offensive inside and outside the film and messy as heck  yet professional critics loved it  yes
Apr 6 2023,negative,abysmal remake if you take all the good stuff from the original you get this mess of a movie most of the cast missing no songs and terrible choppy editing which felt like it should come with a seizure warning the plot twist with one of the villains was so poorly written and mulan doesnt learn how to be a good warrior throughout the movie anymore she just naturally is one this makes her a much less compelling character overall i dont know how anyone can enjoy this without nostalgia goggles
Mar 23 2023,positive,nikki caro breathes unimaginable life into the folktale of the ballad of mulan with new meaning to the story its loyal brave and true to its very core with outstanding performances by liu yen and the entire army of friends the best still goes undoubtedly to tzi ma this version brings honor to them all
Mar 22 2023,negative,this movie was not all bad i liked some of the cinematography and how things were made original with the swords that mulan lost and then gained in the end with the inscriptions on them but that was about it jet li acted very awkwardly with his lines there were no songs which made the original fantastic there was no mushu there were awkward moments with awkward characters that shouldnt have been added to the story like the bird lady and many scenes were forgettable by the end of the film this is one of the worst production decisions that disney has made and the best disney movie imo did not have to be remade like this dont touch the classics that we all love and adore
Mar 15 2023,negative,badly writen movie no hero arc
Mar 14 2023,negative,this is not mulan storyline more like turning mulan into xmen franchise the first chinese xmen
Mar 13 2023,positive,i get it why people are missing mushu but how can a real life action movie incorporate an cartoon figure the action stunts is wonderful i love it
Mar 11 2023,negative,this movie just sucks why did they make the huns walk on walls what that is just ridiculous they look so dumb why are super powers in this movie like what mulan is a good warrior not because shes stronger its because shes smarter that was really dumb and this is supposed to be her origin why did you add chi also this movie is really controversial because of the xinjiang problem one because the lead actor said i support the hong kong police and disney even thanked a concentration camp and filmed in xinjiang which is horrible this movie should be boycotted alright thats all if i said something wrong notify me please
Mar 10 2023,positive,whilst the live action take of mulan is a decent and interesting take but does not quite capture the same charm as its animated counterpart
Mar 8 2023,negative,if you enjoyed the original 1998 mulan forget watching this if you loved mushu and singalong forget watching this none of the original was used no shang no trio no cricket nothing i was so excited but then so disappointed
Mar 6 2023,positive, the movie gets it share of hate but i feel like it was one of the best live action movie adaptation it loses points for acting like it is based on a true story while having a woman villain who can shape shift
Feb 28 2023,negative,its hard to get worse than this remake  it makes me wish disney had left well enough alone  like star wars before it this new character is a mary sue which can really do no wrong and is powerful just because doesnt hold a candle to the original cartoon
Feb 15 2023,negative,breathtaking set and costume design do not a great film make a combination of too serious and too campy this mulan lacks the sense of adventure that was captured the first time around
Feb 9 2023,negative,in my opinion this film was a disappointment not saying that its a horrible film its definitely worth giving a chance and watching ones but the fact that mushu was removed from the film to give it a more realistic adaptation was ridiculous the point of disney and the point of making these films in the live action is to give us exactly what we want and thats a recreation of the cartoon with a little bit of a twist to give a difference so it doesnt look and act exactly the same but they went way too far and they even turned shayne into a sissy and yes the character was attractive enough to play the role but they did not utilize him the way he should have and then the biggest downfall of all they remove the music i was done after that
Feb 8 2023,positive,this movie is great for girls who are coming of age for them to see they do not need to hide their strength and wit
Jan 31 2023,negative,there is just so much wrong about this movie but in short it laks a soul and is an insult to the original
Jan 23 2023,negative,so bad it got a lower rating than a seagal straight to video an absolute mess no character arc mary sue again just leave animated stuff alone those are classics
Jan 19 2023,positive,i watched this on disney recently had a little negative anticipation at the beginning and at the end i would like to see mulan 2 dont judge to fast the movie takes his time
Jan 19 2023,positive,disney and director nikki caro brings to live action another one of their animated hits from the second renaissance it had dazzling animation memorable songs and some good laughs its also one of the few films to have a disney princess wield a sword showing her capability to fend for herself based on a historic legend here many things are changed from the 1998 film such as her father having two daughters mushu is completely taken out of the picture as is crickee theres no wise grandmother ling yao and po are absent and the villain this time is aided by a female sorceress that can shapeshift into a hawk another person or anything else using the power of chi which has been banned and vilified mulan as a child has always been fascinated by the art of combat yet her village looks down upon it they see her as too much of a wild card years later as a young woman played by newcomer liu yifei her mother wishes for her to find a suitable husband to bring honor to them all according to the gender roles assigned during the 15th century just then china is being invaded by people from the north called rorans led by bori khan so the emperor has called for every able bodied man to stand and fight the enemy if bori khan and the sorceress succeed china will fall mulans father is the only male capable of going into battle but given a major injury he suffered years back he may not be able to return just like the original mulan sees that the only way to save him her mother and her sister is to take his place her father prays to the ancestors to watch over her and the spirit of the phoenix arises to guide her this liveaction retelling really embraces the chinese culture from the costumes to the fighting styles to the traditional customs to the set designs liu yifei shines as mulan with her solemn expressions playing a woman pretending to be a man not giving herself away she has a duty to uphold but doesnt forget what shes fighting for 3 virtues exist for a warrior loyalty bravery and truth but can she actually uphold all of them without compromising her honor the sorceress actually has a lot of backstory too living in exile with no place to call home because of her gift like mulan she wants to belong somewhere i admire how fast this movie goes for 2 hours the fight choreography is impressive its visually pleasing with vibrant colors and there isnt too much jokey comedy to make the viewer not appreciate the dignified gracefulness of this womans story so it can be taken seriously ok so its not historically accurate and there couldve been greater depth to it but it still works in so many ways family honor honesty love and protecting one another are many big themes in this liveaction remake i must say i wasnt disappointed with this one its just as good as the original if not better with a brilliant female lead and much appreciated commentary on women being in power that does make most men afraid but doesnt act as threatening and for fans theres a cool quick cameo at the endblink and youll miss it disney succeeds again with another updated retelling of an animated hit
Jan 13 2023,negative,what the hell is this a stripped down version of the mulan film that loses all the charm and humor the original animated films had important characters are completely removed or replaced from this film for little to no reason where tf is mushu the entire plot is changed to appease to the younger demographic mulan doesnt even feel like mulan just a random ass asian girl dealing with sexism and discovering super powers    moral of the story dont remake animated films ever again the animation is a part of the charm that makes these films as beloved they are
Jan 2 2023,negative,i am a huge fan of the animated mulan the live action mulan is very bad why would they make a kid cartoon movie into a violent movie its frigging pg13 why not pg the cast is okay the action was pretty good but not perfect the acting was only alright the witch and the villain was really good but the rest were ok overall 310
Jan 2 2023,positive,it feels like a kungfu epic not a disney movie some positives mulan and dad bonding the female villains acting interaction between mulan and love interest negatives weak acting by mulan choppy dialogue and script and bizarre explanation of life force especially for a movie trying to be historically accurate and culturally sensitive
Dec 30 2022,negative,i really do love and huge fan of original animated mulan you have no idea how many times i watched   but this liveaction mulan movie   ughit was just sad disappointing and boring no humour scene at all not even single one   disney ruined my childhood again  disney should ask theirs money back who wrote and film it  i was like where is the god damn basic mulan story and all the characters like mushu cricket ancestors ghost  even no singing  to be honest it was just a chinese action movie with a mulan title def not a mulan at all   now im afraid of watching any disneys remake movie from original animated of course including the little mermaid  why cant you just keep the original character and basic story  stop ruining my childhood disney cartoon version please
Dec 24 2022,positive,i know most people dont like this because it is closer to the story of mulan and not as close to the animation mulan the artistry in this movie was great and it told the story in a more straightforward way
Dec 23 2022,negative,it is not charming mainly because it is pg13 the characters are ultimately either unmemorable or unlikable and it also has no mushu some might say it is because it is faithful to the original poem but no i have read the poem before so if disney wants us to believe the movie was faithful to the original poem id say it is more faithful to 1998 mulan and is therefore 99 bull
Dec 23 2022,negative,if you are comparing it to the original you are going to be completely upset they took out all the good funny and joy from the movie as a movie itself it was ok mulan is a superhuman you arent emotionally involved the story was out of place the witch was completely pointless in the movie is mulans father had gone to war he would of been sent home because the chief sends home anyone to doesnt live up to his expectations the villain wasnt scary or intimidating he had a few pointless scenes as well there was probably like one short action scene that was cool
Dec 22 2022,positive,i really liked this movie and have watched it a few times i totally understand why changes were made from the original and the direction they were going in they wanted to focus on different morals i would say the only thing lacking was time if they had more time they could have built more connection with the other soldiers which would have been amazing im sad that it was received badly i think the director did an amazing job
Dec 19 2022,negative,this just isnt worth the watch id recommend going back to watching the original mulan movie even the mediocre mulan ii at least keeps the charming animation making it far better than this awful remake
Dec 19 2022,negative,the fact disney even thought this was passable is an insult to every single fan of the original and the fact they wanted 30 from people on release is a crime against humanity this is an embarrassment of cinema
Dec 9 2022,negative,acting was good and thats about it the story was too far fetched from original and no mushu tough loss for disney
Dec 5 2022,positive,competent but too much has been changed to the source material to please a lot of fans
Dec 2 2022,negative,definition of a failed tone promise and mulan becomes a magical mary sue     poor conceptualization
Nov 28 2022,negative,some nice visuals of landscapes otherwise sucked awkward script twitchy acting cringey morals snail pacing plot dumbed down from the original
Nov 27 2022,negative,somehow the live action show with real people is less believable than the animated show
Nov 21 2022,negative,it has a few good qualities but its overall another shameless remake of an already great movie and once again strips away all the things that made the original so good
Nov 18 2022,negative,another worthless mary sue
Nov 11 2022,negative,yawn the remake of mulan was boring and contrived the magic of the 1998 classic was missing not just because mushu and the music were absent but because the plot itself was completely misconstrued the qi power that mulan possesses makes the whole purpose of her journey fall flat after finishing the movie i just wanted to go back and enjoy the original
Nov 7 2022,negative,followed the general story of the original with some terrible twists a witch felt like a 70s kung fu movie with fake moves and faker voice overs plus no songs or funcomedy never again
Nov 5 2022,positive,the storyline itself is not the same thing that happen from the original and the film is very different they should have make it more better but even with that is just good sometimes 6910
Oct 23 2022,negative,girl power bs  boring  letdown  terrible movie
Oct 19 2022,positive,great special effects costumes and music
Oct 19 2022,negative,movie was hollow and sad
Oct 8 2022,negative,this film had nothing unsafe about it it has some cultural statusbut it got ride of mushu and the comedy that was what made the original special so thats why this movie is the worst disney remake of all time
Oct 1 2022,negative,i think it ruins the original movie it completely different and it doesnt capture eyes like the original its boring and so is the main fight scene the villains is bad the characters are bad no songs like why is it even a disney movie it should be bormulan
Oct 1 2022,negative,this movie was a major disappointment it was too much of a cash grab
Sep 28 2022,negative,a poor remake that does not excite and makes you question the time line of the film
Sep 18 2022,negative,substituted brave girl who overcame her fears and physical limitations against bigger men through hard work with magical aryarey and its lame
Sep 17 2022,negative,all that was a good lesson in the original animated cartoon was removed form this version mulan is no longer smart and super determined to overcome her limits nope now she was born superhuman entitled and completely unrelatable i will show the original cartoon to my daughter to show her that the only limit to her success is lack of determination not society
Sep 16 2022,negative,it was like watching paint dry
Sep 13 2022,positive,the movie was amazing  absolutely loved it and i would definitely watch it again
Sep 13 2022,negative,the most pointless film to ever exist
Sep 12 2022,negative,i feel like they tried too hard on this film i also believe way too much in this movie was changed some said that tying dragons to the asian culture is racist but i had no problem in the animated movie with the little dragon being there i miss the humor in the first movie and this one lacks humor and tries to make itself a superhero like movie thats just me though
Sep 9 2022,negative,i dont know why my previous review was removed anyway i grew up learning about mulan story at confucius chinese elementary school 孔子学院 mulan original story teaches us about hard work discipline and respect to the elderly not about talent at birth super girl power or magic which this movie focus on
Sep 4 2022,negative,a live action film that is just another way for disney to make a quick buck instead of putting time and effort into a original story
Sep 4 2022,negative,absolute garbage an insult to the original and the animated mulan film
Aug 29 2022,negative,i can honestly rant about this all day i dont know who in their right mind would want to turn disneys mulan into a dramatic war movie first of all thats been done and can be done again without the disney license all niki caro has achieved here is making sure we never see a proper live action remake of the disney mulan no mushu no funny grandma none of the music none of the fun not to mention it fails at being a dramatic war movie because it had bad guys running up walls i have so much more to complain about when it comes to this movie but i dont actually think anybodys going to read this
Aug 29 2022,positive,really good performance for yifei and all the actors surprised to see donnie yen and jet li in it
Aug 28 2022,positive,stunning cinematography and very inspiring story line beautiful life lesson in confronting and overcoming your inner struggles after watching it three times i am struck again by the solid thread of doing what is right loyal brave and true family is also a central theme reunion and forgiveness accepting who your loved ones are in themselves just awesome
Aug 25 2022,negative,kowtow to ccp then you have this kind of movie
Aug 24 2022,negative,by far the worst disney film of their animated classics
Aug 24 2022,negative,worst disney movie since cars 3 the actress does not give a flat performance her performance is factually concave plot wise   is mulan supposed to be a terminator is
Aug 23 2022,negative,i really was excited for this but it makes no sense why you had to give her ing powers the cartoon disney story was great but whoever wrote this ruined a great character this couldve been one of their best live action remakes but its definitely the worst to date
Jul 27 2022,positive,the greatest 01 hour and 56 minutes of humor kung fu action violence and   skinnydipping
Jul 8 2022,negative,its really a disaster ive never ever seen a terrible film like it the main actress is terrible too she is not worthy to the actress appellation finally if it has no star choice i would give it to her because shes worthy
Jun 23 2022,negative,worst disney live action movie ever
Jun 8 2022,positive,overall a pretty good adaptation of a well known story if you go in with the expectation that it is going to follow the animated story you will be disappointed this version focuses more on chinese culture and tradition it is devoid of the iconic humor and music as well as the love story it does not have a strong emotional appeal it has a rather serious tone and the cinematography is quite good the cameo of mingna wen the original mulan was a bonus for me
May 28 2022,negative,again a modern female hero with no flaws or weaknesses the original mulan wasnt born the most talented warrior in china she clawed her way through even though she lacked in size and strength and found a way to be help protect her country thats what made he likable relatable and heroic modern writers once again fail to understand this
May 25 2022,negative,the only reason this movie got any love is probably because disney higher ups wouldve ruined the careers of the critics who complained or simply bribed them
May 22 2022,negative,very bad in both narration and acting
May 15 2022,negative,the movie was aight but they took at the special moments like the love between mulan and the general and the magic and funny moments and important characters like mushu and the cricket without them the movie wasnt as exiting
May 3 2022,negative,worst disney live action adaptation stripped all things that were good in the animation and added unnecessary bs
May 2 2022,negative,another live action swampfest from disney unlikable characters
Apr 25 2022,negative,something truer to the story and characterizations of the animation that was not filmed withing viewing distance of the chinese concentration camps housing the uyghurs muslims would have been a lot better
Apr 4 2022,negative,literally a disney movie without anything that makes the movie a disney or chinese movie wrong architectural structures lack of soundtrack inaccurate depiction of scenery and story not to talk about the lack of main character mushu who was the comedy relief of the original disney movie in the 2000s  if you are expecting a lighthearted movie about comedy good luck just watch the original it s 1000 times better did i mention they did not include ill make a man out of you or the first song from the original id give it a 0 if i could
Mar 22 2022,positive,saw 2020s mulan as a massive disney fan although their recent live action offerings are very mixed and none are as good as the originals many of their animated films are fine examples of how to do animation right looking at the title the advertising and that seeing it was made by disney it is very easy to think that this is another one of the live action remakes and it is easy why it has been critiqued as one part of me was really psyched being somebody who loves the 1998 film but also worried when seeing the hate for the film and for the lead actress    when seeing mulan it didnt actually strike me as a live action remake and doesnt have an awful lot of disney in sight other than the title and references to the score of the 1998 film embedded in this one instead to me it came over as more another version of the character and her story and one more serious and less family friendly so directly comparing the two films didnt strike me as right while the disappointment that is expressed is understandable as there are big flaws to be found and it definitely does not have the same amount of charm heart and thrills as the 1998 film to me mulan was not that bad and was not deserving of the extreme backlash before it was even released seeing as yifei lius personal views hadhave nothing to do with disney or the film crew    mulan is not perfect do agree with those that say that a lot of the dialogue is pretty bad with a tendency to sound stilted especially in the cringeworthy and very out of place attempts at sporadic humour with the troops and go too heavy on emphasising the characters values loyal brave and true agreed did not need to be emphasised so much the point was made quite quickly there are things in the plot that sounded oddly intriguing on paper but done too little with especially with the phoenix which doesnt really add anything    both xianniang and bori khan felt like underdeveloped characters the former comes off better as she is suitably mysterious and alluring but her motives are pretty confused later on with it being not clear what side she was on she is pretty much a come and go plot device and her final scene felt very rushed bori khan has an intimidating look but is underused and his motivation is pretty much the only thing that is learnt about him didnt like how easily defeated he was and how clumsy the scene looked in general the characters could have done with more depth mulan and zhou are the ones that come closest and the film could have done with more soul    however mulan does look great especially striking in the truly exquisite historical visuals and the at its best majestic scenery there is a lot of colour and atmosphere in the photography which was clearly inspired by the likes of zhang yimou and the costumes do catch the eye the cgi didnt seem too excessive and didnt look jarringly cheap either harry gregsonwilliams score is stirring and also has a sumptuous emotional core also enjoyed hearing references to the music from the 1998 film niki caro on the most part directs with confidence    personally really was impressed by the beautifully choreographed and dynamically photographed action when it needed to be tense it was when it needed to be particularly athletic it was and when it needed to excite it did especially the big battle and the avalanche it was easy to feel the strength pain and perseverance needed to get through all that training only the final showdown came over as ridiculous the story was not perfect but it engaged enough intrigued with the cultural aspects and inspired thanks to mulan still being a strong character though she doesnt grow as much or go on a character journey as much as the animated mulan if to briefly compare although the fatherdaughter reunion was more emotionally powerful previously it is still quite moving in a subtle way here    moreover the acting wasnt bad at all to me liu is a confident lead bringing authority and vulnerability to mulan that was ideal for this ideal heroine donnie yen and jet li are strong authority figures and jason scott lee does inject some menace into his underdeveloped role tzi mas performance is very telling in its nuance more than once not even saying a word li gong looks wonderful in the film and is both deceptively alluring and mysterious despite the character herself is not meaty gongs acting is quite complex    in conclusion prepared myself to hate it but quite liked it while finding it very flawed 610
Mar 20 2022,negative,i dont know who wrote this but disney needs to ask for their money back characters has no deep connection with nothing mulan is actually a very boring plain character watching my cat lick his but is far more entertaining
Mar 16 2022,negative,a movie about a daughters love and the lengths she would go to save her loved ones  a timeless tale in china  so her disabled dad was conscripted to go to war so his daughter picks up his armor and sword and conscript papers to go in his stead to save her fathershe gets to the army camp and was given rules of which lying is beheading sneaking a girl into camp is beheading and if you cant preform well you get sent home  wait what  her going there is punishable by death yet if her father went and because of his disability he would have just been sent home anyhow so the whole situation of this movie was avoidable and now she has to fear for her life instead  hmmminteresting concept for a movie do what you think is right but its punishable by death if youre caughtgood disney family oriented message can always count on those family values from disney
Mar 13 2022,positive,mulan is an okay movie but at times it can feel like other movies and thats a problem but otherwise its a good movie
Mar 13 2022,positive,after i saw this movie i think this movie is about chinese culture the careful training and planning according to the art of war i think the actors are very emotional and enthusiastic there are realistic and spectacular performance scenes and filming locations but according to the cartoons that disney has made it is more fun and inserts love drama than in the movie so i think watching cartoons is better but if according to history it will be a movie version that is more realistic and closer than the cartoon version and the end of this famous female general of china also didnt end very well according to suitang composed by churenhua during the qing dynasty but i can admit that this movie overall is a good movie for anyone who likes movies about the history of china this movie is worth watching too in my opinion but according to the plot that the director brought to make this movie it is interesting and inserts ideas beliefs roles and duties in addition many livelihoods and traditions such as the duties of women in the past that are still in effect to this day the belief that women are obligated to marry in order to build a reputation for their ancestry restrictions on the rights and obligations of women to stay at home cooking and raising children no matter how much time has passed this belief still exists this film therefore serves as a spokesperson and shows on the other side that women do not have a duty to just stay at home cooking and raising children we can work and build our reputation just like men so i think that besides the history acting skills scenes places this movie is considered a very good movie and there are also beliefs about mythical beasts that are inserted into it as a little knowledge that adds to the story and makes the story more exciting
Mar 12 2022,negative,no humor like it was on the cartoon doesnt make sense she take off her armor when she comes out as mulan the soldier in the middle of a battle also the jumps and coreography with ropes very badly done looks like effects crouching tiger hidden dragon 2000
Mar 3 2022,negative,still not sure why they bothered to even call it mulan there is barely any resemblance to the original
Feb 19 2022,positive,one of the best animation to liveaction adaptations to come out of disney  this is very well made and serious which was a surprise considering what they did with aladan and dumbo  epic action sequences and a fantastic storyline
Feb 11 2022,negative,yet more misguided political manipulation of women played out on our screens    watch the fabulous original mulan animation instead and feel good about yourself
Feb 6 2022,positive,its good and all but the cricket and why is mushu a phoenix
Jan 24 2022,negative,disney has reached a new low for reasons which i cant mention here
Jan 24 2022,positive,not my favorite disney remake that is lion king 2019 but still pretty good movie i havent watched the original mulan from 1998 the acting is pretty good the cinematography and visual effects are good too  i would recommend it
Jan 11 2022,negative,an incompetent remake of a 90s movie which itself was inspired by stories of a real person in history dont waste your time on this just watch the original animated version the only thing this one has similar to the original movie or original story is the name
Jan 10 2022,negative,is anyone noticing a trend with what disney is producing  in this as well as the star warsthemed movies to appease the social media gods regardless of its popularity with john q consumer omg forgive me if i dont name jane q as well because that would be  gender specific instead of expecting all of us to think sometimes that the critics are praising this woke liberalist agenda pushed by their productions but the real audience does not enjoy the show  maybe the people producing this crap need to have a cup of coffee and woke they own dang self up
Jan 9 2022,positive,the best disney movie and my fav disney princess
Jan 4 2022,negative,this movie would have worked well if the characters were updated and and newer better things were added but because its another disney remake that is trying to pull on the nostalgic strings on people it fails because its a heavily stripped down version of the original thats bland playing it safe with the pg13 rating and being dull without any charm or likability that made the original mulan a disney classic
Dec 31 2021,negative,if it was its own movie it wouldnt be so bad but as a disney mulan movie it was horrible
Dec 29 2021,positive,its not your regular disney movie and its definitely not a remake of the animated film its a much more mature story for sure
Dec 28 2021,neutral,fells more like a movie slapt with a mulan titel than a remake
Dec 28 2021,negative,on rare occasions a liveaction remake of an existing work can equal or surpass the original this movie however is not one of those exceptions like many disney characters of late mulan is another mary sue who is just great at everything very different from the more realistic and endearing mulan from the animation who struggles and works hard to be as strong as the other male soldiers its hard to like a character that you cant relate to combine that with the weird credits thanking a provincial government engaging in genocide and an actress who holds us citizenship but is clearly still a cardcarrying member of the chinese communist party there is absolutely nothing redeeming about this movie if you want to watch mulan watch the original disney animated movie
Dec 25 2021,positive,entertaining enough but im not sure that it lived up to all the hype and hoopla  i had never seen the original animated film  the martial arts choreography was well done which has pretty much become the norm though for these sorts of films
Dec 22 2021,negative,nope nope and nope the animated movie will continue to reign supreme watching this live adaptation made me realize that this would have no way been successful without mushu and crickee perhaps i prejudged it to begin with but  no
Dec 22 2021,negative,what is the purpose of taking out everything that made the animated version such a charming movie i was looking forward to the animated little dragonwhat a disappointment this was this is more mulan from some boring marvel action yawner with magic super powers but quite boring kids were the first to request to better rewatch the original to which i happily obliged will steer clear of any other disney remakes in the foreseeable future
Dec 12 2021,neutral,the cinematography and music was great and the acting wasnt bad but everything else was just bad choice after bad choice they turned a relatable character with flaws and personality into a mary sue plank of wood who really has no real hurdles or growth in the movie also the additional plots that werent part of the original movie are just unnecessary and only drag down the movie in quality  also the whole chinese camps controversy is no surprise with disneys current record
Dec 5 2021,negative,i really tried to like this movie i was so excited to see it it felt like a long psa for china
Dec 4 2021,negative,a worthless remake with a marysue lead they took all that was good out of the original to make this
Dec 1 2021,negative,its ok but just cant top the original at all
Nov 30 2021,negative,nonsensical completely pointless remake without any charm or engagement not true to traditional story or even a fun story  she is captain marvel and jackie chans most out there martial arts characters rolled into one what is the point of the story imagine paying the disney premium to watch it  ooof
Nov 29 2021,negative,dishonor dishonor on your whole company dishonor on your movie dishonor on your cow
Nov 25 2021,negative,waste and unnecessary animation was way better you took out the best character and substitute w some bs cgi fights and someone that turns into a bird also not to mention the controversial xingjiang human rights abuse credits thanking them the best thing was i am glad i didnt pay money to see this in theaters
Nov 23 2021,negative,mulan one of the many marvels to hit film and save disney in their animation world i went in heeding the mixed reviews i heard and was left broken hearted there was no fa mulan shang cute cricket of luck or even eddie murphy reprising his iconic role of mushu im sorry but this movie may have been 1h 26mns but it dragged on like it was 6 hours long i honestly was expecting the make a man out of you and reflection scenes props for the back story of the hawk being a witch and bringing a pheonix into itbut everything else was ridiculously portrayed cgi was over played and looked hysterically cheesy some parts of the movie looked like godzilla dubbing from the 80s ugh mulan was my favorite 90s disney princess line heroineand i am dumbfounded hurt and quite literally feel betrayed about the immoral justice done to her alsousing a disney park hotel for the location really im actually glad i paid 5 at walmart for thisit wasnt worth the 30 originally charged for it
Nov 19 2021,neutral,the cinematography is stunning but the writing lacks any whisper of emotional connection to the characters who were well acted but shoot in the foot by a script that turned this former classic into more hollow than wholesome
Nov 16 2021,positive,another casualty of the pandemic forcing this amazing cinematic film direct into our homes i liked it but to me it didnt have the same emotional weight as the animation however that could be my nostalgia i wish disney had released this to the movies as well as disney though
Nov 15 2021,negative,this movie was just unnecessary its nothing like the animated movie which was full of fun and life where is the music or the mushu from the animated movie they completely changed it all i felt no emotions watching this its pretty forgettable and just dumb this is not how you make a live action remake
Nov 15 2021,negative,why justwhy was this movie really necessary
Nov 14 2021,negative,this movie brings dishonour to us all
Nov 13 2021,positive,never saw the cartoon so took this movie strictly on its own merits fantastic acting from the lead
Nov 13 2021,positive,good movie about girl power movie shows how a girl can be successful in gender differences places
Nov 8 2021,negative,it looks and sounds nice but the central characters arc shes already awesome and perfect she just needs to express herself is flat and empty  stick with the classic animated one
Nov 7 2021,negative,watch the cartoon instead
Nov 6 2021,positive,the film is about a kind and brave something was missing in the film i didnt make it the plot itself is not very interesting but there is still something in it
Nov 5 2021,negative,yeah this is the way you never ever do a movie remake and this is also the way you never ever do a movie about strong woman the animated mulan was great character this one is just pain in the ass
Oct 27 2021,positive,everything was brilliant and of high calibre from the story line visuals and actors everything was great if you are looking for inspiration in your life particularly if you have hardship finding your place in the world this movie is a must watch
Oct 23 2021,positive,sadly the beautiful scenery and colours werent enough to carry this off cannot compare to the original
Oct 21 2021,negative,horrible acting and lack of story there was no explanation of any of her powers and she can all of a sudden do crazy stunts without any training ok and nobody could tell she was a girl ok
Oct 16 2021,negative,poor acting and overall poor movie worst movie ever seen to date
Oct 8 2021,neutral,one of the most disappointing live action remakes to come out of the mouse house  its too long oh and no mushu what were you thinking disney i have to admit the shape shifting witch character worked really well action was pretty impressive but still it felt so lifeless compared to the original
Oct 7 2021,negative,once again disney has shown us how terrible and incredibly pointless the live action remakes are the character mulan who was once full of character personality and lovable is now dumbed down to a plain canvas who is forgettable the side characters are dumbed down to the point they leave no imprint the villain is laughable and a pathetic excuse of a villain who is not scary in the slightest the witch is painfully written and not needed disney has failed to make a good live action adaptation and just show us that they are just interested in the chinese audiences wallets
Oct 4 2021,negative,i think this is the superman problem when the protagonist is already perfect there is no grow of character and with that no depth for the story  in my opinion the acting by orders of the director or maybe the actress interpretation is extremely bland  ps seems to be there were some problems in the production of this movie with some politics and human rights possibly some original fans disliked the movie before watching it
Oct 1 2021,negative,i am disappointed about this remake it should have been more like the original animated film with musical numbers and mushu in it along with that lucky cricket this is not the mulan i wanted
Sep 26 2021,negative,so bad no mushu no singing this isnt disney dumb movie
Sep 26 2021,negative,was expecting a story more compelling
Sep 25 2021,positive,i missed the magic of the disney story  i dont think it helped that they didnt make this one a musical  the acting and visuals were great and i did tear up at the end i just wanted more from this live action adaptation
Sep 25 2021,positive,mulan may not be better than the disney animated movie but it is at least a better disney remake thanks to its violent action mature themes dramatic tone and amazing performances
Sep 23 2021,negative,the fight scenes were tame while also unrealistic with a bunch of house of flying wires nonsense  no music to sing along to  no mushu no sassy grandma no lucky cricket no anthropomorphic horse no funny side characters at all to provide levity  changed the huns for a different bad guy changed the names of some characters from the 90s version  mulans identity isnt even a secret in this one changing the entire message  to top it all off the actress who plays mulan is an unapologetic open communist that denounces the struggles of the citizens of hong kong and american ideals     i wasnt surprised disney went for a shameless cash grab remake of something less than 20 years old i am surprised however at how god awful it was
Sep 21 2021,negative,the sets and costumes were great and the acting was good but the dialog and editing were terrible there were so many tacky and cringeworthy moments also speaking english with bad accents makes the characters look stupid if the movie is english language the characters should speak it with fluent and proper english like they would their native language this is what chernobyl did and they bucked the awful trend
Sep 17 2021,neutral,a pretty dull film with some bad acting and bad cgi this new version of mulan closely follows the previous disney iteration very closely but without the wit and charm this film quite hollow without and too serious and the more humorous scenes with the spider or the soldiers jokes feel forced and unfunny the lead actress and the actor who plays the emperor gave pretty stilted performances the cgi of the phoenix which wasnt needed and didnt add much to the story anyway was very noticeable the fight scenes are very heavily edited and are not visually impressive the only things i liked about the film were the costumes production design and the cinematography it feels like this film wasnt needed whatsoever as it does not deviate that much from the previous iteration and the new elements it adds to distinguish itself does not work overall a mediocre film that is uninteresting and does not do enough to justify its own existence
Sep 3 2021,negative,how did this turn out so bad because they ignored everything that made the original great and replaced it with bland characters with zero personality and cheesy action scenes just awful
Sep 1 2021,negative,although looking very beautiful its ultimately not worth your time
Aug 28 2021,negative,terrible all original mulan fans will be disappointed 
Aug 21 2021,negative,absolute bullshit not a single moment is enjoyable the acting is wooden through  through the story is shit no clever writing at all the characters are not developed in the slightest just a waste of time and please note im not trying to compare it to the original animated movie just because of the simple fact that i havent the animated movie yet but i do hope to watch it sometime in the future
Aug 15 2021,neutral,its not a bad movie but its not  good either
Aug 11 2021,negative,just watch the animated one
Aug 9 2021,positive,absolutely loved it
Aug 3 2021,negative,if the original movie is a bowl of ramen this film is a like warm pot noodle bad story bad acting bad editing just save yourself the time and dont watch
Jul 27 2021,negative,why why why why to ruin something was already perfect this is one of those movies you will never recall that even was made or oh yes that was rotten
Jul 26 2021,negative,its suck the worst disney movie ever made
Jul 26 2021,negative,watch the cartoon movie instead
Jul 24 2021,negative,the worst movie ive seen in a long time
Jul 23 2021,negative,early into the film and evil looking girl entered into a man as if she was an evil spirit she later burst out and killed men inside the city wall where he went then it looked like she was going to enter another man but we decided to turn it off too much evil spiritual stuff for us
Jul 20 2021,negative,in a vacuum this movie is terrible if you take the original animated film and the controversies surrounding the production of this remake into account this movie is a complete disaster no redeeming qualities the only good thing to come out of it is that i now know which critics get paid to leave good reviews
Jul 4 2021,negative,beautiful settings and action scenes but once again disney falls into their own traps creating a live action mulan with no depth i cant understand why they spend so much money in creating these movies and forget about the story truly unimpressive
Jun 29 2021,positive,i loved it i have to say though that as a disney movie it lacked magic i didnt get the feeling of a fairytale and i really wanted a different ending something more juicy probably lol but it is an amazing movie i really liked the cast and everything must watch
Jun 28 2021,negative,i couldnt make myself watch the whole movie  it was just too hokey not funny in the funny parts and the special effects and wirework were jarring and stupid looking  and it had almost no relation to the original disney movie it was trying to be crouching tiger hidden dragon and disney at the same time and it just did not work
Jun 25 2021,negative,terrible do not watch it for your own sake
Jun 23 2021,negative,what a disgrace to the original attempting to make it historically accurate with a witch using cloth and whipping it around people or running 50 feet straight up a wall its a huge joke and a major disappointment to anyone who enjoyed the real mulan
Jun 21 2021,negative,i hope this movie will finally help convince disney to stop the live action remakes  the movies are just cash grabs as we all know and they are not all that good  out of all of live action disney remakes i have seen mulan is no doubt the worst  i was not a fan of the 1998 animated movie but it was much better than this film  the title character is flat uninspiring and just plan boring  i will give disney a small amount of credit for trying to do something different with the movie and did not just do a shot for shot remake of the animated movie as they did with the lion king  still their efforts are just plain disastrous  the dialogue is contrived to the nth degree  the actors just phone it in  none of them put any effort into their roles  they all just seem like they are reading their lines and collect their paychecks  the whole thing with mulan and several other characters have superhuman abilities which is beyond stupid  the villains can literally run up and down walls  what in the world was that  the fight scenes were not well done at all  nothing in this movie worked  hands down the worst of disneys live action remakes  i do not even recommend this remake even for fans of the original animated movie
Jun 15 2021,negative,i love the original movie and i have watched it multiple times but this garbage had me face palming in the first 30 minutes everything that made the original great is just absent here the characters are boring and dull with no likeable qualities the plot is lazy and just unbearable just another pointless cash grab by disney
Jun 14 2021,positive,a beautiful and elegantly shot film that well carries the typical disney inspiration it plays it too safe though keeping most emotional impacts and character depth to nothing more than surface level
Jun 12 2021,negative,this movie had bad editing and made no sense 0 stars
Jun 12 2021,positive,i love disney and i was disappointed by this movie it had no mushu and for some reason it had a witch disney can do better
Jun 11 2021,negative,disappointing disney really went for a cashgrab and ruined an amazing film
Jun 8 2021,positive,its a wonderfull lets say reboot of a lovely disney classics it talks about lots of important subjects which we still cant handle nowadays and the role of the chi is very well done
Jun 7 2021,neutral,this movie takes risks by being so much different than the original and it unfortunately doesnt really work 
Jun 6 2021,positive,heard so many bad things about mulan but i thought it was amazing loved it
Jun 6 2021,positive,opting for a more gritty and realistic approach although there are some magical elements that relate more to chinese beliefsmyths than anything disney 2020s mulan isnt a shotforshot liveaction adaptation of a classic animation and after 2019s the lion king thats definitely a good thing it doesnt hold a candle to the original for many reasons nostalgia will always play a big part here but if you can overlook the obvious chinese propaganda its got enough of the original animations story and enough action to make for an entertaining watch with a distinct feminist message if nothing else its certainly one of disneys better liveaction adaptations
Jun 1 2021,negative,i love how the director said that they removed mushu because they didnt want any magic in the movie while giving us a witch a phoenix and a chi powered mulan
May 29 2021,negative,this felt like a poorly made high budget b grade version of the animated movie and even without any comparison to the original disney classic it fails as a movie in general
May 29 2021,negative,i didnt see any of the crappy disney la remakes after that train wreck beauty and the beast but i gave this pos movie a chance i thought how bad could it be it has so much potential this is easily the worst movie ive seen in 2020 hands down
May 28 2021,negative,mulan gets a star because it looks good and thats all it has going into this borefestthere is no personality and its just a big budget rip off of the early 2000 movies that did it better
May 28 2021,positive,disneys liveaction adaptation of mulan is a much more sophisticated film than the original animation that isnt to say that the film does not have its issues on and off screen without the whimsical musical numbers and cutting out the beloved character mushu hurts the film severely luckily the film manages to put together a talented cast with a great script and some incredible action scenes although some of the vfx do fail to be fully realized the film has a wonderful message about being true to yourself but it also has elements of family devotion being important in chinese culture which is thoroughly enjoyable in fact majority of the representation of chinese culture in the film is wellrealized this is definitely a movie that adults will enjoy more than children it is still fun and exciting and includes many great surprises for fans of the original but instead of a comedymusical disney provides a militarydrama
May 28 2021,negative,souless pointless only a sad feling at the end
May 27 2021,negative,disneys mulan from 1998 is arguably the best of its entire animated collection its a beautiful lovingly animated story told with a powerful message one only made better by an impeccable soundtrack ranking amongst the studios greats in 2020 it was only a matter of time before the film got adapted into live action how has it translated well i just burned 30 on premium vod to be able to tell you you definitely shouldnt    despite adding and subtracting several characters and plot elements the mulan remake largely tells the same story as its animated counterpart itself based on a centuriesold legend the ballad of mulan with an invasion from bandits on the horizon the emperor of china issues a decree for every family to present a male warrior for his army fearing for her frail fathers life and with no other man to represent her family hua mulan disguises herself as a man to join the army in his stead    i hate to sound like a broken record but disneys shoddy trend of remakes leaves me no other choice this live action mulan is worse in every way to its sister animation like the studios other adaptations it mixes up some of the supporting framework in its characters and side stories but its all empty posturing    mulan only goes through the motions clumsily skipping over the masterful beats that make the cartoon so wonderful the film presents itself as a deathly serious war epic but hurts for cutting out pivotal characters such as captain shang and mulans ancestors and its songs whose lovely melodies occasionally echo through the instrumental score while these cuts are done in a respectable effort to distance the film from the animation the crucial moments and dense development given to its characters during the films songs are all gone with nothing to compensate one notable new character aside more on her later its as if the music supporting crew and all the content concerning them are blindly axed from the 90minute original with the areas surrounding them being stretched out in tedium to spit out a two hour movie    mulan 4    as a result you never get that personal investing connection to mulan her growth into a leader and warrior doesnt feel active and natural but like a recreation that expects you to fill in the missing development by having seen the gorgeously empowering animation first it doesnt help that lead star liu yifie is too uncharismatic and blankfaced in an attempt to look stoic and her lack of acting aside yifies shameful stance on the police and violence thats been erupting in hong kong in the current sours mulan just that extra bit more    gong lis performance as xian lang a witch allied with the bandits from the north is the only interesting character in the movie funnily enough the new characters arc is almost entirely mulans from the animation making her feel while one of the better parts of the film pretty much redundant    as with the majority of disneys other live action adaptations mulan does excel in one area its visuals picking up on the accomplishments of last years aladdin mulan is wrapped in colorful costumes and production design that beautifully honor the 600 ad tang dynasty region its set in mulans home village is particularly eyecatching and as the film progresses through snowy mountains grassy fields bathed in golden sunsets and striking chinese architecture its almost always a visual treat the heightened wirework action incorporated into the films set pieces though sparse enough to make you pine for more is also thoroughly stunning and one of mulans true accomplishments in the uninspired story its all set in its just too little too late    mulan is one of the worst live action adaptations coming from disneys tenyear cashgrabbing streak it fails its protagonist her journey and everything else making the animation great in a choppy halfhearted attempt to make something new
May 27 2021,negative,where is mushu im a disappointed with this film since they took out one of the main characters from the first film
May 26 2021,positive,i dont know why everyone is saying this movie is awful they fixed most of the problems that the original had the original gave mulan a love interest when it wasnt need in the newest tale which this movie removed and if you are angered about no comedy then i dont think that should be a offense this mulan movie was more series because it kinda took place in a war so no comedy is fine the movie also had more battle scenes which the original one only really had in the end and the sequel didnt even have a battle if i did want to complain is that it would have still been nice to see her just learning how to fight and that they didnt really need the new characters but thats it
May 25 2021,negative,seriously displeased  why are there all of a sudden witches and no songs from the original soundtrack was really hoping to see a childhood favorite film come to life but this was very disappointing there were many significant changes that i do not believe bettered this movie
May 21 2021,negative,you have to be smoking crack to think that this movie was good waste of time and shouldnt have been made they completely changed the story and the cgi and logic was crap
May 21 2021,positive,not to bad wish the phoenix interacted more
May 20 2021,negative,why just why instead of delivering a beautiful story of a strong woman who is slowing growing during her life and learning from the mistakes they just did a generic movie where the main character is just born powerful like 99 of others weak vilan and so much culturally wrong
May 20 2021,negative,wheresmushu yeah this film sucks the acting is as stale as 13 year old crackers the editing sucks the action scenes are laughable i guess the score is alright yeah just watch the original i usually dont join hate trains but im willing to make an exception this one time
May 20 2021,negative,low suspenseful boring mess of a movie doesnt live up to expectations continue reading for advanced review    story  3510   script  5510     acting  610   humor  4510   interest  3510   character development  3510   final verdict  410 
May 17 2021,negative,that phoenix thing makes 0 sense why is the editing so bad why did the witch lady suddenly switch sides all of a sudden oh wow were not so different now ill take a shot for a random stranger even though weve been enemies for the past 30 minutes
May 17 2021,negative,i guess xi jinping himself directed this this movie should be compared with corona virus and not tomatoes
May 15 2021,negative,i now know why its on disney  its because people would be burning the dvds after watching it  its just awful the movie doesnt make any sense and if anything its just a disrespectful mockoff of the original movie its cold unemotional shitty they could have saved the money of making the movie and used it for something else
May 14 2021,negative,this was so bad i think disney should apologize to the 1998 classic for daring to even use the name mulan this movie is so bad even the chinese hated     the characters boring bland and so forgettable   the action was was well i cant even think of an adjective to describe its laughableness     no intended funny moments at all or memorable moments    the worst part is the vomit inducing storyline that insults all of its audience    well done disney you proved that even women can fuck up a 200m dollar film   you go girls    i mean who wants a story of a brave and strong willed girl overcoming adversity and hardship an intelligent and endearing heroine that is the hero of an entire nation   who would want that when you can just have superpowers and face 0 challenges
May 14 2021,neutral,this had bad acting it screamed dishonor to the original film no mushu  no mulan  we dont need live action remakes i prefer disney to make more original ideas rather than waste money on something that is being remade and turns out to be worse
May 13 2021,negative,it completely fails in recreating the tone of the original
May 13 2021,negative,this movie had nothing compared to the original everything about it was so boring that i can compare it to the liveaction dumbo which is another liveaction remake i skipped for a reason
May 10 2021,negative,there is barely any story just because the main character was female the writers just made her one of the most powerful beings simply because she is a woman its just horrible all of it
May 9 2021,negative,the creators took away everything good about the original mulan and turned it into an illogical humorless mess
May 5 2021,neutral,4510 lets get down to business by trading charm humor and pretty good tunes for mediocre kung fu action overlyserious yet toothless tone and stilted dialogue mulan has laid bare the soullessness of the disney live action formula certainly not a film worth fighting for
May 2 2021,negative,this is legitimately one of the worst movies ever made it disrespects the original features acting thats mediocre at best no emotion no memorable music and is culturally inaccurate to the last degree its also persistently insulting that the score in this movie is mostly just polished instrumentals of the beloved songs from the original do not watch this it is not worth it
May 1 2021,negative,this movie was so boring and bland characters had no personality and it was the worst wuxia movie ive ever seen
Apr 28 2021,negative,this never should have been made
Apr 21 2021,positive,at first i was regretting paying 20 dollars for this feminist movie but it made up for it everyone is born with a gift problem is most people are ashamed of it 
Apr 20 2021,negative,the fact that this movie was marketed as a more ethnically correct take on mulan yet its written and directed by a bunch of crackers thats truly irony at its highest
Apr 16 2021,neutral,really wasnt going to give this one a chance seeing as im in the antidisney live action remakedlar group but since i have disney why not going to say right off the bat nowhere near as good as the animated version not even close as far as dlars go its probably the best one ive seen but thats not saying much no mushu none of the charm of the original just some pretty cool action scenes here and there even if by the end of it it becomes silly meh barely gets a pass from me
Apr 15 2021,negative,mulan 2020 is the movie equivalent of panda express  an american product fantasizing about chinese culture the characters were underdeveloped the storyline drudged along slower than mud and the choreography was too illogical to even be appreciated the beautiful visuals does not replace a good story and bright colors do not equal good visuals i honestly thought i was going crazy by the end because of how bad the decisions in this movie were this movie was spectacular in how painfully bland it was just go watch house of flying daggers or any other wuxia film  dont waste your money and sanity with this meager attempt at nostalgia
Apr 14 2021,negative,it is bad oh god it is soooo bad disney has acquired a particular talent that consists of ruining all the films of my youth
Apr 14 2021,negative,li shang what did they do to him how can he get down to business and defeat the huns when hes a old man
Apr 11 2021,negative,very disappointed in the change of the original plot some idea didnt make sense for why they were in this movie
Apr 10 2021,positive,a fine film     great to look at
Apr 9 2021,negative,you know i look at the reviewers score and legitimately asking myself if we saw the same movie this is without a doubt the worst disney remake thus far its worthless like seriously you call it the mature version like what like in the original i love how in the middle of a bright song it been cut in the middle and we can see the ruins and nobody talks because of the shock well here we cut to this place stay there for a minute and non of the characters shut up its only one example of plenty another is mulan running away in original its at night rainy the score slaps and the family wakes up in middle of the night to find her missing here they wake up in the middle of a regular morning to find that shes gone mulan is just awful she has chi power that let her do everything so she doesnt need to train any get better she just needs to believe because this is the adult version also which because adult version but honestly the worst thing here is the editing and camera it will never stop from keep zipping doing slowmoes and change potions every 2 seconds its awful bottom line this movie sucks its the worst movie of 2020 and one of the worst disney movies ever dont wacth please dont
Apr 9 2021,positive,its a good night time movie we can watch with family and kids and has some of the best story telling in last years and story is great too
Apr 8 2021,positive,wasnt as bad as i was expecting granted i watched with my wife and kid  not a bad adventure
Apr 8 2021,positive,the movie fails to capture the magic of the original animated feature yes it is true to the story of mulan but there is no sense of myth and valor too many things dont really make sense plot wise and with their budget disney could have really made the action sequences 10 times better the movie does showcase chinese culture well and the movie was watchable with the family 
Apr 6 2021,negative,the most boring thing i have ever watched it has no personality like the real original mulan
Apr 5 2021,negative,another unnecessary although slightly more entertaining then the majority liveaction disney remake whose adaptation of an animated feature only reinforces the longing for the creative original
Apr 5 2021,negative,another classic ruined it was flat i didnt empathise with any of the characters as they didnt have any personality and felt cold and distant i adore the original one as they show that with resilience and hard work you can get anywhere here she had the chi since little so she didnt struggle at any point the music on this one was trash compared to the original none of the original songs were included only some hinted i didnt recognise yao ling and chien po im still confused they had such big personalities in the original and were the perfect comedy reliefs here on this one they are like extras no personality and minimal sense of humour li shang it was such a cool character in the first one here hes split into two pointless characters their romance in the first one was complex and beautiful mushu mushu wasnt even there one of the best characters instead he was a pointless speechless phoenix no character development no lessons learned although they tried to by repeating to exhaustion the words loyal brave true but words means nothing if you dont show it ive learned so much more from the original one without anyone preaching anything i felt much more empowered in the original one even though this one was made by woke feminists they forced the message they wanted to give and completely destroyed the story
Apr 4 2021,negative,i watched this movie so none of you should bad cgis and acting misuse of the original disney movie
Apr 4 2021,negative,disneys worst movie to exist   this movie was extremely boring
Apr 2 2021,negative,a very disappointing remake to one of my favorite stories in short  1 the movie is culturally inaccurate to the point of it being insulting  2 the message of mulan is supposed to be of strength and empowerment instead in the movie mulan is grossly subservient and was born with special powers  3 strange decisions to add in certain scenes and characters that bring no value to the story    1 the movie is culturally inaccurate to the point of it being insulting  when niki caro was announced as director i flinched i get the argument that race shouldnt matter when picking a competent movie director and in many scenarios i can agree with this the reason why this argument doesnt work in this case is because the movie heavily relies on chinese culture and unless niki caro truly understands chinas history its philosophy and way of life then the depiction isnt going to be accurate thus lowering the overall quality of the movie     the mulan liveaction is a gross caricature of chinese culture chinese people arent obsessed with phoenixes filial piety and honor are important but its not our lifeblood and does not need to be shoved down our throats the movie represents the chinese as submissive honorobsessed dolls who think of nothing but to serve their country because theyre supposed to all of these random chinese stereotypes and assumptions clumsily added to the movie just cheapen the overall message and makes it nearly impossible for me to take seriously    2 the message of mulan is supposed to be of strength and empowerment instead in the movie mulan is grossly subservient and was born with special powers    in other adaptations of mulan mulan is supposed to be smart competent enough to keep up with the men but not physically better she stands out by being smart and embracing both her femininity and masculinity to outwit her struggles mulan in the liveaction is just born strong she shows no signs of cleverness throughout the movie she beats all of her opponents through brute force and her special birthgiven chi powers you can argue the catapult scene but that act was so out of character for her it didnt make her come across as smart it was just confusing for the audience    mulan is also supposed to feel like a real person someone who has struggles dreams ambitions the mulan in the liveaction shows none of that her biggest struggle is hiding her chi powers because shes a woman eyeroll in the disney adaption you can see the hesitation and fear in her eyes when she first gets to the training camp you can see how she struggles to keep up mulan in the liveaction gets to the camp and doesnt seem phased at all around all the other men and even very confidently pulls her sword on one of them within 30 seconds of arriving her hiding her special chi powers that normal people dont have as her biggest struggle cheapens the grit and resilience of the original mulan    3 strange decisions to add in certain scenes and characters that bring no value to the story    i still have no idea why the witch and phoenix were added to the movie i thought the phoenix was a kite at first and it wasnt until it kept hovering around that i realized it was supposed to be integral to the movie except all it did was fly around as some sad attempt of a symbol     when the movie was first announced i was really excited to hear that it was going to be a more realistic mature take on the classic disney film i thought it would pay some homage to the animated version but the liveaction very randomly shows the iconic disney scenes even though it has no place to put simply the live action attempts to send a different message than the original disney but then incorporates all the iconic animated scenes that have no relevance to the live action the matchmaker scene the fireworkcatapult scene the scene of the lost battle all vital to developing mulan as a smart yet clumsy character in the animated movie when in the live action they portray mulan as stoic and physically powerful they chose to include the aforementioned scenes but chose to omit scenes of the father trying to chase after mulan in the rain after she leaves mulan cutting her hair the father comforting her after her failed matchmaking all of which would have fit into the movie perfectly     there are so many more things wrong with the movie like the character development just being bland and the characters themselves just being onedimensional the dad the sister why was she even in the movie the love interest i dont even know his name and the storytelling had no emotional depth to it some of the lines were so cringe and felt like some nonchinese person writing what they think chinese people say the fiercest winter storm could not take off this makeup is this supposed to be some pathetic attempt at poetry mulans weird submissive nature she even says she knows her place     this movie does such a huge disservice to a beautiful role model i feel even angrier when i think about how it caricatures chinese culture and makes one of chinas most beloved heroines a laughingstock
Apr 1 2021,negative,i think its bad because there is no music and mushu
Apr 1 2021,negative,it was not a live action remake billing as such was a poor choice it told mulan differently thats fine but dont falsely advertise the story was okay the acting was okayish the action season were old they felt 2010s style effort it was obvious that this film was not solely intended for a western audience the phoenix part was trash i believe the random phoenix inserts were added when mushy was pulled out
Mar 31 2021,negative,a blatant money grab full of plot holes soulless and disrespectful of the original material  and its meaning the screenwriters apparently dont understand their own movie or how a story is written shameless and all in all forgettable
Mar 28 2021,positive,it was a very good adaptation i did feel it needed the little dragon character and such i wish it had more ties to the cartoon story line i think more magic and such would have made it better its hard to score a disney movie a three
Mar 28 2021,negative,this movie was the worst thing i have ever seen as a stand alone there were so many different plot holes that made little to no sense at all i felt no character development whatsoever and the ones they tried to give this to were so easy to brush off they would have been better if not existing then to compare it to the original oh my god the original took the general and simple version of the story of mulan and added to it to an extent this pile of i dont even know what not only followed no part of her actually story but turned it into the dragon ball evolution of the disney world i went into this with low hopes from what id heard but by far i have never seen anything this bad ever so bad id rather watch the death note live action again before i watched this i pray no one suffers the things i saw and heard throughout the extent of this movie
Mar 27 2021,negative,what was to like about this movie nothing
Mar 25 2021,negative,theres nothing here it is simply a lifeless emotionless adaptation of one of the best disney films of all time the villains remind me of a silly filler episode in an anime or a sunday morning cartoon there is no sense of tension derived from the conflict of the characters the scenes from the original which were so inspiring are reduced to something that feels lifeless and passed over it feels as though the directors simply tried to tribute and then said lets move on to the action scenes the story doesnt matter all that much when it comes to the action the awful slomo shots are merely saved by the fact that the actors seem to care about making it feel realistic but as i stated before the film never takes the moments from the original that added tension and emotional weight it feels like theres someone on set dragging the characters to the next scene in a lets get over this type way the personality possessed by the original film is nowhere to be found here this is not mulan that isnt the menacing villain from the animated original and those arent the soldiers whose witty jokes made us smile this is yet another lifeless and uninteresting timewaster for children who havent seen the original
Mar 24 2021,negative,compared to the original trash on its own also trash if you dont want to build up a powerful female character just give her magic mulan doesnt work for or earn anything in this movie there are no struggles and the characters are painfully plain i would recommend not watching this movie it is a waste of time i feel like a more boring person after having consumed it
Mar 24 2021,negative,it was nice to see disney take a serious note on their remakebut lacked the charm of the original mulan they shouldve kept the dragon songs and spark that the animation had
Mar 24 2021,negative,this movie is just pure trash i mean the original has nothing to do with chinese culture either but at least it had eddie murphy catchy songs a menacing villain and a finale for kids to enjoy this one supports and advertises genocide does even less for women than the first one has not a single good action scene or song it tries to appropriate an asian martial arts theme and fails on every level i can only give this movie credit its appealing color play but why would i want to stare at pleasant screensaver for 2 hours
Mar 23 2021,positive,i was skeptical about watching mulan only because of the opinions of people on social media but the film was more then i expected it was graceful and with out a doubt an amazing take on the old movie i dont think mushu not being in the the new movie made the film any less then it is i think it was honestly better and more real without him being present i hope to see a mulan 2 within the next couple of years the special effects on foot placement during her stunts could use some work but other then that truly this new take was a turn out
Mar 23 2021,negative,big disney fan big disappointment on this one not only we already have high expectation compared to the cartoon there were many flaws here the characters are not memorable and they stare into the blank and we cant relate because theres no music for them to tell us how they feel also character arc for villain was also a let down last minute they rushed it maybe because of budget or something after a huge build up watch different analysis of the movie online and youll understand why not to mention the controversy as well around the movie itself surrounding politics
Mar 22 2021,negative,didnt quite live up to the hype feels like an american version of an asian film
Mar 21 2021,negative,such a bad version of mulan ruined the character my god mulan never relied on her strength she accomplished wonders by working hard and because of her intellect way to ruin the disney mulan version really hate it
Mar 20 2021,neutral,this is essentially just a less entertaining version of the animated mulan the characters feel less relatable and certain fantastical elements of the original have been removed it has a very predictable and almost emotionless plot that gets old quick
Mar 19 2021,negative,i dont like the animated movie but if comparing to this movie then the animated version is far better than this trash i dont get it why the critics always rate all disneys movies high i was shocked knowing this movie is nominated for oscar the only good thing comes from this movie is the song loyal brave true by christina aguilera
Mar 19 2021,positive,mulan was by most accounts a beautiful movie the land scape was amazing to look at and the look of all the cities and towns was on point however it didnt really hold to the original 90s version which i still find a lot better
Mar 19 2021,negative,what  how on earth is this culturally accurate plot makes no sense womens empowerment is poorly executed enjoyability non existent  if your looking for a good example on how to confuse and irritate an audience youve found one otherwise dont watch it
Mar 17 2021,negative,what a mess of a movie
Mar 17 2021,positive,loved it highly recommend giving it a watch
Mar 16 2021,positive,better as a remake ever created than the terrible cartoon movie
Mar 16 2021,neutral,i guess that in order to enjoy this film you need to forget the animated original even exists yes its hard especially because it gave us some epic moments and characters the fun the jokes the songs theyre not here and thats why i think it works at least they tried in a whole different way     although this liveaction version gives us some great sceneries and custom design it lacks at least for the first half the essence and excitement going for a linear and bland storyline everything just feels so rushed the battle sequences were fun but nothing outstanding and this new villainess i liked her     im not a huge fan of disneys live actions i stay with the animated originals all the way but this was a mildly good attempt of telling a beloved story in a more realistic and different kind of way that im pretty sure it will piss a lot of fans of the original
Mar 16 2021,positive,although the live action had very little that represented the original disneys mulan that most people expected which gave such low ratings to the community looking at it with out the disney aspects that so many were looking for it was an amazing movie that not only showed true character but gave amazing representation to women in an era that valued a mans strength over everything  not only that  but the scenery cosmetics acting  and costume designs were outstanding  based on many reviews and word of mouth i almost didnt give this movie a chance but im glad i did and others should too  basing it off the original disney movie alone isnt fair i can see a great deal of work that came forth in creating this movie  absolutely loved it its a movie that should be given an actual chance instead of being compared strictly to its original inspiration
Mar 16 2021,negative,where is mushu we wanted to see mushu not a freaking fried chicken
Mar 15 2021,negative,mulan is a boring and slow placed stain on its animated counterparts legacy
Mar 14 2021,negative,why make such bad films and watch them just awful
Mar 13 2021,positive,magical and inspiring 
Mar 12 2021,neutral,i loved the idea of mulan being a badass and owing it in live action it unfortunately did not give me the same thrill as the original there were some hits and misses in the story line and maybe the direction
Mar 11 2021,negative,wish 0 stars was possible its not an accurate representation of the actual ballad of hua mulan like disney kept claiming it would be nor is even a decent remake of the disney animated versionits just bad please do yourself a favor and either watch the original animated disney film or if youre looking for a good live action version thats true to the original ballad watch mulan rise of a warrior from 2009 both are much better than this movie
Mar 9 2021,negative,they removed all comedic aspects that were present in the original there is literally no comedic element to this movie  they turned a great animated movie into a crappy action film  mulan is no longer an underdog but the best warrior from the very beginning with the use of her chi  the visuals arent great everything seems to be kind of exaggerated  the feel in most scenes seem to be similar to stage theater
Mar 8 2021,positive,as always context is important and when it comes to disneys 2020 reimagining of the story of mulan it should be noted that i was twelve yearsold when the original animated film was released that film coming in between the likes of hercules and tarzan would signal the end of disneys animation renaissance of the nineties and in many waysthough there are liveaction reimaginings of the little mermaid and hercules among others in the worksthis new mulan somewhat feels as if it also signals the end of this particular brand exercise whats most disappointing though is this very easily could have felt like a turning point instead of a conclusion but alas director niki caros whale rider mcfarland usa reimagining of the material fails to inspire its own identity despite diverting the most from the original blueprint having now seen liveaction adaptations of most if not all of those ashman and menken collaborations along with the likes of the classic princess tales surely disney wont make its own snow white peter pan or pinocchio again after so many iterations already having been producgoogles furiouslyoh no it would seem this trend has more or less run its course with more critical failures than successes even if most have knocked it out of the park in terms of box office how this pertains to caros vision of the fictional folk heroine from the northern and southern dynasties of chinese history though has to do with how audiences have come to perceive the film once regarded as the opportunity among the other more formulaic fairy tales to become an authentic historical epic with sweeping visuals large battles and a brave female lead the sequence of events that have led mulan to landing on disney for an added premiere price seems to have reduced the impact of said opportunity its impossible to say if first impressions might have been stronger had the initial experience with caros film been on the big screen rather than from the comfort of my own home but given some of the blatantly bad cgi work in a handful of shots it could have certainly come across worse as well i guess this is all to say that 2020s liveaction version of mulan funnily enough ends up making many of the same mistakes as its predecessors despite trying the hardest not to this mulan removes many of the elements that infused so much life and energy into the original without bothering to substitute them with anything new or substantial even as that seems to be the intent and not to simply strip away your favorite childhood aspects and saving money on a cgi dragon for the hell of it good intentions are always honorable at least one would hope but the danger in adjusting a narrative that already worked so well and leaning more heavily into a certain theme tends to undo the crucial balance that was strucklikely not easilybefore as someone who found not only the music but the arc of the camaraderie between our heroine and her newfound peers along with the strong tonal balance that the animated film exhibited alarmingly good as a child i had hopes that as an adult caros versionwhile clearly leaning into the more historical lessmusical side of thingsmight find its own balance and sense of selfbeing as well but the biggest issue with caros film is that it knows it needs to be a massive epic adventure but doesnt really have any idea what it wants to be    read the whole review at 
Mar 8 2021,negative,since most of it has been written here already ill just add my twocents by saying that i find it genuinely astonishing how something so beautiful can feel that pointless     seems that by taking mushu cricket grandma and all the guys in the army out of the movie theyve taken its soul out with them the whole thing feels like a bland reciting of events with horrible pacing and zero emotional gravitas shame
Mar 8 2021,neutral,visually stunning in design and action it has its emotional impact moments but largely struggles from a shallow measure of depth several clever lines about the genderbending
Mar 7 2021,negative,ultimately mulan fell a bit flat for me there were some good moments like the visuals and acting but the lack of character development the overuse of exposition and the addition of some new elements that werent fully expanded upon weakened the film in my perspective
Mar 6 2021,negative,an absolute failure of a movie no parts work either individually or when taken as a whole   their attempts to make a wuxia move are brought down by too tight camera angles and too fast editing   their attempts to make an adventure movie are brought down by a script to generic that i was saying the characters lines minutes in advance   and their attempts to call back to the original much better disney mulan are brought down by the fact that they only bring back one song that they repeat endlessly   its a terrible movie dont watch it
Mar 4 2021,positive,it was a great story with a strong woman character
Mar 3 2021,negative,it has random and repeated mentions of honor your family  also the dramatic zoomins were unnecessary too  i literally created a rotten tomatoes account for the first time just to leave a one star review for this movie
Mar 2 2021,negative,oh no oh god no they couldnt even keep their mythology straight let alone time period the green screens were so obvious i couldnt even focus on the movie and the acting sometimes was just atrocious the actors seemed like they didnt even want to be there     this more modern adaption of the 1998 film is somehow worse at showing the blatant sexism at the time because during the silk road dynasty women wouldve needed to deform their bodies to be seen as normal    this adaptation also added something new qi which makes the viewers need to stretch their imagination to the limit to accept that this is a good decision for the plot especially when they mention shadow warriors    i could gripe about this movie all day because i love the original but hey at least they got mulans surname right this time
Mar 2 2021,positive,enjoyable  the most unlikely people believe in her and i found that very satisfying
Mar 2 2021,negative,mulan is the latest disney live action cashgrab and this really gives everyone who loved the classic a biiiiiiiiig fuuuuck yoooooou to them this film is such a very disappointing disaster with tons of bland acting lack of interest repetitive sequences weve seen before but this time it has witches woooooooow this wasnt in the film at all but fuck it were disney god damn it
Mar 1 2021,negative,i knew from the very first scene that it was going to be bad the movie budget leaves no excuse for such poor quality editing
Mar 1 2021,negative,throughout the disney renascence this movie by far is a big flop   it really underestimates the old mulan and how amazing it really was  by taking out most childhood characters and replacing it with fantasy creates a big black hole in disneys  community within remakes
Feb 26 2021,positive,a beautiful film i am a huge fan of the original mulan i thought this was a lovely attempt at the true story and they captured the heart beauty and charms of ancient chinese culture forget the haters its entertainment not politics 
Feb 25 2021,neutral,visually stunning to the point where it deserves to be remembered for it but mediocre acting and writing for the lead characters keep mulan from achieving its expectations even if it were an original action epic
Feb 24 2021,positive,i mean i would have like to see mushu the love scenes and the funny parts from the original movie but to be honest i thought it was a great action movie followed the story line overall i thought it was great im hoping for a sequel
Feb 23 2021,positive,if i were chinese i would probably be able to tell you if this version of mulan missed the mark somehow my reading has led me to believe that disneys liveaction version has indeed missed the mark
Feb 23 2021,negative,disneys take on a live action mulan is a poorly written misdirected bore no amount of dressed up ancient chinese visuals can cover this waste of talented actors mediocre martial arts choreography and shallow shot at a mythologically rich medieval fantasy    the script is rather stiff and charmless creating a cast of wooden characters that have no chemistry with each other this sets an unsuccessful tone for a wondrous fantasy epic yet somehow it works even less as a solemn war film the drama is much too superficial and the plot is absolute nonsense  they couldve done a lot to make this film work with the same ideas to stay apart from the animation but the whole project is a strong case of bad execution everything feels poorly sequenced and has no sensible flow as a result the mythology and magic is transparent the battles are mundane and the character themes rarely resonate    a huge missed opportunity for the asian community and for disney to prove that they can create a live action film without attempting to replicate their animated counterparts
Feb 21 2021,negative,the liveaction reimagining of the famous animated mulan film by disney is a successful display of artistry with its punchy colors amazing visuals along absolutely dreadful writing and uninspiring characters that pale in comparison to the original animated film    there is no hiding it the film suffers drastically from the unnecessary rewriting of the original disney story and as a result the film is a total departure from its original source in fact its so far off that if someone had told me that this was a low budget knockoff liveaction remake by a random studio i would believe himher    the story of mulan centers on her struggle to become a strong soldier in contradiction to the stereotype of women being too weak and frail for military work her difficulties and eventual success are inspirational components that communicate the message if you work hard and never give up anything is possible her identity as a regular weak woman in the very beginning resonates with viewers and is the main reason why mulan is so beloved in the animated film    but for whatever reason mulan in the remake is instead given this mysterious qi magic power that only a select few people get to possess to add to it mulans unnatural qi power was given to her from birth instead of through any sort of hard work or tribulation this very simple narrative transforms mulan from a regular relatable woman into a distant superhero destined to succeed from the very day she was conceived in the end the message of hard worksuccess from the original animated feature reduces into the brutally unrelatable message of if you are born lucky you will easily beat everyone else    in conclusion playing with the essence of a story is a recipe for failure and there is no better example than 2020s mulan no amount of beautiful artistry and colors can save a broken story disney has made a massive mistake and if this type of writing is to continue i can confidently say that there is no hope left for the future of liveaction disney remakes
Feb 20 2021,positive,so i finally got around to watching mulan and it wasnt actually too bad     in a lot of ways its quite different to the original animated version especially with the lack of songs throughout the movie and also the lack of mushu which in the case of this reinvention of the classic version of mulan hes been replaced with a phoenix    but overall i enjoyed it and its not actually a bad movie in comparison to its original animated predecessor     id give mulan a solid 35 out of 5   yifei liu gave a great performance as the title character also 
Feb 20 2021,negative,to fit in with men women need to be madly gifted seriously nice one disney
Feb 20 2021,positive,i enjoyed watching this female action pack movie its not like the original cartoon mulan take it for what it is the scenery was beautiful and the fighting scenes were well choreographed theres a bit of romance tease which i enjoyed the overall movie reminded me of the old kung fu movies that i watch when i was younger if you want to see a beautiful and elegant woman warrior who is bad ass sword fighting then check out this film 
Feb 20 2021,positive,it was a great movie and i thoroughly enjoyed it one of the best movies ive seen in a while
Feb 20 2021,negative,first the good  they brought back the original mulan ming to play another role i thought that was a great thing to do and thats the end of the good section    now the bad  lets just go ahead and start with the really bad genocide disney supports the genocide of the uyghur people in china in the credits of this movie this isnt just bad its evil if im being honestly for this reason alone i didnt want to watch the movie but i saw it anyway because my wife pulled it up on d    aside from the looming shadow of genocide looming over the movie it was completely devoid of any joy or character development in the original movie mulan is great because she works harder than anybody else and uses her creative intelligence to solve big problems in the live action she wins because girl power she was born with magical abilities that just make her awesome so she can just do everything the best without really having to try or learn anything or overcome any real challenges it was terrible story telling that fell completely flat there was never any tension or doubt that she was just going to be even more awesome and win because  of course shell win girl power    dont get me wrong i have no problem with female characters i have quite a few favorites that are female favorite scifi character ripley from alien favorite distopian character katness from the hunger games favorite justice leaguer wonder woman favorite democratic politician tulsi gabbard favorite politician from texas kathy glass i dont want to list them all here but the majority of my favorite singers are female long story short i love women and i want to see them portrayed well in stories this movie didnt do that at all it was just bad
Feb 19 2021,negative,just didnt hold up to the original  everything seemed forced
Feb 18 2021,negative,terrible movie sole focus was based on gender main villain sacrificed her life because they had the same sex parts compelling story no had plenty of potential though mulan coulda just been a badass chisensitive chick but disney went the low brow route instead
Feb 17 2021,neutral,the stunning visuals and the alright story are a real selling point its the ethics behind the scenes that deter the movie from being great
Feb 16 2021,negative,it was really disappointing and didnt seem like mulan at all
Feb 16 2021,neutral,at times its pleasant to look at yet this liveaction adaptation suffers from a lack of heart
Feb 16 2021,positive,absolutely exceptional cant wait for the sequel
Feb 15 2021,negative,this is one of the worst movies ive ever seen they completely destroyed the point of her story which is that she is a sting regular woman who works hard to save her country they took that whole message away
Feb 15 2021,positive,i was prepared for a disney movie and for everything to be a little too much but the movie actually had some decent subtleties and was quite enjoyable  full disclosure i do enjoy the eastern movies with the moral themes of honour tradition bravery etc and hopping across rooftops doesnt hurt  mulan had many of the strong qualities of a good martial arts type movie and it was visually quite impressive  characters were decent after the first 10 minutes the pace was good and the tone of the movie worked as i mentioned it wasnt too campy or too over the top  more about mulans performance and acceptance than spectacular fight scenes but it all works
Feb 15 2021,negative,no be a man song missing classic moment like when mulan climbs the pillar to reach the arrow does not stay true to the original at all and actually makes it worse this is unlike the live action versions of aladdinlion king where through their ups and downs they mostly stay true to the original story
Feb 15 2021,positive,the movie was a more grown up version of mulan loved the message of loyal brave and true as well as dedication to family it told the story of sacrifice for family while being true to self great movie wish disney would do a black princess with heart and honor but no frogs
Feb 15 2021,positive,definitely inferior to the 1998 animated movie but it was a little better than i thought it was going to be the storyline could have used some enhancements first and only viewing  12282020
Feb 15 2021,positive,i really enjoyed this version of mulan  of course i still miss mushu and the songs but the story of woman empowerment in a man dominated role was very good and the action scenes more than made up for some of the losses   the changes made were good for this story  i definitely plan to watch it again
Feb 14 2021,positive,i expected more from this somehow it felt like a summary of events more than a piece that dove deep into the character elements it was still pretty good but didnt meet my expectations
Feb 14 2021,negative,visually stunning butalmost every scene looked cut off like there was more to it there was no heart here the points the film was trying to make were both in your face and falling flat it was hollow shallow trite why the hell did she have her hair down i put my hair up to do the dishes oh yes shes a female warrior now so she needs to look prettier ugh i also miss mushu
Feb 14 2021,negative,the cartoon was a better story the story is silly
Feb 13 2021,negative,so stale and boring also the actress was really really bad even if it was less legitimately chinese the original disney version was vastly superior and much more fun not only for kids but also adults
Jan 27 2021,negative,we were so eager to see this movie they really messed up the magic of the orignal movie made it serious and kids didnt like it makes the movie pointless
Jan 14 2021,negative,i liked the action in this movie but i hated everything else
Jan 14 2021,positive,pretty good movie id say
Jan 2 2021,negative,super cheesy and ridiculous movie which takes itself too seriously the story is just plain bad and the mulan character and story is completely different from the original its obviously disney high budget production with beautiful cinematography sets costumes but more often then not you will be groaning and laughing at the ridiculous moments and bad dialogue
Dec 31 2020,negative,insensitive the fact they filmed this movie so close to an active war ground is disgusting it didnt have any of the songs the original did or the dragon and the characters are way different to the cartoon its pretty much just about mulan and some evil bird lady
Dec 31 2020,positive,to be fair here i am not a disney fan at all probably the reason i realy liked the movie because it does not feel like a disney movie at all here the story is slightly changed from the original to realy ground it in this lower fantasy reality but the movie spoke to me the acting was great the action exciting and the story even though its based on the original still quit engaging overall i recommend this movie but i get that hardcore disney fans will probably be let down here
Dec 31 2020,positive,the movie was terrific and the overall retelling was very well done memorable characters such as mushu and li shang were not in the movie but great new characters were there the action was good but not scary the falcon lady and climbing walls scenes were a little weird but it was still cool definitely recommend watching
Dec 30 2020,negative,i had enough i tried to tell myself that it is not bad but i cant
Dec 30 2020,negative,as a native chinese watching this movie i give the plot a pass for being disney and for kids but the whole movie is pretty racist and unrealistic in its plot while deviating from the original real mulan story so its basically a racist western media praised movie that has a plot only explainable by western culture and expectations  requirement of disney magic yet still coming off pretty unrealistic    i mean the allpowerful witch who literally could have assassinated spoiler at the beginning of the movie and literally at any moment in the movie that she wanted to does not the allpowerful witch who did not have to spoiler to save mulan in her weakest form of spoiler chooses to spoiler in order to stop spoiler she could easily have stopped with her magic not to mention the army experience everything is literally lined up on a silver platter for mulan basically made her into someone who never earned her recognition or fame but simply handed it utterly racist hollywood choose to character assassinate a famous chinese heroine this way and at the same time make racist conjecture about chinese culture    if they bothered to do some research there are many reasons why chinese mothers are traditionally power figures in the family not the men yet western people want to feel better about their own sexist past that they want to bash down chinese culture to feel superior its only fooling the blind and average iq
Dec 30 2020,negative,why does this exist  no seriously  it contributes nothing the movie landscape that hasnt been done better already  including by disney themselves
Dec 29 2020,positive,the story is disneys version of hua mulan so it is simplified and very pg very different from the animated version for sure  more action drama and no romance which is very much a disney animation conceit casting was a pleasant surprise many alist asian actors signed up for the generous house of mouse paycheck    of course the photography and production were very high but when contrasted against similar chinese period war dramas no real added value can really be noticed disney received value for its money but a liveaction budget of this scale is way over the top much of it likely due to filming in new zealand instead of china alone although likely there would have been more restrictions on a chinese production    perhaps one stereotypical criticism i have is that because the language is in english the actors speak in accented english it not being their native language for any of them i dont know if mandarin or cantonese is offered on the dvdbluray but it would be more authentic to hear the script in chinese    overall a good effort
Dec 29 2020,positive,cinematography is amazing in this movie  it really captures the beauty of china not the cities but the land of china  the culture i do believe is represented well by the amazing visuals  plot is thinner than the cartoon in general because bringing animated characters to life is hard if they are not animated as actors and the actors while doing everything in their power to play the parts felt like they struggled to find home  i think the plot was there but weaker but i never felt fully connected to the characters  it needed something more to connect us that was missing  but oh the gorgeous visualsworth the price of admission just on the visuals alone
Dec 29 2020,negative,never been more disappointed in a movie they had a chance to make something great and instead made garbage
Dec 29 2020,positive,beautiful and memorable
Dec 29 2020,negative,all of the messages from not only the original ballad of mulan but also the 90s animated film are absolutely gone mulan is born as a prodigal fighter with special abilities that give her an edge rather than working hard for the skills she obtains to defeat the villains and save the emperor instead of giving the message that the male rabbit and the female rabbit look the same while running the film is saying that the female rabbit is only the same when she has magic powers it fails to deliver the empowering message that the 1990s adaptation gave to young girls everywhere
Dec 29 2020,neutral,this is the weakest liveaction remake of the disney animated films that i have seen although it does have strengths first among these is the visuals this is a beautiful film with stunning landscapes thrilling action sequences and vibrant costuming the cast is good as well liu yifei does a solid job but is not as compelling as id hoped culturally this movie does a better job than the animated original to be both genuine and respectful but at other times it slips back into a cringeinducing us orientalist gaze    the pacing also felt off in this film with strangely dissonant cuts between certain scenes at times it felt like the movie was not cohesive the fantasy in fact the entire addition of the witch was halfhearted and not well integrated into the story the movie seemed to be trying to do too many things at once and achieve too much at once while gong lis witch character was important thematically the movie did not devote enough attention to her and as a result her presence lacked the emotional satisfaction or investment to really be worthwhile similarly mulan and honghuis connection felt a little unearned    overall the visuals are not enough in my opinion to make this a priority watch probably leave it near the bottom of your watchlist and prioritise other films first
Dec 29 2020,negative,this movie is trying extremely hard to be something it is not and that is probably the most ironic thing about this movie  not going to lie but i got bored watching this movie the character felt like a mary sue which is weird because the animated version was anything but  the animated version worked hard to get where they were at the end  they used brain over brawn and wit to seize the day this one lacks any nuance and it is a shame  all the fun was sucked out of it and the changes made hindered the movie  the reliability of the core story goes out the window 5 minutes in  i would recommend the animated movie 9 times over to whatever this movie was  plus the claims of filming in a less than desirable local in china are hard to ignore
Dec 29 2020,negative,a word of warning for those who seek to relive a cherished moment of your childhood  at all costs stay away from this no matter how much you love donnie yen
Dec 29 2020,negative,it was a monotone movie it lacked any extraordinary scenes it did not have the same spirit or cinematic presence as the original
Dec 29 2020,positive,mulan is a warrior and a legend
Dec 29 2020,negative,so bad so cringworthy bad camerawork bad action scenes bad acting bad script
Dec 29 2020,negative,it was homophobic  racist transphobicand ageist  the most disgusting and offense thing to asians watch taylor swift miss americana instead 
Dec 28 2020,negative,is disney seriously running out of creating new and exciting content that they can only redo old animations had it not been 2020 and the year of covid19 this movie might have done so much better and had it not been filmed near a concentration camp it might have gotten a higher mark at least for its attempt to inject some new parts to an otherwise classic movie that was already great and should have never been altered in any way or form
Dec 28 2020,negative,wow  thatsucked
Dec 24 2020,negative,i wanted to revisit one of my classic childhood favourites mulan no longer started out as a clumsy weak girl so she had no struggle instead she was a toxic child who didnt care about destroying others property showing respect to others and had abnormal powers or flight agility and destruction all the key disney lessons for children about hard work initiative determination and inventiveness were gone it became a movie focused on political issues like feminism rather than the original lesson intended for children that anyone can succeed with hardwork
Dec 16 2020,negative,they took all the magic and fun out of the movie and ruined it imagine them trying to do a realistic aladdin without genie
Dec 16 2020,negative,issues with political views sad that disney has chosen profits over values
Dec 16 2020,positive,overall not such a bad remake but there is a small big minus the absence of mushu
Dec 15 2020,positive,one of the five best movies i have ever watched please try to watch it and make your own judgement i bet you wouldnt be disappointed dont be influenced by those people who tried hard to hurt this movies rating and reputation
Dec 14 2020,negative,if it was possible to give less than half a star i would to be honest i thought casting and the display of feminism was great but that was significantly overshadowed by the fact that producers who decided to change the plot of this entire movie unlike the original this mulan had preexisting trainingabilitiesskills prior to her arriving to the camp they should have stuck to the original where the original mulan used her intelligence to overcome the obstacles dont even get me started with the character changes that we beloved dishonor to the producers and their cow
Dec 12 2020,neutral,mulan 2019 has some decent visual and technical qualities but it sadly does not make this movie good everything that is new in this version is inferior to the original as the chi aspect lowered my enjoyment of the story giving mulan the chosen one treatment instead of the broad hard worker i also dislike some of the action it looks like the frame rates off for some shots or that they eliminated motionblur making some shots look unfluid the score and lighting are cool and creative so at the end of the day its a mixed bag so 510 could have had better fleshed out ideas and themes
Dec 12 2020,positive,not very comparable to the original but its worse and better for its own reasons its an enjoyable watch and i would recommend
Dec 10 2020,positive,this film is create when it comes to the visual look of costumes and visual look however the story is not executed as well as the 1998 animated film i never felt the emotional moments as strong as i should have i did not laugh as much but also it does not capture the heart felt emotional moments like the animated film did i did not appreciate that this film altered the spirits with a witch mushu dragon for a phoenix or the over the top fantasy acrobatics and martial arts that did not hit as well this film also did not hit the same emotional and dramatic emotional tensions that the 1998 film hit with the consequences to their actions the 1998 film clearly showed the significance of family honor dishonor death family consequences for their actions this live action film fewer main characters hit the emotional consequences this film has the emperor acting out more doing things i could not see from an emperor such as get into armor i did feel like the training scene did not provide enough to show how difficult training was compared to the animated film however this film does show more time in training giving the impression more time was spent on training vs the animated film from 1998 i also got the impression in this film that training was incomplete where as in the animated film i felt like training was nearly complete i was not a big fan of the villains in this film i did not find them as scary as the animated film one thing that was great about this film was that it expanded the world of china by showing a much larger area of china further west compared to the 1998 film by showing what was going on in areas in the silk road i did find the big battle with the huns rather disappointing in this film compared to the 1998 animated film the 1998 film showed a much more interesting environment and tougher odds with a much larger army going up a small army in a snowy mountains where as in this film it felt rather small and less interesting taking place in a flat area surrounded by mountains it just did not show as tough of a struggle compared to the animated film and show how significant the battle was
Dec 6 2020,negative,horrible cgi effects beautiful cinematography and its better to use japanese language instead english words
Dec 6 2020,negative,dont bother with this one watch the animated version its 100x better 
Dec 5 2020,negative,this version is mid and an insult to the original movie
Nov 30 2020,positive,although it could have told its classic story with greater depth but at least mulan had a great story great characters great battle scenes and great special effects overall the movie was fine
Nov 30 2020,neutral,just the movie you could watch to pass time   no other special thing that anyone could take out of it   seemed far way from reality
Nov 28 2020,negative,hard work pfftttt magic a more realistic movie with bird witches also stellar editing i really like the induced motion sickness
Nov 28 2020,positive,it was pretty enjoyable i didnt have a problem with this movie with the exception of being a little slow but its exciting it was a beautiful remake to watch 
Nov 28 2020,positive,the characters in the movie seemed to lack depth or strong emotion there wasnt the comedy music mushu the prince love interest or the big running away scene with her cutting  her hair the original cartoon version characters had better emotionacting skills the live action movie of mulan was okay but the characters shouldve had more depthemotiondevelopment they seemed stiff a bit
Nov 27 2020,positive,the live action remake of mulan really surprised me and it ended up being absolutely better than i thought itd be    there is no mushu no shang or no singing but its still the same story its just a more realistic grounded in reality approach    455
Nov 26 2020,neutral,the movie tried to be mature and new but the magic and charm is gone from the original sometimes while watching this movie i was confused cause they added unnecessary plot points and changes that just made it confusing and weird i believe the original is a better telling
Nov 26 2020,neutral,another live action remake from disney and by now the remakes are either a hit or miss  disneys mulan has a brilliant story but it doesnt use it to its full advantage  the cast itself at least some of it does a pretty good job in the story  liu yifei does a pretty good job as the female warrior disguising as a man in the chinese army and the rest of the cast is mostly    forgettable  mulans father hua zhou did a very good job in his role and i guess that i accepted the rest of the cast  as with most of the live action films coming from disney the design is  very well done  the most bugging part of the film is that its unrealistic to its own story  disney forgets that they are working with humans instead of superhumans too much marvel maybe and decides that mulan can kick arrows at everyone else and that the huns are great at running up and down walls  the villain defeat has got to be at least one of the dumbest yet  in the next remake remember who youre dealing with  humans or superhumans
Nov 25 2020,negative,spoilers  i didnt like the movie felt like a lot of charm from the original was just ignored and made the movie lacking    in the original they showed her strong feelings to make her family proud that she prayed for the gods she even wrote on her arm on what to say in for the matchmaking which made the matchmaker get the ink on her fingers and draw a mustache on herself which i can understand its humiliated for the matchmaker but this one she tried to kill a dangerous spider and destroyed some porcelain   in the original you respected mulan for her character development when she became stronger and her determination but on the movie she already have the skills   im fine if they dont want to have shang a leader romance but they should just remove the romance completely cause it really felt unnecessary   in the original they built up a friendship with the three guys chienpo yao and ling which made them first join mulan after she got revealed and she used some features she learnt from her study on the matchmaking but this movie they got convinced straight away you dishonor us dont show up again okay lead the way    why is there a witch felt like her only purpose was just to tell mulan where the bad guy is    mulan the original is one of my favorite movies so thats why i got sad that the charm i knew it as was completely gone in the movie     it gets a full star cause it had nice scenery and the actors was asian instead of american
Nov 25 2020,negative,glad i didnt pay for it because that would be on par with buying 2 hours of mao yelling at you about how great communism is at gun point
Nov 22 2020,negative,wow what a disappointment have a chainsaw murdering activist butcher a beloved animated classic that is what it seemed like to me leaves a sour taste in my mouth for the future of disney
Nov 22 2020,negative,it took out almost everything good from the first movie and i felt like i was having a stroke while watching the action scenes
Nov 22 2020,negative,milan 2020 was absolutely the worst disney live action remake ive seen
Nov 22 2020,negative,with a ridiculous story and a boring protagonist mulan 2020 will be forgotten for the simple fact of wanting to forget her    no dont even think about singing remember me for this
Nov 22 2020,positive,this isnt a remake of the animated movie but a new telling of the ancient chinese story of mulan unlike the cartoon this version is incredibly respectful of chinese culture and history its masterfully written skillfully directed beautifully shot and the acting is outstanding
Nov 22 2020,positive,mulan is the best disney live action adaptation by far the scenery is great it is intense and it has some great themes overall i really enjoyed this take on the story highly recommend
Nov 22 2020,positive,was definitely different from the cartoon but was really good it was more of a drama than the original movie so it seemed more for older audiences than just for kids
Nov 22 2020,negative,okaylets start from the very begeningso mulan is a girl and she has super powers to begin withwhen she grows up and gets olderher father must fight for chinaso we know that she goes and becomes a soilderbutduring her trainingshe magicly loeses her powers somehowlater on in the movieshe relizes her powerswtflike disney was a master at the mulan i watched back when i was  10they made a good plotlikeable charactersfunny scencesi like the ill make a men out of you scequncebut herewe see nothing but mulan has superpowersjoins army to save her fatherfightskills the main artagonist frm the first moviebut this dude now isnt even the main artagonist anymoreanywaysshe kills the duderegains powers somewhere along the linefights bird like sorcerer then bamthats itwell there is still the endingbut i just summerized the main thingthe whole magic and sidechracters just mess up the movieand if there something ive learned from thomass 2021 reboot and this rebootits that reboots are rare to turn out goodso to anyone reading thislisten to my advicedot watch the fucking moviei my just be likearound a teenagerbut im not stupid to knowthat this movie is downright crapeveryone who gave this a five star review are either botsor they didnt know what they where seeingi would tell you how i could fix itbut my fingers hurt from typing so ill some day post it on facebook or somethingim donebye
Nov 21 2020,positive,perfect movie great values and appreciation to women role in society i would see it again many times
Nov 21 2020,negative,muddled metaphors poor acting performances confused action it slogs through the plot with no heed towards character motivation its just mindlessly moving through a checklist of events pulled from the original while missing all emotional beats
Nov 20 2020,negative,just awful in any aspect no memorable character horrible dialogue they tried to make the movie more mature by taking mushu and the cricket of the movie and somehow failing it and the reason cant be making a movie more realistic so mushu wouldnt fit cause they have a freaking phoenix that does nothing and a witch with super powers  how the animated movie tried to portray mulan was although she wasnt as physically stronger than the man she was smarter like on the arrow in the pole scene and had character progress something that in this movie has none she somehow is master acrobatic and martial artist since child  there are so many more flaws but i will leave at that
Nov 20 2020,negative,it wasnt very good if you loved the original mulan dont bother watching this movie the editing and cinematography wasnt up to par and the characters even the main character herself felt very bland to me
Nov 20 2020,neutral,theres a lot of beauty with a lack luster story and an agenda thats off even for disney 
Nov 19 2020,positive,i think mulan liveaction is bit of different from the animated film my papa said qi for some chinese people is some of energy that flowing inside on our body phoenix is a symbol of beauty and pure heart of woman while dragon is a symbol of power truth kindness and luck i think why chinese critics and audience dont like the liveaction of this movie is from the characters their culture and qi maybe my papa think this movie is such a different culture and qi for every inside of us
Nov 19 2020,positive,my husband and i really enjoyed the story acting costumemakeup and visuals i am surprised at the low score from some as we would highly recommend the movie loyalty honor and truth as well as devotion to family are values we dont often see in movies nowadays
Nov 18 2020,negative,now no disney remake is good but this one just takes it to a different level    it lacks any of the good characters that made the original stand out and instead of making it a seemingly boring chinese war story which this movie is    long story short this movie is an incredibly bland and uninteresting remake which deviates from the original to a disrespectful degree
Nov 18 2020,negative,bad sorry had high expectations for the movie but basic logic is not respected in the movie really sad   how can mulan get behind the rohansmongols  she is in a valley they are above her   the log scene physics only apply when both of them are standing on the log  she just walks in woman attire and tries to kill herself we are in ancient china here not 2020
Nov 17 2020,negative,garbage movie that takes the powerful message that the original movie had and trashes it also there are more plot holes in this movie than swiss cheese
Nov 17 2020,negative,the movie got it all wrong the culture misappropriation is so server that it made black mermaid looks just fine
Nov 17 2020,negative,this movie was terrible the costumes look fake and cheap the actors are bland very bad casting the plot is completely different to the original the stunts look fake and are so obviously technologically enhanced the scenery was nothing special and everything was clearly done with a green screen it is a shame to call this movie mulan it is nothing like the original and was poorly done in all ways i would not recommend this movie to anyone and would encourage everyone not to waste their time and money watching a movie that ruins a once great story
Nov 17 2020,positive,recently i watched the movie mulan i recommend this movie for people who like action movies  the hunn invaded the tang dynasty so hwa mulans dad got to participate in the war however mulans dad was old and was not suitable for a soldier for a war so mulan pretends as a man and participates in the war instead of her father as hwa jun and the finally met the leader team of the hunn   when everybody was struggling with fighting the hunn mulan fired a cannon to the mountain the mountain covered in ice started to fall and the hunn had to run away but they eventuallygot buried in the snow  however the fact that mulan was a girl was discovered and mulan got exiled from the military  one day mulan saw the hunn go to zhang an the capital of tang so mulan went to zhang an and tried to tell the soldiers that the hunn was coming but nobody listened to poor mulan  so the hunn got to easily come to zhang an and the emperor got captured mulan decided to save the emperor mulan got to fight with the leader of the hunn and eventually she won and became a great person who saved the emperor  my favorite part is when mulan decides to help the military although the military exiled her just because she was a girl she decided to help the military and the country who betrayed her
Nov 16 2020,positive,the live action version of mulan was great the movie had a cool story and was fun too watch if you are looking for a remake of the cartoon you may not like it its the only live action disney movie ive seen that completely did its own thing it created its own characters and stories and left out the music it was a really good movie but if you are watching it to see a remake of the cartoon your hopes will not be met people should stop rating movies based on their assumptions and take them for what they are the movie gets a zero rating for copying the cartoon but i thought it was refreshing to see something completely different we live in a day and age where everything is remade or copied if mulan was your favorite movie growing up this might not be for you if you like watching good movies check it out
Nov 16 2020,negative,theres clearly a lot of work put into this movie and while some aspects are incredible this movie just fell flat for me it feels like it completely missed the mark and really dont do a good job of showing a strong female character everything is handed to her simply because shes the best
Nov 16 2020,negative,mulan is a cheap shot of a movie the acting is adequate but lacking depth too many character and plot changes that it strays too far from the beloved original and the choice to cut all the songs and humor created a dull film for viewers i was not impressed
Nov 16 2020,negative,a total crap heap there is literally no story line dont even know who the characters are at the end of the movie another blatant movie ruined by attempts to push political messages a disgrace compared to the original
Nov 16 2020,negative,wow what an awful movie looking over the fact of the movie was filmed near some xinjiang concentration camps and yifei liu supporting the hong kong police during the hong kong protests this movie is a boring awful garbagefire disney remake
Nov 16 2020,negative,this movie is like generic brand pizza its not good but its not bad its still edible i did my best to not mirror this movie the original masterpiece but i was still left sitting there playing sudoku checking social media and texting on my phone while watching the movie you wont miss much disney magic wasnt there at all as if the director has never seen a disney movie or even experienced magic kingdom in disney world orlando i wasnt moved or swayed by anything the only thing that did catch my eye was seeing jet li and donnie yen on screen much respects to those two gentlemen when it came to editing there were no smooth transitions at all as if they found pieces from a different puzzle that just so happen to fit the puzzle they were working on movie will be easily forgettable the moment im about to open up tinder and easily swipe left on someone that looks like shan yu but its a female mind you im no catch myself i can pass by as a crikee at least theres my review now time to find woman with a low selfesteem and who just so happens to be adventurous on dating the likes of me
Nov 16 2020,positive,just got done watching this film for the second time and for the second time watching it i liked it even morevery underrated movie which i really like very muchif you never seen it before worth the watch
Nov 15 2020,positive,wow what a great movie really enjoyed it great acting great story we should have this much honor 
Nov 15 2020,positive,i struggle with this movie and i want to give it a higher rating but knowing the time and money spent on it i have to really factor that into the assessment on the one hand it had amazing cinematography great costumes and the rich depiction of chinese culture we can all admire and indulge the action and story line was there but something was missing i wanted a 1010 but the connection to mulan was lacking sadly i felt more connected to the animated mulan with a few tweaks this could have been one of greats it doesnt replace the original mulan for me but still a great live action adaptation with a few misgivings
Nov 14 2020,negative,the actress who played mulan is terrible and had no acting skill also do some research about chinese history and culture before filming a movie everything about chinese culture in this movie is absolutely wrong including all the clothings and architectures 
Nov 14 2020,negative,the ancient chinese visuals and landscapes were beautiful the acting plot and dialogue was terrible overall a very boring movie the best part was donny yen showing off his sword skills to the bratty kids
Nov 14 2020,positive,5 out of 5 stars mulan is a fantasy adventure film that has a serious approach to the disney animated movie while staying similiar to the story that made the original lovable the plot following mulan yifei liu who is destined by her mother that she needs to meet a man and wed when a war is coming which the emperor enlists one son from every family mulan and her sister being the only siblings her father prepares to join but with his aging slowing him down mulan takes the family sword and armor and joins the army to face against a witch army who is plotting to take over the emperor similiar plot the film is a little serious compare to the original which was musical and had talking animals the film does lack the musical set pieces and talking animals but it does pay some homage to those characters that may or may not disappoint hard core fans the cinematography is beautifully done capturing the set pieces and settings the music score is great the action sequences are exciting and well done a couple of exciting battle sequences that is well choreographed with the fighting and camera work the cast ensemble is great yifei liu did a great job as playing mulan overall it is a great film with slight differences but similar story exciting action and visuals
Nov 13 2020,positive,great cinematography great acting great story great places bravo
Nov 13 2020,positive,the movie was so much better than the cartoon i love how they used the phoenix
Nov 12 2020,negative,so far the fight scenes were ok but the main problem with the movie was it kind of felt insulting because in the first mulan movie it was about overcoming barriers and prove that if you try hard enough you can accomplish anything this movie is utter trash it doesnt have the overcoming obstacles she can do everything because magic so yeah not like the original mulan and i dont recommend it
Nov 12 2020,positive,wonderful movie i enjoyed watching the transformation of this beloved chinese animated story to the big screen and though it was well done with a great cast too hoping there is a sequel
Nov 12 2020,positive,audiences looking for a mulan film in the image of the original cartoon movie will be sorely dissatisfied however this more serious and mature story makes for a good movie on its own the cinematography is great and the overall plot is mostly the same the film might be a great watch but it does have its flaws for example the acting i can respect that disney wanted to make the film more authentic with its casting choices but the lack of english skills was a bit distracting and gave the appearance of bad acting
Nov 11 2020,neutral,the lead actor was good as mulan but the movie had too many cheesy moments and plot elements including the overplayed phoenix that looked like a fancy kite  also it was hard to believe that the lead actor could have been taken as a male in the first half of the movie  she looked too much like well a female even with her hair up
Nov 11 2020,negative,a fine disappointment    niki caros live action mulan 2020 is nowhere near as good as the phenomenal disney animated original mulan 1998 all the humor and music is gone including mushu replaced with melodramatic war drama and bland action choreography that never feels gritty harry gregsonwilliams score is so forgettable instead of the iconic mulan songs so thats disappointing to say the least    caro films a few neat sword fights and spear combat but theres no blood or convincing fights that feel genuine and not just stunt people going through the motions caros direction is pretty basic and unimaginative she rips all the charm out of disneys classic for a boring 115 minutes david coulson could have edited this down to a tighter gripping pace i found this mulan to be a shallow cash grab from the increasingly cynical disney desperate for their next dollar    rick jaffa amanda silver lauren hynek and elizabeth martins writing is terrible they take all the personality out of mulan opting for generic action cliches and chinese communist propaganda theres no asian heroine left instead theres chi magic powers like the force from star wars and unrealistic action in a poor attempt at being different joe howes cgi is awful for the birds especially     id praise mandy walkers cinematography but the fights are shot in incoherent angles and cuts walkers wide shots are okay but everything looks too saturated the chinese countryside is entirely an ugly yellow or orange grant majors production design looks like a cheap play or a television show too bad disney filmed this next to a chinese concentration camp anne kuljians set decoration looks bland if colorful bina daigelers costumes are colorful with vibrant reds or deep blacks but everyone does look too similar i dont know why they needed 8 makeup artists as everyone has too much makeup that makes each actor look fake when its just them    i admit that liu yifei is the highlight as hua mulan shes quite lovely and charming but a bit cold at times her sword fighting and bamboo stick combat is fun but she shines during some of the more dramatic moments i found her easily the only likable part of mulan i wish niki caro got an even more charismatic performance out of liu yifei because she can clearly act i hate that liu yifei chooses to side with chinas communist suppression of hong kongs protests for democracy as well its repulsive that shes said what she did just for acting roles in china i wonder how long her fame and fortune will last    unfortunately everyone else phoned it in hard for mulan jet li sounds half asleep as the emperor tzi ma barely reaches emotional realism as mulans father hua zhou donnie yen looks bored as commander tung and gong li appears to barely emote or care considering they are all phenomenal alist talent i am certainly saddened to see them barely try for mulan     jason scott lee on the other hand tries too hard to be scary as the mongol warlord bori khan he never blinks to seem fearsome but it just looks weird his makeup and fights are pretty bad i like lee from his roles in dragon the bruce lee story and balls of fury so im upset they didnt give him anything to work with for cool lines or combat sequences    in short mulan 2020 is dull and disappointing coming from someone who adores the original i liked the lead actress but she doesnt save mulan from never feeling truly heroic
Nov 11 2020,neutral,its okay not great though they really strayed from the original mulan here this so called remake features a version of mulan who is already practically a ninja instead of a wellearned skilled warrior who overcame many obstacles with her wit not to mention that the bad guys now have a bunch of strange magic abilities which kinda ruin the whole atmosphere of a the movie also you wont see mushu making an appearance in this film its still watchable
Nov 10 2020,negative,too long boring and will not watch again
Nov 9 2020,negative,out of all the movies in the animated disney catalog i always felt mulan would benefit the most from a live action remake due to its timely tale of feminism   what a missed opportunity  this movie is one of the worst live action disney remakes  it even completely failed to capture the heart and scope of the original animated movie  a complete frame to frame translation like the lion king would have been better than what we got here the wooden acting across the board made all the characters feel superficial  the action in the movie was disappointing  in scale especially when you compare it to the animated film  the only bright spot in the film are the amazing sceneries and settings but other than that this movie is a huge downgrade from the original animated film
Nov 8 2020,negative,without a doubt this was the worst liveaction movie disney has ever made it has nothing of the magic of the original 1998 film no comedy the actors are not charismatic they have no romance and no emotion from beginning to end this film was a real disappointment
Nov 8 2020,negative,this movie was not what i thought it would be it to seemed more like a 90s movie not in a good way this is not anything like the original movie this is just not worth the money
Nov 6 2020,negative,some good special effects but it doesnt live up to the animated version of the movie theres also people with super powers that turn into beasts but they took out mushu the talking dragon that was a big part of the animated series they also took out all the comedy and light hearted fun from the animated movie and made this all about serving your country and obeying your parents action scenes werent great either you could clearly tell the actors were just pulled by wires
Nov 6 2020,negative,would give a zero star if there is such an option the worst actress terrible acting same potato face no expression throughout the whole movie a boring story about a young girl saving the empire with her superpower of chai   but the stunts and some fighting scenes were pretty good though
Nov 5 2020,negative,poor story characters locations use of special effects cast music and internal logic they had a lot of resources to pull from both ancient and modern along with a big budget for a realistic story of everyday people yet they somehow crushed all underestimates of what they could achieve i was looking forward to this movie for a very long time and it really disappointed me i wasnt looking for songs or magic i was looking for an inspirational every woman instead we got a jedi it was so sad 
Nov 4 2020,positive,i loved every minute of it it was a great telling of the fable
Nov 3 2020,negative,the story had too much in common to stand alone from the original cartoon and at the same time took most of the best elements out the characters were hard to feel anything for especially mulan who fell flat in my opinion also no mushu is a bust for me
Nov 3 2020,positive,thank you mulan let me more cherish my family
Nov 3 2020,positive,the very beginning of the movie is quite boring but it quickly starts to get so fun to watch the story is a little bit different but the vibes is much like the 2d mulan i highly recommend it
Nov 3 2020,negative,the action sequences has some of the worst editing ive ever seen  mulan is written to do anything she wants with no effort because she was born perfect  they regard this movie as being chinese accurate as possible when they thrown in a witch not chinese a bunch of western culture stringed into this chinese land just the right amount to make it dumb and they turned chi into a superpower  chi is somewhat a connection of life force throughout the world especially by nature meaning chi is to all its the equivalent of saying blood so saying blood is only for men and warriors and not for you mulan is the stupidest thing ive ever heard  this world is our world but superpowers exist thats not how worlds work when a world has an issue people come up with ways to live with it so how does a world with superpowers become out world    fails in editing characters culture and world building
Nov 2 2020,positive,a lame imitation of the animated classic woke poorly written film not the worst disney remake but most certainly not the best youre better off watching the original treats the audience as if they were stupid with its unnatural script and screenplay lacks authenticity too you really couldnt have done lines in mandarin 
Nov 2 2020,neutral,because of donnie yen this film can relate to watch
Nov 2 2020,negative,wheres mushu and cricket this long and frankly uninteresting remake of probably one of the all time greats has its essence removed the comedy is gone the characters names arent even the same and the defining features like the music are gone a real mess up for disney the only good part is that amazing scenery
Nov 2 2020,negative,this is really badly written mulan is a blank slate and the romantic interest is a piece of soap jet li and donnie yen do nothing and the best character is gong li but that means nothing in this a white man is not the person to write this niki caro really tries to save this crap but its a futile effort
Nov 1 2020,positive,its nothing like the original they got rid of all the magic and songs and personality it was ok the phoenix was beautiful
Nov 1 2020,negative,a complete and utter devastation to a classic either make new movies or accurately retell the one you already had but not this
Nov 1 2020,positive,if you want a talking dragon and music go to the original and watch it this movie has been so harshly judged and criticised because of people expecting a musicalthis is not classic disney this is a refreshing and a heartfelt moviein my opinion a must watch to summarise an great movie with a great story and not a boring moment great undertones throughout the movie about the sexism that is still well and alive today so many metaphors all combined in a great movie
Nov 1 2020,positive,please ignore the other reviews that have been written by people who are sad that the new mulan movie has no musical sequences or a talking dragon  this was a brilliant movie with a beautiful and strong message  it was entertaining a great story and carried really well its not the be compared to an animated version because this was a movie of its own    if you can watch a disney movie without the expectation of a musical sequence in every other scene and talking animals then this movie is fantastic however the negative reviews as im sure you can read for yourself are in the majority from people mad that this wasnt a sequence  sequence remake of the animated mulan and that it didnt have nice songs and funny talking animals
Nov 1 2020,negative,some decent visuals which are captivating with the bright colours but thats about all this movie has going for it complete failure in every other regard
Nov 1 2020,positive,i quite enjoyed it actually much more than i expected given all the negative press i am obviously not chinese so im not savvy on the finer points of cultural misrepresentation but its a movie not a documentary    also if you are familiar with the wuxia kind of movies this is modelled after the fantasy and wire work style fights are fine
Oct 31 2020,neutral,i dont know why i had such high expectations of this movie but i was disappointed i will soon forget it and never watch it again if it wasnt for the witch and mulan in her red outfit i wouldnt even give the 25 stars
Oct 31 2020,positive,cant deny the wonderful improvisation of disneys fav anim character on real live screen honestly i liked it and would certaintly consider it to be recommendable
Oct 31 2020,positive,disneys one of marvellous works no kidding it was definitely worth the time and attention such a beautiful story driven by pure ingenuity and decorated by true inspiriation of moral determination and dedication enjoyed it well
Oct 31 2020,negative,another disney animation classic ruined
Oct 30 2020,negative,this deserves more rotten tomatoes its so bad that this is my first rotten tomato review because the lack of rot is an insult no emotion no character development absolutely no sense of family and heart  everything that made the disney original feel so authentic and pure i could say more valid critiques too many others have already mentioned but im not about to do that i just want justice and to give this movie the rating it deserves a disgrace to women family and all of asia
Oct 29 2020,negative,the more i think about the movie the less i like it so aparently mushu was too unreal and fantasy thing to put in a more realistic version of mulan but magic and crazy flips in the air if they wanted to go for acrobatics at least they could have made it look realistic a person witch turning into birds and eagles is totally realistic and that phoenix thing flying around looking more like a paper kite when i first saw it flying in the air i swear i thought a kid was on the ground and holding it by a string at least mushu at some personality and funny moments its a disney movie whats so wrong about having legit funny moments    i was very disappointed that they practically rushed or didnt even show the scene where in the animation film she cuts her hair with the sword picks up her fathers armor and leaves in the middle of the night they just brushed it over its my favorite scene does it make her less woman just for cutting her hair and she just decides to reveal herself after fighting the witch maybe i didt get it maybe im stupid but i prefer how she is exposed in the animation after saving them in battle and gets hurt i think it causes more impact and also she doesnt become stronger for working out she already is stronger than anyone else just because of magic i didnt see her strugle enough  im sorry if i didnt get the movie or the female empowerment thing for me the animation gives a much stronger message regarding that and the line that her father says  the flower that blooms in adversity is the most rare and beautiful of all it means a lot to me personally
Oct 29 2020,positive,great movie great story great characters great battle scenes great special effects it was a real tearjerker towards the end i honestly believe it deserves 5 stars
Oct 29 2020,negative,the cartoon was so much better this remake was bland and the characters werent as interesting i feel that way with a lot of the new disney remakes seems that the focus is less on the storylines and more about pleasing everyones political beliefs but thats just a feeling and overall i think people should watch the old cartoon
Oct 28 2020,negative,horrible they screwed my childhood with this movie please delete it from the world where mouchu  mulan loved her trainer not a college mulan got injured in the war the eagle dont change that phenix was horrified idea
Oct 27 2020,negative,it makes no sense terrible story terrible combat scenes just some eye candy but visuals dont make up for everything this movie lacks
Oct 27 2020,positive,a fresh relevant take on the classic tale yifei liu you did mulan proud
Oct 26 2020,negative,formulaic movie displaying terrible representation of asian actors and chinese culture full of clichés poorly wired stunts and fight scenes full of obvious green screen the ensemble cast are great actors doing their best to perform  awful lines for the most part
Oct 26 2020,negative,horrible dont waste your time just watch the original no music no singing slow and boring acting horrible
Oct 26 2020,negative,mulan 1998 is an absolute inevitable invincible wonderful perfect winner  mulan rise of a warrior is even better    so what this terrible movie is saying   dad is wrong so do not follow to be heroic   mulan is born hero so not anyone can become hero   talented woman can not rule the kingdom only better to find somewhere she can be adopted   what made mulan heroine is her powerful qi not any patriotism or love what is the qi  mulan is one of the avengers with super power    only cg is what i can say not bad  plot is ridiculous actors are ordinary just actresses are great so strange way to show off woman up huh  so frustrated they ruined nice material
Oct 25 2020,negative,great visually but too obsessed with sticking to the original disney animated film the story was not well developed the screen play was cringey and mulan as a person was far too bland
Oct 25 2020,negative,very boring remake of the original it lost all the heart that make the animation great the staging and cgi feels cheap disney is using our nostalgia as a cash grab watch if you subscribe to disney plus it is free you are stuck at home due to lockdown and you have watched everything else
Oct 25 2020,negative,everything except the plotscript was great the makeup visual effects actors but the lines just didnt make it for me i get that the producers wanted to make a new better mulan but it was just so bland because there were only a handful of comedic reliefs while the original mulan had tons of comedic reliefs
Oct 25 2020,positive,mulan is not even close to the original but it at least tries to be some what original the action is amazing and is very cringe and times mulan is a solid live action remake
Oct 24 2020,positive,the director and yifei have made mulan a stunningly beautiful film with dazzling colors and rich details
Oct 24 2020,positive,the female martial arts in mulan is smooth beautiful and powerful
Oct 24 2020,positive,all of the actors performances are detailed mulan meets my expectation
Oct 24 2020,positive,mulan was shot in newzealand and china the picture of it is really beautiful of course the story and the soundtrack of this movie are also great
Oct 24 2020,positive,this live action mulan was a satisfactory success enough which might still catch childrens attention
Oct 24 2020,positive,a well made remake of the original one action scenes are well designed and executed
Oct 24 2020,positive,loved it visually beautiful and al wonderful story for young girls
Oct 23 2020,negative,kind of boring not sure how it was empowering but the cinematography was good i guess
Oct 23 2020,positive,after being bitterly disappointed with the likes of the lion king jungle book and aladdin remakes i was pessimistic with mulan i was then pleasantly surprised to find that there was no disneysong bullshit no cheesy word for word line repeats and for what its worth these days  pure storytelling gold mulan is the only disney remake so far that actually improves on the original i hope the writers stick to this formula for their upcoming projects and not ruin my favourites like pinocchio and robin hood
Oct 23 2020,negative,the movie is very bad the characters lacks depth the story is uninspirational and lazily written i wouldnt recommended this movie to anyone
Oct 23 2020,negative,stop using the same animated titles if its not going to be like the animated whatsoever give it a different title and dont call it a remake this movie fails yet again in the long line of live action disney movie failures lion king made so much because it gave the people what they wanted we want shot for shot remake to see the animated characters we fell in love with to actually be seen real life or cgid
Oct 22 2020,positive,i know a lot of people thought it was unexciting that mulan seemed to have an unrealistic superpower for martial arts and more i get it id give the movie a 610 however i thought the movie did a good job of addressing gender roles stereotypes and how some men can view women to read more of what i think go to the link 
Oct 22 2020,positive,good story for a family movie
Oct 22 2020,negative,no music disney what the flip
Oct 22 2020,negative,yet another hollow disney cash grab not remake
Oct 21 2020,negative,its terrible in every way
Oct 21 2020,negative,worst remake yet the main character had the same facial reactions the whole movie the plot was amateur at worst along with the fact that they introduced new characters without developing said characters within the movie so pointless dont waste your time cos ive just wasted 2 hours of my life ill never get back on this bland washed down version
Oct 21 2020,negative,oh my god what an awful movie of all the remakes disneys making lately this one is the worst for sure the action scenes seem fake with no pace sometimes really absurd the mountain scene was incredible and made sense in the 98 version here its there just because there was that scene in the other version
Oct 20 2020,negative,this film removes everything i love from  the original and is worse in every way stop making live action remakes
Oct 19 2020,negative,i felt like they wanted to do something different but in all honesty it felt like the original but without any of the good parts
Oct 18 2020,positive,yifei liu is stunning here thats why i loved this film so much even tho there are lots of cons
Oct 18 2020,positive,one of the best disney live actionso good
Oct 18 2020,negative,poor acting a story thats far too slow and predictable average fight scenes and zero humour it all adds up to a very dull film
Oct 17 2020,negative,i have two now teenage daughters who absolutely loved the story of mulan so much so that it is my eldest daughters favorite animated adventure  she was so excited to learn that it would be made into a live action movie depicting the strength of character fierce independence and commitment to friends and family that was reflected in her hero  telling was the look she gave me at the end of the movie which  reflected her disappointment at the retelling of the tale in an incongruous often incoherent occasionally ridiculous and utterly superficial story  many of the components of the original would not translate well into a live action but the story of a girl who broke with tradition to save her family relying on herself at first and ultimately those whose trust she earned to save her country were certainly transferrable  yet instead of a hero who proves that with grit and determination she can achieve anything we meet another princess who has magic inside that gives her the ability to triumph over evil  it wasnt the story arc that built the backstory which would explain how amazing and unique her magic was that ruined the story it was that my daughter who once felt a kindred with mulan now feels nothing toward this fantasy that disney reimagined  great visuals soundtrack on par casting and acting all done wellthough we could have done without the is it or isnt it real phoenix cameos  with all this my daughter thought about it at length and ranted about how bad it was for days ultimately ranking it as her least favorite disney movieand shes seen return from witch mountain
Oct 17 2020,positive,so sub par 150 unimpressed    new story made darn near no sense justa big big let down to be honest not worth 30 for disney premium plus
Oct 16 2020,positive,first of all i wish to assert the fact that my opinions are totally based on the content of mulan without any emotional inteference of any other elements especially politics sadly the film replaces the funny animation characters which promote the entertaining quality of the movie mushu and crickee  with a phonex which is just beautiful and less harshly can be considered as a symbol or spiritual support there are some small but noticeably illogical such as flying chicken and biased snowslide which only kills the northern invaders additionally the acting performance of characters is absolutely not up to bar the other family members of mulan fail to truly express worry anxiety and care for her and unfortunately it makes them become so ignorant and indifferent at least in the animation movie the father of mulan can express a deeper sorrow by sitting under a tree to wait for her reunion the development of characters and performance of main characters is also incoherent despite the collaboration between famous actors mulan fails to express a wide variety of emotions in certain situations but remains in the same the witch is too powerful and basically invicible therefore i expect a longer and more energetic fight between her and mulan but there is no such thing her mental strength is just unusually weak constantly begs to merge with mulan and repeats the a same message of the unequality that women had to suffer in the society it is perfectly fine and ideal if this message is underlyingly shown but it becomes so forcedly unnatural the close teammates of mulan are portrayed to so weak and do not have enough opportunities to bond and comprehend each other during trainings bori khan is too dependent on the witch to take control of the empire this once again makes the femine message so unnatural however the movie successful brings out all neccessary feelings when watching an action film as well as open up the vast and magnificent nature
Oct 16 2020,positive,great movie loved seeing some well known chinese actors like donnie yen great shots of the landscape too
Oct 16 2020,negative,75 are you sure we are watching the same movie when i saw this rating i was like thank god this movie isnt completely trash spoilers it was only to be utterly disappointed the plot was terrible the acting was even more terrible especially liu yifei it was all terrible the phoenix looked like a paper kite and had no meaning whatsoever the movie got chi all wrong in ancient china girls had chi too you know also chi isnt a natural gift and it has nothing to do with lying to yourself also ancient china does not have the concept of witches they also got ancient chinese culture all wrong too despite being advertised as a more accurate retelling spoilers not that it matters or you should watch this movie but the witch dies in the most stupid and unempowering way possible just search up bird witch death in mulan 2020 and youll see
Oct 15 2020,negative,this movie was boring and ruined a great classic movie there is no character development i watched this with high hopes but it fell short in almost every part they took all the emotion out of a every aspect the removal of mushu and all the comical relief characters really hurt this film not even as a stand alone movie does this film life up to any real goals hard pass on this live action remake
Oct 14 2020,negative,not an imaginative movie i expected way more from disney
Oct 14 2020,positive,the movie was good lots of emotion excitement some comedy excellent action scenes i feel that the only thing that shouldve been changed is the teeth of the actress lou though cause whenever she smiles she displays her teeth which looks like she didnt brush or floss before doing any of her roles though so maybe she should see a dentist
Oct 14 2020,negative,they ruined mulan i am just so disappointed
Oct 14 2020,negative,why did they have to butcher one my childhoods favorite movies i mean the original one was just perfect this is not mulan this is something else
Oct 14 2020,neutral,disneys live action interpretation of the 1998 classic has some nice moments but overall is a very meh kind of movie its the kind of movie that is very emotionless and you dont really think or care about it afterwards however this live action remake does a lot of things correctly by changing some of the key plot points and adding some interesting new characters the witch for example whereas the previous disney remakes were almost a complete plot ctrl cv of there predecessor the visuals along with the production  costume design were all great overall this is definitely my favorite disney live action remake so far but still banks quite heavily on the original with characters and some plot points and is still an unnecessary cash grab and in my opinion a 510 film
Oct 14 2020,negative,horrible movie  not the correct message
Oct 14 2020,negative,absolutely horrible a disgrace to the animated movie this movie deserves to be destroyed and erased from history
Oct 13 2020,negative,one of the worst films i have ever seen its super boring and boring i dont recommend
Oct 13 2020,negative,a poor take on the pervasive and important themes of poor kid does good in the face of scorn discrimination and oppression and good vs evil tempation redemption honour and courage the plagarism of other films on the subject eg star wars iv to vi was so bad it is possible to predict the plot and even the lines     the female angle shines a spotlight on the bigotry that women still face today the messages about being judged on merit rather than sex or race or or or are important but mulan is so corny and predicatble that it spoils it     great costumes and sets and scenery but the action and the acting leave a lot to be desired
Oct 13 2020,negative,so many issues with this movie first of all adding the witch it took away from the fact that the huns were ruthless killers dominating the empire and made them seem weak and not important the second was people running up 60ft walls and catching arrows like it was nothing the fact that the huns seemed like they werent a real enemy made it feel like mulan didnt actual do anything significant should have just copied the cartoon it had comedy heroism and strength another sad failure of trying to over sale equality
Oct 13 2020,neutral,the story was much better in the animated version giving her magic powers makes the story less interesting because it lowers the stakes
Oct 12 2020,negative,you can read about why this movie is not good on other reviews what really concerns me is that it has a 75 fresh rotten tomatoes score it by no means could have obtained this score but it has it therefore somebody has made it so that is all
Oct 12 2020,negative,no disney magic mulan could have been a great movie if it has retained its disney magic  the classic songs the animal sidekick shang and mulans love story and humour both beauty and the beast and aladdin were given the respect to keep the storylines and songs true to the originals why was mulan stripped back
Oct 12 2020,positive,not the same story and we didnt need the same story again did we its fantastic great movie spectacular cast and performances beautiful cinematography this is disneys crouching tiger hidden dragon watch it as cinematically as you can 
Oct 12 2020,negative,the worst disney ever made
Oct 11 2020,negative,in this movie mulan basically has superpowers which removes any real sense of danger that might make the audience root for her she has nothing to learn and doesnt need to train and overcome physical weakness with intelligence like in the original the animated movie is better in every way
Oct 11 2020,negative,ccp propaganda  1 mulans father is a xi dada look alike  2 in ancient china the people lived in circular apartment complex  3 during the matchmaker scene they painted the symbol of huawei on their forehead  4 worst crime  mulan is a good fighter because she knows chigong  cmon  everyone knows that in every competition the mma master always beat the living bejuices out of the chigong master    aside from the ccp propaganda the acting is stiff   ok to watch this but do not pay for it
Oct 11 2020,negative,the worst movie in disney history  its full of script flaws  full of miseenscene errors
Oct 11 2020,negative,film is trash and creators dont understand the mulan story at all
Oct 11 2020,negative,the worst remake of a movie yet   even when not compared to the original this movie is bad   terrible plot character development voice overs
Oct 10 2020,positive,if youre hoping for a shot for shot remake of the original mulan you might not love it but i personally watched this movie without the mindset of expecting originality i was pleasantly pleased what a great movie with stunning scenery great soundtrack and good acting i definitely recommend watching this some of the reviews had me wonder if i should spend the 30 dollars to watch it but im happy i did
Oct 10 2020,positive,consumed by a lot of bad acting and a weak script that being said i still kinda liked it
Oct 10 2020,negative,watch the original this is garbage and is disrespectful to the original
Oct 9 2020,negative,this movie was supposed to be amazing i was hyped i thought if anyone can pull off a mulan movie then disney could but they failed    my first problem with the movie was the superpowers in the original 1998 disney animation mulan didnt have any powers she was just a regular girl who loved her family and she trained hard to become a skilled fighter and used her brain in combat to outwit her enemies and that was admirable and easy to look up to but this new mulan was born with chi a power that makes her a naturally skilled fighter this made her deeds less inspiring and admirable because it appeared that she was just a normal girl without her powers and it also gave me an itch that said disney doesnt think a woman can beat a man without powers watching mulan use these powers was kinda like watching a guy play a game with cheat codes they win but its not that impressive because anyone would win if they had those cheats    my 2nd problem with the movie was the lack of character development this movie had literally zero character development for anyone not even mulan got an adequate amount of development all she did was get tired of lying her friends from the original disney animation were replaced with some random soldiers who barely said or did anything to make them stand out if one of them died or got replaced half way through the movie i wouldnt have noticed because they gave me no impression whatsoever even the guy who was a technical love interest got no development apart from smiling and saying something nice in most of his scenes he wasnt anything special i legitimately think mulan only liked him because he was tall and handsome and thats surprising from a studio that preaches true love in all its princess movies the family was a generic family the dad was ok the little sister hated spiders and the mum was just existing for fun    my 3rd problem is a more personal one as it is related to my childhood where was mushu musu was a very important plot device and comedic relief and they decided to replace him with some dumb bird that was there to represent some kind of symbol i guess i didnt like that without a sense of humour the movies darker elements are more visible and people especially kids can tell that you just showed mulan kill several people in a pg movie i assume that mushu was removed from the movie because of chinese censors these guys need to learn the value of humour in movies because what theyre currently doing to hollywood productions ruins a writers ideas and destroys good movies     my 4th problem wad the lack of music the music in mulans original movie adaptation was gold and i was honestly looking forward to it but disney decided to ditch their disney princesses should sing philosophy and kept it all raw and natural and this would be ok if everything else was perfectly executed which it was not     my 5th and final problem was the villains more importantly the witch for some reason disney was trying to make this character that was killing innocent men and women relatable they gave her a simlar past to mulans about how she was judged and labled a witch because of her chi based powers and i dont know why disney was trying to make us feel sorry for thi evil and sick person it takes a really stupid person to feel sorry for someone like that    i actually have alot more to say about the movie but my fingers are tired and its 10pm  i feel like ive only said negative things about the movie so ill just type a few positive things     the movie had amazing visuals apart from the emperor everyone had solid acting skills the cg was ok mulan was a beautiful the fights were mostly well choreographed and  thats it
Oct 9 2020,neutral,disney needs a refund on cgithis film will make perfect sense to anyone 12 and under
Oct 9 2020,negative,this film supports genocide and police brutality in china if this is not a good reason not to watch this movie  you need to know this is the fakest woman empowering film ever produced the only good things are from the original movie shame on you disney
Oct 9 2020,positive,this movie was visually spectacular the sound track was awesome the acting was spectacular and the fights were gorgeous and the story was overall amazing you could tell it was made by disney however this movie was not the mulan that we all enjoyed as kids disney went out of its way to write an inferior plot in my opinion unlike the original this one has more fictional elements and that ruined it for me the original 1998 disney animation had elements like mushu and the ancestors which were fictional but it still managed to ground itself in reality by limiting the fictional elements to the mere existence of those beings and nothing too beyond that but this movie had magic people scaling walls using their feet and instead of a girl who used her brain wits and relied on her friends to save the day this version of mulan is just a fighting machine doped up on the indestructible power of chi it has way less character development than the original most of the characters were blank slates and very unrelatable compared to the original if you never watched the original its very hard for you to think of any of the elements this movie is lacking but as a person who has watched the 1998 animation i just couldnt fully enjoy this movie     i was also pissed off personally because mushu isnt in this movie and it has no singing in my opinion all disney princess movies should have singing it just feels like a huge part of the disney princess brand but those are just my personal thoughts    i initially wanted to give this movie 1 star but out of appreciation for every good thing about it i added 2 more
Oct 9 2020,negative,an abysmal remake of a beloved disney classic  this remake has none of the charm humour or substance of the original   the acting is as wooded as it gets the plot is ridiculous and the effects are sub par at best  all in all this was a needless waste of a few hundred million dollars
Oct 8 2020,negative,nothing good remakes can be justified when they can be seen as a quality film on their own or try something new this did neither there was not a single positive aspect of this movie not only was everything uninspired boring and nonsensical but they took out so much they contradict their own dialogue and rules half the time plus most of it was filmed cheaply and near concentration camps so that too  theres no positive message here either the only reason mulan is a little bit special is that they gave her magicthe force  they have her conform constantly to the system that the animated one had her fight against they made her lose anything that made her relatable and appealing in the first place the action was bad and filled with cuts the twist is blindingly obvious once you even see mulan and one other character   this is actually the 2nd worst disney remake at least most of the others experimented with new things this just took away and took away until there was nothing decent left i streamed this online for free and i still feel like disney robbed me of my money this was a bad movie on every level if you want to watch mulan stick to the 1998 animated version
Oct 8 2020,positive,i didnt know what to expect but i think the critics have overreacted negatively it is a good adaptation of the disney animated movie more real and serious in comparison but necessary the design and costume are excelent and there is a good conversion of the animated characters such as the cricket into live action personas of course not everything is the same as the animated movie but still as a live action is very good
Oct 8 2020,negative,this film has none of the greatness of the original its a drunken version of the original there are some beautiful shots and scenery in the movie there is some really good choreography in this movie but it stops there there is no great character growth in this movie the original has real character growth this is a movie you should not waste your money on it does nothing to pull you into the story there are moments with some of the action where it started to pull my attention but the rest of the time its a complete flop
Oct 8 2020,negative,aside from the main actress support of the ccps crackdown in hong kong and disney thanking officials complicit in genocide the film itself just isnt very good its boring it has dumb uncompelling action the changes from the animated version all make it worse i am biased in that i havent been a big fan of the disney remakes but i must admit this is one of the worst if not the worst of them all
Oct 8 2020,negative,this movie takes all the good things about the original mulan movie and destroys it in the original movie mulan starts off as a talentless girl and utilizing her wits to overcome adversary to become the best soldier in the army this movie starts off as the superman of her movie the story describes her as being super talented in her ability to control her chi they also eliminated all the character developments and whimsical interactions between the characters so not only did the movie seem boring i feel no attachment to any of the characters in addition since mulan was so powerful i never felt she was ever in any significant danger the only redeeming aspect of the movie is that it is visibly beautiful but even this was shadowed by the fact this movie was shoot near a concentration camp where the ccp performed inhumane acts to their people
Oct 7 2020,neutral,very disappointing but not as bad as aladdin live action
Oct 7 2020,negative,im fine with getting rid of characters like mushu and li shang as long as the movie replaced them with better alternatives but i was extremely disappointed getting rid of characters is fine but is it necessary to suck the life out of every single character none of them have nearly as much personality compared to the animated movie including chi not only ruined the perseverance aspect of mulans character but was also represented terribly not to mention the editing didnt seem like it was even done professionally the emotional scenes were bland and didnt serve their purpose at all everything about this movie is a disgrace to the 1998 animated mulan
Oct 7 2020,negative,the movie was culturally insensitive wrong boring and frustrating plus it is really just boring and standard
Oct 7 2020,positive,its not a bad movie it just isnt mulan i wish they had not removed the comedy great songs and important characters and wasted time and storyline with the witch and magic nonsense watch it but do not expect this to be anything like the original disney animation
Oct 6 2020,negative,the film brings the plot completely wrong when it gave magical powers to the main character taking away every single thing about her growth for the entire film  it adds nothing when having taken the dragon and put the phoenix and until now i didnt understand why that female villain is there
Oct 6 2020,positive,i was so happy it finally came out on disney plus sorry there wasnt any dragon and musical on the live action movie  it was fun going to china with my families and other coworkers for this movie  i miss movie editing with other coworkers of disney inside the disney castle studios  special premier inside the castle was an honor  after watching this movie for more than two times i end up sleeping  but evertheless it was good to bring back 90s disney animated movies back to life  thank you fans
Oct 5 2020,negative,my daughters really wanted to see this movie so i coughed up the 30 and rented it  they only sat through half of the movie and left to play in their rooms after they realized there were no songs  this was not the musical they were expecting  they were board to tears
Oct 5 2020,positive,really great movie i would say its the best remake live action yet
Oct 5 2020,negative,the movie action scenes were terrible the actress playing mulan was not that good they wasted donnie yen in the movie this is how westerners interpret chinese stories  would have helped if they had chinese people involved in the script and storyline jason scott lee as the main villain  terrible selection overall a painful movie to watch
Oct 4 2020,negative,the 200 million dollars that they spend just to create this movie is totally worth it and made a profit less than 30 million dollars
Oct 4 2020,negative,take the mary sue from star wars final trilogy and put her in china terrible movie doesnt represent the source material or improve on the animated movie at all
Oct 4 2020,negative,its not just inaccuracy about the chinese culture extremely shallow characters  no acting except donny yen stupid storyline unbelievably mediocre stunts
Oct 4 2020,negative,one of the worst liveaction disneyremakes ever they had no grasp of the original poem or the chinese culture that they so claimed that they wanted to represent compared to the 1999 disney version this movie does not contribute to anything new what it does have is changes but these changes are what contributes to it being one of the worst liveaction disneyremakes of all time no need to watch it
Oct 4 2020,negative,i cant believe theyve totally ruined a perfectly great movie only watch this if its free and youre okay with not getting back this time in your life 
Oct 4 2020,positive,this movie is so colorful and i love the fact that it is close to the real thing and i also love that it isnt a love story and more on self discovery this movie does not disappoint
Oct 4 2020,negative,a boring story about a mary sue who overcomes all because shes born special chinese culture gets rewritten to make political points
Oct 3 2020,negative,awful disney should stop with remakes and discover and make new stories to tell
Oct 3 2020,positive,very good movie  recommended
Oct 3 2020,negative,mulan did not sing reflection and it sounds like narnia the phoenix from the original mulan is jolly while in this live action the phoenix did not even speak or talk o mulan at least
Oct 3 2020,negative,total garbage might have been fun if it had been on the big screen but doesnt hold up well enough for streaming
Oct 3 2020,negative,the original is way better
Oct 3 2020,positive,didnt have the classic mulan songs but still was a good movie cgi wise had substance just different more towards a fighting sequence than a disney animation remake
Oct 3 2020,negative,my 5 year old cant make much sense of it and i cant do much better     heres an actual conversation  5 year old whats that peacock  me i dont know maybe the witch it doesnt make a lot of sense  well i remember the cartoon there was a silly dragon maybe thats what it is but not silly   that makes as much sense as anything i can think of  this is not a good movie
Oct 3 2020,positive,there was stuff i liked there was stuff i didnt its fine
Oct 2 2020,positive,excellent live action adaptation sure its a bit cheesy but thats the genre they were aiming for and they pulled it off the very kingfu moviesque style of the fight scenes nails it without being too much over the top think crouching tiger hidden dragon cinematics wear beautiful and they even managed to sneak in some of the original score although orchestrally
Oct 2 2020,negative,mulan is supposed to be someone not naturally strong or gifted this is movie is an egregious remake do not give them any of your movie or time
Oct 2 2020,negative,while the fight choreography was good and the sets are lovely this movie lacks the charm the original did not only it is missing the classic songs and characters we all love but the actors feel lifeless and the addition of the new characters and the chi powers make the movie feel even more worthless this is the worst disney remake by far
Oct 2 2020,negative,when disney said they were doing a live action for mulan the clear objective was to correct the mistakes they did on the mulan of 1998  truly respect the chinese culture so to do that they took all the talking animals the musics and all the disney magic and for what to disrespect even more the chinese people the mulan from the original showed that youwomen can be as good as any man if you work it out and what this new movie shows that if you wasnt born with a gift given from their god you will never be good as a man and will have to follow your lands costumes like marring a man and thats why they put her sister in the story  lake of true chinese facts not one of the screenwriters was chinese thats a shame a live action with so much potential and budget to do so  sorry for any error im from brazil
Oct 2 2020,positive,this movie is for anyone who desires a different iteration over the animated version  great fight scenes bit heavy on wire special f2f
Oct 2 2020,negative,utter disappointment without any chemistry between cast nor any romance involved while not a fan of disneys excessive singing it was weirdly missed in this movie hardly any magic or creatures involved that gave some real charm to the story and lack of mulans struggles to fit into the male army made this one a missed opportunity well maybe its better that it never saw light of day on the big movie screen after all
Oct 2 2020,negative,nothing really loved up to the original the music was worse it just didnt do it for me
Oct 2 2020,positive,the film was overall great it had some flaws but i kept forgetting it because of the cinematography haters gonna hate it is what it is
Oct 2 2020,negative,i do not like this movie  see it on redbox or get from the library when available  dont spend your money on it
Oct 2 2020,negative,so many changes from the original disney that it ruined my views i could tell where the wirefu started and ended the replacement of the dragon for a phoenix was a big let down since it was a prominent fixture of the animated version another note was that all of the actors may have been asian but the scripts directing and scene settings were all done by white people who had no idea what they were doing this would have been a much better send off had all of those changes had been done properly and actually followed the culture
Oct 1 2020,negative,the whole movie only tell me one thing that mulan is a destiny girl  seriously i laughed when i see phoenixs wings spreading behind her  i wish i could ask for refund if i can  30 why not watching tenet two more times
Oct 1 2020,negative,lovely cinematography but blandtounlikable main character really ruined this film the pacing was awful and the actress just could not appear masculine enough to make the basic concept of the film work ive seen several women successfully appear masculine enough in a film to make a similar premise work so why on earth did disney think they didnt need to make a reasonable effort to help this actress look masculine  im not sure it would have made a huge difference though because as written shes still dull and unlikable  the intriguing characters were the male soldier love interest cricket and the witch character  i wanted to like mulans father because he did a really good job of portraying his character but he was written with such lousy dialog and behavior that it really undermined my ability to be invested in him  yeesh i just wanted this movie to hurry up and be over with whenever the witch honghui or cricket werent on screen editing to add i havent seen the cartoon version so cannot compare the two
Oct 1 2020,negative,another super hero story where the main character oh wait this is supposed to be mulan why does she have super powers  where is mushu  why are there witches  why cant i take the villain seriously because they made him a joke  if you really want to watch this movie just pretend its not mulan and then maybe it will deserve a 2 stars instead of a 1
Oct 1 2020,negative,it a movie with good picture and cgi like other disney movie but the worst in acting
Sep 30 2020,negative,most boring movie ever mulan experiences no character growth and never appears to have a genuine struggle the movie lacks any happy or funny moments there is no music it is a bland awful movie my friends fell asleep watching it
Sep 30 2020,negative,i will give it 1 start because while it has many faults and i mean many it does have some good looking shots though that mainly boils down to id rather see a movie clips version of this then watch the whole thing again
Sep 29 2020,positive,a remake of a movie from my childhood  it was ok had some really good action and the characters were great  some  time the plot lagged and it a little boring but overall i still enjoyed it i would say 710 
Sep 29 2020,negative,this movie was a hard one to sit through a lot of chinese cultural nuances fell flat with me and appears to have fallen flat in china as well with the poor performance there the action scenes  although a function of chi  were not at all believable i felt a stronger balance between believability and supernatural could have been molded in this film
Sep 29 2020,positive,if you want to enjoy the movie think of it separately of the previous one and youll truly enjoy it it was awesome they gave mulan a hole new power which made her awesome at least for me and my family the movie is worth seeing
Sep 29 2020,positive,a nice new take on the classic tale fun fight choreography lovely visuals a great score and yufeu liu brings a strong but vulnerable performance that i found endearing pacing is somewhat flawed though with certain moments needing to be expanded on if a few more minutes were added to the film aside from that its a pleasant experience and i applaud it for being different from its animated counterpart
Sep 29 2020,negative,they took out mushu her love interest and chopped out all the comedy of the original somehow she now is a witch which makes no sense
Sep 29 2020,negative,awful why would you give her superpowers especially when removing mushu claiming it makes it more accurate and not have any chinese or at least knowledgeable people on the board the fact they erased the amazing plot line of an average girl making the ultimate sacrifice for her family knowing she could die in war having to be knocked down and pull herself up using her own cunningness to turn her resources into strengths and fighting to be just as strong as the boys just communicates the idea to young girls that you can only be strong if youre special and have superpowers no you cant fight you cant be weak and build yourself up nope you have to have super chi powers which is completely inaccurately depicted i also dont know why they didnt have one chinese writer that could literally fix any inaccuracies on this film if you want a good explanation as to why this movie is just terrible at representing chinese culture look up everything culturally wrong with mulan 2020 and how they couldve been fixed
Sep 29 2020,negative,very poor acting some tried too hard other not trying main girl has 1 facial expression entire movie she trips over her own dialog multiple times story characters make questionable illogical choices bad guys villains are stupid zero character developments mulan is good because shes born strong like superhuman strong she can climb wall like spiderman and kick arrow fly faster than even bow can shoot
Sep 28 2020,positive,they removed the funny cricket and the wonderful music  the cricket added some comic relief and the music helped move the transition along new mulan was a good film but just boring and should have at least kept the music even if it was only the instrumental  i know we all know the story but come on give me something  mulan was awesome and i loved the fight scenes but seriously needs fillers to keep you awake
Sep 28 2020,negative,absolutely horrible no character development and entertainment
Sep 28 2020,positive,this remake of the beloved disney animated film sans musical numbers is visually stunning with impressive action sequences and an important message about independence however what the film lacks is proper character development which is essential in a story about a strong female lead
Sep 28 2020,negative,im a huge fan of actionkung fuwarrior female hero films but it pains me to say that this movie was absolute tripe of the stinkiest kind cheesy regurgitated rubbish from disney with no imagination whatsoever why cant they leave  good thing alone there was nothing wrong with the original but this rendition was truly cringe worthy
Sep 28 2020,positive,the movie is a blast
Sep 28 2020,neutral,not what i expected at all and left me disappointed over all there were definitely great aspects and overall was beautiful to watch but some of the acting was also kinda meh
Sep 27 2020,negative,a disgrace to the original had no character development and excluded many of the cartoon characters that made the movie mulan such  as mushu the cricket her military friends and a genuine li shang they made this adaptation look like a joke making it all about chi and the huns running up walls the witch the pheonix and them trying to make it empowering for women absolutely horrible remake and it is a shame disney took this route seemed very emotionless and rushed
Sep 27 2020,negative,it was just bad the actress has no talent some things are better left animated
Sep 27 2020,negative,the cartoon was much more better this mulan is not strong independet woman she is null
Sep 27 2020,positive,was expecting something similar from what they did to other disney live action movies such as aladdin and the beauty and the beast but surprisingly they took a sharp turn to their own storytelling i felt like not all the characters from the animated ones were introduced correctly the  story was a bit off going here to there but the scenes and the stunts are fun to watch yes i would like to see more if theres a sequel
Sep 27 2020,negative,badly adapted story action was shaky wasted donnie yens talents
Sep 26 2020,negative,the pacing is bad the characters are bland and have no real personality they take away womens empowerment by giving mulan chi and not allowing her to grow her own skills and match that of a mans shes only as good or better than them because of magic they remove much needed characters and add others that just make no sense such as the witch there is not a single point when i empathized with this character or wanted to see more of her the dialogue is poorly written and the musical score is meh at best a total waste of time and money just watch the cartoon version
Sep 26 2020,negative,this remake is terrible its visually stunning but so difficult to emotionally connect with the main character the lack of musical numbers or trusty sidekick didnt help ive never wanted my money back this bad
Sep 26 2020,negative,while finally taking some creative decisions with the writing that were sorely missed in the beauty and the beast remake mulan 2020 completely missed the mark of what made the original so great  the core message this coupled with taking away almost every meaningful supporting character and the music left mulan 2020 a hollow shell of a movie and a mere echo to its original masterpiece
Sep 26 2020,negative,the main actress showed unemotional acting throughout the movie and the villians were really boring
Sep 26 2020,positive,not your typical karate movie i did like it well balance drama an action
Sep 26 2020,negative,the movie feels rush no character development poor script writting
Sep 26 2020,negative,it removes most of the good things about the original and instead of mulan being smart she is just super human
Sep 26 2020,negative,i understand the point of this remake was well money but to more accurately depict the original chinese legend    wow did it do a terrible job of showing the original legend and making a good film its half shameless fanservice by playing the animated movies instrumentals and half boring nonsense    plus the situations connected to this film no one should have paid for it anyway and many people didnt
Sep 26 2020,negative,the original animated mulan is the best disney princess movie for me i really enjoyed its great and original humor love the story line  really like movies about underdogs rising up to the occasion the songs were very iconic the direction was well put together and everything was done with the perfect blend of its cast     surprisingly i wonder how this 2020 mulan liveaction movie got past disneys quality control it has the worst flow ever niki caro is the director and i really blame her for the mess that mulan 2020 is the story and directing failed to effectively portray the supporting characters characters the phoenix was being built up only to be revealed too soon without much significance the witchs character was an absolute mess the lead actress is also very one dimensional and is really poor at acting and conveying emotions    overall the movie is flat motionless still and stagnant dont know why it currently sits at 75 at the tomatometer just like starwars 78 and 9 i just find it difficult to trust rotten tomatoes with disney movies
Sep 26 2020,positive,leaving aside the fact that this movie is different to the original of 1998 the script cinematography and the production is very big in quality
Sep 25 2020,positive,worthy take on the animated classic
Sep 25 2020,negative,not what i had hoped the story is differ from the original animated movie we all love alot and though ive read that they follow the original chinese legend more closely with this movie it didnt feel right to me   the photography is beautiful and music is well produced but the story fails to get us invested in the events and characters   only character i felt was done right was the villain though i cant remember his namn right now otherwise is limped on without and real ease
Sep 25 2020,negative,they completely changed mulan  it became a cheesy childrens kungfu movie with none of the magical music or comic relief  expect major disappointment dont waste your money
Sep 25 2020,positive,this film is a perfect example of how behindthescenes politics of modern storytelling threaten to override the important dynamic of simply telling an entertaining story the tale that of a young woman who becomes a soldier and then a military leader in a culture not open to young women becoming anything but baby machines is chiefly the workhorse of selling the idea of female empowerment still it is a well done affair a walk on the highwire to accomplish particularly in how chinese traditions of familial loyalty and gender are handled both conceits central to the tale as well the obligatory magical disney element is not overplayed for a welcome change
Sep 25 2020,negative,boring missed out a lot from the original movie the casting for the characters was alright tho
Sep 25 2020,negative,i like the cartoon more 1 star for nice cinematography
Sep 25 2020,positive,this movie was amazing it was made like most other chinese movies in action and in themes if your a fan of chinese movies then you will love this if not then you might not enjoy it as much however for anyone thats complaining about it being serious and not having music suck it up and see mulan for the amazing and beautiful movie that it is 1010 will watch again and i will buy mulan as soon as it is released for purchase
Sep 25 2020,positive,in short it was a good movie and good acting but i lost enthusiasm in the middle of the movie for its lack of drama and romance scenes also the action scenes were not great and also its story is very expected
Sep 24 2020,positive,despite the film having different things from the 1998 animation like some characters and songs nikki caro brought an innovative and brilliant version of mulan that i just loved and hope very much that the sequel will come and yifei liu rocked like mulan and that more films will come this dear actress
Sep 24 2020,negative,dishonor on this movie this is my hated and least favorite live action movie of all time by disney this movie made so many mistakes from the animation of mulan 1998 they on purposely removed li chang and even remove my favorite character mushu its just a huge shame and a black eye for disney
Sep 24 2020,negative,if youre looking for a true telling of the story of mulan something that feels realistic and accurate against the classic animated film this is not your movie the animated musical is able to convey emotion heart friendship and an actual character arc where this film doesnt have any of that
Sep 24 2020,negative,not a good movie with no character development very disappointed
Sep 24 2020,positive,before o start the review i have to admiti never saw the original mulan but still al my friends told me that its wonderful so i came for this movie with high expectations and i have to say that i came out of the movie a little disappointed  i am not going to spoil the movie so dont worry i am just telling you my feeling after the movie there was some scenes that i thought could be much better but still the movie is a pure fun and can help you pass the pandemic so if you come for this movie with the correct expectations you will enjoy and if not maybe no
Sep 24 2020,negative,so bad acting is flat no cinematography skills bad cgi 
Sep 24 2020,negative,animated was way better it felt rushed and not written very well acting was mediocre and the added witch character is annihilating armies of people then falls to an arrow
Sep 24 2020,negative,dont see it    lost all of the feelgoodness of the first
Sep 23 2020,positive,i thought it was good kids did too
Sep 23 2020,negative,just to be clear i wanted to like this film so much i was convinced that it was going to be good and told everyone who had doubts that they were wrong little did i know that i was wrong it was literally a disney drama movie    none of the great comedy that it used to have none of the songs which i dont normally like musicals even missing most of the same characters it was almost as if they had never seen the original    i love all of the disney remakes but this is the first one that i really did not enjoy it was boring and nothing like the original only positive i would give it was the main actress i thought she did a decent job despite the horrendous writing
Sep 23 2020,neutral,the movies visual marvel is great but the overall screenplay darkerthemes and lack of originality make it an overall mediocre experience also the lead actress supports police brutality
Sep 23 2020,negative,save your money the cartoon was much better because it actually had a heros story arc this took what couldve been a homage to the actual historical figure and made it unrealistic overly  fictitious by inserting magic chi as if its a jedis force that you are born with and just become naturally awesome just like the in new star wars movies    they destroted the likeable wise and loving emperor with an arrogant one halfway did the same to her father     the movie had little to do with the ancestral aspects emphasized in the first    all and all the great cartoon movie was gutted so mulan can be a perfect jedi chinese warrior giving girls a unrealistic perception of how life really is screw reality history and story arc     disney had an opportunity to make a more historic homage and they totally blew it
Sep 23 2020,positive,i loved the visuals and the martial arts however i did think that they relied heavily on cgi which i really wish they didnt overall i really enjoyed the entire theme and it honestly made me tear up a few times i loved it
Sep 23 2020,negative,some pointers as to why i did not like this movie at all  all the meaning and emotion was sucked out of mulans story  the concep of qi was misunderstood and made into something that doesnt even exist   the added character of the witch makes no sense especially in a chinese context also her sacrifice at the end should have been easily avoided with her powers no   costuming in many scenes was an ungly charicature of actual chinese traditional clothing  the sense of scale was thoroughly underwhelming its just couple of soldiers fighting each others
Sep 23 2020,positive,i actually enjoyed this remake and thought liu yiefi did great job in the leading role christina aguileras end credit song was amazing as usual
Sep 23 2020,positive,felt more like a marvel movie than a disney movie and certainly not a princess movie there were enjoyable elements and excitement but overall i thought it wasnt amazing
Sep 23 2020,positive,niki caros mulan is an intense actionpacked and sweeping liveaction remake that offers a fresh interpretation of the animated classic with her seventh feature writerdirector niki carro has crafted an astonishing liveaction adaptation of a beloved animated film its the filmmakers first attempt to bring disneys beloved animated classic to the bigscreen but she pulls if off seamlessly using captivating cinematography carro draws viewers into the world of a chinese woman on a quest to become a warrior from intimate closeups to gorgeous establishing shots the cinematography keeps viewers immersed in the films cultural setting carros decision to exclude the musical sequences from the animated film is risky but it works tremendously it gives the film a somber and realistic tone that is missing from the animated movie in terms of acting the entire ensemble is excellent yifei liu delivers a starmaking performance as hua mulan with riveting expressions she conveys the courage determination and heroism of the iconic animated character although mulan is undeniably enthralling ultimately it is not a flawless film the film is so focused on its battle sequences that it often loses sight of telling a compelling story moreover it lacks the strong character development of the original animated classic nevertheless fans of the beloved disney cartoon will definitely enjoy mulan and so will moviegoers seeking exhilarating entertainment arriving on the 22nd anniversary of the cartoon its a stirring reminder that tales of chinese women are worth retelling on the bigscreen
Sep 23 2020,negative,i cant believe i even spent a minute on this thing  poor story poor video editing no depth in the characters the removal of music the removal of mushu  im not even factoring in the things that disneys been doing and allowing outside of the film  i havent felt this disappointed in a film let alone a disney film since they made kylo ren make out with rey ill be rewatching the og mulan and trying to erase this 2020 version from my mind
Sep 23 2020,negative,why make this lame adaptation when the original version was great what a waste
Sep 23 2020,negative,i there are many things that i want to say about this movie but i only will resume with it was innecesary it has bad special effects for to have 200 billion of dollars of budget deception 
Sep 23 2020,negative,the cartoon version is more realistic than this one   also the main actor supports police brutality
Sep 22 2020,negative,i love the original animated movie but i was extremely excited to see a more realistic truetolegend version of mulan    unfortunately nothing apart from the scenery was good aside from the breathtaking shots of chinas natural beauty theres nothing worth watching here    mulan gets superpowers in this movie her victory is no longer a victory as an ordinary woman but as a woman with superpowers it really muddles the message of the film especially since her feminine traits have nothing to do with any of her successes here instead of beating her trials with wit and patience mulan uses her chi to bruteforce her way through them i guess since i dont have superpowers ill never be able to measure up to a man im really confused as to why they took out all the problemsolving pieces of the original and replaced them with less interesting versions    theres also a really weird proimperial vibe that doesnt fit well with the emperor himself in this movie the emperor acts more like a vengeful dictator than a wise caring man since they also took out the parts of the movie that show the villains brutality its uncomfortable when mulan is so staunchly on one side of the conflict    finally the dialogue is awful its a stilted boring mess that the actors can hardly even deliver theres no personality in any of it    this doesnt even mention the human rights violations and the concentration camps in china if mulan 2020 was any good this would still be a horrible taint on it but it wasnt even a decent film seriously how was this garbage produced
Sep 22 2020,negative,this movie sucked western view of chinese culture is trash literally 1 min in and i was already cringing whack cgi martial arts story and design trash dont bother purchasing or getting premier access on disney plus just rent it trash
Sep 22 2020,negative,once the film leaves behind the first act everything begins to be implausible from her posing as a man to her appointment as leader random forced quick and mindless decisions everything to keep mulan moving forward too much deus ex machina for me
Sep 22 2020,negative,was just lame always liked mulan but this movie was lame
Sep 22 2020,positive,great visualsound effect a reflection of a loyal brave  true young lady
Sep 22 2020,positive,mulan 2020 was a disappointing film that felt like it was filmed more in the middle east rather than where the story takes place the story was still great and it offered a minor nostalgic sense to its original but it failed for me with sequences and plot lines that seemed all too much like it was made for younger audiences instead of what the advertisements have been making it out to be it was not worth the money spent
Sep 22 2020,positive,while much controversy surrounds the making of this live adaptation of disneys mulan its a movie worth watching  there were a handful of well placed emotional and comedic beats throughout and a nicely updated film score along with the newly penned loyal brave  true sung by christina aguilera over the closing credits  its a large scale production with some stunning visuals  its clear they spent every penny of the estimated 200 mil budget  having said that i would not recommend paying 2995 for disney plus premier access wait a few months when it streams for free in early december
Sep 22 2020,negative,this movie is utter garbage its a trash retelling of an important story it evokes zero emotion and utterly failed at depicting female empowerment
Sep 22 2020,positive,the 2020 remake of mulan lies firmly in the middle when it comes to disney liveaction remakes its not bad but its not great either its solid throughout without ever reaching anything truly strong as it was a missed opportunity on many fronts the main characters struggle with her deceit was so well realized but ultimately her possession of chi basically made her a mary sue and effectively rendered the movies feminist message pointless it is to be respected how this remake is changed significantly from the original movie though and the best new addition has to be gongs li witch character who is so well written and easily the most intriguing part of the entire feature the action is serviceable but rarely reaching martial arts wuxia levels technically speaking the films a treat with great visuals and a strong score its overall competently made through and through but it was rarely truly great or memorable on a side note the overwhelmingly present themes of the importance of your family and nation made the film very chinese in its values which makes the movies failure at the chinese box office even more of a significant blow
Sep 22 2020,negative,movie was not funny and have no sense of direction also they took out the most funniest part of the whole entire film and the acting was just terrible they took out the suspenseful moment swim alone put on her fathers armor and took off and he chased after her in the rain they shouldve kept that night
Sep 22 2020,negative,horrible their other live actions still kept the magic this one didnt taking away a large part mushu of what made animated classic wonderful strike one the acting isnot great though i cant say if thats the fault of the actors or the horrible onedimensional pieces of cardboard this movies characters were written as strike 2 the setting is boring and bland its a poor adaptation of what makes chinese culture beautiful and unique half of the story is changed and not in a good way strike 3 all togetherthis movie is horrible with the biggest budget theyve ever had youd think it would be better than cinderella maleficent or any of the various snow whites its even worse than the cringe nightmare that was beauty and the beast im referring to all the live action versions not their animated classics here they need to fire the entire team from screenwriters to director because this is a mess of a movie i have no doubt that this will be one of those we dont talk about it remakes i didnt know it cost 200million for something worse than a straight to vhs movie
Sep 22 2020,negative,honestly at this point i dont understand why disney seems to be making a point if sucking all the elements that made the cartoons great and lovable and give us insipid remakes without soul    the cast is great its visually beautiful but the script and editing bring the whole thing down humorous moments have been reduced to poor cringe pantomime moments that felt epic challenging and rewarding in the animated original have lost their intensity and excitement characters that had their own personalities and motivation have become bland and uninteresting    whats the point of a remake if it gives you less than the original just another disappointment
Sep 22 2020,positive,i was surprised at how much i enjoyed this movie because the reality is that this is one of my least favorite disney cartoons i thought the action was great i thought the actors were amazing and the special effects  a real pleasure to watch
Sep 22 2020,negative,terrible gets rid of the whole point of female empowerment do not watch
Sep 22 2020,negative,contrived inconsistent and the changes were essentially pointless the original mulan was poignant because mulan wasnt some warrior prodigy she didnt know how to fight she just wanted to protect her father she had real physical obstacles and taking her through that journey bonds her with the other soilders and the audience i was not invested in this mulan
Sep 22 2020,positive,i liked the movie much more than the cartoonanime
Sep 22 2020,neutral,4510 lets get down to business by trading charm humor and pretty good tunes for mediocre kung fu action overlyserious yet toothless tone and stilted dialogue mulan has laid bare the soullessness of the disney live action formula certainly not a film worth fighting for
Sep 21 2020,negative,it feels more like an indian movie with all the action scene that dont make sense than a disney movie a big let down of a classic
Sep 21 2020,negative,bad cgi unflattering camera techniques and cut corners everywhere this is most obvious during the grand finale at the temple which by the way is under construction and mostly scaffolding this cost how much again
Sep 21 2020,negative,it seemed to aim closer to the original legend but the final result is a lukewarm mix of anachronisms and anatopisms like trading mushu for an even more western phoenix the action is fine and the cast gives overall good performances but the battle scenes are belittled by chaotic cuts and the scarcity of people involved in them  even the imperial city feels empty like for many other disney remakes the question is who it is aimed at the american and european audiences who love the 1998 classic or the chinese one who can already choose between several adaptations
Sep 21 2020,negative,mediocre boring and predictable
Sep 21 2020,negative,this remake was no where near the original animated movie this mulan lacked any real charm problem solving or growth in the animated version you can see that mulan finds value in herself and her personality and is accepted fully for being herself in this remake she now has powers that make her special not her mind or character you dont see real growth and she is accepted as a worrior only after her powers are displayed the animated version besides the talking animals was actual more grounded and much more accepted id rather look up to a 98 mulan who uses her wits to overcome obstacles than this mulan who lacks growth and is special in a more conventional way
Sep 21 2020,negative,this is literally one of the worst movies ive seen in a long time extremely bmovie by so many standards the original mulan was fantastic and lovable this is a super cheap knockoff with zero character development laughable and unrealistic and unrelatable scenarios shes the definition of marysue i have no idea how this director got a job it aims to be femaleempowering but this is the opposite of female empowerment
Sep 21 2020,negative,it was the exact same movie except they removed all the stuff that made the animated movie good and to top that off they added a terrible new villain
Sep 21 2020,negative,gutted the original story took away all charm that the original had and replaced it with mediocre cgi
Sep 21 2020,negative,to say the soundtrack  doesnt fit the tone so we kept it out is truly a dishonor  dishonor on them dishonor on us and dishonor on the whole disney family heres to 2020 even messing up one of the most beloved  strongest disney princess and side kick duo  im gonna go watch the true magic of the og and sing my lungs off lol
Sep 21 2020,negative,the movie gutted all the humor creativity and fun from the animated mulan the great songs from the movie discarded despite keeping 10 second jingles of the original tunes we miss just to taunt us on what could have been all we are left with is a boring forced husk devoid of character and originality it felt like just another stiff live action ancient chinese war movie except it was in english 
Sep 21 2020,negative,its better than dragon ball evolution   that all it has
Sep 21 2020,negative,i had hope this would be an alright movie regardless of not following the cartoon it still had a chance unless youre mulan you dont get to develop as a character her squad are just generic soldiers that you could replace with anyone at any time her love interest likewise is only there to be a love interest he has nothing going for him other than the good looking one of the group even mulan doesnt really grow as a character the plot was female empowerment so she is the most powerful by nature of being female great story writing there  the magic was really poorly done as well in the mountain fight scene which is iconic in the cartoon mulan can apparently go invisible to get around the entire army its the only way to explain how she got there without anyone seeing her the emperor can wield clothe to fight off his opponents they can all catch arrows like theyre being casually tossed around instead of fired from bows  this entire movie is a joke none of it makes any sense the story writing isnt really a thing there is no development or reason to care about anyone to call this movie mulan hurts the original movie this is a female action movie whose main character happens to share the name of a great disney character
Sep 21 2020,negative,you will know what is shit
Sep 21 2020,negative,absolutely horrible smfh i cant believe they spent 200 million on this piece of trash this isnt even mulan this is just a horrible spin off this movie was just pure trash cant believe i wasted money or time to watch this shit the whole team of people behind this have dropped the ball this movie was trash not sure how you ruin such a classic movie when all they had to do was remake something already good just goes to show these people have no idea what they are doing 200 million spent on this what a waste
Sep 21 2020,negative,one of the worst films of 2020 the lack of any understanding of the original chinese story is embarrassingly apparent
Sep 21 2020,negative,just watch the original everybody i havent watched it but judging by schaffrillas productions review on the movie its really bad i do not like disney live action remakes at all with some exceptions this movie took everything out from the original story that made it good i was fine with them taking out the songs and mushu as long as they made it a darker story but they didnt do that again just watch the original everyone
Sep 21 2020,positive,i absolutely loved it its a inspiring movie and mulan is badass for sure ill watch many times again
Sep 21 2020,negative,pretty terrible heartless adaptation 
Sep 21 2020,neutral,it was entertaining enough but nothing like the animated film just pieces i dont understand why they took out mushu and the singing they just replaced the non realistic with something else non realistic like i said it was okay on its own but not my fav as a remake
Sep 21 2020,negative,this movie was not good in fact it was boring and the fight scenes sucked too they didnt even have intricate combos like a typical kung fu film awful and lame would not recommend
Sep 21 2020,negative,the original was much better the phoenix doesnt make any sense nor the witch disney should stop making this live action remakes that ruin the stories
Sep 21 2020,positive,awesome movie plot storyreflecting true real life hardship and realitymuch more better than the disney cartoon story versionin an era of war of bloodshed and deathwhich is historically true singing songs   and talking animals would only reduce the darkness and intensityvalue and virtues shown and emphasis welldidnt expect this at allpraise to all the beautiful and handsome actors who present this moviemulan is awesome
Sep 21 2020,negative,this was horrible it looked nice visually the character was not very realistic i felt like she had no flaws that she had to overcome and for this reason i couldnt get behind her
Sep 21 2020,positive,the 2020 film is much closer to the original tale of mulan so i loved it especially for that the actors were absolutely incredible and the director did a fantastic job its clear they put most of their bank toward the story than the graphics but i prefer it this way i dont really care if i can tell that the movement is done with wires and the creatures are digitized i much rather the story and acting to be on point if you care more for the graphics than you might be disappointed however the cinematography of landscapes is something to admire and costs a lot of money to do well so worth the wait and am not at all disappointed with the live remake of one of my most favorite of films thank you
Sep 20 2020,positive,its a good movie for kids nice to see
Sep 20 2020,positive,a good effort and nicely made adaptation that enhances the points and cues of the original disney classic while bringing vivid visual depth and incredible music and a fine performance from the principal actress whom portrayed mulan
Sep 20 2020,negative,very sad about this movie discards many key and beloved characters from the original movie while adding new and irrelevant characters doesnt even follow the original chinese storyline like some people have said it was trying to do weak character development and mulans facial emotions stay the same throughout the movie if you like good cinematography you may like this movie but other than that the purpose of this movie is just confusing
Sep 20 2020,positive,as disney remakes go this was one was surprisingly fresh  i was pleasantly surprised to see that this was not the same exact story as the animated version the liveaction version was more grownup had more suspense better action and still maintained the key elements of the original if i had to make a change i would say leaving out the dragon was not the best move but all in all mulan delivers
Sep 20 2020,negative,they removed all the highlights from the animated version by pretending to do a more adult approach but the dialogue was very childish and the chimagical aspect felt so out of place this mulans arc was disappointing as she was already a skilled warrior but her only struggle was to admit she was a badass and a woman thats far away from inclusive and progressive
Sep 20 2020,negative,so much potential such a disappointment
Sep 20 2020,positive,loved it love mulan shes a badass and this is well depicted here the landscapes are so pretty
Sep 20 2020,negative,there was no chemistry between the actors the entire movie sounded dubbed in english even though the cast was speaking english and the scripting was just cringeworthy  it was just a bad movie
Sep 20 2020,positive,this was my favorite remake so far
Sep 20 2020,positive,went into this movie expecting the worse happy to say far from it i throughly enjoyed this movie great fight scene after fight scene i maybe from an older generation but i could careless about any message this movie is suppose to give i wanted to just watch an a kicking movie dont care if your a man or a woman this movie gave me that and then some ive seen 1000s of movies over time and many had zero messages in them i dont understand this generation thinking every movie needs to give us a message went into this movie just wanting action pack and disney delivered that to me so thank you disney
Sep 20 2020,positive,disneys liveaction adaptation of the acclaimed 1998 animated film in which a young chinese maiden disguises herself as a male warrior in order to save her father even if it a worthy and more realistic and accurate retelling of the story of the ballad of mulan one cant help but miss some of the favourite characters of the previous version as well as the comedy and the catchy songs from the musical especially when some instrumental pieces of some of the songs are present in the score it is a visually striking movie with interesting new characters decent fighting and excellent costumes and sets
Sep 20 2020,negative,cultural and tradition inaccuracies some architectural inaccuracies misleading portrayals wardrobe errors make up errors this movie is a trainwreck with no character developments bad scriptwritings and is an insult to the chinese culture at best this is a watered down chinese takeout this shows how shallow western understanding of chinese culture is
Sep 20 2020,negative,it just isnt mulan  most of the disney live action remakes have been very true to the original movie and this one just isnt disappointing
Sep 20 2020,positive,the key to enjoying this movie is to go into it with new eyes what most people may not realize is that the tale of mulan is not a story created by disney it is based on a legendary chinese tale this movie is another take on that tale most people disappointed with it are so because they compare it to the animated version this is a guaranteed way to easy disappointment this movie is done with more focus on the story being historically appropriate and grounded in traditional aspects of the story keep this in mind and you will probably enjoy the movie i managed to approach seeing this movie without bias of the animated classic thanks to the early reviews i saw and read thats when i noticed almost every criticism had to do with how it compared to the animated release most of the favorable reviews tended to be from this movies own take of story of mulan do yourself a favor dont watch the movie expecting the animated movie reshot as live action this is a new telling with a different take and dynamics clear your mind and watch it for what it is and you might find you like it it has some different elements and events to put its spin so be open minded and you might find a lot to like
Sep 20 2020,negative,to put it in perspective the animated film would be like reading the book and the live film would be its movie so many details changed and others missing
Sep 20 2020,negative,its like they isolated everything successful about mulan and took it out also somehow forgot that the pitfalls of tragic emotion come when they are preceded by levity also they decided character development wasnt essential for me to care about anyone
Sep 20 2020,negative,no quality message plot is disconnected and there is no character development poor attempt at recreating what was mulan
Sep 20 2020,negative,i really think there is so much potential in this movie but failed to deliver the story line fall short of our expectation
Sep 20 2020,positive,i had seen mixed reviews on this film so to form my own opinion we ordered it i have to say i was pleasantly surprised by the performances of the main characters in my opinion all of the characters that played central roles in this film had an emotional connection to each character that made their performances believable but more then that it made their performances enjoyable to watch the actress liu yifei played the character of mulan with depth and conviction that showed she truly took the role seriously my whole family loved the movie including my teenage daughter and son we cant hardly get my teenage kids in the same room together let    alone to watch a full movie together lol so thats also how i grade the likeability of this film because if my busy teenage kids literally stopped everything including putting down there phones to watch a disney movie especially during these times then you know that they are truly enjoying the film so as i stated before everyone has their own thoughts and opinions on what they likedislike when it comes to many different aspects in life cinema in my opinion is no different i believe this film was a beautiful live action remake that will complement the disney franchise for many years to come  i cant wait to see what else disney has up its sleeves for the future
Sep 20 2020,negative,was nothing like the animation and was really blah wife didnt like it either 
Sep 20 2020,negative,the trailer made it seem like it would be serious like crouching tiger hidden dragon or a serious version of the original disney cartoon mulan used her magic powers rather than her brain like in the original to solve problems her signature spear kick reminds me of stephen chows kick from shaolin soccer
Sep 20 2020,negative,i had heard it was bad and it was the animated mulan had such a good message about women being able to do anything that a man can do this movie had a different message the message was that if youre bien with jedisuperpowers then you can be something great not the message i want for my daughter the whole time during the movie you keep waiting for the music you love and it never arrives the movie feels hollow and rushed with zero character development and just never pulls you in honestly 010 will never watch again 
Sep 19 2020,negative,its not the worst movie in the world but it aint great
Sep 19 2020,negative,while being big budget and undeniably beautiful the live action mulan in no way will ever live up to its animated counterpart from the strange chosen one aspect of the way the writers chose to present mulan to the lack of heart the entire movie seems to radiate to endorse this film is a waste of time and money the entire idea of feminism and the bridge between chinese and american culture is completely forgotten about and the lines themselves feel so dry and so far removed from what normal speech is i forgot how to talk after watching it performance wise the movie itself was lack luster liu yifei playing a disappointing main character failing to give her character any life whatsoever editing wise the shots feel quick and scenes where emotional qualities should have shined through failed to do so lack of comedic relief and a literal witch added into the movie strip the film of its disney and more importantly its chinese identity while lack of diversity beyond the big screen itself prove to be the epitome of representation of diversity purely for a money grab im so disappointed as a chinese american woman i feel alienated from this movie thanks a lot disney
Sep 19 2020,negative,a twisted version of the original with all the best bits removed
Sep 19 2020,negative,disappointingly boring the father in the movie was pretty good and the writing for him was good but the rest was honestly almost cringe i went in hopeful but it ended up being a chore to finish the film   disappointed i liked the first mulan
Sep 19 2020,negative,i am not a tough critic whatsoever there have only been 2 big movies in my life that i regretted paying fo see this is one of them so disappointed with disney terrible acting reminds me of a hallmark movie everything about it awful
Sep 19 2020,negative,mulan was never my favorite disney classic but taking away the og parts that made it fun ruined the newer take on the character
Sep 19 2020,positive,it didnt couldnt live up to the hype but it was enjoyable enough
Sep 19 2020,positive,for me is one of the best live action that disney has made i really enjoy the idea to change a big part of the story and i think that the movie does a good job in bringing representation to the asian comunity my only problem its that i dont really like the concept from where the power and brave of mulan is coming
Sep 19 2020,negative,disney ruined one of its most classical movies all good was taken away i idnt care much about mushu or the songs but they made something entirely diferrent the whole point of this movie was to shown a normal young woman whi desides to take her destiny on her hands by taking her fathers place intead we have a girl who was already powerful and basically decides to go war to proof her father wrong stead of protecting him as a movie alone it dosent work either awful story afwul effects aside the controversy around where it was filmed and the actress  really a bad movie
Sep 19 2020,negative,the plot was strange and unsatisfying they had to justify her being able to fight at all by having super special chi instead of working hard to get there mushu was replaced by a deus ex machina phoenix thing there was no character development i really didnt enjoy it waste of 30
Sep 19 2020,negative,buring and very changed super mulan skywalker next avengers
Sep 19 2020,positive,im satisfied with this movie i feel happy after watching it i cried a few times the choice of stunts for the ending fight scenes could have been better yes mulan is like wonderwoman or lara croft towards the end but its alright whats there to look forward to beautiful scenery details in the costumes touching interaction with mulan and her father donnie yen fight moves mulans other comrades in the training camp eg handsomefunny asian actors actress gong li has many scenes bad guy jason scott lee also has many scenes jet li in elaborate emperor costume the romance is special no touching required romance tension between mulan and her love interest puts a smile on my face im glad its good movie
Sep 19 2020,negative,a plain uninspired forgettable emotionless badly written poorly paced horribly edited piece of adaptation with 200 million usd one would hope at least a decent technical execution but the editing is so bad i wonder where all that budget went the sfx are not bad but not good either hoped more for 200 million   it boasts being more adult and culturally accurate but it isnt apparently the adults would have difficulty understanding the scenes without obvious inyourface dialogues and useless narration for an adulttake the script sure is very cringey the cultural representation is a joke they even miss the point of the rabbit story from the poem the costumes and the makeups are ugly and they are not accurate   mulan is another mary sue born with superpower without any personality the straightfaced acting doesnt help either chi disrobes the meaning of female empowerment entirely if you are not born with powerful chi then sorry you are not a strong independent woman you can only bring honour to the family by getting married new characters introduced witch new love interest can be interesting if explored more but instead we get superficial interactions   the addition of phoenix is laughable not only does it look fake looks like a kite it has no purpose to the narrative at all aside from being a gps if the creators wanted to omit mushu then stick to it and dont give us this halfassed replacement changing the love interest from shang to the new guy is weird and butchered the meaning of the character entirely again the new love interest doesnt serve anything to the plot better off without him side characters are forgettable and useless unlike 1998s yao ling and chien po who were essential to the narrative   there are more things to say but this review is quite long already better off watching the 1998 version for an enjoyable wellexecuted nicely paced mature coherent film or the many chinese versions for a more accurate adaptation
Sep 19 2020,negative,what would make a great movie even better remove all the character development and struggles that show who that character is and replaces it with magic
Sep 19 2020,positive,i think the film isnt bad it has very good times which we understand could have been much better you have to see her to have an opinion on her it has excellent photography good effects good rhythm it just falls into the narrative
Sep 19 2020,neutral,i expected more than just constant action scenes which is good sometimes but my biggest disappointment is that there wasnt lot of things that were in the cartoon such as the talking dragon
Sep 19 2020,negative,this movie has nothing to do with feminism or equality its suppose to be about mulan taking her fathers place in a war in order to protect him shes suppose to be normal not all powerful where was mushu why is there a witch why was this movie made
Sep 19 2020,negative,this movie was atrocious do some research they got basically everything wrong removed all agency from the character by giving her the equivalent of force powers
Sep 19 2020,negative,if this was categorized as a comedy it would make more sense have a few spirited drinks before you watch so you can laugh instead of being upset
Sep 19 2020,positive,i was not expecting this to be such a great movie i love this movie mulan is such a great role model for young girls she has so much integrity in this movie which she didnt have in the cartoon mulan was bothered by her lie and eventually told the truth i love how the war scenes were exciting but not violent no profanity no sex family and honor thank you disney i hope there is a mulan ii
Sep 19 2020,negative,leave it to disney to make a plain vanilla movie of an epic they made this flick because it is not a real movie for 12 year old girls the fights were mediocre the story was expected nothing left to the imagination acting was good directing was bad
Sep 19 2020,negative,personally prefer the liveaction movie of 2009 hua mulan this new version its boring in parts and the vissual effects was lower of qualitys in some escenes
Sep 19 2020,negative,worst live action of disney history is too bad effects are horrible all the movie is so boring
Sep 18 2020,positive,if you go into this film without the expectation of a disney musical and just enjoy the film for what it isit becomes a very enjoyable experience
Sep 18 2020,positive,this film recalls the history of animation in several aspects but it is not possible to create links with the characters because the plot develops very fast apart from that the film treats mulan as someone special something like super powers there is no work of conquest finally the creators said that they wanted to bring this film closer to reality so it would not include animated characters but a witch that turns into birds and people walking on the walls is very close to reality
Sep 18 2020,negative,the movie tried to be more loyal with the original poem but it ended up being boring and a shadow of the animated super boring
Sep 18 2020,positive,disney were not reusing some elements from previous successful animated movie for the sake of respecting and faithful to the source material    me i respect that and cant wait to see it    disney adds tons of new and unnecessary elements that is not in the source material resulting in a not so faithful adaptation to the source material except maybe the basic plot     me 
Sep 18 2020,positive,i really enjoyed retelling of the animated film  how they shot it made it okay not to have musical numbers and also having eddie murphys mushu not be there  great action great message  i still think it is dumb for to pay an extra 30 to get it on a streaming service i already pay to use
Sep 18 2020,positive,my kids wanted the talking dragon but still enjoyed the movie
Sep 18 2020,negative,disney should leave the movies as they are instead of doing this live action movies that nobody likes and have nothing to do with the original movie
Sep 18 2020,negative,where to begin with   sfx made me want to vomit dont even let me begin about the fighting scenes  since when is there a witch in the story of mulan the whole legend that is mulan is a symbol of female empowerment and now its about mystical magic powers mulan could have been anyone that was the whole point here shes the chosen one because her strength is only due to her chi   no problem solving nothing no character growth   you know whats hilarious about this movie though the story of mulan was one of female empowerment and emancipation from traditional gender roles moreover the condition of women in society and at the end of the fucking movie we get to see mulans dear little sister wait for it getting married that fact is being welcomed i am at loss for words
Sep 18 2020,negative,terrible  boring  
Sep 18 2020,negative,so this movie you dont see mushu which is wack also apparently theres a love connection with one of the soldiers when in the original animation she falls for the commander smh  this movie was very disappointing yes it does have some good fights  but this movie shows a witch mulan exposes herself  not because she got hurt and basically got expose by accident  theres is no music at all smh not worth to pay 30 to watch it
Sep 18 2020,negative,wow how can anyone watch this movie without laughing constantly at the bad dialogue wooden acting poor script and constant stream of amusingly illogical plot points whoever directed this film needs to go back to film school
Sep 18 2020,negative,terrible movie completely ruined the message of the original story the main character is a mary sue with zero character flaws the logic of the magic system is completely lacking furthermore most characters act opposite to the next logical step in their progression doing things that never ever ever would actually happen
Sep 18 2020,positive,ive always loved the movie and the liveaction version is just as amazing in its own way
Sep 18 2020,negative,seriously aside from being historically inaccurate as they were going for taking away the enjoyment the original had and sucking away all the plot had to hold in the previous film mulan 2020 is without a doubt disneys worst live action adaptation and not worth the asking price
Sep 18 2020,negative,not at all close to the original at all
Sep 18 2020,negative,the characters had no development so there was no emotional attachment like in the animation mulan was portrayed as always being a powerful lady when it would have been much more effective showing her struggle to progress in the difficult times   disney promised cultural accurateness but it was far from accurate according to chinese culture and history   even the fighting scenes had an awkward camera shot style that made the whole thing feel tacky and cheap rather than epic or cool   i do not understand how a budget this big produced something so poor
Sep 18 2020,negative,boring with no magic
Sep 18 2020,negative,it absolutely sucked it was a complete waste of my time not very many things that i would consider redeemable in this film disney is taken their old movies and turning them into crappy remakes
Sep 18 2020,negative,mulan used to be my favorit of al disney movies but this new one feels like something they did on budget
Sep 17 2020,negative,a average film which is very inferior compared to the walt disney animated original even though they have made it as original as possible by staying faithful to the true events but however the acting was average the story was average due to removal and adding of certain major characters but the action and visuals were really good but that does not make up for a good movie   i will give mulan a 25 star rating
Sep 17 2020,negative,worst movie adaptation of a disney character i have ever seen the movie was really bad and the main character actresses did a really bad performance
Sep 17 2020,negative,this movie was a flaming pile of hot garbage i am so mad i paid 35 for this abomination     the fighting scenes sucked     they took out all of the meaningful scenes from the original movie    there wasnt any gravity to the movie the stakes were so low its not even funny the villains seemed like they were from a 1940s batman and robin live action tv show the villain wasnt even remotely scary it was just an angry looking dude with too much makeup on     the show was so bad i wish i could go back in time and  unwatch it my time would have been much better spent doing literally a million other things     i would rather eat a rotten tomato than watch this straight to dvd movie again     more like straight to vhs
Sep 17 2020,negative,boring fight scenes are dull and short acting is preposterous dialogues seem like written by a 6yearold and man that directing though has some sparks of genius feels amateur 98 of the time it really bothers me that having a nice set for epic battles and inside a magical world they took no risks at all take the final fight against the antagonist for example it couldve been amazing but it was short boring and unskilful just ridiculous good story line i think but very fast development i mean it took 10 seconds to transform the witch for crying out loud feels like the last season of got all over again on the other hand the scenery is nice and descent effects skip this one
Sep 17 2020,negative,no comment for this movie so bad
Sep 17 2020,negative,it sucks chii whats that the first mulan was better she won against mongols with its intelligence and effort here only with her chi
Sep 17 2020,negative,what i disliked the most about the movie is that they removed most of the original characters from the cartoon version such as mushu li shang cirlee which was very disappointing some points of the movie was completely different story lines so i wouldnt recommend it or watch a 2nd time
Sep 17 2020,negative,worst live action reboot so far  none of the original songs  half the fun characters are missing  the plot is so so much worse  they took as story about a woman working hard to achieve her goals while the whole world is against her into a woman born with powers and everyone just treats her like shes special  why work hard when you can be born with magic right  oh and dont expect to see fan favorites like mushu apparently disney wanted this to be a grim and boring movie with 0 comedy  stop doing live action remakes if youre just going to make sh worse
Sep 17 2020,negative,disney has lost its magic and theyre just resting on their laurels    mulan might be the worst movie disney has ever made the editing was atrocious the story didnt captivate and no characters were likable in any way a live action movie should be additive to the canon not change it altogether and change the whole plot    animated mulan showed that women are equal with men with the same type of traininglive mulan showed that you have to be born special to even be noticed by men
Sep 17 2020,negative,this is a movie for kids only mulan is an ordinary women at first not hidden talented super hero she fights her lifetakes her dads responsibility to become a warrior during twelve year miltary life not by using something called chi this story comes from the real histroy and demonstrates how brave  strong a women could be overall the movie fails to express any of those ideas instead just putting every boring moments together so sad
Sep 17 2020,negative,much worse than the cartoon original this one is exactly the same except it lacks not only the eddie murphy dragon but also the best song
Sep 17 2020,negative,i fell asleep while watching the movie its tedious i cant feel anything
Sep 17 2020,positive,i must admit i was a little disappointed in this film with all the hype the awesome trailers and build up i was expecting something a little more epic that is not me saying the movie is bad or anything its just not the epic it thinks it is  while i do adore niki caro the director and her 2002 film whale rider shes seems like the wrong person to have been tagged to make this feature whale rider was a slower smaller and more personal film which i think fits her skill set here we have a movie that should be  on the level of something like the lord of the rings films or at least the goofy fun of the first pirate of the caribbean movie atlas just because she hails from new zealand it doesnt make her peter jackson       my first problem is i feel the feminism message gets lost in underdevelopedunder written characters instead of saying a woman can do anything a man can and maybe even better it makes it seem mulan is the exception to the rule while she was born to kick ass and chew bubble gum and shes all out of bubble gum  most of the other women characters fit the normal weak woman trope meh i guess its not too distracting as the movie is indeed about mulan and not the other women but i found this to be an oversight that could had been easily remedied with another look at the script     second and this is a big big problem i had with the film is how the action scenes were shot i really hate jump cuts its a cheap way to film a fight scene you see a fist fly but you never see the landing you just see the guy on the ground its how western film makers shoot actions scenes with stars who dont know anytype of martial arts or fighting style some films it works well bourne identity or badly the taken sequels  ive seen many of these same chinese actors in other action films served better just go back and watch the great donny yen in any of his past hong kong action films youll see what i mean im thinking they should have shot the fight scenes with a more hong kongnese is that a word martial arts film sensibility maybe this aspect of the feature wont bother you as much as it bothered me but i just hate watching talented performers appearing to give subpar performances when its not their fault at all       i dunno since it is indeed a chinese story maybe they should have gotten a chinese director with a history of kung fu epics under his or her belt ang lee comes to mind      lastly and i know westerners will at least disagree with me but i dont care i hated hated hated hated hated that it was in english ive seen all these actors before and most of them in non english films  i felt the feature would have been better served in mandarin or cantonese with english subtitles      final thoughts its a middle tier disney that for once i thought needed to be updated into the live action format is it the classic it wants to be no but i think you wont have a bad time the film i didnt 35 three out of 5 stars
Sep 17 2020,negative,the 1998 mulan animated classic has always been my favorite one of my favorite movies i was sorely disappointed with the direction they decided to take with the recreation the qi was an interesting idea that could have been employed in a much more empowering way for mulan2020 had they not made her already adept in the use of this life force power and had it be part of her potential developed through training in the same way that they had mulan1998 develop her skills as a solider what set mulan1998 apart from other soliders in the imperial army was not magic not some special ability it was a different way of thinking a more inquisitive mind and solutions that most would not have come up with it praised her individuality without the need for her being inherently special and this conveyed to viewers that anyone can be do great things because there is no special ingredient necessary this message was sadly lost in mulan2020 and the messages and life lessons conveyed by many of these classics should never be lost on top of all that they took out mushu and some much needed comic relief
Sep 17 2020,negative,really bad movie bad plot good acting but just that i would never recomend this movie to anyone if you wanna make a adaptation of a classic dont take out important characters and if you dont want musics in a disney movie simply dont make a adaptation adaptation of a musical with great characters to a bad movie with no music only in the credits and take out good characters i will never forgive u disney for making mulan a wall walker yeah you saw rigth mulan and everyone else can simply walk in the wall wow omg isaac newton is impressed 0510 trash
Sep 17 2020,negative,im sorry but this movie is complete garbage
Sep 17 2020,negative,it didnt bring the childhood memories bad movie
Sep 17 2020,negative,even as a stand alone movie no relationship to the disney animated version this movie was plain bad just boring     and then when you compare it to the animated film its just awful
Sep 17 2020,positive,id say its the best of the disney live action remakes but its not even worth comparing because its in a whole different league in an attempt to appeal to china were the original famously flopped because it was seen as not chinese enough they decided to make this one a straight up classic wuxia film with story elements from the original disney version but then again the overall structure of both is pretty similar to the original folk poem   theres some awkwardness in the conversion the matchmaker scene is by far the weakest as it clearly doesnt go well with the themes of the new one they both do their own thing dont expect the uber feminist systemic dissection of the originalwhich i adore but rather something more fitting for a story originating in ancient china a more classic heros journey with some feminist undertones this shift is clear in how they handled the use of reflection music from the original it was originally mulans lament over not fitting in the gender binary presented by society the new mulan isnt a simple country girl however she is a warrior she wants to fight but instead of being held back by the feminity expected of her its the other way around her powers are held back by pretending to be a man   dont take this too literally but if the original could in some ways show the experience of a non binary person the new one in some ways depicts the experience of a transgender woman   now while its nowhere near as well written and thematically weaker than the 1998 film it makes up for its biggest flaws compared to the animated films like aladdin the lion king hunchback beauty and beast etc the original mulan didnt really have a strong sense of place and the action was dramatically watered down in the final act the new mulan however is simply a kick ass action film and perhaps even more importantly it does something rarely seen in action these days it has time to breath when was the last time you saw an action film where the main character doesnt fight until 23 into the film and we even get a big training montageclassic wuxia stuff  theres an interesting duality in the original poem   no sound of her parents hailing their girl  just the rumbling waters of the yellow river and later we see  no sound of her parents hailing their girl  just the cries of barbarian cavalry in the yan hills with its mix of beautifully shot nature and quiet moments and loud goofy action this film perfectly matches this sentiment
Sep 17 2020,negative,in the animated film mulan became a hero in live action mulan was born a hero throw some magic in it and take all the magic moments of the originak one the villain is also bad again in the original the villain is just angry at everyone who stands in his way in the live action he just hates mulan because she is a woman boring and i can say meaningless there are some fine moments but nothing special rotten as hell
Sep 17 2020,negative,i just wanted to turn it off but i couldnt  i kept telling myself it would get better it didnt the the child in me died a little like that feeling you get when someone runs there fingers nails down a chalkboard
Sep 17 2020,negative,it was pretty much a x men film  it wasnt mulan at all as an australian born chinese woman i felt like the only representative character i had in the media while growing up was utterly destroyed by this film there was no reason to give her super abilities theres very little character development and felt like it was written by people who had not idea of the cultural significance of the story
Sep 17 2020,positive,i dont understand why theres bad reviews i truly love this movie the actress that plays mulan did  an amazing job not to mention all the other actors that made the movie what it is i understand that people might be upset because theres no singalongs but it was one of my favorite movies that has been redone so far when it comes to going from animation to live action they nailed it
Sep 17 2020,negative,now this mulan shes not like other girls    shes rey  rey skywalker 
Sep 17 2020,negative,no blood in war no dirt in war but have on tranning mulan not smart villian really stupid script not have any impression  no wow moment     disney should stop making live action that downgrade thier cartoon editon  cartoon version is more better
Sep 17 2020,negative,terrible movie with bad acting and poor storytelling even if you watch it for free its not worth your time to watch 0 star
Sep 17 2020,negative,sumary she has super power cause she is mulan then she out match the soldiers then she easily defeat the bad guy
Sep 17 2020,positive,did the movie production team really understand this story and the meaning behind the story obviously the they didnt understand mulan at all and didnt understand the history so they just made her into a princess with superhero power rather than mulan this character
Sep 17 2020,positive,i only wish i could have seen this on a big screen
Sep 17 2020,negative,this movie is trash they took a classic and ripped it apart into a b rated martial arts movie
Sep 17 2020,negative,not only is the cgi terrible they managed to take away everything remotely likeable about the original and failed at any kind of memorable momments nothing in it seemed to land on top of that its false female empowerment almost insulting really and completely fails at reaching an appropriate cultural relevance and not only that also creating a political and public nightmare outside of the movie i could go on about how i literally didnt like anything about this movie but it would take me hours
Sep 16 2020,negative,this movie is in the top 10 worst things to happen in 2020   uneven in pacing dead and wooden performances this movie could not have been worse i have a million negative things to say about this movie but i will restrain myself
Sep 16 2020,positive,okay so i am going to rate this film a 355 while ignoring the fact this was a remake of another film when i do think about it being a remake this is a 15 didnt even add a singsong in the film they wanted a girl worth fighting for and needed to sing that dont get me started on the phoenix and it not being our main man    but to be mature about this i think the movie was well made and the story was still interesting the violence for this film took me by surprise but fair enough disney make a bad ass princess with crazy fight scenes it had decent actors and was enjoyable i was happy to see how the story developed the way it did and was not disappointed by the ending if the producers didnt have to loosely base it off mulan then they could have made a lot better of a movie which was still in the same era and location thats just my personal opinion anyway    yours sincerely  big s
Sep 16 2020,negative,they removed everything that made the 98 movie such a classic and instead gave us a bland movie with no heart and a mulan with none of the charm and intelligence that made her one of the best characters disney has ever created
Sep 16 2020,negative,really disappointing and dumbed down version of the original the theme is really confusing as well following a chosen one story template for a be yourself message which doesnt have to be incompatible but certainly sends mixed signals here i dont think theres any value added by giving mulan magic powers either competent film making but its a hard pass
Sep 16 2020,negative,what made mulan a feminist icon was that she was average in every way she worked hard and engaged in problem solving to compensate for areas where she was weaker any woman could be mulan because mulan was just like every other woman the movie showed women and men as equal because during their training they all start off badly but the train and work and all of them improve the significance of that was that it showed that gender wasnt the deciding factor in success when each gender is given an equal and unbiased opportunity then they gave this mulan super powers and had her fight for a patriarchal monarchy that supports oppression rather than her fighting on behalf of her father and her peers great no woman or man could ever hope to be as good as mulan and mulan fights for oppression rather than for familycoolgreat job
Sep 16 2020,neutral,so this took me a while to want to even make a review on this filmbecause i needed some time to think about how i felt about this filmlets just say i felt conflicted when i first saw itnow i just hate this filmand heres whywarning   spoiler reviewbut honestly who cares its not like everyone is going to spend 30 on a streaming service for this film but if u dont want this to be spoiledthen dont read thisbut if u do so u dont need to spend 30then stick aroundwell the best way i can describe this film is by doing comparisons between both films    so in the original mulan the way it starts is at night time and the huns and there leader shan yu climbs the great wall of china and well attacksnow in the remakethe beginning starts off with showing mulan as a child and we find out she has a power called chiand it makes her powerfulshes able climb up on top of roofs and do  parkour type stuff and somehow able to jump off a top roof without getting hurtanyway then we get introduced to our main villiansthis time there called the rourans and the leader name is bori khansorry no offense but i cant take those names seriouslythe rouranssounds like moronsbur u might as well call them moronsespecially when i describe what they do in a certain sceneanyway when we first see themwe see the shape shifting witchabsorbing into a citizen and and that  possessed person heads into a cityand then the rourans start riding towards the city then they jump off their horses and run up the side of the walloh yeah so realisticand dont forget that disney said they made this movie realisticand oh yeah this whole scene happened in broad daylightso its less intense in my opinion and then we get introduce to mulan familyin the originalher family was her mother and father and auntnow in this new film she has no aunt she is replaced with a sisterand her only characteristics is she is afraid of spiderstake that as u willalso i have a challenge out therecount the amount of times they say the word chi in this filmtrust me it will hurt ur brain just like mineoh and mulan in this movie is the chosen oneessentiallyso disney took there best feminist hero and turned her into a mary sueof course why the heck not  for those who dont know what a mary sue isits a woman that has no conflict and is powerful and overall just a perfect characterand thats what mulan is like in this filmher conflict in the original film wastrying to keep her identity a secret and trying to bring honor to her familynow the conflict in this film for her is of course bringing honor but its mainlyhm maybe i shouldnt hide mt chi because if i do it weakens ithmmmmmalso the moral of the story i got from the original was even any woman can do and be whatever they wantnow the morals i got from this mulan ishey if ur a female and ur already perfect and have superpowersdont let men hold u back otherwise it will make ur superpowers weakerthats what i got from this film jesus lordoh and the matchmaker scene is in this filmand its dumbthis time mulan has her sister and mother in the same roomand this time instead of a cricketnow its a spider and mulan puts a pot over the spider to protect her sisterbut the matchmaker made her love the pot back in the spot it was inand the cgi spider jumps in the air the matchmaker screams and falls over and knocks the table over and then mulan gets on the table and catches the cups and the the teapot on her feet and the tip of chopsticks she was holdingyeah dont worry its dumber then the way im describing itand somehow that brings disgrace to her familythe matchmaker said u failed at raising a good daughterand im just sitting there baffled saying howshe tried to save the cups from fallingand its the matchmaker fault the cups and teapot flew in the airright im not even halfway describing this film and as u can see i went on a long rantfor just the first 15 minanywayremember that scene where its night time and its pouring rain and she leaves in the middle of night and she puts on her father armor and takes his sword and cuts her hairguess what thats cut out of this filmsee what i did therethey cut out that sceneand just has her pointing his sword then it cuts to her already having the armor on then she just leavesand the next day her family finds out she leftnot in the middle of the night like in the originalbut during the morning in broad daylightthats when they found out she leftsighanyway there no shane in this movie because disney was afraid of the idea of mulan dating her superioror lieutenantoh and this film has no singing or music and or mushuor comedyto go for realismsurenothing says realistic then a shape shifting witch and defining gravity and a phoenix and superpowersso she gets to the camp and well training happensand guess what they cut out the make a man out of u music montage scenesighand instead of the pole they climb on top ofin this film they walk up a mountain while holding 2 buckets of water on each side of the armand no she doesnt  strategize on how to climb up the pole with those 2 heavyweights like in the originalin this film she just walks up the mountainno strategy or anythingshe just does it because she perfectalso this film is pg13but the violence doesnt feel pg13 worthyno blood and then theres scenes where bad guys and good guys get knocked out instead of being killedin a war movieanyway so the avalanche scene is in this moviebut insteadthe battle is on green fields thats underneath the snowy mountainsso mulan starts chasing down bori khan and his men that start ridding awaythats right bori khan and some of his men leave the battleanyway mulan bumps into the witchspeaking of the witchshe is way to similar to darth vader she is basically a chinese female darth vaderher lines are to similar  at one point she said to mulanjoin me and together well be powerfulhm sounds familiaroh wait a minjoin me and together well rule the galaxyand then near the end of the film the witch redeems herself and helps mulan by leading her to bori khan and he shoots an arrow toward mulan and the witch turns into a hawk and flys towards mulan and gets shot and then dies in mulans armsdisney what are u doing this isnt star warsthis is mulanso mulan gets a ninja star tossed towards her from the witch and it doesnt even harm her or anything she just sits up and pulls it out like its nothing  and yet everyone else who had a ninja star tossed at them it killed themof coursebecause nothing can harm herpfffffanyways she rides back to battle and she decides to take off her armorwhatthats the most dumbest thing ive heardtaking ur armor off during battlemakes about as much sense as a person not wearing riot gearat a riotbut fine whatever sure of course shes invincible at this pointanyway she goes out into battle and using her chishes now able to kick spears our of the air and kick it into peoples chestsand able to dodge swords and spears almost hitting herso then the soldiers bundle up together and hold their shields  out to protect them because the morons start tossing fire  ball rocks towards them and on impact to the peopleit causes an explosionsighwhatok thats it officially physics have been tossed out the windowso mulan plans to take helmets and put them behind the morons and put the on rocks and then start shooting arrows towards them to make it look like there men shooting at the moronsand yes she was able to do all of this while the morons were refilling there catapulthow u may askbecause the script says soso hehehehehehear this outthey turned the catapult around  and shoot it at the so call soldiersbut yet they cartoonsihly missedthey shoot the fire rock at the mountain instead of it hitting the so call menwow this really makes the villains look really competentcongrats filmso the avalanche kills majority of the moronsand mulan gets discovered just because she had her disguise offand she gets banishedthe witch finds her tells her bori khan and his men are going to go kill the emperor but of course after kidnapping himso mulan  no less then 3 min go back to the soldiers to tell then after they told her if she shows her face

finallygood riddancenow my rating on this film3810not worth 30 dollarsbut who knows u guys might like this film its hard to ssy i mean mt parents enjoyed it
Sep 16 2020,neutral,looking at the reception that this new version of mulan got at least among general audience not the critics one can arrive to a conclusion that many viewers did not get what disney did here and why it did it or at least they did not like it but since nobody as far as i heard really talks about how new mulan is a wuxia movie and that it is made so because creators wanted it feel more connected to the chinese roots of the original story i am going with the first one this movie is not really a remade version of 1998 disney classic its a retelling of the same story that it was based on now the real question is does it all make it a better movie my answer to that is not really i like wuxia cinema as much as any other guy but lets be honest we all love disney renaissance movies a lot more well maybe not all of us but i do and while i respect and even praise disneys attempts to mix things a little bit with their live action remakes this particular one did not captivate me one bit and not because it is so different from the earlier movie  i just did not feel like wuxia on that particular evening that i watched it
Sep 16 2020,positive,not bad for a disney remake
Sep 16 2020,negative,honestly i wanted to love this movie unfortunately it was incredibly boring and didnt show any depth to any aspect the characters were boring to watch and the plot was changed in unnecessary ways the other live action disney adaptations have been much stronger for the most part because they didnt change the story to the point of being almost unrecognizable also one great thing about the original mulan is the music this had references to great songs that everyone loves but they didnt add any of them plus if you can have a witch and a giant phoenix but not a dragon companion for comic relief  lame there was nothing to add any sort of comic relief and i cant see kids getting invested in this childrens movie at all
Sep 16 2020,negative,has nothing to do with the past movie that was released in the 1998 mulan has no character instead of being about family and love and empowering women has become about defending the empire that makes no since when mulan in the 1998 was just a random women who didnt want her father to fight in the war she was never part of the empire i could go on but it was just trouble
Sep 16 2020,positive,a pity not to take advantage of the soundtrack of the original film which detracts from the film in my opinion they wanted to make a bruce lee movie with a disney background but something failed to make the mix work
Sep 16 2020,negative,bad movie took out good characters took out all the comedy took out all the musicals just bad and boring and they even thanked the concentration camp workers in xinjiang do not recommend watching at all
Sep 16 2020,negative,the storyline does not make any sense
Sep 16 2020,negative,the visuals are oftentimes the only redeeming part of this movie it kinda takes a steaming dump all over the ballad of mulan and the concept of chi
Sep 16 2020,negative,god this movie is atrocious
Sep 16 2020,negative,there was literally no character development for mulan she was just perfect from the beginning nothing makes her as relatable or memorable as the animated movie they were trying to remake
Sep 16 2020,negative,it lacked a certain something great colours and a nice retelling of the original ballad but the camera work was pretty bad awkward angles the special effectscgi were pretty pour quality for a disney production and the story felt incomplete it seemed as though the whole production of it was done with little to no care the acting was the best thing about it perhaps there was too much hype before the release perhaps im being too harsh i was really disappointed
Sep 16 2020,neutral,this movie could have been so much better the biggest issues i had with it that essentially ruined the movie for me was that they never showed mulans father teaching her how to harness her chi we are just left to assume that was how she learned or she somehow was just already amazing at it a 2 minute scene of her father teaching her chi channeling and gungfu would have linked up all the disjointed parts of the story telling also the witch sacrificing herself to save mulan didnt make sense at all they had a minor connection with each other but not enough to elicit the sacrifice especially when she flies up to warn the main protagonist mulan is coming which obviously he will try to kill her so why warn him if you didnt want mulan to die makes no sense
Sep 16 2020,positive,the hype and excitement created by the success of the previous animated version has created a lot of expectation on this movie the chinese fans are too much this is supposed to be a fun and feel good movie if you want a story that stick to the original  character and history then this movie is not for you  please give this movie a pass go and look for a 10 episode drama wherever that tell history of mulan otherwise stop whining grab a popcorn and drink and just enjoy the movie watch with open mind
Sep 16 2020,positive,the movie was heartwarming and inspiring it may not be like the original animated movie but it was really nice
Sep 16 2020,negative,honestly this movie sucks and you know why its a superhero movie about another mary sue who has infinite power
Sep 16 2020,negative,it was 1 long cringe from when mulan was a girl everything that happens just makes you cringe at the tv screen the editor did a terrible job cutting scenes together
Sep 16 2020,negative,dont get confused this movie deserves a rotten score not because of all the controversies surrounding its production but because it is genuinely a terrible story they completely miss the mark on what makes mulan such an iconic character it is perfectly summed up in the ending line of the poem where she clearly states the reason shes as good as her fellow soldiers is that even if men and women are physically different when working together they are the same told through a metaphor with hares but pretty straight forward nonetheless the original did great by this showing how she not only came from nothing trained with everyone and got to be great on her own right but how rejecting the hypermasculine tropes of brute strength and power can achieve more her cleverness and strategic thinking she knows how to harness that strength that she doesnt have to overpower others and how her fellow soldiers learn form her and they too end up rejecting the mans way to defeat the enemy they end up as equals here they pretty much tell us only girls naturally gifted with a divine power can succeed in life you need to be born with it if you plan to be at the level of men its antifeminisim disguised as feminism if you dont have the force sorry qi you have to be matched marry a stranger and bear his children if you are not the one you are her sister and you should be happy with what you got what a horrible message to convey what a betrayal to such an iconic story
Sep 16 2020,positive,gosh this is hard     firstly disney failed by not letting the audience know that this was a reimagination of mulan versus a remake but i will forgive them for this and review this movie independently     pros   the visuals were stunning   the actors were great   the overall storyline was decent    spolier alert    cons   the story felt rushed there were a few scenes that should have been more indulgent but just as you started to feel somethingit was over    since they already changed so much it would have been nice to see mulan take her place on the kings guard or better yet council    the witch did not have to die    this movie just didnt trigger as much emotional attachment from the audience as it could have     overall while i did like the movie it missed the mark set by high expectations i left the movie wondering where the 200 million usd of its budget went totally see it but lower your expectations
Sep 16 2020,positive,a more realistic take and approach to the original mulan
Sep 16 2020,negative,throw back songs in back ground melodies were nice to hear and the fighting was pretty good but the chi and old school hidden string fighting didnt fit im sorry i wasted my time watching this when i could have watched the cartoon version instead disney fucked up  and thats not even getting into the politics around this movie
Sep 16 2020,negative,it tries too hard to please everyone
Sep 16 2020,negative,misunderstood the story was taken somewhere that didnt add anything to the original or animated mulan there was no characters worth watching or getting to know somehow i was left alienated from my own heritage and culture that was an impressive feat in itself
Sep 16 2020,negative,very rushed and it was just silly thismovie isnt worth any money 
Sep 16 2020,positive,and a good movie competently builds the heros journey well directed and produced with normal dialogues but it leaves something to be desired  the weak point is the villain who is very forgettable making the last act of the film weak
Sep 16 2020,positive,great movie to watch with your daughters inspiring
Sep 16 2020,positive,beautiful cinematography loved the modern adaptation of the story line loved the nod to the historical one with the music not really for kids
Sep 15 2020,negative,mulan is a story different to classic princess in distress shes a warrior that needs no saving shes a soldier shes a simbol of equality however they destroy all this work by a simple mistake they made her flawless shes on pair and even surpases her male allies because shes special shes just strong no effort whatsoever exept for her holding back for not accepting herself while her sister as she doesnt have the chi her fait is to be a matched wife so instead of the message of girls are just as good as boys the message is well youre special or you are not
Sep 15 2020,positive,its not a perfect movie but as a childrens movie its pretty good there are just way too many people reviewing this movie with political agendas in 98s mulan she was dragged out into the snow half naked by men after she was exposed as a woman and theres a lot of drag jokes or sissy men jokes in the 98s movie which will be very problematic today so the film did its best to retell the story with a new lens mulan choose to come out as who she truly is a powerful female warrior rather than get exposed by men and dragged out half naked in the snow this is a very important aspect and in the end what we want our children to learn from
Sep 15 2020,negative,did disney not watch the original cartoon if you want to make a movie completely different than the original call it something else disappointed
Sep 15 2020,negative,this is a superhero movie not mulan
Sep 15 2020,positive,there is only one thing that makes me explain if i liked or not  was i concentrated on the film without thinking in other things  yes some films you start to watch them and  you dont get immersed   i havent seen the first one it has a message it talks about family and care love principles we need a light to follow and these kind of films give us some traditional chinese perspective to it   i would recommend the film fights are amazing cgi is fine i liked photography also that is why i give 45 points
Sep 15 2020,negative,horrible adaptation of a great story  who thought is was a good idea to have ninjas in a movie that takes place in china   who thought mulan could only truly be herself with long flowing hairs makeup and no armor   apparently the directors of this movie thought china was this place roughly the size of new york where every construction looks like it was built yesterday and wars are fought by naruto characters
Sep 15 2020,negative,not what i was expecting took out too much of the original animated content irritated i bought it
Sep 15 2020,negative,racist yeah pretty racist
Sep 15 2020,negative,potential is the only word i can think of big sets with big actors but ultimately falls flat character development feels hollow the plot very loosely follows the original
Sep 15 2020,neutral,the movie fails on showing the empowerement of women instead of being how fa mulan grew alongside her male army partners and how she defied the hyper masculinization and hyper feminization of her society we got the story of hua mulan a girl that was an martial arts prodigy since her yooung age and got her place in the army by being more of man than her army partners even in the end after she saved the emperor her father try to defend her even if we know that she can defend herself the movie contains a lot of propaganda but im not gonna even talk about it her sister character was not necessary at all and just destroy the entire plot about how women and men are equal just as a lot of this new movies they dont show how women and men are the same they just go for how some women that are extremely over powered can be alongside man but characters that are not that powered just need to go for the traditional and patriarchal way of things her sister that was not so powerful just had to bring honor ti her family by marrying since she had no powers she can not be an equal to man my other issue is that they got 4  writers and none fo them was chinese or chinese descendant and it shows a lot for starters they used the egyptian phoenix myth instead of the chinese one a lot of the dialogues look like some bad fan fiction some non chinese person with no knowledge of chinese culture wrote on wattpad and finally their biggest sin was using the most important phrase from the ballad of mulan as a fanservice to try to fool people that they understood what the poem was about they failed   but when the two rabbits run side by side  how can you tell the female from the male   overall the movie is entertaining if you dont care about all of this and it pass as a meh movie a good way to throw 2 hours away but not worth 30 dollar to watch it on disney
Sep 15 2020,negative,mulan was supossed to be a normal girl who sacrifices herself for her father however by making her basically a superhero since birth they took away the character growth and the empowerment she gets by training hard and persevering despite the hardships she encounters     the result was boring no compelling characters and no joy at all
Sep 15 2020,positive,mulan is very different from what has already been seen on disney especially for those who expected something more faithful to the 1998 movie   in the beginning in the first speech narrated by hua mulans father this is already clear ignoring this point it is a majestic film with a unique level of beauty even without having the cinema as a support which loses much of the epic characteristic when seen on smaller screens the sad part for me is that the film does not include the songs used in the animation li shang is not part of the plot nor the muchloved dragon mushu and cricket that accompany the heroine throughout the story  and yet its exciting
Sep 15 2020,negative,so take all the fun  laughter and  powerful moments out of the animated movie   make it longer  matrix like  fail at female impowerment and thats the movie     the animated movie is so much better
Sep 15 2020,negative,imagine going from a woman can keep up and even exceed her male peers to a woman can succeed only if she has super powers
Sep 15 2020,negative,its a bad movie it completely misses the point of the original story it is just a cash grab for the chinese market and i hope it fails what was originally was a empowering story about a women growing as a person and saving her country was turned into a poorly made superhero movie with no redeeming features if you want to watch mulan go watch the animated original
Sep 15 2020,negative,i had high hopes for this live action remake of mulan and defied my frugality to pay 30 to watch it on disney  turned out to be a big disappointment  its such a mess that im not sure where to start     zero character development   zero female empowerment   caricatures of asian people and culture   dark magic and superpowers  is this an xmen or maleficent remake   confused genre with no commitment to any particular emotion   use of trebuchet to attack foot soldiers   the list goes on    cinematics are nice which earn the movie 1 star  its unfortunate  ive held favorable views of disneys live action remakes with progressive spins that put their female characters in more 21stcentury compatible positions  the mulan movie 20 years ago was already progressive and lends itself as a convenient canvas to further build up female empowerment but disney did a complete 180 here  do not recommend
Sep 15 2020,negative,the new mulan movie absolutely ruined what made the animated mulan so special they took away her cunning and the fact that she was a normal girl who did amazing things and made her amazing from childhood signaling that you apparently have to be born great to do amazing things disney took the heart out of the movie and trampled on it
Sep 15 2020,negative,visually great insanely boring what happened to the mulan who overcame her weaknesses by applying her strengths and training to grow stronger and more skilled the new mulan has no weaknesses its so boring to watch none of the other soldiers mattered at all  friend or foe
Sep 15 2020,positive,not usually a fan of the disney live action movies  plus the political sway on things is getting old  i also think its ridicules that people are upset they have to pay a premium for a new movie  any true cinema freak would not question the desire of the creatures of a film to not want it to go straight to the dollar menu  overall it was was a good movie with a half decent plot
Sep 15 2020,negative,disappointing and boring
Sep 15 2020,negative,it was a boring movie nothing good or great it wasnt the worst movie ive seen but its definitely not worth paying money for the animated movie outshines this by far
Sep 15 2020,positive,it did lack any sort of comedy which really made it kind of inapropriate for kids its disney so you would think they will make something more appealing to little ones but as an adult i actually liked it the acting and effects were nice story telling also solid 7 out of 10
Sep 15 2020,negative,giving mulan superpowers from birth is like watching rocky run up the steps in philly flawlessly in act one it robbed her of her growth and the story of its power
Sep 15 2020,negative,so disappointed there was so much more character development that could have been done with the soldier buddies the phoenix looked like a paper kite that an advanced art student made by hand this movie came across like a very average chinese period piece i wish we could get a refund so disappointed
Sep 15 2020,negative,i understand the meaning behind developing a film to match the original legend but it didnt feel clean   the dialogue was boring there was so much random foreshadowing and imagery that never went anywhere a really big disappointment
Sep 15 2020,positive,its very worth to watch
Sep 15 2020,negative,dont waste your money and time a lot of scenes were really illogical and could have been executed better
Sep 15 2020,positive,it would have been a good movie if the actors had more than one expression  the rest of the work was good compliments to the crew
Sep 15 2020,negative,i was not overly impressed with it maybe its because there has been a large number of disney action remakes already it just sorta felt like yawnboreit didnt inspire any real feelings of excitement or interest like other disney shows have in the past it may be time for disney to take a break from live action remakes and return to what they did best at one point in time if you are expecting something new and different with this movie youre going to be disappointed
Sep 15 2020,negative,awful it felt like a washup version of the original script with no soul or passion
Sep 15 2020,negative,total gutter trash 20 minutes in and youll want to turn it off and put the 98 cartoon on  what were they thinking
Sep 15 2020,negative,a really subpar remake of a wonderful cartoon the movie lost all the charm humor and integrity that the animated version had
Sep 15 2020,positive,lost all of the original picture slow and boring
Sep 15 2020,positive,disneys 2020 liveaction remake of mulan feels like a pale imitation of something from the chinese actionfantasy genre its beautiful to look at but it lacks soul
Sep 15 2020,negative,its an average action movie nothing memorial nothing spectacular bad edition with characters with a total lack of charisma over all its a terrible recreation of the original animated movie the hole charm of the animated version is missing
Sep 15 2020,negative,aside from all the controversy for everything outside of the film itself this movie misses the point of mulan entirely    mulan is something of a super hero in this movie she inherently has a gift and is special from the start    the basic idea of what mulan should be is that any girl no matter what even if youre not like any others a bit goofy and a bit clumsy can rise up to be a hero of her own story      that basic principle missing from the story 5 minutes in has already ruined the movie add in the countless plot changes and the western ideals of what chinese culture is the only good thing i can say about this movie is the cinematography was good im sure catering probably was great costumes look cool i guess    dont waste your time
Sep 15 2020,negative,acting for main character was wooden family and i were not able to connect with her  characters were flat directing was unimaginative the original animated feature is several orders of magnitude better packed with more nuance and meaning the only character with an arc was the witch     redeeming qualities 1 disney dad was a good guy 2 no eddie murphy as mushu     we had to watch the original disney animation to wash our palates
Sep 15 2020,negative,i would give this 0 stars if i could the magic isnt there the key scenes from 1998 movie werent present i felt nothing throughout the entire movie boring and if i were disney i would take my name off
Sep 15 2020,positive,it wasnt perfect but i see what the writers were trying to accomplish i felt like it lacked depth in some of its characters but mulan shone through i loved watching her embrace her true self and i also enjoyed how it focused mostly on her self discovery rather than her love interest it was also very visually stunning and much more intense than the original which id say added a lot of depth to the movie it was a different take on a classic story while still paying homage to the original despite the controversy and mixed reviews the liveaction mulan is a fresh take on a great story
Sep 15 2020,positive,empowering cultural well edited this movie had incredible moments and a fantastic embodiment of the original cartoon while maintaining an original feel dont listen to the critics especially in 2020 watch it for yourself
Sep 15 2020,negative,despite the action and casting being great mulan 2020 is a huge mess i wanted to like this movie without mushu and not being a musical but this is definitely one of the worst disney live actions in history
Sep 15 2020,negative,out of all the shitty disney remakes this one was one of the worst acting was horrible cinematography was atrocious and the choice to exclude the songs to honor the original chinese tale was a bad decision save your money and wait til its free on disney
Sep 15 2020,negative,disney made a horrible decision of taking away shang and mushu both characters add a special kind of magic to the movie and mulan by herself just makes the movie seem like a mary sue which everyone is tired of the sorceress character addition was pointless and stupid and added a lot of confusion to the plot the dialogue seemed as though it was written by a twelve year old at some points plus the lack of asian representation offscreen was incredibly disappointing id say dont waste your money on this horrible tired out version of a beloved disney classic
Sep 15 2020,negative,this movie is a disgrace to the original quit making these live action movies you greedy corporation
Sep 15 2020,negative,this movie was in my opinion was a letdown    if you come in expecting something similar to the disney animated movie i suggest you should drop those expectations at the door    coming from a standalone movie does allow for a little more wiggle room however i still thought that as a whole lacked a lot of cohesion each scene taken alone i can understand the argument that there was beauty in the design scene by scene the cinematography choreography set design were all well thought out    however stitched together the movie seemed rushed to say the least the overall plot seemed to get rushed through the progression seemed like a storyteller who was running out of town and just rushing to highlight points here and there character development lacked tremendously the movie barely introduced characters beyond a cursory name and relation to mulan seeming more like passing acquaintances than true supporting roles    honestly would just say this would be a movie to watch to pass the time as opposed to a movie you would watch to feel warm inside
Sep 15 2020,positive,the 2020 mulan adaptation is an epic retelling of the story weve all grown to love filled with adventure action and emotion however some of the characters lack the charisma with which we feel in love in the original movie and some scenes feel a little bit rushed mostly in the beginning also the new elements that were unnecessarily added to the story do not help adding plot points and characters that did not need to exist making the story look a bit messy ultimately the new mulan adaptation is a wellcrafted action movie filled with emotional scenes but lacking the magic humor and charisma of the first installment
Sep 14 2020,negative,it ended up being very childish compared to the animated movie
Sep 14 2020,negative,watched with my kids  the whole time i kept hearing this is not mulanthat didnt happenwhere is    argh and besides that its just a bad movie in general  dont care about any of the characters boring and action was ho hum  another horrible live action adaptation  only beauty and the beast has been worth seeing
Sep 14 2020,negative,mulan 2020 is a decent film but lacks the authenticity that could have made it great
Sep 14 2020,negative,definitely a high budget film like one long episode of game of thrones beautiful scenery and decent cgi but gawd it was so cheesy i couldnt figure out who is supposed to be the target audience is it supposed to be children but there is too much violence for children so is it supposed to be for teenagers and adults who think like children there were many missteps when they made this movie for starters they could have gotten an actress who looked more like a dude there is no way she could ever pass for a man 2nd when mulan was in the middle of the battlefield none of the enemies saw her ride her horse and flank them come on man
Sep 14 2020,negative,sad disappointing insulting soulless boring dry misinterpretation of the asian culture liu yifei was the worst at acting thanks for ruining my childhood
Sep 14 2020,positive,it cant compare to the original but by itself its a solid film
Sep 14 2020,positive,great movie great actors and wonderful effects it was awesome to watch
Sep 14 2020,negative,i was bored the whole movie it has no emotion and there are many inconsistencies
Sep 14 2020,negative,entirely different message chosen one  working hard  than the animated version
Sep 14 2020,positive,a beautiful reimagining of the original with enough of the old movie to make you smile and plenty of new material as well as chinese cultural ties to make it more realization
Sep 14 2020,negative,racist and whitewashed do better disney if at least the action acting and cgi was good i could at least turn off my brain and enjoy it but that was all subpar too i was really hoping this was going to be amazing i do not understand how this cost 200 million when a movie like battle angel alita cost 175 million and was far superior in every way i hope this is a lesson for studios around the world
Sep 14 2020,negative,this is the first time i have gone out of my way to put up a review of the movie  the original mulan worked hard to get where she was  this version of mulan was granted magic chi powers at birth so fighting is easy for her  ridiculous story changes to a beloved and complex story of real girl power
Sep 14 2020,negative,mulan 2020 had some big shoes to fill by being a remake of a beloved classic disney film it sadly didnt live up to the original firstly it is hidden behind a paywall on a platform that you already pay for which i can understand to an extent but for 30 it wasnt worth it the movie hit all the original main beats of the story but it lacked the heart that made the original enjoyable to all ages they rearranged some storylines and characters which ended up making those characters onedimensional and forgettable also the addition of chi made the story seem less like a random girl finding the strength within her to save her father and in turn china to something that made it feel by chance instead of mulans hard work the movie also felt somber throughout even in moments that are made for comedic relief i believe my favorite part was the addition of the witch she was by far the most interesting character in the movie and i would love to see more about her past all in all it is a student copying the answers to a test and still failing
Sep 14 2020,negative,too many plot holes mary sue and idiotic military tactics
Sep 14 2020,negative,definitely worse than the animated movie in 1998 the scenography is worst than i thought not much to save in this movie also the idea of distributing it on a streaming platform at exorbitant prices is crazy for me
Sep 14 2020,negative,30 bucks for this junk skip it
Sep 14 2020,negative,watched movie with an open mind was highly disappointed with the results even as a stand alone film fails to tell a good narrative pacing is too fast so you cant even connect to the characters when witch lady dies i wanted to feel something but tbh i felt nothing these fake reviews are killing me as well trying to counter all the bad reviews honestly if you are reviewing this movie and see this film and think its on a level to its predecessors or a movie like maleficent idk what to say to you sorry for the rant but its a terrible film
Sep 14 2020,positive,this is really beautiful i loved the characters i am crying whenever mulan and her father scene i loved the touch of funny scene and romance i great job everyone 
Sep 14 2020,positive,unexpectedly good actors decorations and everything are on top level
Sep 14 2020,negative,same female empowerment movie were the protagonist is super awesome from the start and only needs to flip a switch to unleash the force sorry her chi i meant xd the thing that sets this apart from other simplistic blockbuster trainwrecks is the supporting cast imagery and nostalgia i guess not worthy of the additional 30 bucks on top of the disney service cost
Sep 14 2020,negative,complete waste of time killed the reputation of the original movie from the stiff acting to the cringey phoenix cgi ive seen low budget chinese films do better truly a massive dissapoontment
Sep 14 2020,positive,very entertaining excellent music and scenery i enjoyed the story and the acting  do not compare it to the animated version  just enjoy it it is an epic production
Sep 14 2020,negative,took a wonderful chinese legend and gave her the mary suechosen one treatment absolutely removed any inspirational message for girls the message of this movie is youre either the chosen one who is magically better than everyone else without trying or maybe youre just mulans worthless sister also why bother going into the army in your fathers place if anyone who fails the incredibly difficult training regimen just gets sent home without ever seeing combat dad would have been back in a week utter garbage
Sep 14 2020,negative,without the comedy relief and the music the movie felt totally different the lame magic scenes and the bad looking fire bird didnt help
Sep 14 2020,negative,this movie lost the animated films original growth story and all its charm i actively wished for mulans death more than once one star for the pretty scenery
Sep 14 2020,negative,movie was boring not recommended for anyone under the age of 8 they should at least bit the bullet and made it at least rated pg13 and had more violence or something more entertaining
Sep 14 2020,negative,soulless pandering piece of action spectacle thats sure to disappoint both the fans of original as well as newcomers
Sep 14 2020,negative,a completely different movie than mulan
Sep 14 2020,positive,best disneys remake
Sep 14 2020,negative,failed to capture the magic or humour from the original reflects the core values the original was built around family duty and honour but fails to affect the audience clumsy at best cutting out significant cultural specifics at worst this film fails to capture any of the good elements of the original whilst also causing outrage due to external matters when filming
Sep 14 2020,negative,an absolute waste of time and money i couldnt believe this movie costs 200 millions  to make almost everything from mary sue plotline and that chi shit to editing acting cgi and soundtrack did not make the experience entertaining boring and lame movie
Sep 14 2020,positive,well done one thing i did not like in the movie why in english
Sep 14 2020,negative,another soulless disney cash grab that pales in comparison to the original film  even if you take the original out of consideration it still falls flat in its efforts to produce some semblance of a decent movie dont waste your money on the premiere access if you want to see it but wait until december when it is free
Sep 14 2020,negative,the original was way better
Sep 14 2020,positive,best disney live action remake ever best casting great acting from all actors across the board great story line this movie is way better than cinderella and beauty and the beast the leading actress of mulan was phenomenal i was impressed by her acting and talent truly a versatile actress
Sep 14 2020,positive,what a beautiful movie 30 dollars was underpriced this movie is a work of art i was a huge fan of the cartoon mulan made me cry every timebut thisthis movie surpassed all expectations what they did with it just took my breath away the story the scenery the acting the special effects the movie is a true work of cinematographic art  i was touched and move beyond wordsloyal brave and true to the legend of mulan    what is really upsetting about this movie is the reviews it has gotten they are so unfair people forget that mulan is a disney film and it is meant for children people forget that this was meant to be a movie that you sit and watch with your children your family this movie is not game of thrones people should stop treating it as it is yes mulan is a warrior but blood and heads on spikes are not part of this particular film    also another aspect that i find very unfair about the judging of mulan is all politics surrounding the movie which has nothing to do with the movie itself it is an american product about a chinese legend due to the very delicate relationship between china and the us this movie has been frowned upon and put down i thought the movie was very respectful to the chinese culture and brought out the beauty of it      i believe that if you watch mulan thinking that is a movie meant for children that it is not game of thrones and avoid all the politics that surround it which have nothing to do with the movie itself than maybe there would be more understanding of what this movie is about and more appreciation to its beauty
Sep 14 2020,negative,such a missed opportunity    i didnt mind that they wanted to approach the story differently to the animated version and be more true to the original poem andor provide a more realistic version of the tale i was open for changes and greatly looked forward to seeing this fresh take on the story but i was utterly disappointed    i really wanted to like this movie as i was such a fan of the animated version and of the director but they seemed to have misunderstood everything that made the animated version so inspiring and empowering for young girls    the only positive i have about this movie is the cinematography everything else this movie fails on abysmally for the first time ever watching a disney movie i got bored part way through and thought to myself several times well ive seen it now i dont need to see this one ever again     the story itself is dull illogical and emotionless the characters are poorly developed and poorly acted the editing is sloppy at no point did i feel emotionally engaged which is a real shame given the potential of the source material and the directors past work is this really from the same person who directed whale rider the two are worlds apart     it felt like they were simply ticking off the boxes for each plot point while missing the point of each as a result the whole movie has a very superficial feel     in my opinion the worst remake to date
Sep 14 2020,negative,im so tired of mary sue movies nobody asked for them theyre not empowering theyre patronising and insulting when are we going to get movies about actual realistic inspirational women
Sep 14 2020,positive,beautiful actress a fair try to show the chinese culture
Sep 14 2020,negative,superficial characters both the main character and the villain are not attractive enough except for some nice scenes i dont think this movie is of any interest i am disappointed with the money i spent
Sep 14 2020,positive,a new revised story weaved in sophistication and beauty   the actress who played mulan was enough to surprise the audience i was touched by her acting performance the story was completely different from the animated film but truly justifies the message of the movie the cinematography was also great the colors were perfectly blended together with the background
Sep 14 2020,negative,im not exactly sure what disney thought they were doing here of all the live adaptations that should have been a shot for shot remake this was definitely at the top of my list the movie took only mild inspiration from its source material and none of its soul the movie is slow clumsy and mulan might as well be a background character for all the personality she has     thats all besides the total undermining of how mulans character grows into a clever magnificent warrior by stripping that all away and making her the chosen one     i remember watching mulan with my sister so often that we went through two vhs tapes it was wonderful to be able to show her such a positive female role model that though hard work and perseverance you can do anything where the message of this live action nonsense appears to be a woman should know her place unless shes freaking magic and the chosen one     the mulan live action adaptation will forever sit on my shelf next to the likes of world war z and the last airbender
Sep 14 2020,negative,the movie was borring af nothing interesting and a lot of details with the realism they were tryng
Sep 14 2020,positive,beautifully shot and virtue inspiring
Sep 14 2020,negative,i did not like the movie very disappointing not a single song in the movie i like 10 times more the cartoon movie
Sep 14 2020,negative,is fun canceled at disney
Sep 14 2020,positive,i like mulans spirit and courage as a woman
Sep 14 2020,negative,what a fail if youre going to remake a classic movie remake the movie dont turn it into something else
Sep 14 2020,positive,great craft and attention to detail  wellacted  liked the ending
Sep 14 2020,negative,incoherent arguably insulting to the original version the editting is trash the main actor is stiff
Sep 14 2020,positive,i was so glad to see a live action disney movie where the actors did not need to break out in song i loved mulan
Sep 14 2020,positive,stop criticizing this movie out of your hypocritical propaganda and childish political mambojumbo this movie is great it is different from the animated one but so what i was entertained its all that matters the scores are great the plot is simple yet satisfying enough the casts wow they are shining i especially love the badass version of jason scott lee a movie is a movie treat it as a movie
Sep 14 2020,negative,rather than spend 40 dollars to watch this movie you could instead pay someone to try and repeatedly kick an arrow at your crotch whether they succeed or not it will be very similar to the experience you would get from watching it this movie could have been a feminist icon had it been made several decades ago they could have released the original afterwards and people would have been like oh my god the changes they made were necessary thank you for updating this story for a 1998 audience instead this movie was released twenty years after the original and is shit in comparison
Sep 14 2020,positive,marvelous and tantalizing  a great tale told with a new twist with hints of music and scenes from the animated feature i enjoyed this version as much as the animated one great story telling and emotion i give a head nod to the creators and artist that created this wonderful movie
Sep 14 2020,negative,this movie was absolute garbage i dont know why anyone would ever spend time on this movie on this dumpster fire
Sep 14 2020,positive,hopefully this movie will get seen amid the uncertainties of the pandemic and political opposition to the movie what has been done to the uighurs and others is horrible there is no but to that this movie is one of disneys better live action remakes do not expect a live action remake of the animated movie this movie is different and stands on its own the acting and action is quite good the cultural focus upon honor loyalty courage honesty and family is inspiring the movie is stunning to watch the lead actress is graceful and strong the story is not complex and is not trying to be
Sep 14 2020,negative,its a boring remake
Sep 14 2020,positive,the movie is good in so many aspects its beautiful perfectly well done
Sep 14 2020,negative,love the cartoon version better the movie lacked character buildup comedy relief and an all around disney movie this movie should be called the flight of the phoenix not mulan its not to late to add scenes and music before the dec release date they need to go back to the drawing board on this one it lacks everything the cartoon was and more
Sep 14 2020,negative,this movie had some decent ideas but failed to execute anything well mulan is basically a superhero without any weaknesses and way less like able in this version
Sep 14 2020,positive,visually stunning and with the right amount of disneylowkey violence this new take on mulan does its purpuse on the liveaction spectrum but it lacks a bit of emotionally charged moments to make it a standout in the remake frenzy
Sep 14 2020,positive,i am a simple girl from a very simple place i lost my father too young this movie made me cry six different times it made me feel like i could conquer the world it made me feel like i can be respected in the real world it made me feel like i can be proud to be a girl and where im from thats just not possible for girls i hate that people keep comparing this film to the brilliant 1998 original film this film is different this film feels different because this film feels real and honest and true to me i thank every one who brought this film to life even if it made my life better for just 2 hours i can live off those 2 hours for weeks to come
Sep 14 2020,negative,this movie is terrible in every way it looks so low budget and like they just didnt put much thought into it at all
Sep 14 2020,positive,i dont know what were you expecting but the movie was one of the best movies ive ever seen
Sep 14 2020,positive,i liked it wasnt as good as the original animated version but it was still pretty good
Sep 14 2020,negative,first of all disney removed mushu because he seemed to unrealistic but then proceeded to have no blood in the film and have people flying aroung and climbing walls like spiderman they also stripped away all of mulans empowerment and character development instead of her working hard and proving that she can be just as strong as men she has powers that she is just naturally good at from birth i also dont understand why there was a new character the witch she literally brought nothing to the story also i had absolutely no emotional attachment to mulan she had the same expression that she had on the cover during the entire movie
Sep 14 2020,neutral,too much hype about this movie didnt live up to expectations wasted 30   nice scenery and imagery but the story execution was weak even my daughter didnt like it and we think disneys animated version of 1998 is more interesting
Sep 14 2020,negative,i feel like the movie was turned into a cliche chosen one movie the movie just felt like a nostalgic cash grab like most of the other diseny animated movies turned live action remake failed miserably
Sep 14 2020,negative,this film does nothing to relive the memories i had of the original mulan with the worst martial arts ive seen in a long time and i bland  boring story i knew after 5 minutes that this film was going to bomb 30 for an exclusive premiere was over kill and totally unjustified
Sep 14 2020,negative,worst editing and storytelling ive seen in a long long time
Sep 14 2020,positive,lots of controversy hate and knit picking along side fans wanting the same song and dance so glad i ignored that this was quite a wonderful film best 2995 i ever spent on disney
Sep 14 2020,positive,absolutely phenomenal
Sep 14 2020,negative,terrible nothing like the original please dont waste your money
Sep 14 2020,negative,very cringy almost a comedy
Sep 14 2020,positive,beautifully done up but some poor built up and use of supporting characters more depth needed for the camaraderie between mulan and her squad and more time needed for the budding love between mulan and honghui more fighting scenes needed too
Sep 14 2020,negative,i really wish i could give this movie a zero enough said thanks a lot disney
Sep 14 2020,negative,easily one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time  its like disney never even watched the original movie  what with terrible dialog bad acting poor editing and some physically impossible actions in a movie that disney claims was intended to be more realistic you are better off saving that money and showing your kids the original
Sep 14 2020,positive,pretty good except is not related to the history
Sep 14 2020,positive,i watched this with family and loved it
Sep 14 2020,negative,may have been the worst disney movie of all time aladdin and lion king were much better live action remakes this one was terrible
Sep 14 2020,negative,its a crappy movie slow and predictible 
Sep 14 2020,negative,i was really looking forward to this movie when i heard about it and saw the preview  my husband and i watched it together and we were both very disappointed  we did not care for the silly mysticism and the battle scenes were silly and built up zero tension  a huge disappointment
Sep 13 2020,negative,utter trash a disgrace to the animated version
Sep 13 2020,positive,a fun entertaining retelling of the original disney classic fantastic production design and visuals and an overall great family movie disneys best liveaction remake
Sep 13 2020,positive,perhaps one of the most anticipated films in this difficult year for the film industry and that thanks to the bravery of disney we can enjoy although it is not as round as one would have liked or as one had thought    this live action version of mulan is a great movie as far as cinematography is concerned you can see the neat hand of its director we are also facing one of the most cultural disney films in this new era of live action however i think that this new version lacks a bit of that charm with which its animated version conquered us in other words we lack that little princess charm that was given to the animated mulan in this version we face that mulan clearly heroine which is also a great point and totally satisfying clearly the two versions of mulan are effective and very rewarding but in consistency i think the animated version is somewhat rounder than in its 2020 version    with a brilliant interpretation of its protagonist liu yifei who takes over mulans skin and makes it her own like the rest of her cast a beautiful photograph and a good direction by niki caro the director knows how to put her stamp on this version of mulan and that is what is valued she tells us her version of mulan you may like it or not but the value that is delivered that we must rescue    this live action version of mulan is a good and beautiful movie that it does not have the charm of its animated version and perhaps that is what makes you a little distant to this new installment but it cannot be denied that it is a movie that works wonderfully entertains gives us the wonder of chinese culture and by the way cinema in 2020 gives us something that is appreciated with the soul
Sep 13 2020,negative,transitions were horrible as well as the acting in general  so rigid
Sep 13 2020,negative,dissapointing terrible writing and directing i missed the songs and mushu so much literally so much disonor on your cow disney 410
Sep 13 2020,negative,this is yet another unneeded remake without the magic and talent shown in the original animated version  disney should be disappointed in the reception for this one and will hopefully wake up
Sep 13 2020,positive,first watch the movie and then give your opinion  for me its fine ill give it 10 out of 10
Sep 13 2020,positive,some parts couldve been done differently but its the best liveaction in a good while
Sep 13 2020,positive,its visually stunning there were some issues with the acting in my opinion some of the side characters could have been written better but over all it has a powerful message thats delivered well
Sep 13 2020,positive,loved it worth watching
Sep 13 2020,positive,i dont understand why people hate this movie after seeing this movie i thought it was awesome  sure it doesnt have the music that made the classic mulan animation great but hey they did a marvelous action with the fight scenes and the storyline this remake is everything i wanted in the animation but since the animation is targeted towards kids i understand why the live action must add characters and remove the music quit hating this underrate movie its great for what its worth the actresses and actors worked on the scenes phenomenally and i couldnt have asked for more
Sep 13 2020,positive,a disney movie recreating a chinese story that actually has real chinese actors who wouldve ever guessed that this could happen in an american movie production definitely worth watching especially since there isnt anything else better our there right now
Sep 13 2020,negative,i would say it passed the timetwo stars but i couldnt even finish it just rotten
Sep 13 2020,negative,the way this movie takes away mulans character arc and replaces is with the message that unless youre born with super powers you as a women will never be able to hold a candle to and much less be equal or superior to men is nothing other than sickening add to that the awful script the lackluster acting and horrendous editing and youre left with the worst disney remake thus far dishonour on you disney
Sep 13 2020,negative,lacks the magic of the cartoon in chinese cultural authenticity action sequences and just basic storytelling too many plot jumps  training montage was short and all of a sudden the troops were trained best fighter was donnie yen as the director emphasized but somehow they sent mulan to protect the king makes no sense the cartoon discovery of mulans secret was more realistic and dramatic lack of character development of the surrounding characters they might as well as not have been in the movie so many beautiful traditions and scenery of chinese culture ignored and an aging jet li emperor can catch arrows barehanded then why does he need any protection and rescuing plot and movie felt rushed which is surprising considering they had all of covid to improve it
Sep 13 2020,negative,great costumes and colour but not a fan overall
Sep 13 2020,negative,this movie is complete and total trash couldnt have made a worse remake if that was the intention i would have preferred a shot for shot remake in live action rather than this garbage
Sep 13 2020,negative,the father was made to be a more stern character and mulan lost all her characters personality  most of the best songs from the original didnt have lyrics  i would watch the original 100 times before ever watching this one again
Sep 13 2020,positive,in my opinion one of the best live actions theyve made its a new movie on its own its similar but different its adult but for children also its action packed yet beautiful its a very good blend
Sep 13 2020,negative,nothing on the original
Sep 13 2020,neutral,i cant say there was anything particularly bad about this film but that being said im struggling to remember any moments that interested me if it were a meal i would say its boiled chicken
Sep 13 2020,negative,the phoenix cgi is horrible the story just doesnt capture the qualities of the original disney animation see the video on yt by accented cinema for a good analysis
Sep 13 2020,positive,mostly bland cool and unengaging as the disney treatments of star wars have been  those who were hoping for a more complex adult treatment of the mulan myth will come away disappointed here   there a few good moments like any time that gong li the witch is on screen the opening chickenchasing sequence with young mulan and the sexual tension interactions between mulan and loveinterest honghui   there probably wasnt space or plot enough here to leverage donnie yen or jet lis talents but its still disappointing to see them pretty much wasted in this film   mulan is a harmless and utterly forgettable bit of fluff no surprise since thats probably just what the disney executives love
Sep 13 2020,negative,this movie sucks the main character is like rey skywalker just because she exists can do anything she is the chosen one no hard work no polishing abilities no sacrifice bullshit
Sep 13 2020,negative,disney you have ruined my childhood
Sep 13 2020,negative,completely ruined
Sep 13 2020,negative,story is not the original one with modifications that doesnt make sense to the original and the chinese culture
Sep 13 2020,positive,excellent movie different from the animated movie but no less good
Sep 13 2020,negative,oh my good this was a terrible experience taking me on an emotional roller coaster with almost only never ending falls     first of all lets go through what worked with this movie some of the landscapes scenes was amazing the coloration was bright and gorgeous the idea of the witch counter part was an interesting idea though terrible executed they addressed a super interesting situation where they could have a explored mulans resourcefulness in regard of a calling all soldiers to a shower scene however they backed out with the most lame solution of never ending guard duty well i guess thats all good to say about this film    so for everything that didnt work  first of all everything er loved with the original mulan is gone her struggle to have been banished for a new idea about shes already born all powerful her way of overcoming brut force with her clever mind is out the window the message of everyone can become a mulan if they put their mind and effort to it is replaced with a message about only the chosen ones can have hope of getting by and now its all about brut force     these changes goes against both the original mulan movie and the original chinese legend of mulan they are both butchering the original disney movie we loved and the original chinese legend making a mockery of both     gone is all things that makes us love mulan in sense of theme and message the new mulan never has to overcome hardship nor does she makes friends in the army she doesnt earn the respect of her following soldiers through her actions shes just happens to be given the respect by the writers because the plot needs to move forward its terrible to watch and it breaks my heart to see someone fail so miserably on every level of the creation and production of this movie     in addition the political backlash this move has gotten also makes the message from the original mulan ring hollow and dishonored
Sep 13 2020,negative,this positive score isnt fooling anyone disney made a halfhearted attempt at crouching tiger hidden dragon and ripped off the mulan title for it the bottom line is that its a mediocre film of war with a misappropriated title
Sep 13 2020,negative,more virtue signaling i really wish ppl would stop ruining movies with all these messages and just make a movie about its storyline ellen ripley female lead in the aliens franchise was a strong lead character who happened to be female mulan is portrayed as a superhuman simply because shes a female
Sep 13 2020,positive,teary eyed after i watched the movie though i kinda hope for more comedy and romance if only some scenes werent cut off
Sep 13 2020,positive,i enjoyed the small twist and action scenes to the animated film that i already loved 
Sep 13 2020,negative,not only does this movie not do any justice to the original animation version but is also simply a dull boring and lifeless standalone movie
Sep 13 2020,negative,i feel like it ruined the great animated  movie of mulan disney should stop making live action movies netflix failed with death note what makes you think youll do any better
Sep 13 2020,positive,i thought that it was very captivating and suspenseful even though i saw the animated version very well made and excellent use of cgi
Sep 13 2020,negative,the original animation shows that a gender does no difference and despite the discriminating environment mulan are able to achieve success and work hard while also proud of being who she is this is a powerful message and very inspiring the movie in the other hand shows that mulan only need unleash her unrealistic power and be successful in the animation mulan have very conflicting thoughts with the emperor but still saves him because she sees him as human beings this shows her capable of making her own decision this is honor in the movie she does this because it is the honor way to serve the kingdom this is not honor this is just teaching children that if you obey the rule you will be honored this is not honor this is propaganda not only it failed the hype and expectations it pushes unnecessary ideologies and malicious messages to younger generation disney had an easy chance to just retell such a meaningful story instead just erasing all the meaningful part and replacing it with misdirecting and meaningless story what a shame
Sep 13 2020,positive,its an amazing movie   people are just hating because theres no mushu or songs  but its a liveaction movie  no need a for a dragon to be there also its a war movie no one sings in war   if u dont like it just stick to your original one please
Sep 13 2020,negative,i am sorry i paid money to watch this movie  i knew it is a kids movie and didnt expect anything fancy but even so i am very disappointed and left the cinema 5 minutes before the end
Sep 13 2020,negative,the story didnt give much regard to the animated version nor the original chinese poem it was a sad attempt from disney to embrace the chinese culture all the while having not one chinese or even asian producer among the four people who were responsible for the movie this story teaches females that some of us are just naturally gifted mulan while others best bet is to make do with what they have and stay behind mulans forgettable sister nevermind the useless phoenix that was added for whoknowswhat reason  is wasnt necessarily a bad movie the cinematography was quite good its just the storyline that came with it that was complete sh
Sep 13 2020,positive,it was a great movie 
Sep 13 2020,positive,mulan is a good movie if you remove your robe of racism first  disneys liveaction mulan reimagined the animation version and made it more realistic with human drama     this is one of those rare movies that gave me goosebumps and made two teardrops fall one in each eye the last movie that gave me the same emotional experience was wreckit ralph 2      everybody should watch mulan and make it the billion dollar boxoffice hit that disney wished it would be
Sep 13 2020,negative,really choppy lacking any resemblance to the original i cant believe disney made this my daughter hated it not inspiring in any way
Sep 13 2020,positive,amazing choreographing and original storyline that does not retain to any politically incorrect stereotypes about the asian ethnicity must watch
Sep 13 2020,negative,this movie was extremely disappointing no grandmother and they have mulan a sister  there was no real back story the original mulan i grew up with was about a girl who did what she did to save her father and along the way she proved that girls are just as strong and able as men she didnt need the magical power of chi to help her smh the cgi was horrible all the bright happy colors didnt not match the mood of the movie and the fact that she doesnt cut her hair so she can have beach waves for the big battle scene that lasts barely 2 minute editing was choppy there was no real humor it was so disappointing
Sep 13 2020,negative,i liked the live action aladdin and beauty and the beast i am that easy to please this is just crap cool visually but crap just watch the original masterpiece
Sep 13 2020,negative,terrible illogical script poorly developed characters they turned mulan into a mary sue just horrible
Sep 13 2020,negative,bullshit of a movie its not worth the money and the time mulan is not a super hero ok even if you add the very concept of real chinese ethics and such chi is not used that way and mulan lost the touch of being a normal girl who went to war in order to protect her dad and family
Sep 13 2020,negative,a really really bad movie bad acting shame on u disney 
Sep 13 2020,negative,not very good i was really disappointed with disney the worst live action yet
Sep 13 2020,negative,just watch the old movie
Sep 13 2020,negative,a pretty and big budget movies with great visuals but wow what poor messages this sends and how bluntly it handles anything delicate
Sep 13 2020,negative,the only thing that this live action film shared with the original is its title this recent mulan is everything that is not what endeared my generation to the animated version humourless nothing to make you singalong no mushu no shang sensitivity to cultural appropriation yes but they failed to consider us whove been fans of mulan for years it looked and felt like an entirely different movie they should have just given it its own title and let the actors speak in the characters native language
Sep 13 2020,negative,disneys liveaction mulan barely resembles the animated version too violent for kids under 10 too watered down for adults     legends of chinese film rosalind chao tzi ma and cheng peipei along with jet li and donny yen make this a whoswho of actors ripe for rich storytelling but this isnt the case     who the puts jet li and donnie yen in a film with no action roles dont say anything about age jackie chan and pat morita did it albeit with chopsticks jason scott lee son of legendary bruce lee doesnt get much action either he spends most of his on screen time scowling into the camera     there is no lighthearted banter or comic relief in this film like there was in the animated version mulans love interest has a completely different role and name so any child who looks for shang will be disappointed supporting characters yao po and ling are just bodies whom we never really get to know the cricket from the animated film has become a personcalled cricket   there is no iconic mushu arguably the fan favorite in the animated film if there was one character they could have used in this movie it would be him if you arent going to use such a rich cast for a serious film then make it child friendly and make the audience laugh instead we get the cricket who had no lines in the first film and hardly any in this one     they added a shapechanging witch who has some keen action when she slices and dices the army up close she was presented in a seriously scary and homicidal way i want to see a film about her  again either develop this character fully or make her less violent as this is supposed to be a disney film for children     the only bright spot in this film is the five seconds we get of ming na wen  the original voice of mulan during the palace scene     there is so much potential here for a badass mulan in the vein of wonder woman instead we get a watered down version that is still too much for the under 10 crowd disneys core viewership next time make a deeper gritty version and get patty jenkins to direct
Sep 13 2020,positive,mulan is my favorite princess apart from cinderella thank you disney for making such a great movie  it was so beautiful and enjoyable to watch and it delivers such a strong and positive message that i doubt anyone sensible would disagree my sister and i almost cried watching it lets all be brave and true
Sep 13 2020,positive,i have always loved this story i was impressed with the tener of this version i appreciate the infusion of the narrative to let mulan shine and the storyline makes more sense in this version although the original animated version is more geared to children this version is very impressive i enjoyed this immensely
Sep 13 2020,negative,honestly just terrible movie overall i meankey characters were missing honestly just plain boring and nothing really exiting snore
Sep 13 2020,positive,the film was indeed visually appealing love the costumes colors sets and scenery  though there are questionable changes and additions in the movie it still did its best
Sep 13 2020,negative,nooo i was so excited for this movie for so long i paid for this they changed so much the originalanimated is my 2nd favorite disney movie first off why change her story so much oh and make her a little fighing prodigy from the beginning also why add a witch but take away mushu ok and another thing wheres the heart and humor of the original i already knew they werent going to be singing but i actually really missed it i was desperate to watch her sing reflections while looking at her reflection like in the original sigh im so heartbroken the only one i loved more was brave please dont mess up a live action of it next 
Sep 13 2020,negative,this movie has absolutely no good moments
Sep 13 2020,negative,so the girl dresses in a glamorous red dress go to fight in war with no helmet just swinging her blade here and there that is so hollywood just nope it would have been nice if they had at least tried to make it seem what could have been the real life experience of hua mulan in the army if the legend is true but as always americans doing it wrong if you want to see a hua mulan live action movie you should watch the chinese version hua mulan 2009 dont waste your time with this youll be disappointed i would not recommend
Sep 13 2020,positive,it could have shown a greater depth still a good one to watch
Sep 13 2020,neutral,i was expected a great adapt from animation to live act with all the element contain but instead this was a different story although it have the same purpose nor good and bad but i really dislike how they remove the good part from the original animation i wouldnt recommend this film to others
Sep 13 2020,positive,best disney remake so far maybe not for younger children who want musical and light hearted movie but for adults looking for an enjoyable update movie version i would highly recommend
Sep 13 2020,negative,first off the cgi is terrible it literally looks like a cheesy bollywood movie there is no establishment to where the characters were besides the obnoxious text at the bottom of the screen to literally tell audience members where they were the editing jumped around so much it made the movie hard to follow and it seemed as if the director completely changes from the beginning to the end of the movie none of the people who worked on this movie apparently knew anything about imperial china everything from costumes to makeup to war strategies is very western and childish im aware this is a childrens movie but i expected better from disney since the animated version did mulan more justice it is very apparent that the crew for this movie was heavily european as much of the actual history and practices of ancient china are completely absent  mulans character is written completely differently from the animated version which makes her much less appealing as a protagonist she displays little to no emotion and is nowhere near as complex a character due to poor writing her actions arent throughout or driven by anything except relevance to the story not because of her own personal motivation  theres no relationship built between characters whatsoever making everything extremely forced and tends to blindsight you with new connections that have no buildup from removing the previous love interest li shang the movie is now riddled with plot holes disney really shouldve just written a whole new movie completely since that would have been much more successful than their attempt at making mulan stronger and more of an action movie  the witch is a pointless character and only serves to literally tell the audience what is going on since this movie assumes the audience is stupid and cant understand basic plot   what is the point of the narrator he comes in in three parts to do nothing but tell the audience exactly what is happening in front of them for absolutely no reason whatsoever
Sep 13 2020,negative,this version of mulan is mediocre at best i understand its not the animated version  but i couldnt get over the unbelievable effects and the ridiculously bad action this film needs to find a plot that makes sense
Sep 13 2020,positive,so going into this movie my expectations were pretty high since the original mulan has been a part of almost everyones childhood me included and the movie itself was great and a very big part of that was that mulan was a clumsy goofy character more than the perfect heroine and this movie takes that and instead of making mulan learn it makes her hide the fact that shes extremely skilled in combat because of her chi many important scenes are just cut off like the first time she suits up the first time she grabs her fathers sword isnt as impactful and im sorry to say it but yifei lie didnt really feel right in the role for me she wasnt as emotional as i would have expected or really expressive at all and to my surprize ive notices some plotholes and incontinuities too for example the main antagonist dies in a way that could be totally prevented by mulan and when it does happen there was no emotion at all nothing i appreaciate this movie for not trying to emulate 11 the original it more or less tried to be its own thing but it really turned out as a mix of mulan and a generic proving yourself plot some characters are missing too and for some id see why because it tries to be more realistic and less goofy actually there barely arent any funnycomedic moments at all this movie does its fight scenes pretty well and the plot never really drags so id say its a decent time on its own right the mulan remake is a more serious version of the original without the comedy which makes it have less heart which makes it pretty much a husk of the original
Sep 13 2020,negative,really bad full of offensively bad cliches such as her suddenly dropping her long luscious  locks to block her eyes when she gets ready for a fight the moral of the story is definitely twisted from the old film and much more preachy this is the sort of story that can only be improved by heckling
Sep 13 2020,negative,another soulless money grab with none of the entertainment or charm of the original
Sep 13 2020,negative,absolutely terrible
Sep 13 2020,negative,i would compare this live action remake to the live action remake of avatar last airbender seems like all the actors took their rolls way too seriously and the action scenes are similar to something you would find in a bollywood film
Sep 13 2020,negative,this movie sucked everything that was good about the original was missing it was a complete waste of time and money  there are been enough disappointments in 2020 to last a lifetime and mulan is just another one there is no music no comedy no romance no dragon nothing fun this is 100 not a childrens movie which is fine but come on big budget for such a huge bust even all the action scenes were lack luster the emotional moments evoked almost no physical response and im no heartless jerk i love movies and i love the emotion but this sterile version was completely lacking i highly recommend you skip it and save yourself some money and time
Sep 13 2020,negative,a complete disgrace to the original in almost every single way possible
Sep 13 2020,negative,no songs asian camera style  tiger and the dragon  not a single joke in the whole film definitely not what i was expecting 
Sep 13 2020,positive,well made and with bright costumes but a bit dull  the most interesting character is xianniang the birdwitch who steals the show and leaves you wishing the movie had told her story instead   it is a fine watch but is unlikely to be one that kids or adults ask to see more than once  may be a bit violent for really young viewers 3 stars out of 5 for me  strangely i would like to see sequel as what happens next seems like it would be an interesting story
Sep 13 2020,negative,this is really mulan whats wrong with disney princess now we love mushu and crikee and mulans friends in military where are songs no sing no disneys culture you can change this movies name as another thing not mulan its better than this original of chinese novel i can search and read it online but live action should give us more than this     mulans personality not like this shes smart  she has brain not super power inside her intelligent is key and show up to everyone whats man can do woman can do it too whats your point on this live action for chinese mulan in 1998 better than this live shes friendly and more emotional whats happen in live did you told her to play as stone     its rotten rot
Sep 13 2020,negative,another classic story butchered for the exhuasting sake of protecting chinese audiences from free thinking     another expensive flat spaghettieastern
Sep 13 2020,positive,it could have told with more scope but its still nice at times it feels flat and disconnected especially during the crucial scenes it does pass time while doing something else the movie doesnt have as much depth and isnt as good as it can possibly be however it isnt the worst movie possible
Sep 13 2020,negative,one of the disneys worst cultural appropriation with laughable script writing bad acting questionable set with all the wrong timelines and so much absurdity to the point i facepalmed every few minutes
Sep 13 2020,negative,the fact that the original cartoon version of mulan was more realistic than this live action version says something
Sep 13 2020,negative,visual stimulation all but developing relatable characters look at the phoenix scene why significance dialogue all visuals all distractions whats the point
Sep 13 2020,negative,the story line is so bad the cartoon from 20 years ago was a million times better i dont know if its because covid causes brain issues who the hell thought of a story line so wack even when i am high i could tell the story line was written by a brain dead and all those actorsactress yifei liu who seems to play anything that pays well without a story line cant blame her i would do it too donnie yen was our first asian in a star wars movie he made us proud but in this movie hes crap hes so rich i cant believe he agreed to act in this garbage     for anyone who watched it where the hell was mushu couldnt they afford better cgi wheres that witch from whys she so powerful yet that arrow i think people are generous to give it 50 on rottentomatoes this is truly the rotten of rotten
Sep 13 2020,negative,the fact that is not in chinese and everyone talks in english wtf compare with the animated version this sucks no character development and bad cuality of some scenes like the chilhood of mulan forgettable movie but it is entertaining just not disney quality
Sep 13 2020,negative,its a joke screenwriting is terrible  messed up story line n logic  production looks nothing like 300mil  but 30mil at most   terrible costume n makeup   its a joke
Sep 13 2020,negative,this is like an american chef went to sichuan province of china and learned 3 months and did egg fried rice its finally not authentic chinese food or not a sandwich  who will be your audiences for this movie the chinese or the americans     sorry no one likes it     the directors did not really know the answer they are too superficial and did not completely understand the chinese culture for example there are too many mistakes in the dresses and story which are conflict with the basic chinese history do your homework before you go to class 
Sep 13 2020,negative,disney failed miserably on this story mulan was a woman who was educated to be a wife a mother a daughter in law that was clumsy strong and courageus enough to take her fathers place in the war and this tells a story of a woman who was trained had chi and other things they took way the power of the choice mulan made leaving her home to do her duty among men in a very machist society and made just as easy as saying three sentences to convince a commander that she a woman in china before 4th century was right and he should lead them disney please shame shame shame idk where is the realistic sight that the director claimed she wanted shame and im not even mentioning politics seriously shame
Sep 13 2020,positive,i am from chinese and i am really looking forward to this movie  many people say its too bad but i think its okay  its impossible for you to make a story in another country understandable to native americans and make the chinese feel a good movie    i personally think that if i havent watched this cartoon  it will feel like guessing  the actors lines are a bit lacking or the storyline is not much to watch  after all you have to change a very short cartoon  i dont think you should be so mean right
Sep 13 2020,positive,loved the movie and want to see more of this kind
Sep 13 2020,positive,an amazing film it escapes common scripts with an innovative way of telling the story without losing the link with the original legend
Sep 13 2020,negative,ruinously uninspiring took out all the elements that made the original film great the character arc gone the music gone the comedic relief gone all for what a shallow narcissistic and rotten excuse of a film 010
Sep 13 2020,positive,this movie certainly has its moments and some amazing action scenes but overall the movie turned out just to be ok
Sep 13 2020,negative,i love martial arts movies but this film is a very subpar one it also has none of the charm and humor of the animated film  the entire messaging of the original was dropped in favor of a chosen one premise  overall its a boring slog from start to end
Sep 13 2020,positive,was a wonderful action filled movie this new version reaches a whole new adult audience loved it
Sep 13 2020,negative,horrible cgi horrible dialogue horrible changes to a great animated film the use of green screen was apparent as well as the bollywood style action i found the underlying womens power idea completely ridiculous this movie was bad all around bad you want womens empowerment in a movie watch alita battle angel or wonder woman not this train wreck of a movie
Sep 13 2020,positive,loved it its like the book action scenes were cool as well
Sep 13 2020,negative,such a disappointment looks and feels more like a video game than a movieand last time i checked mulan is quirky and charismatic not boring and somber
Sep 13 2020,negative,trash  absolute trash  no music no mushu shes a witch now  zero character development cause they couldnt have her show weakness at any point in the movie  skip this
Sep 13 2020,negative,19982020 the new mulan is a slap to the face of the original mulan
Sep 13 2020,positive,mulan is one of my favourite disney movies this remake was not up to standard the actors were incredible and the premise was there but once they took out the music and added unnecessary characters like a witch and an awfully rendered multicoloured cartoonish phoenix the magic was lost there are also much better examples of that style of fighting seen on shows like into the badlands this movie made most of the fighting look cheesy the love story didnt seem as strong and the emperors favour in the end didnt have the same impact meh
Sep 13 2020,positive,great retelling of a great story
Sep 13 2020,negative,nice cinematography but nothing in this movie warrants emotion or intrigue from the viewer
Sep 13 2020,negative,this movie is so bland so boring and the actions scenes were very bad the characthers did not feel like the orignal movie if you took the original mulan and sucked up everything good about it and make a bland story and thats this movie so do not watch this movie its a waste of money and time this movie is so bad compared to the animated disney classic
Sep 13 2020,positive,while it definitely falls short of the animated original mulan 2020 is a decent enough for what it aims to be 
Sep 13 2020,negative,no just no dont waste your time on this
Sep 13 2020,neutral,not for people who dont like chinese martial arts movies  pros the villain girls story is awesome  cons everything else everyone else has already said  tip do not compare this movie to the cartoon version or you will be disappointed if you take it as a stand alone you may enjoy it my mom ended up crying
Sep 13 2020,negative,this movie had no soul and brought dishonor on the whole of disney studios and dishonored the memory of the original animated version the lead actress was bland and emotionless the dad looked exactly like president xicoincidence they took out mushu and inserted a phoenix that seemed to appear randomly and was never explained what is up with the chi thing it made no sense and dont get me started on the one dimensional sorceress who decided to essentially commit suicide just so she could tell her boss off this movie was so boring that my kids spent most of their time running around my living room instead of happily munching popcorn and cheering on mulan in short this movie sucks and i think most of the positive reviews are fake
Sep 12 2020,negative,i believe mulan is the worst disneys live action movie so far none of them were good but at least aladdin had great songs and some decent performances while beauty and the beast had a great cast the only good aspect of the film is photography and settings everything else i crap performances lack of humor no characters development event the martial arts sequences are dull and boring
Sep 12 2020,negative,0 stars if that were possible filmed like a crappy commercial with terrible dialogue and no emotion this gives the last airbender a strong challenge for worst movie ever made it was truly a disaster
Sep 12 2020,positive,it was good but not great  they missed an opportunity with this one
Sep 12 2020,positive,loved it brilliantly executed remake i am a big fan of the original and was concerned that it would not live up to the original animation but it was really enjoyable
Sep 12 2020,positive, original film doesnt matter who you are if you work hard and have that sheer determination you can be a badass    remake if you have a special power you dont have to work hard also girl powercommentator on youtube    this story as a standalone just fell flat for a lot of people    disney put magic above character development and made the side characters extremely unlikeable which i was slightly surprised to see at this point    spoilers           it almost seemed like disney tried to spoonfeed the audience which made me bored and annoyed replacing awesome characters and songs with a witch just to have a girl power moment felt out of place  the addition of the extra villain and the bad blood between the king and lead villian also made the plot convoluted   even mulans character didnt make me want to cheer for her as she thwarted the villains plan  i missed the lead up that showed me how clever she was as a character mulan is a character that didnt need to be made into a man ironically she was the best solider because she found ways to use her strength as a woman that idea shouldnt be fed to the audience it should be shown   i cant think of many changes that i liked in the remake i take my hat off for the use of some of the greatest actorsactresses of asian descent but this movie wasnt worth 30 bucks
Sep 12 2020,negative,holds none of the magic of its 1998 animation counter part the movie felt rushed lacked substance and didnt even mention historical accuracy of the huns attacking china come on disney  you can do better than that
Sep 12 2020,negative,thanks for making this movie on the premium tier of an already subscription service i have to pay for  it was pretty crappy for a remake  please stop making movies in which the original was great
Sep 12 2020,negative,yeah this was not good
Sep 12 2020,negative,none of the fun of the original  boring slow moving story dry dialogue    this is the worst disney remake yet and thats saying something considering how terrible the lion king was
Sep 12 2020,positive,i actually quite loved this movie i dont know if i would call it a remake as much as adaptation if you love korean or chinese drama this movie will stand out to you i thought it was lovely and the message was better try not to compare it to the previous movie try to look at it as a new telling i loved that the music was woven into the theatrical music in this film watch it before you judge it
Sep 12 2020,negative,as a chinese american female who grew up with the cartoon version and was looking forward to this live actionmore realistic version i was really disappointed this movie was a poor version of the original disney cartoon message and ballad of mulan this film depicted the opposite of female empowerment was a poor representation of chinese culture and managed to misinterpreted lines of the ballad of mulan    1 poor female representation  the original showed how females if they work hard enough and be better then the patriarchymales this version showed that only the chosen females can succeed and implies that no amount of hard work would allow women to surpass males you have to be chosen     2 poor representation of chinese culture   mulan is from northern china not southern as the movie would depict idk what dynasty they were trying to depict it was a hodgepodge the myth of the phenix confused with the egyption myth in china the phenix depicts a message of peace so why is it taking mulan into war       also why the did she take down her hair it doesnt really show she is a female because everyone had long hair back then    lastly in my eyes the most egregious error is how they screwed up qi in china qi is something that needs to be trained studied and honed to be that good it is also something that is admired it is not something you are born spectacular at unless you are a demon or pusa     3 ballad of mulan  they reinterpreted a line of the ballad to have the direct opposite meaning the line is from early in the movie when she saw 2 rabbits running side by side in the movie she says something along the line of one was male and the other female meaning that she was able to differentiate them while in the ballad a rough translation of the rabbit line is there are male rabbits and female rabbits but when they run side by side one cannot see the difference meaning that there are no difference between male and female   sorry for this long rant but mulan the cartoon was such an important movie for me along with the ballad of mulan while this movie left such a bad taste in my mouth so much so that i made a rotten tomato account    anyways if this movie was supposed to appeal more to their chinese audience or female audience they have failed on all fronts in my opinion what this movie has accomplished is the further watering down of female empowerment and asian culture
Sep 12 2020,negative,there were bits of potential but mainly just cheesy action that didnt fit and no real heart got nothing on the cartoon never worth paying for  end credits were decent tbf
Sep 12 2020,positive,mulan is the best disney live action remake since the jungle book in 2016 the cinematography is spectacular the acting is really good the visual effects are really awesome the action and fighting scenes are aweinspiring the music score is fun to listen to and i believe niki caro did a really good job in directing this remake paying homage to the original chinese ballad as well as the 1998 animated film this remake does bring honor to us all
Sep 12 2020,negative,shockingly bad     characters are wooden humorless tropes largely devoid of compelling arcs the parts of the plot that are not wholesale recycled dont make any sense even the action sequences felt like cheesy imitations of eastern martial arts cinema which i can generally appreciate even if im not terribly fond of the genre visuals are generally good though variously borderline ostentatious but then 30 should get you more than a screen saver
Sep 12 2020,positive,loved this movie so much
Sep 12 2020,negative,we had a watch party for this and expected so much this was an unbelievable waste of time and just felt like another highbudget kung fu flick it felt in no way connected to the animated mulan we all grew up with very disappointed
Sep 12 2020,negative,only good in this film is the end and cgi
Sep 12 2020,negative,ruined the original took all the music out the comedy bit felt like the story had been cut short
Sep 12 2020,negative,do not watch this nonsensical boring charmless mess of a movie
Sep 12 2020,negative,no amazing story at all useless characters the phoenix the witch mulans friends  s nothing compared with cartoon mulan
Sep 12 2020,negative,its far form showing respect for traditional values of chinese culture far away from being as good as the animated movie it is not an empowerment for woman in actual times its more like an aversion born from actual pop culture
Sep 12 2020,negative,it did not live up the standards of the original disney movie i understand it was trying to be realistic but some of those realistic scenes were just terrible they didnt put much or any effort to the locations sets looked for like a shakespeare play set it also didnt give the inspiration the original gave it didnt go enough into the chinese culture besides the things women cant doshould do it was just a let down
Sep 12 2020,negative,no humor no shang no mushu no songs now a twin sister its closer to crouching tiger than it is to the original stay away from it
Sep 12 2020,negative,more like a china version of star wars new hope than a live action mulan mulan now has the force but no mushu this was a not a great remake it misses the charm and humor of the original
Sep 12 2020,negative,i never watched the animated movie and i found this one quite good i need to watch the animated movie and see where all the hate come from  edit  after watching the old movie i remove all the stars and what i said about 2020 mulans movie its horrible to see the changes they made to the original story so basically what i understand from star wars and mulan you need some cheated super powers to be a strong woman stronger than men while the old movies say   with hard work and a brain you can be as strong as men and even outsmart themi guess people in the 90s were more progressive than the ones in the 2020sits sad to know that the new generation will be fed these bullshit ideas
Sep 12 2020,negative,this is an insult to the mulan i saw as a kid
Sep 12 2020,positive,i never saw the original sp this was a new story to me amazing visual effects great a story and fun the whole family loved it
Sep 12 2020,positive,great family movie dont expect cartoon rendition of the movie as it wants to capture a more realistic approach of the story its inspiring and you find great lessons on the importance of family
Sep 12 2020,positive,my one and only criticism i wish they would have done a little more with the love interest but besides that the whole movie was amazing in every waydid it a very good job disney definitely knows what theyre doing when creating movies me and my family enjoyed every step every scene that happened in mulan 2020
Sep 12 2020,negative,dont believe these insincere 5 star reviews by paid reviewers this movie is complete garbage bad cgi that they had 5 months to get right poor performances all around terrible writing that ruins the spirit of the story a waste of time and money watch the original or if you want a more accurate chinese fantasy film watch something like hero or house of flying daggers skip this trash
Sep 12 2020,positive,not bad still like the animated version better
Sep 12 2020,positive,mulan is both better than it has any right to be and nowhere near as could as it ought to be the action is solid the cinematography is frequently gorgeous and theres a real sense that everyone involved took the project very seriously still its lacking a certain spark of magic nevermind the cut songs  the real issues are with the stiff performances the clunky script and the overall sense that the movie is just connecting a bunch of dots that everyone has seen before and any of its attempts to color outside of the lines feel halfhearted and uncertain its an okay way to kill a couple of hours but that shouldnt be the bar that disney is setting for remakes of movies that many consider to be bonafide classics
Sep 12 2020,negative,yet another fail by disney this movie is a disgrace to the much much better cartoon version
Sep 12 2020,neutral,this is the next film in the line of disney remakes this time they are tackling the 1998 classic that i loved so with this film like all other liveaction remakes of these classics i give a chance that being said i would say that this movie is competent in the way it was made this movie is the first remake to actually try something different from the original      you have to commend this movie for that because it is not a shot for shot remake of the animated classic but that is where is suffers in some places especially with the main character herself mulan take the moment in the original where she cuts off her hair singing my reflection and puts on her fathers armor that is a huge characterbuilding moment for her character and it is cut down here they jump to the scene where she is in the armor that scene in particular is important because it shows the confidence that builds in her character    besides that how is the main plot of this movie as i said before it trys to differ from the original it does follow the same narrative structure as the 1998 film there is some glimmer of light in it the movie has some new clever ideas that i enjoyed quite a bit but besides that this movies plot misses on its character building for our main character     this brings me to the performances they are fairly well done by pretty much everyone in the movie besides that liu yifei who plays our main character in a way her performance comes off average not great not bad just average the best performances that come out of this movie are jet li and donnie yen     now that being said this brings me to the action scenes of this movie they are something else and actually surprised me of how messy they are to sloppy slowmotion scenes to asking the question of why they speed up a certain scene i can say that i enjoyed this movie is not awfully bad to any stretch of the matter this movie does have an interesting villain in some instances     but really where this movie fails is not being as heartfelt and as powerful as the original did the original was a 1hr and 28min and this is over 2hrs long that being said does this remake have the rewatchable factor in some cases yes the movie is definitely are more tolerable live action remake to sit down and watch but the original 1998 film will always be better     that being said does this remake have the rewatchable factor in some cases yes the movie is definitely are more tolerable live action remake to sit down and watch but the original 1998 film will always be better that being said i give this movie a 5510
Sep 12 2020,negative,they took everything fun out of the original  filled it with nonsense one of the worst of the disney remakes not worth the 30 please stop trying to remake these classics
Sep 12 2020,negative,this movie managed to lose all the beauty and strength of its original the original showed the story of an intelligent young woman who didnt fit into any social or gender norms she was not too feminine or masculine she had no skill before she left which is why people loved her so much and still do and this new one butchered it the character was portrayed as an angry joyless person who submits to the patriarchy and is only able to be the main character because she has chi which is her superpower so the moral that a woman can learn and evolve in a mans environment was lost completely and the relationship with her father was utterly ruined the only decent thing was the cinematography but since disney insisted on being impatient they beauty of the graphics could not be experienced on the small screen so all and all  major flop the original mulan is the only mulan
Sep 12 2020,negative,wow this was baaaad another horrible live action remake of a beloved movie thanks disney so much of this movie is horrible including where it was filmed the people and in general the movie itself just no  do yourself a favour watch the original
Sep 12 2020,negative,stop doing remakes of classics    this remake was hard to watch
Sep 12 2020,positive,kiwi director niki caro successfully bring this disney animation to real life action movie not only it showcase reference to china grandeur architecture but also new zealand south islands ahuriri valley and poolburn yes its in english like some meme outthere do you expect lion king meow all the way born second generation malaysian chinese and read of this legendary historical character in my school days and seen few chinese productions before even disneys animation liu yifei perfectly cast as the main lead mulan transition from village girl to the confidence woman honouring loyal brave true and filial empowering the female gender and inspiring underdog nonetheless go watch with open mind enjoy the ride its not a musical nor a oscar origin of ang lees crouching tiger hidden dragon nor it is zhang yimous arty hero its a remake period movie of a legend fulfilling filial duty to her aged fathers place in the army defending her country and honouring her familys name not many do that todays period haters gonna hate
Sep 12 2020,negative,this movie should not be told as a remake or retelling of the animated film this film would have done better having not been marketed as a remake having only 3 or so of the characters from the animated film this live action retelling throws away much of the original charm of the animated film making it a dull watch
Sep 12 2020,negative,first mulan is history based story disney has made it more like imagination anime second the military outfit used in the movie is a japanese style theme which disney got it totally wrong the same goes for character makeup etc the story line is even worse than the 2004 version
Sep 12 2020,positive,huge fan of the og animation not so much of the disneys live action remakes however i really really enjoyed it american audiences will have difficulty with the whole concept of family before self there has also been a lot of political noise around the movie  if you can set that aside it is a great story  the movie was visually stunning  i imagine it would have been more so on a theatre screen the action sequences were really good and family friendly  having jet li and donnie yen display there skills was especially cool  the little nod to ming na at the end was a nice bit of fan service
Sep 12 2020,negative,while the movie is visually stunning with some beautifully done action sequences the movie is just overall sort of a lackluster unimpressive update on the source material with unnecessary magic bits added in to enhance the story
Sep 12 2020,positive,for my personal opinion no matter how the external issues happen surrounding the movie i just want to say that the movie itself is good and genuine story line is clear and fast performance is perfect to watch actors are good such a great waste for not having premiere on cinema screen
Sep 12 2020,positive,beautiful story i like it
Sep 12 2020,negative,if you have watched the animated movie you will hate this movie maybe first time watcher might find some enjoyment it was dissapointing for me
Sep 12 2020,negative,it is a movie without any soul absurd and not very credible
Sep 12 2020,negative,absolute trash key features of the original animation removed to make the movie more realistic only for the fight scenes to be anything but   massive disappointment and a complete waste of 3500 i do not recommend this movie
Sep 12 2020,negative,do not waste your money nor your time on this hideous thing they call a movie disney messed up big time this movie is a big disgrace to the cartoon version and to each and every disney fan it aint worth a dime
Sep 12 2020,negative,it cut out all of the magic and singing making you think that it would be a much more realistic take on the true story although then they added a random girl who can turn into a bird also all the side characters had next to not appeal i dont even remember their names     go with the animated story or be more realistic its one or the other
Sep 12 2020,neutral,poor character development lame dragon and implementation of chi so same problem with rey in short i know kung fu preinstalled no downloads and practice required above average action     nice attempt at trying to impart values and virtues but its ultimately a letdown the discrimination narrative totally misfired
Sep 12 2020,negative,shortly like every liveaction remake of the disney renaissance mulan looks pretty astonishing as the main theme in the film is ancient china but the pace story and editing are not at the same level of good quality and removing mushu just cause they wanted the movie to be serious is just stupid  some people say the other reason was that mushu was voiced by a black actor not a good treatment for an iconic disney movie  pro  theyre lucky that they have the theme based in ancient china which personally i like it   the costumes designs are pretty good looking   cons  no deep story or at least a character growth which should attract the viewers   sound effect and the editing are so bad  they removed mushu
Sep 12 2020,positive,its awesome  i have been waiting for this movie since it was announce and girl it didnt disappoint  love the story and the cast
Sep 12 2020,negative,the skewed story and the additional mysticism scenes made this movie unwatchable even with so many famous casts in addition the cheap theatrics the twirling and flying the terrible makeup n clothings and the superwoman concept just added salt to the injury this movie ruined the great story of filial piety hardwork and heroism however if you are a big fan of liu yifei then go and watch as she still looks good especially when charging into battle in red clothes without armor huh but in a few scene without makeup she looked aged
Sep 12 2020,negative,why ruin all your classics with these live action bullshit  ah yes money
Sep 12 2020,positive,disneys animated mulan was the first theatrical movie i watched when i was a kid  as ive grown to be an adult it still holds a special place in my heart  although the concept of the movie was still the same much was different  the music that everyone loves especially make a man out of you  the group of men that was supposed to be the robin to mulans batman  the dragon and cricket  the magical presence you got from the original was changed to make it seem more realistic  liu yifeis beauty is unquestionable and she fits the role of mulan very well  i just wish she had more to do  overall it made me feel like a kid again  call it nostalgic  would recommend it  would recommend the animated one more
Sep 12 2020,negative,took out all the heart the action sequences were wanky and just bad the story changed so much it is now actually antifeminist you need to conform to the patriarchy unless maybe you are special then you need to use your specialty to protect the patriarchy the animated movie was careful to show mulan protected the emperor as a person and then rejected the job on the counsel mulans father rejected her war sword and medal honor in order to just hug his daughter even the patriarch here recognizes the human value above any social expectations mulan 2020 fucks every single one of those points and more so much more 
Sep 12 2020,negative,waste of money watch anything else  particularly disneys og mulan
Sep 12 2020,negative,i want my money back this is was such a wash down version its bs
Sep 12 2020,negative,it wasnt anything special the visuals were nothing new besides a slight different palette i found it hard to stay focused or invested in the characters or story overall none of the wonders or magic you remember from your childhood just a boring retelling of a good tale      plus what was the whole qi thing we get a quick glimpse of it at the start then out of no where its shoved into our faces again and were supposed to believe this is how she saves her country there was no real journey or character development
Sep 12 2020,negative,this is not a disneys production its a typical chinese movie with the disneys stamp of approval on it so that it could be marketed at a high price just like all bigbudget chinese movies these day it has some big names nice scenery nice set etc but lousy story and even worse storytelling     the original 花木兰 story is actually a story about filial piety how she overcome all the hardships of war being a solider sacrifices she made etc whist still being true to herself her family and her country 花木兰代父从军 says it all and these are the words that resonated with me even after all these years merely from hearing the story alone and not actually having read or watched the story it certainly is not about womenpower or the insecure witch or the unrealistically portrayed emperor nor the simpleminded bori khan crap in no way did this movie portray the atrocities of war instead each scene is a typical setup of what we would normally see in chinese movies today     even if the movie were in chinese it would at most be a 6 or 65 anything above that would be coming from someone with an agenda but hey since when casting a vote its all or nothing i would go with nothing its simply not a movie worthy of its price
Sep 12 2020,positive,i watched it by removing my any correlation with the animation therefore i find it quite entertaining 
Sep 12 2020,negative,visuals terrible story was fiiiine  soundtrack out of place acting really bad overall just a bad movie with ok story
Sep 12 2020,negative,i really cannot understand who thought this was good script  the movie has occasional moments but its generally horribly paced  the main character has almost no character arc or development shes a classic disney mary sue and her only change is to stop holding back on her super powers  this dreadful live recreation somehow missed all that was charming in the original  its a shame because there is some genuinely good acting and cinematography in this movie  costumes are well done but its hard to get over the horrible script and pacing
Sep 12 2020,positive,i really enjoyed mulan growing up i had seen so many adaptions of mulan and this one was beautiful although this adaption is different from the original but the storyline is powerful it focus on woman empowering woman redefining gender roles family and much more although i dont agree with the actress political views but everyone are entitled to their own opinions overall it was a lovely movie
Sep 12 2020,negative,its like the original without any of the charms drama or memorable music and characters and the editing is garbage
Sep 12 2020,negative,mulan is a chinese storybut this movie is not
Sep 12 2020,negative,cringed throughout the whole film so many cultural and historical inaccuracies especially when they kept emphasizing about honor which is an extremely inaccurate stereotype by that you can tell that the film is made by people who do not really understand the culture or the story the original story of mulan has so much more going on than represented in the film ill just point out a few chi wasnt even a part of the story mulan had an older sister and a younger brother mulan wasnt even han ethnicity so there were less social restrictions honor was never mentioned in the original story buildings more than 2 floors were very rare not to even mention the 3 story buildings that kept showing up throughout the film etc  i also hated that the plot did not allow the characters to fully develop so that the audience can be attached each character basically only had one sentence per conversation everything just went over so quickly very awkwardly  lastly whats with the phoenix in ancient china the phoenix is a representation of the queen if the hua family had their family animal as a phoenix they would not last that long cause the whole clan would be executed for treason  the whole film is basically a disaster and as an asian i feel very offended by this film the only thing i liked was where christina aguilera sang reflection in the credits
Sep 12 2020,negative,it took everything interesting from the original removed it made the main character bland and uninteresting added a random new villain removed all but 5 characters picked random scenes from the original and decided to make them worse while adding in new ones horrible editing in most scenes and more i would say save the money but its not worth your time even when it is available for free watch the original its actually good
Sep 12 2020,negative,200 millions dollars really there are better movies even series on netflix that this garbage 
Sep 12 2020,negative,nothing like the childhood movie you loved added this took away that its a different movie  dont waste hrs watching it 
Sep 12 2020,negative,live action mulan was a disgrace the character building and story building were the worst ive ever seen by disney the script had no depth the score was terrible and did not even create any suspense or emotion the effects were cheap the bad guy didnt seem scary and the battle with him was very anticlimactic there didnt even seem to be any emotion in this movie im highly disappointed in this film disgrace to the whole story disgrace to the animated film i get trying to be true to the original story but disney really lost the audience in the process it seems like no money was spent for this movie and they just tried to throw out a movie just because more time should have been spent on the score script and acting would never watch this again and im a disney fan do yourself a favor and only watch the animated mulan 
Sep 12 2020,negative,garbage remake i had to go back and watch the original movie just to get the crap out of my eyes i regret the 30s i spent on this garbage the regret is real
Sep 12 2020,negative,garbage what a waste of time
Sep 12 2020,negative,sorely disappointed the only character who had any sort of emotional depth was yao and mulans younger sister neither of whom displayed any compelling relationship with the either titular character or the plot
Sep 12 2020,negative,this was a total butchering of the ballad of mulan which this was designed to model after the historical inaccuracies were baffling the set and costume designer didnt bother doing research to make sure that it resemble anything from the northern wei era it was a hodgepodge kebab of a mixture of time frames this isnt some low budget c class film do your due diligence and get your facts straight disney     terrible facts aside the way the movie was edited was awful they overly cgid the fight scenes  tragic since they cast martial arts masters who have made amazing martial arts films in the past and had trouble transitioning from scene to scene the writers assumed you know the story line and cut to scenes without any build up or introduction        liu yifei doesnt embody the character of mulan her acting was very lackluster it came off as very bland and boring she had little to no chemistry with her costars    overall i couldnt really tell who was the targeted audience for this movie its graphic enough to not be suitable for children yet the unappealing to adults this may be one of the worst live action remakes disney has ever attempted it felt like an asian cast acting out a terrible overly gentrified retelling of a classic chinese folklore
Sep 12 2020,negative,this remake essentially removed everything that made the original movie good may as well have been its own standalone movie also filming in xinjiang was an incredibly stupid decision by disney overall awful
Sep 12 2020,negative,the film director niki c completely missed the point of mulan and the important moments of the first movie no music no story no drama no continuity and what a disaster  i cant believe you removed key components from the first movie dragon and cricket  lets go back to the drawing board and discuss who the target audience is and what moment you should keep and not remove
Sep 12 2020,neutral,its good the cinematography the cast the plot was kinda ok its entertaining though there are some scenes that are downside for me but overall worth to watch
Sep 12 2020,negative,first of all id like to mention that when disney announce the movie woldnt include the music or mushu i was fine with that actually i was glad because i saw real potential un making a different movie focused on the aspects of war  however what i saw was really disappointing the story wasnt great the dialogues didnt connect it felt like there was no coherence between lines no chemistry between characters the editng was terrible the fight scenes were meh thats the best word i can find to describe them  the new villains suck i kinda felt for the witch but it didnt work enough for me i understood her but something was missing to make her story soomething more interesting  there was a thing about the qi that didnt make sense there was a complete plot whole with that  i wont comment about female empowerment because as a man i do believe its not my place to do so  so the story was lame it didnt pay off as a new version of the story god i regret spending those 30 dollars
Sep 12 2020,positive,very entertaining for fans of disneys first mulan movie it was different but i can appreciate both renditions
Sep 12 2020,positive,waiting for mulan ii
Sep 12 2020,negative,if they were going to do it they should have done it well
Sep 12 2020,negative,horrible    the movie has too many conveniences mulan is a mary sue she contradicts herself at all times for example with the chi that mulan hid when she entered the army because it seemed that only women had high chi when not it didnt make sense what steven universe did to the diamonds the villains in the series does not compare to what mulan did with the witch here because i literally evangelize her because mulan is a woman the choreographies are hideously shot and the special effects super cheesy and the movie cost over  200 million so theres no excuse    the movie is bad even if the animated one didnt exist    my rating 1010
Sep 12 2020,negative,mulan starts out terribly and plays like a bad anime adaptation as a child goes on to preform impossible feats for even a trained adult it did pick up as the movie introduced their replacement for the huns it made the new direction the movie took seem less still interesting and fascinating however this did not keep    the movie then resumes changing most everything that made me enjoy the original fun the movie was not funny the entire opening there was no attempt at humor the jokes in the movie seemed to be for the characters and didnt translate to the audience it then resumed taking inspiration from anime action which looked silly in a disney movie why a person hitting the ground from four feet knocks  him unconscious is a mystery     the hun replacements did continue to feel great throughout the movie while the witch sorta detracted from it they werent able to carry the movie as they had sparse scenes a good bad guy wasnt enough to save a movie full of bad good guys    chi was a really unnecessary addition ive heard this was a movie that was aimed for an asian audience and as such it completely isolated everyone else if that type of movie is something you enjoy then i suppose you could enjoy it but i will say most people will not have fun watching this movie
Sep 12 2020,positive,i loved the movie the legend of mulan is totally in this movie the action scenes are very good and the actors were awesome in the movie 5 stars
Sep 12 2020,positive,omg so good its not the cartoon it doesnt have songs and dancing and such but man it really delivered so much talent went into making such a satisfying movie
Sep 12 2020,negative,if disney had mildly tweaked the story changed the character names and called it by a different title it would have been considered in much higher regard    instead they created a movie where the expectation was so different from what they created that they set up the audience for disappointment    this was a failure in marketing more than a failed movie disney should have known better such a disappointment
Sep 11 2020,positive,i wasnt expecting it to be a remake of the animation so i wasnt put off by the differences    maybe its because ive watched a ton of cheesy movies recently but i didnt think mulan was that bad there were some rather silly moments and some examples of things happeningnot happening as simply being subject to the needs of the plot but when you consider that this is really meant to be a family movie with some younger demographics theyre acceptable    personally i think the main letdown is that mulan isnt meant to be a chosen one ala joan of arc with some special aspect chi shes supposed to be this average girl who did what she did to protect her family shes supposed to represent all women and show that any woman is capable
Sep 11 2020,negative,destroyed most of what was good about the original without bringing anything new to the table
Sep 11 2020,negative,corny looked like it had small cast to be low budget not nearly as much cool action as anticipated the previews were waaaay better than the movie
Sep 11 2020,negative,one of the most emotionless movies ive ever seen
Sep 11 2020,positive,so refreshing to not be a scene for scene copy it is a chinese warkung fu serious retelling the left out elements would not have fit in this unique movie 
Sep 11 2020,positive,i enjoyed it and was even moved to tears a few times 
Sep 11 2020,negative,i wanted to love this but its a high production valued dumpster fire that captures none of the elements that made the original animated movie so great
Sep 11 2020,negative,this movie strips every thing that made the original good  and thows it in the trash
Sep 11 2020,negative,predictable and boring nothing to it anticlimactic action scenes id rather pass the time with a movie ive already seen and liked much better
Sep 11 2020,negative,ive never been more disappointed by a film
Sep 11 2020,negative,where is moshu where is the fantastic songs why mulan have chi this is no good
Sep 11 2020,negative,worse than the animated one but passible didnt like the chosen one aspects of the story kind of removed some of the meaning behind it
Sep 11 2020,negative,stick to the original
Sep 11 2020,negative,this movie felt very lifeless to me visually the cinematography is absolutely beautiful and i like the practicality of the wire work in a lot of the stunts but storywise it felt very bland i felt like there were a lot of moments in the movie that dont make sense like mulan quaking and avalanche to happen the filmmakers here have definitely seen disneys agents of shield and definitely know who daisy johnson is the first half of the movie almost felt like it was screaming the words do you remember this part that the animation did so much better and i found that very annoying i also found it a bit strange that they pronounce mulans surname differently than the animation thats kind of like the difference between the name aang in avatar the last airbender vs the m night shyamalan movie and how they pronounce the name in that movie i also found it annoying when donnie yen was talking to mulan and said as tranquil as a forest but on fire within is annoying because i really thought that the songs were going to be incorporated into the score a lot more but instead we only got the song reflection ncorporated into the score one of the biggest issues i have with the movie is the plotline about mulan having the power of chi that annoyed me because in the animation its about this clumsy weak girl who has to learn to compete and convince only fight as these big strong men and we get the evolution of that through the song ill make a man out of you in the animated movie when the incorporated element of chi and show how its used by mulan in her childhood it kind of throws that whole sequence away from the animated movie that would be on top of the fact that we have a sequence about the soldiers carrying water buckets to the top of the mountain with their arms straight out as a strength building exercise another big problem i have with the movie is that the theme of this movie from the very beginning is be who you truly are without hiding it even though your culture tells you that you should be what they expect you to be instead of who you really are the animated movie does have the element of mulan hiding her identity disguise as a man and there isnt undertone in the animated movie about being true to yourself its just that with the animated film the main story is about mulan trying to protect her father because he does have a busted leg i also just want to put it in there that i think they did jet li dirty in this movie when they decided to overdub his voice jet li is an actor that can speak english weve seen it in more than 10 of his movies whenever we see jet li as the emperor on screen you can instantly tell that its not him talking because the voice is disconnected from the mouth it doesnt match up perfectly and i personally know his voice because ive seen him in several movies speaking english so what made no sense to overdub jet li as the emperor in this movie    so that was basically the first half of the movie before we get to the action in the battles before i talk about the second half of the movie i want to talk about editing of the movie and how the story feels like theres a lot of missing plot because of the way they added it in the sequence when mulan is grabbing her fathers store and his armor to take his place and disguise herself as a man we just did jumpcut of milan holding the sword and then jump cut to mulan wearing the armor in the animated movie we get this beautiful instrumental sequence of milan preparing to leave home and take her fathers place which when compared to this live action movie works thematically and visually much better for me we also get the sequence with mulan parents discovering that she took her fathers place in the army the specific line reading is what destroyed the sequence of the parents discovering that mulan took his place im still talking about the first half of the movie this idea of the phoenix throughout the movie is kind of interesting even though the phoenix doesnt really do anything except fly in the direction that mulan is supposed to travel i thought it would have been much better storytelling to have the phoenix represent the girl that society wants milan to be kind of metaphorically being killed and milan resurrecting herself as who she truly wants to be or who shes truly supposed to be i thought that would have been a much better use of the phoenix in this story  one of the biggest things i have a problem with in this movie and im pretty sure ive said that phrase a lot already is the fact that in the big battle in the movie mulan decides to take off her armor and ride back into battle she took off her armor and ride back into battle and is basically invincible because shes the main character kind of like vin diesel and paul walker in the movie furious 7 where they going to a warehouse with a swat team and the entire swat team which is wearing body armor gets shot dead even though vin diesel and paul walker are not wearing any armor at all and come out of it without a scratch the same thing happens here with mulan taking off her armor and we see a bunch of soldiers with full armor getting killed    then there is the f avalanche and the f quake so does element of tri that milan has to hide apparently automatically gives her the skills of parkour and kung fu fighting everybody was fast as lightning and apparently it also gives her f earthquake powers like daisy johnson from the show agents of shield speaking of agents of shield i both loved and hated the cameo from mingna wen  because ive seen the original animated movie so many times it was it was frustrating to see the superior actress who was in a superior version of the same movie  i have to mention that i hate the fact that the villain of this movie takes back seat to a witch  i just didnt like that part of the story at all what disappoints me most about this movie is that i honestly think that as a musical even if they dont incorporate mushu the dragon or lucky cricket i think that would have had potential to be the best disney liveaction remakes so far  story elements like mulan randomly deciding to go back into battle but letting her hair down and taking off her armor are just stupid and im going to say it just stupid it works much better in the animated film because she gets wounded in battle and the doctors discovered shes a woman after the fact when tending to her wounds also we filled up this culture of women are subservient men dont listen to what women say and women just have to shut up and be there and look pretty we set this up throughout the entire movie and then one mulan comes back to the army to say that the emperor is under attack they just kind of decide to believe her right then and there in the animated movie we see all of these people in the crowd ignoring the mulan and not listening to her because shes a woman  even captain shane questioned whether or not he could believe mulan because she lied and deceived her for months while they were training and went to battle     i really do think that the cinematography and the stunts look phenomenal in this movie you can definitely tell that everything was shot at extremely high framerate so that they could take any shot in the movie and slow it down for slowmotion anytime they wanted to for any sequence in the movie some of the fighting is cut way too fast making it impossible to see whats happening at that exact moment there are timeline skips in the movie that just throw me off because itll skip something that should have been like 1 minute of time skip theres also other time skips in the movie that just make me feel like theres a lot of story that missing because of the time skips     to come to conclusion i think this was a very disappointing movie that had a lot of plot holes and very poor and very poor screenplay  theres also a lot of things that happen that are not consistent throughout the movie mike mulans vague set of powers that she gets from the chi  i did not watch this movie on disney plus because i decided to just download it for free to me that makes it worth watching because i didnt have to waste 30 just to watch the movie because if i had paid to watch the movie it would have felt like i really got ripped off for the price and it would have felt like i wasted the time to watch the movie having watched this movie for free i feel like it was okay and thats it     on a positive note i watched this movie with my mom she really enjoyed the movie and said she had a great time and she thought it was a beautiful movie
Sep 11 2020,negative,cgi was really distracting and pulled you out of the otherwise beautiful movie many scenes were extremely cringy that it baffled me as to how that made it into the movie
Sep 11 2020,negative,oh god this terrible and bad
Sep 11 2020,negative,the characters are flat and the story is boring also some misunderstanding of chinese culture so sad
Sep 11 2020,negative,there is no logic in the story of this movie and mulan look exactly like a robot in a live action movie the original cartoon version is better
Sep 11 2020,positive,its good to watch some history movies
Sep 11 2020,positive,visually the movie was stunning but overall lacked any character development and background details that wouldnt make sense to a newcomer of mulan 
Sep 11 2020,negative,i always thought there was a point of inversion where if a movie got so bad it became good disney just proved that wrong
Sep 11 2020,negative,director has no knowledge of chinese culture and the historical background of the story but to randomly putting some so called chinese ideas together with no respect and shows little evidence that she studied the content at all the story itself is a merely chinese cover with its inherent american modern movie thinking and wording this movie is at best a hollywood commercial show for those who knows little at all of chinese culture but to see some chinese factors that only they want to see and in a way that they want these factors to be
Sep 11 2020,negative,just watch the original this is a soulless remake that literally removes everything that made the original mulan cartoon great mulan was a relatable character with struggles that overcame them with dedication and smarts while in this movie this mulan is just a super special personal with special abilities that just needs to not be oppressed by society
Sep 11 2020,negative,boring and lifeless
Sep 11 2020,positive,best live action remake i have seen from disney i am not sure why everyone is hating on it so bad it still tugged at my heartstrings i think people get a little butthurt when a remake varies from the original in the least lighten up people i think youve been quarantined too long
Sep 11 2020,positive,overall it was a good movie if you have never seen the disney version of it if you base it off of it being a live action film from the original mulan then there is a lot of differences theres characters missing as well as new main characters added in  overall if mulan was your favorite movie growing up then this one will disappoint you but still good to watch
Sep 11 2020,positive,mulan is not a bad movie its pretty entertaining the visuals are incredible and beautifuli like how it honors the history when it takes place but the problem with this movie is the same as with many of these remakes you dont feel the depth and greatness of the originals the characters are nice and there are some great performances but there is a lack of depth and emotion that makes it disappointing also the movie trying to follow the general outline of the original makes it hollow but the good thing it brings the story to a new generation the songs of the original and mushu were not needed this movie was realistic
Sep 11 2020,negative,2 points are for the occassionally good visual efect turning mulan into a witch with superpower is just lazy writing and i thought the filmaker is trying to make to movie more realistic a witch that could morph into birds people jay walking on walls really
Sep 11 2020,negative,stop doing this disney
Sep 11 2020,neutral,this was extremely disappointing for me personally i felt that disney tried to listen to all the problems that people have had with their liveaction remakes and roll with it however this is just lacking that spark of fantasy that the original had yes the original had a small dragon and all these other magical elements but this shouldve stayed that way we arent asking for them to change everything only to keep the initial magic that we feel when watching a disney film i didnt feel that with this movie        the leading performance by liu yifei was absolutely perfect though she really captured the awkward nature of mulans character while also giving us that badass quality she really needs most of the performances were perfectly fine the most disappointing performance for me was that of donnie yen i think he is an extremely underrated actor and stuntman i usually really like his performances whenever i see him sadly this wasnt his best        overall this movie had its moments but very few and far between i wish they kept more elements from the original film than they did
Sep 11 2020,negative,this is a bad movie  i can understand taking the music out but this movie barely any melody on many important scenes and the most they try to do is to play some chunks from good songs from the animated movie to try and convey some emotion  they took out the mushu and the ancestors ghosts because it was not meant to be a mystical story or some nonsense just to put in chinese chi magic a shapeshifting witch and wall climbing shadow mongolian ninjas that they couldnt even call by name  the only good actors are the villain the general and mulans father everyone else has no emotion and no stage chemistry i dont believe a thing they say and the scene progression sometimes is laughably bad im looking at you avalanche battle  the editing for this movie is something akin to taken 3 so many bad cuts specilly towards the end of the movie  the cg was bad what people say about the phoenix being a good adition is a damn lie the phoenix looked like it came out of some 2005 movie it sais nothing and makes mulan look like a schizophrenic because nobody else sees it  they cut out a lot of what made this movie good in the animation to just replace it with flat and uninteresting scenes or characters dont pay to see this
Sep 11 2020,negative,just watched the movie in full despite the boycott human rights issue pertinent in xinjang where they took few scenes and acknowledged to the department at the centre of inhumane detainment of civilians     i just watched it for the memory of my childhood with expectation that the disney could do something wonderful like what they have done with aladdin     folks be warned this movie is recommended for those who do not mind having their childhood memory ruined   three features including mulan is a women avalanche and celebration with firework are only common things you will find from mulan 2020 to our original mulan     message of course the key message from mulan is about being who you are regardless of your gender this wasnt new as mulan 1998 have well delivered this message   my thoughts on mulan 1998 was that the song reflection was the flag in the movie where mulan faces herself living a life fulfilling expectations of others around her the new mulan didnt explain this well wellthey did but stopping mulan from running on the roof chasing rooster is clearly not of flag where viewers and sympathise her limitation of course this scene did not do its job that could have replaced the song reflection     independent and being selfish are completely different as this could be a matter of controversy i would not say much but i had impression from the new mulan that she was being selfish rather than being independent     overcasting  to those who loved asian movie for past 20 years you will agree with me that the casting of new mulan was massive as avengers they even cast peipei as a match maker who appears in the movie for about a minute and half   jet li plus doonie yen is like a golden equation for a legendary action movie but the action scenes in the movie wasnt as dynamic as recent or even some movies from 90s hk action movies     lastly the only seller for this movie is the visual   i found background scene were almost good as lord of the rings but sadly that was it
Sep 11 2020,negative,people say they wasted 200 million on sceneric cgi that they have no place for music in it why was a snowy mountain as they were training right after they show her travel through a dessert and that the place was located in a desert and then show a desert mountain again in the next scene it makes no sense the lighting and cinematography was also terrible as it doesnt give you the feel that the place it was set on was old ancient china
Sep 11 2020,neutral,boring the original movie is much better
Sep 11 2020,negative,i think this version of mulan is really rotten and the characters it self is so numb
Sep 11 2020,negative,i had higher expectations from this piece of art well that is if you can call it that it does not have the flair of previous mulan adaptions considering depth of character nor the lightfooted easyiness of the former disney mulan just another real life disney adaption no one wanted or needed so sad to see literally
Sep 11 2020,positive,i really liked mulan especially the theme of female empowerment and the beautiful vistas scenery and costumes  viewers should know it is different from the animated storyline but that is to be expected with a live action remake because of this you dont have the songs and the charming and funny little creatures as in the animated mulan  but it wouldnt belong in this live action mulan so you should go in to the new film with this in mind  to add to the magic there are elements of mysticism with new characters  the lead actors are perfect in their roles
Sep 11 2020,positive,ignore the haters i found this to be fun and entertaining with a cheesy ending but what more do you want from a disney movie  its got plenty of high flying action with some mild humor and a good cast
Sep 11 2020,negative,attrocious movie with a chosenone cliche and an idiot plot if mulans father had gone instead of her he would have just been sent back if he couldnt pass the tests to fight so nothing actually drives the plot
Sep 11 2020,positive,i have watched it from pakistan its an amazing movie with incredible acting skills displayed by every actor especially liu yifei great direction storyline music and talented cast everything were perfect everyone should watch mulan
Sep 11 2020,positive,i think this movie is being very unfairly rated was it my favorite disney film no was it really good still yes i knew what to expect going into it and so should you disney has two types of live action those that stick very closely to the original and those that do not this one is the latter that being said there are still great elements from the original including pieces of the original animated classics music worked into the new film score if youre going into this expecting to see eddy murphy as mushu and sing ill make a man out of you youre going to be very disappointed but if you look at this as a retelling of the ballad of mulan i think its very enjoyable to watch with the family and also a great way to support a film that stars almost all poc 
Sep 11 2020,negative,absolute garbage of a film that should not have been made
Sep 11 2020,negative,the movie is an attempt to recreate the story of the original animated series however it fails to tell the story and seems to have the opposite message of the animated movie and they use of chinas concentration camps are absolutely disgusting
Sep 11 2020,negative,another soulless disney remake that destroys everything that made the animated original a classic
Sep 11 2020,positive,finally a great mulan movie 
Sep 11 2020,negative,didnt enjoy at all watch the 90s its better anyway even the trashy sequel of mulan is a better watch mulan is no a mary sue she isnt flawed in any way youll have more enjoyment watching paint dry then this movie
Sep 11 2020,negative,why there have no mushu mulan becomes a soldierman and turns into a woman to save the army the plot is stiff
Sep 11 2020,negative,movie is boring i can say the worst remake from disney so far everything in this movie looks dry and forced and there is no heart to it
Sep 11 2020,negative,the original movie is much much betterplus i didnt get any emotion changes from that actress
Sep 11 2020,negative,as other reviews have said this movie reads like one of the lowtier marvel movies visually impressive but lacking everything else  none of the charm of the original animated movie is present and the often wooden acting surely does not bring honor to the original chinese tale mulan is unfortunately somewhat of a mary sue and her military companions lines are so bad no one would believe they were real people overall disney released another lowquality live action reimagining to go along with the others this review would probably be a onestar if had not been for the impressive visuals
Sep 11 2020,negative,i cant believe how bad this movie was  terrible plot and awful quality
Sep 11 2020,negative,this movie is terrible my 4 daughters favorite disney movie is mulan the animated version  they all hated this movie  the plot is unbelievably bad theres this magicchi which replaces the former mulans intelligence and ingenuity the the production quality is super cheap  this does not feel like a big budget movie it was laughable  speaking of humor this movie lacked it
Sep 11 2020,negative,very boring painful to sit through if you are familiar with the original needs mushu and murphy
Sep 11 2020,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever seen in my entire life if not the ultimate worst
Sep 11 2020,positive,this is by far the second best movie to be released in disneys remake era its nice to see they havent lost all creativity and originality in these types of movies as was the case with aladdin and lion king the only reason i do not go 5 stars is because the acting is sometimes a bit lacking and the cgi could look a bit fake at times other than that i see it as a wonderful new addition to the legend that is mulan
Sep 11 2020,negative,might be ok if you didnt see the original
Sep 11 2020,positive,i absolutely loved it and im sad its getting so much hate i went in with zero expectations and ended up liking it even more than the animated version in some ways
Sep 11 2020,negative,trash super boring and over the top cheesy and dumb nothing like the original 
Sep 11 2020,positive,i like it i know people didnt like it but i did i loved the actors and actresses it was funny cute and yes it was nothing like the movie in some aspect but at this point what do you want a mulan 2 then you would except the movie smh enjoy the movie its 2020 and we cant go to the theaters so martial arts is your thing then you would like this if your sad its not the same way then ask disney to come from the dead its just what it is new modern and good and i loved the cartoon
Sep 11 2020,negative,if you want your daughter to see an inspiring female lead with a great character arc watch the animation     this movie ruined the character arc of mulan and leaves us with a character who does not need to grow at all    what a waste all the emotion conveyed in mulans difficult decisions from the animation is gone  the cgi is distracting the movie tries to be realistic but disney is not brave enough to actually go far enough to make this idea work
Sep 11 2020,negative,this is the worst movie ive seen in a while im not kidding if i could give 0 stars i would i cried after i saw this the animated mulan is my favorite disney movie and i could not bear to see the story twisted into such a horrible rendition what are we even trying to teach young girls that they can change around 4 thousand years of sexism provided that they have some magic mojo oh and they should make dangerous decisions and never own up to the consequences there was no character development and the actors were like blocks of wood the script was so cliche that it was like watching a movie from the 70s i had to go back and watch the old mulan to restore my faith in humanity
Sep 11 2020,negative,garbage no character dev terrible dialogue just looking to profit off bored people sitting at home watch the old cartoon instead 
Sep 11 2020,negative,it looks like a tv movie and dubbed it in english language many errors can be fix but they changed in a bad way why they cant choose liveaction mulan speaking in traditional chinese language i was expecting great but when i watched it so much dissapionted after i watched it too much expensive 30  for a mess film
Sep 11 2020,positive,i was skeptical at first but i have been recommending this movie to all of my friends great work
Sep 11 2020,negative,boring lack of charm missing the dragon no dancing horse and overall just lacking real cheer  try hard epic  bad acting jedi character you just cannot relate to  old movie had real character and overcoming challenges this is just disappointing in every way  wow disney just keeps making things bad
Sep 11 2020,negative,i thought this movie was very boring how do you take a badass character like mulan and make her boring make her a mary sue character the movie is centered around chi mulan had very strong chi since she was a little girl the opening scene demonstrates that she is a very skilled child by making her run across a rooftop and doing acrobatics which reminded me of the very first scene in legend of korra when the white lotus meet her for the first time korra who is a very young chuld comes busting through a wall bending water and shooting fire out of her hand    i laughed one time at the training montage sequence when everyone was sleeping and one of the guys rolled over onto mulan so she hit him and he rolled to the other side of the bed and rolled onto another random guy    overall i did not enjoy the movie
Sep 11 2020,neutral,although the visuals are wonderful and the effort put into reinterpreting the story in a different light was fascinating i feel as though the magic of the movie came from the original mulan soundtrack with the classic songs that were incorporated within the original animation this movie did not feel like a fairytale it felt more like an expression of how good the mulan plot is without the disney magic involved
Sep 11 2020,positive,emotional full of heroic spirit perfect to inspire girls and strong women
Sep 11 2020,positive,as spoiler free as possible despite being very hypocritical in its development decisions being a bit fast paced with minimal information and some awkward acting and camera angles 2020 mulan wasnt as bad as i had anticipated it isnt an avatar or pacific rim but it doesnt fall under green lantern or sharknado either its a smidge better than ok i preferr the 1998 mulan over this one but id watch it if there was nothing else interesting on tv
Sep 11 2020,negative,by far the worst liveaction disney movie i have ever seen this does not do the animated film any justice whatsoever
Sep 11 2020,negative,it was very predictable and not worth the money
Sep 11 2020,negative,its not the worst of the disney live action remakes however that doesnt stop it from being a mostly dull and soulless experience not worth 34 cad
Sep 11 2020,negative,cant even compare with the animated edition decades ago shame on disney
Sep 11 2020,positive,very well done fantastic movie the new pieces of storyline were well done and gave the movie a fun new element i was surprised it wasnt a musical but it worked quite well with inserting the instrumentals at the right times really great loved it
Sep 11 2020,negative,i would give 0 stars if possible simple
Sep 11 2020,negative,why is mulan a jedi now this is bad
Sep 11 2020,negative,stilted forced unnatural dialogue simple plot with simple characters poorly written script acted without feeling are these the best actors they could get for the money overexplained cultural terms main character comes off as arrogant and selfdeterministically motivated rather than family oriented female nemesis was unnecessary and poorly derived the attempt to merge western ideals and pandering to the chinese communist ideal was painful the scenery was at times beautiful but at other times overindulgent leaving me to wonder what was really and what was computer generated worst movie i have seen in a long time
Sep 11 2020,negative,i dont know what happened i was so disappointed with the movie they should stick with the old story line just like the lion king
Sep 11 2020,negative,it pales in comparison to the animated original it is supposed to emulate and respect honestly it isnt worth watching at all it does nothing to further build upon or enrich the ballad either
Sep 11 2020,negative,pure garbage please understand i love mulan the animated version the story the heroine everything  however this rendition was pure trash and i am so disappointed  there was zero character development i literally dont think they even gave the characters names any of them could have died and i would not have cared  the story seemed to base itself off the animated movie with little to no story building of it own and not provide any additional information background history just some very artistic cinematic shots of battle scenes  the actors i think did a very good job portraying themselves as historic chinese characters i completely fault the director and production team
Sep 11 2020,positive,great film love it mulan is beautiful
Sep 11 2020,negative,well gosh golly gee disney who could have thought that if you take all the most memorable parts of an animated classic youd end up with a soulless shell that has no personality also saying the word chi doesnt make you knowledgeable about chinese culture and if you were aiming for realism why is there a phoenix
Sep 11 2020,negative,no songs no mushu mulan has incredible power that different from animation version
Sep 11 2020,negative,wrong message in my opinion in this movie her chi is what makes her special but in the cartoon version she wasnt born with any special gifts she was just a girl who worked hard and fought for her family independent of her limitations or her gender
Sep 11 2020,positive,better than the cartoon thats for sure and let us not speak of the mushu character in the cartoon version also it looks like most of these reviews were made without the person even watching the movie sad just sad 
Sep 11 2020,negative,i dont want to watch that angin
Sep 11 2020,negative,forgetting the politics original disney mulan was a normal girl who used her brain and perseverance to get ahead this modern mulan is born great
Sep 11 2020,negative,movie was slow weak plot found myself wanting to do other things than actually watch the film
Sep 11 2020,negative,not worth your money at all
Sep 11 2020,negative,the original was much much better
Sep 11 2020,negative,dont call it a remake if you are going to alter 80 of the movie nothing compared to the original
Sep 11 2020,negative,take everything great about the true story and the animation that was amazing and shove in a bunch of ridiculous crap like witches and jedi chi powers and you are left with the ridiculous bland uninspired load of crap that is 2020s mulan  a thievish cash grab
Sep 11 2020,positive,this movie really spoke to me there were a couple of scenes i think could have been handled better but overall the movie felt solid and the action was good i loved the emphasis on being true watch the movie for what it is the retelling of an eastern legend that still inspires us so many hundreds of years later
Sep 10 2020,negative,they took out everything that made a disney film magical and made a horrid attempt at a half assed serious film it sits in an awkward spot of not serious enough but also not fun or entertaining    the cgi was bad the acting was bad the plot was bad    they betrayed everything the original mulan film had but still forcibly tried to make it a mulan film    they claimed to have done so much research into chinese history yet made so many grave errors that made it even more inaccurate than the original film the building they used didnt even belong to china in that period of time the old plot of the original film had much more plausibility even with mushu and cricket accounted for    i didnt have high hopes coming in i was still disappointed they could butcher it so bad
Sep 10 2020,negative,story is the typical stuff you see now day being pushed by the media nothing interesting
Sep 10 2020,positive,story show chinese parents thinking and it influence on teenagers thinking psychologically teenager is looking for autonomy push boundaries risk taking  and emotional approval this may explain the rating of the movie from teenager is different from fate of adult in shot the movie is excellent from more adult point of view it could be better if it include teenager thinking into the movie
Sep 10 2020,negative,why was there so much focus on her being this unbeatable character that needed no development she never had to actually struggle to be what she wasnt the whole hide your chi and because you are an unstoppable force just makes it less interesting the original had mulan actually work to build up to what she could do but she was in the end still just a human who made mistakes
Sep 10 2020,negative,this movie was pretty awful the action is so so no fun no singing no mushu disney needs to stop if they are going to give other live action remakes this treatment by removing all the fun
Sep 10 2020,positive,amazing action beautifully directed by niki caro stunning visuals a beautiful epic score by harry gregson williams and changes that makes it more sophisticated than the original animated easily the best disney live action remake to date
Sep 10 2020,negative,this movie is completely different from the animation like everything that was good from the animation is absent mulan was my favorite animation when i grew up only the plot was the same but everything else was completely different i hated this i am still in disbelief how bad this movie was
Sep 10 2020,negative,lots of crazy cgi covering a thin story
Sep 10 2020,negative,the original animated mulan is about an ordinary woman becoming a warrior with great effort  this live action is about a special woman with special qi and that is the reason she has talent this simply throws away the whole reason why the original was so positively acclaimed
Sep 10 2020,negative,no mushu no training not an accurate remake of the original waste of time
Sep 10 2020,negative,whoa this movie was incredible boring and had none of the charm from the original disney really pooped the bed on this one and showing more now than ever their tone deaf approach on current events and audience save yourself theoney and time and watch something else
Sep 10 2020,negative,animated mulan is better with the mushu and his immortal texts  the film is but it will quickly fade in memory i definitely recommend watching the animated mulan  than to devote time to this movie
Sep 10 2020,negative,very historically inaccurate what a waste of great actors
Sep 10 2020,negative,not original at all basically crouching tiger hidden dragon
Sep 10 2020,positive,genuinely enjoyed this film so much ive watched it multiple times and recommended to everyone  all politics aside
Sep 10 2020,negative,terrible worst liveaction which disney has done a disrespect for fans disneys history and the original movie
Sep 10 2020,positive,amazing very fascinating best from all of the disney princess movies cause its not going 100 like cartoon its has more interesting deep story and martial art was amazing liu yifei  perfectly fitted mulan role she did great job
Sep 10 2020,negative,poorly written with no character development     disney strikes again unfortunately were playing baseball and that was their third
Sep 10 2020,negative,this is not a live action of the animated movie they reimagined the whole thing most of the characters lack personality making in simple and almost dull they said they will avoid mushu to make it more realistic but they added unrealistic martial arts fight scenes a witch and a phoenix they also cut some characters like the grandma making mulan to carry the whole movie on her shoulders definitely the animated movie is way better
Sep 10 2020,neutral,the movie was ok the cinematography was cool the movie was gorgeous but it overall underwhelming they changed mulans character arc from learning how to become a warrior through trials and tribulations to become the chosen one from birth the grounded and realistic atmosphere they wanted to give the movie made the movie completely fell apart    although in the beginning mulan is taught to hide her powerful chi because itll make men not wanna marry her which in the beginning i was able to get behind but then when she goes off to war training shes instantly good at everything she partakes and that completely eliminated any sense of urgency there wasnt one time in this movie i thought she might be caught for being a woman or felt on my toes that she might die from war theres one moment in the entire movie i thought there was a possibility she could be caught about her gender was when she fought her new love interest chen using her chi which drew a lot of attention to her but even then i also thought during that time i highly doubt theyre going to suspect mulan cause shes dressed as a man and powerful chi is clearly expected and associated as a positive trait in mensoldiers which is exactly what happened there was not one moment that didnt feel predictable even in the scene where she fought the second villain the wich who just a reminder is the most powerful character in the movie where i thought at the moment i know disneys not going to kill her but maybe shell actually get badly injured in this fight which during the scene she gets badly thrown into some rocks but after that scene there are no consequences she just gets back up and runs back in war with no injuries or pain at all the main reason the animated version is so widely loved is that feminism portrayed through mulan being just an ordinary woman proving to all of china that women are worth more than marriage childbearers in the animated version during war training she even doubts if shes good enough to fight and win the war because shes a woman which gave her character relatability and complex development due to the chosen one arc it ended up making her character one dimensional and hard to relate to maybe if they had exposed mulan to more sexism it would have contrasted her unrelatable superhero character and achieved the whole grounded and realistic approach they were looking for but it just ended up falling flat    another issue i had with the movie is that they removed li shang the director has said they removed him cause they didnt wanna sexualize a commandergeneral but the original animated movie didnt do that li shang was respected throughout the entire movie as an amazing leader and teacher until the very end when he asks mulan in front of her entire family to have dinner they accomplished nothing removing li shang to then just give her another love interest which by the way he never actually ends up with mulan     lastly i wanna end this off with the main difference in the movie from the animated one which is the wich xian lang and the whole magical phoenix plot this plot had so much potential to make this movie actually enjoyable but then in the end these characters never actually accomplish anything they replaced mushu our beloved comedic relief dragon with a gps bird im sorry but i hated that part of the movie so much there excuse for not putting in mushu was so she can have a closer relationship with the soldiers in the army which never actually happens what we have are two mediocre scenes of mulan being close with ling cheinpo and yao btw were watered down versions to the animation cause they wanted the movie to be grounded and realistic which means no comedy at all the only scene i actually liked between them was when they were about to go into war and they all talk about possibly dying and never seeing their loved ones again the phoenix is supposed to be this mystical and powerful bird but then in the movie has basically no effect they could have done so much with this bird like when she fought with the wich for the first time they could have actually had mulan get badly injured then the bird could heal her alas they just had her unrealistically get up with no bruises as for the wich they really screwed her character over they gave her a lame redemption arc instead of what the audience was hoping for which was an epic battle to the death between her and mulan since both characters have magic using their chi but disney couldnt let the woman just be a badass villain the wich had the most potential to actually make this movie great with her being a far more interesting villain than bori khan the parallels between her and mulan along with her bringing more feminism to the movie overall they really pissed me off when they redeemed her character and i realized it was just going to be a boring fight with bori khan that mulan will win cause her chi gave her somewhat supernatural abilities     i wouldnt watch this movie again in comparison to the animation which was better overall this movie just disappointed me because i was so hyped by disneys marketing i expected that this was going to be a grand story of mulan rising to the top to become the hero of china when in actuality it a predictable lowpressure inconsequential movie that got rid of all the charm of the animation
Sep 10 2020,positive,entertaining fun empowering not an exact copy of disneys previous version and no no lizarddragon nor cricket personally its a plus for me but i know a lot of people are attached to mushu so this might influence whether your experience in 2020 mulan is positive or not    the movie will pamper you with breathtaking  sceneries gorgeous costumes vivid color and beautiful martial art moves overall this is a solid movie that my family  1150 yr old enjoyed give  it a chance and watch with an open mind
Sep 10 2020,negative,it feels like a soulless remake of the original animated version and it deviates from the original traditional chinese story that was passed down from generation to generation if disney really cared about the traditional chinese audience as much as they said by removing mushu they should follow the original traditional story instead
Sep 10 2020,negative,feels like i just watched a bgraded movie with a high budget no character development shallow story line etc  its like a 2 hour version of those hard covered kids disney books with a dozen of colorful pages with minimum dialogues
Sep 10 2020,positive,really enjoyed this movie with my husband even shed a couple tears the fatherdaughter relationship was really sweet didnt have to herofy chi but eh theres definitely an ism going on with most of the bad reviews
Sep 10 2020,negative,this movie is dull when viewed as its own film and insulting when compared to disneys original mulan the editing made me extremely sick at times and had no sense of atmosphere plus none of the original songs or mushu thirty dollars is also an outrageous price and i wish i could get a refund
Sep 10 2020,negative,the action scenes have too many cuts between them so you cannot appreciate what is happening some of the acting particularly the actress playing mulan is very wooden and most importantly the screen play is boring
Sep 10 2020,positive,a fresh take on an old tale  while youll never please everyone with a remake of a classic i thought they did a great retelling  the visuals were magnificent and the acting top notch  i could have done without the addition of the witch but otherwise a very satisfying movie
Sep 10 2020,neutral,i wanted to like this ambitious retelling but this movie comes up way short lifeless inauthentic but beautifully shothuge plot holes that make you wonder if you missed something but then youre so bored you dont really care even though there are lots of asian actors it feels like a western or disney interpretation of chinese culture the script sometimes sounds like a bad translation there are a couple of interesting characters and performances but the movie is just not fungo watch the original and crouching tiger hidden dragonthis one will fade into obscurity
Sep 10 2020,positive,is good but i wish was more like the animation movie
Sep 10 2020,negative,so the original mulan worked because she was a normal person who risked her life for her family she was a woman going off to battle against men and she used her smarts and tenacity to overcome the physical disadvantages she had this version of mulan completely stripped her of her bravery by making her a far superior warrior to all the men by giving her a superpower by making her this powerful she is no longer a brave underdog shes just doing what she should be doing in their effort to make a strong female character they stripped mulan of what made her special and strong
Sep 10 2020,negative,a purely worse telling of the mulan story the slight adjustments to the plot yielded no benefit to the movie as a whole terrible editing and writing between the silly fighting and emotionless shell of a story this movie will have you locked in a cringe for the duration 110 would have to pay me to watch
Sep 10 2020,negative,they basically took out everything that made mulan a beloved character
Sep 10 2020,negative,remember when other movie studios would make live action movies about tarzan snow white cinderella or mowgli thats how this movie is it feels like another movie studios take on mulan everything fun about disneys original mulan is gone no lessons of hard work and determination to find ones self nothing i guess disney still hasnt learned its lesson yet
Sep 10 2020,negative,terrible just terrible if you want to waste your time then watch this movie
Sep 10 2020,negative,im not boycotting the movie im not into any gender political racial actor actress bias this movie is just bad the worst liveaction disney has ever made im not being mean to it im not bashing it its just bad ok not worth your 40 and time    cons  full of cliches  scenes that are too predictable  forced plotline  bad actings  terrible editing   loads of slow and unnecessary boring scenes  some scenes are very confusing  many great setups but awful executions    pros  vibrant colors  beautiful shots  has some entertainment value  its a light movie so you can watch without any tension    its not even worth 40
Sep 10 2020,negative,sorry to say this but it is a very disappointing movie  inappropriate cast bad plot poor cg  a complete waste of two hours
Sep 10 2020,neutral,surprisingly lacked the emotional depth of the original animated movie mulan was such an amazing character because she was a normal girl smarter than the rest not some kind of superhero the animated version is more beautifully shot i thought i would like it without mushu but there needed to be some comedy in there it felt like a watered down chinese action movie for american that dont like those kind of movies didnt work when everyone bows to mulan after she saves the emperor in the original i cry i was not emotionally invested in mulan in this version the made up sorceress character was more interesting than the main character i could go on but ill stop at disappointing
Sep 10 2020,negative,worst disney movie yet none of the best characters in the original movie were there she had no conflict didnt grow as a warrior or a woman and there were none of the classic songs from the original movie i waited for this movie for so long i was so excited to see what theyd turn the original mulan into and then they ruined the whole idea of a new mulan by writing the script the way they did so far ive loved all the disney remakes but after seeing this movie it makes me want to be done with disney altogether i had high hopes for this movie thatd itd be as amazing as the past remakes but somehow it managed to miss the mark of a good movie in a million different ways
Sep 10 2020,negative,terrible script writing terrible story ex how does she not get spotted in the middle of the field with a horse shouldve kept the the original story we wanted mulan not another poor representation chinese wannabe war movie the chinese mulan remake was 10x better way to screw this one up disney i appreciate the originality but if youre going to do it maybe perhaps do your research in china and not europe 
Sep 10 2020,negative,it was so depressing  the most somber movie ever  i dont think mulan smiles even once  furthermore there is no character development with mulan  hate to say it because its become a trope but disney created another mary sue  congratulations disney you suck at making character archs
Sep 10 2020,negative,dont waste your 30 my daughters had been waiting with baited breath to see this movie as soon as it was available so we sat the family down to watch it the friday it came out hey 30 for 6 people to see a movie cheap compared to the theater ticket price id have to pay at least thats what i thought at the time there is a reason i dont pay online rental fees much less movie purchase fees for streamed movies that have 3 or fewer stars and are produced by a nobody its not worth even the 45 cost that is where i and my teenage daughters not to mention my sons and wife valued this movie heaving dose of air quotes here the long and short of it was  the movie just didnt do it for any of us it was boring the writing dull the acting barely registered a blip on the heart monitor could any of them deadpan their lines or scenes any stronger god forbid the actors put an real emotional effect into their scenes ever see someone laugh or smile but you can tell that theyre not really in it yeah it was like that oh and lets not even get into the message to girls in the movie if youre not special enough to be blessed with a mans portion of chi or better then all youre good for is making babies staying silent and bending to the will of the men in the family overall the movie lacked decent character development even of mulan herself and we all agreed that the movie was a huge disappointment it reminded me of a lengthy cut scene for a video game or a bunch of cut scenes all mashed together
Sep 10 2020,negative,boring lifeless and the editing could cause a seizure
Sep 10 2020,negative,clearly its a live action adaptation of mulan but its missing a lot of important scenes like when mulan decided to go to war this movie trashed that scene and the most iconic part where mulan climbed the wood to get the arrow this movie is so much inferior from the original
Sep 10 2020,negative,how much pain misery and death have the uighers been caused yet you still turn a blind eye for profit if there is a hell know you have reserved a firstclass ticket
Sep 10 2020,negative,just absolutely a trash movie dont waste your time and money for it
Sep 10 2020,positive,super nice film worth watching film in 2020
Sep 10 2020,negative,dull cynical lifeless soulless cashgrab
Sep 10 2020,negative,a really horrible remake if of a remake we can talk about of one of my favourite childhood cartoons
Sep 10 2020,negative,it sucked im surprised donnie yen wanted to be in this dumpster fire
Sep 10 2020,negative,worst film of 2020   deserves to flop
Sep 10 2020,negative,absolutely not worth the time and money the only good thing was the portrait of the attire really well made and beautiful the cgi was not good the story is nothing related to the original movie the characters were bland with a bad exception of mulan who for some reason has superpowers and is so empowered she forgot the reason for her to get into the army was to keep her father safe disney again ruining good movies with live actions
Sep 10 2020,negative,it really brought dishonor to the whole franchise the color correction is inconsistent so many random unnecessary things like that bird and also this is straight up a superhero movie what happened to woman is as good as men or even better story the change of story is fine but this is downright ridiculous
Sep 10 2020,positive,i think is the best live action that disney has made   you have to watch it with out thinking about de classic mulan 1998 but 100 recommended 
Sep 10 2020,negative,completely strips all the important themes and lessons of the original one even if you dont compare it to the original its still a poorly made movie
Sep 10 2020,negative,not even close to the 98 film all points are missing now mulan instead of being a hard working girl just trying to save her father from death shes another flawless character already gifted since the beginning of the film
Sep 10 2020,negative,lol they sure took a lot of liberties with the story  at the end just like with star wars i was just happy it was over something else they handed over to feminists so that they could make a feminist movie then yell at everyone that doesnt like it   the story is a mess the characters make no sense its all just crap
Sep 10 2020,negative,that was horrible movie even if you do not compare it to the 1998 animation the characters lack depth the editing is terrible and theres nothing compeling about this movie by far the worst remake disney has made
Sep 10 2020,positive,despite the political controversy surrounding liu yifei and disneys film location choices the film itself is gorgeous and very well done we went in knowing the changes from the disney animated version and loved it they still give a big nod to the beloved music from the original disney film we also loved the ming na cameo the voice of the original mulan and the star studded all asian cast many chinese i think this falls right behind cinderella as the best disney live action remake even though its for older audiences we let our chinese american 35 year old watch the first 50 minutes which with the exception of 1 flash of the bad guys that needs skipped about 5 min in is pg for kids and fun for children to see who loved the animated film
Sep 10 2020,negative,so  instead of mulan struggling to earn her place in the army through trials and hardship shes now a super magical being like maryrey skywalker cpt marvel who must contain her power  and literally work to hide how awesome she is
Sep 10 2020,positive,it was a more epic remake of the animated film mulan
Sep 10 2020,negative,honestly no even tlk was this bad i cant  believe they keep ruining things a superhero chinese plain marie sue  no one of the character make you feel anything i didnt care about any of them or mulan the worst movie of 2020
Sep 10 2020,negative,it just lacked soul it felt like i was watching a foreign film not a beloved disney movie i tried to look at it as a new separate movie from the original and even then it was lame
Sep 10 2020,neutral,was a little bit different from what i expected didnt like it
Sep 10 2020,negative,no character growth and disrespecting chinese culture
Sep 10 2020,neutral,the movie was beautiful but there was no developement of the characters ie the men who became her freinds during training also taking out the music and the dragon but putting in a supernatural witch who could changes forms what was that about the star power was impressive in this movie but the original animated movie showed a woman who showed she could be as much of a warrior as any man while this movie made it out to be that she had some magical powers that enabled her to do what she was able too that to me diminishes the point finally while i understand that live action versus animated is supposed to be more serious there was no fun with this movie or very little we love these movies from our past for many reasons but most of all we have fun watching them you can add this or that make small changes due to the fact it is not animated but if you go off the rails then your just making another movie and stealing a known product for draw only that is what this was i would not buy it or pay to go see it i would catch it on tv only
Sep 10 2020,negative,the worst movie i have ever watch in my life they ruined mulan
Sep 10 2020,positive,this film is proof that it is possible to reconfigure the child friendly musical genre to the action drama genre while being faithful to their supposed themes
Sep 10 2020,negative,rubbish would give a zero if i could no personality nothing good from the original just plain rubbish would avoid watching this just wait until its free
Sep 10 2020,neutral,this isnt a kids movie way to serious and i dont like how they changed mulan the swapped her intelligence for a superhuman like power now it seems you have to be a super hero be special unlike the original that made kids feel like anyone could save the day
Sep 10 2020,negative,total waste of time and money dont support this movie at best this movie is a cheap knock off of crouching tiger hidden dragon and thats being generous i feel sorry for the crew that worked on this monstrosity not to mention the acting was just as emotionless as the lion king remake it has dishonored us all
Sep 10 2020,negative,while i have respect for the crew to not replicate the original one by one and there is a couple of great fight scenes the script and story are just boring as all hell if this came after a good one of these remakes like cinderella or jungle book i dont think this would be getting the reviews it is now also please hire actual asians to tell asian stories instead of a white lady who did boring family dramas like mcfarland usa or the zookeepers wife
Sep 10 2020,positive,overall a good action movie i enjoyed it loved that the female heroine took care of business no need for or waiting for a man to be her salvation
Sep 10 2020,negative,another soulless disney attempt at rebooting their soulful animated featurettes from the 90s go watch the old one skip the new one
Sep 10 2020,negative,this movie was an absolute disaster it took the old film and took all the good things out it made mulan a mary sue and removed li shang an amazing character the movie also promised a new fresh movie which didnt follow the old one but it had the same plot just really bad
Sep 10 2020,negative,too much fantasies and nonsense fighting moves the storyline wasnt that inspiring  doesnt have that happy comedy moments the way eddie murphys mushu did in the original mulan 1998 animated movie
Sep 10 2020,negative,welll   that was  disappointing
Sep 10 2020,negative,what a horrible movie with a boring mary sue protagonist   just trash avoid it at all costs
Sep 10 2020,negative,they converted mulan into a super hero movie where mulan is like wonder woman since minute 0 no development just another disney mary sue this tomato is rotten
Sep 10 2020,positive,really needed the songs they add so much more heart to the film musical is not a bad word beyond that the changes were fine and the movie was good timepasser
Sep 10 2020,negative,absolute trash everything is bad
Sep 10 2020,negative,well we found a history near to the original poem but really far from the people nostalgia a loot of characters taking out from the history not only mushu and mulan with not enough strength to be a feminist icon as it was the cartoon sorry but nope
Sep 10 2020,negative,a movie with no soul disney has successfully ruined another childhood favorite
Sep 10 2020,neutral,beautiful scenes and cg i really love all sceneries in this movie   the end of the movie is so good especially when they ended with how one girl became a legend briefly and then soundtrack with end credit started playing      however the plot has changed quite a lot from the anime i like the old interpretation on how ordinary girl used her brain and became a legend more than the new one which is about a talented girl who conceals her talent and then accept it   moreover the story plays a bit too fast the witch died too easy
Sep 10 2020,negative,not worth 30 basically a crouching tiger hidden dragons knock off with mulan characters with crappier graphics kinda sad a movie made 10 years ago has better quality then a movie that got delayed to upgrade
Sep 10 2020,negative,might as well rewatch the original poor casting
Sep 10 2020,negative,it sucks what made mulan wonderful was that a normal girl became the boat soldier with sheer determination and wits not with magical chi powers it sucks
Sep 10 2020,positive,felt it was good at moments and fell short on some of the iconic scenes from the original movie the side characters were harder to gain a relationship with than the animated version to the point where i couldnt really tell who was who pacing was a little quick the actress for mulan did awesome loved her performance
Sep 10 2020,negative,this movie was more entertaining than i expected it was hilarious i laughed throughout the whole film i especially loved the part she removed her armor untangled her hair and found makeup off screen to look more feminine d it was also amazing they would represent the only plus size character as the comedy relief character so original disney have outdone themselves this time 
Sep 10 2020,negative,after about 15 hours i had had enough the fight scenes went on waaaaay too long were waaaaaay too loud and for 55 of the movie the only colors on the screen were red black and silver if my tv were muted i wouldnt know if i was rewatching a scene or not   the disney magic is not there in fact the only scene that stood out as true disney flair was when mulan met with the matchmaker other than that this didnt feel like a disney classic at all  if you havent paid for it or dont yet have disney save your money you can thank me later as the reviews continue to dive  even eddie murphy couldnt have saved it if he did a cameo as gumby
Sep 10 2020,positive,decent movie people should stop moaning about all the political stuff and just enjoy the movie for what it is
Sep 10 2020,negative,mulan was so bad just too much it was ridiculous at least my siblings and i got a good laugh through the whole movie but yeah just bad like the beauty and the beast 
Sep 10 2020,negative,political issues aside the important messages from the original movie have all been left out how the mind is more powerful than brute strength greatness can be achieved by anyone through hard work instead its almost like a starwars remake she has strong qi and thats why shes the chosen one the main character has been strong from birth she doesnt need to work any harder or smarter than the others the combat is a joke in general being able to grab arrows mid air climbing up walls a catapult that missed by miles for a movie with a more serious tone qi played too large of a role qi is the universes most powerful superpower nearly nothing else matters
Sep 10 2020,positive,its quite great to enjoy with families especially for those having children the beauty of liu yi fei is undeniable and the content is easy to understand however i dont recommend it for adults as the normal performance of the main character and as mentioned above a very simple story with no special peak and plot twist
Sep 10 2020,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever seen the characters are too shallow there is no character development at all most of the characters are just there the dialogue is abysmal a lot of it just doesnt make sense if it wasnt for the huge budget the story feels like a cheap chinese movie with a mediocre plot at best the villains are uninteresting and bland the witch is a pretty good character but the way they handle her is just bad it suffers from an identity crisis in which they dont know who their audience is the fighting and strategy used in the movie dont make sense at all and most of the time i find myself wondering why the character does a particular set of actions that just dont make sense they remove the musical because they wanted it to feel more realistic but adds chi and a shapeshifter they remove all the interesting characters in the original mulan and add insignificant character to the movie for example mulans sister doesnt contribute anything to the movie if they remove the character completely nothing will change about the movie
Sep 10 2020,negative,the most entertaining character of the original movie mushu brilliantly portrayed by eddy murphy was left out there is a lot of seriousness and gravity in this version and almost no fun the main message of the 98 version was clear and meaningful on the other hand it seems that this new interpretation of the original tale is afraid of not getting the real message across and overloads the story with unnecessary solemnity that ends up rendering it boring and irrelevant
Sep 10 2020,negative,easily the worst disney movie of all time i created an account on here just to rate how bad this movie is do not recommend it it was so bad nothing i write will adequately explain how unorganized this movie was that is all thank you for reading my ted talk
Sep 10 2020,negative,i feel like i got catfished they really pulled a sneaky one playing up the nostalgia in the trailer i understand that they wanted to be more respectful of the original story line and culture but some how they missed almost everything else while doing so pretty disappointing definitely not worth the 30 early access
Sep 10 2020,positive,fantastic great action good story and some subtle call backs to the animated movie
Sep 10 2020,neutral,a disjointed story and inconsistencies plague this remake that cant decide if it wants to fully embrace realism not solid action sequences and special effects keep you engaged despite the negatives elsewhere
Sep 10 2020,negative,the dialogues are just trash the main characters expressions are like wooden planks  i pitied gong li one of my fav chinese actress but her costume and make up and script are just trash
Sep 10 2020,negative,disappointing on so many levels
Sep 10 2020,negative,sometimes live action movies are really amazing but mulan wasnt that case after i payed 6  30 for the premier on disney it was not worth my money or time boring and plot very different from the cartoon movie it didnt really capture my attention just saying wait for it to be available to see it actors were amazing especially the girl who played mulan but just the movie overall not the best
Sep 10 2020,positive,mulan is a very good live action better than that trashy beauty and the beast remake audiences that say mulan is bad are just salty over the price literally ive read your reviews thats all that seem to be what you dislike the movie is great and if people think this movie is bad than i want to see which movies they think are good
Sep 10 2020,negative,really failed on the heroes journey arc the classic 90s film had mulan appear with no talent or ability but persevered regardless through wit and hard work the cgi was horrible and the writing was just atrocious killed the original storyline took out the songs all comedic elements and character building very disappointing result
Sep 10 2020,neutral,bad story line and really bland
Sep 10 2020,negative,the movie took an amazing story and poured all of its soul out of it liu yuifei has no expression whatsoever the changes are unnecessary and dont work by themselves but i think the worst thing they could ever do to the character is being a precious little snow flake that is perfect just the way she is who has no struggles no need for training and no empathy she even has super powers she is immediately accepted by her peers even leading the army it is not a disney movie fun and loving nor is it a chinese epic it is a hollow narrative without any maturity there is no impact or character development it is simply a check list ironically the director said they would make a new movie but they follow up everything that happens in the animation we know exactly what is going to happen because we have seen the animation even the new witch character  is predictable  do not recommend this movie
Sep 10 2020,negative,this is some of the worst editing i have seen applied to any movie  i was excited to see a more mature take on what was one of my favorite childhood movies and was completely let down
Sep 10 2020,negative,its feels like another bs cash grab i fell asleep for something i spent 30 dollars on
Sep 10 2020,negative,the absolute worst disney remake ever not to mention that the editing was nauseating and a complete joke it was a waste of time not even comparable to the original when will disney learn to stop live action remakes
Sep 10 2020,positive,it doesnt top nor shouldnt the 1998 version but it can coexist with it  beautiful cast and music best of both worlds
Sep 10 2020,negative,the writers of this movie did nothing to give mulan a personality they banked on the audience to remember the animated movie and put no effort into any characters writing this movie not only lacks any meaning or creativity it brands itself as an adaption of the very first story of mulan no not the animation this movie lacks any historical accuracy and waters down what good it couldve achieved if you enjoyed this movie i wont say your taste is horrible but i will urge you to check how much you love yourself
Sep 10 2020,negative,horrible a movie without heart
Sep 10 2020,positive,these past several years with disney making liveaction adaptations of their animated classics have been a mixed bag of success i abhorred the maleficent movies and beauty and the beast loved cinderella and the lion king and aladdin was somewhat mediocre with mulan there had been plenty of criticisms but in the end i decided to check it out    set in imperial china the land is under attack by a group out to overthrow the emperor all of chinas families volunteer a man for their countrys service one family has a man who is old and long injured but with two daughters one of which is a spirited young woman named mulan who longs for the worthiness of being a warrior like her father but this is war and women are not built for war through deception she takes her fathers place and trains to fight proving to be a capable warrior especially when her unit is sent into the fight in time her deception is revealed but through her perseverance she ends up worthy of honor    having seen the previous disney adaptations of liveaction movies i did not know what to expect i saw the original animated movie but i also read a variation of the actual chinese myth of mulan in high school this movie is more like the latter with less disney elements as well as the other more memorable parts of the cartoon no songs red dragon mushu cricket huns shan yu etc this felt more like crouching tiger hidden dragon and with the action and decent acting that is a compliment but i loved the animated movie i wanted this movie to be as funny as the original it is not the songs are scored but if you like hang around after the credits and listen to two versions of reflection yifei lu is fine but she did not have the warmth that the original actress had i do like donnie yen as the army commander as well yosan an as mulans male friend as well as jet li as the emperor i did not like jason scott lee and gong li as the villains the former didnt have the same charisma as the animated version and i didnt like the latter being more of a negative feminist subplot i did love that cameo from mingna wen at the end probably the only time the movie made me happy
Sep 10 2020,positive,has enough unique new material to justify its retelling of the animated classic but not enough to cement itself amongst the better liveaction group aladdin alice jungle book while gong lis witch is a nice addition the songs and mushu were definitely missed
Sep 10 2020,negative,politics and production issues aside mulan is a pretty underwhelming film overall they made more bad than good choices for this adaptation personally i liked that they split mulans original love interest li shang into two separate characters which would have allowed them to explore different character interactions im fine with the addition of the witch and even the omission of mushu and the cricket but i honestly didnt care for any of the other characters that felt shoehorned  including the supposed main villain  regardless of their shallow motivations backgrounds or potential demise yall could have replaced the likes of jet li with any random old actor in the emperor role and it wouldnt have made a lick of difference i really didnt like the fact that the witch spoilers decided to side with and later die for mulan after they had brief girlpower moments i think it would have been more impactful if she refused to side with mulan or even betrayed mulan after pretense of being her ally moreover in terms of their acting i get that this aims to be a serious film but every character felt quite expressionless there isnt a single memorable character with a unique sense of identity instead of just being caricatures or stereotypical roles the overall plot does not deviate much from its animated predecessor but is lacking in soul the oftheard criticism for this film is that mulan was special since she was young having chi in her that she had to suppress as a woman that she later unleashes to become superior in acrobatics martial arts and carrying buckets of water up a mountain so she doesnt have to work hard she just has to be let her hair down and be true to herself and she becomes superhuman also the story is basically humorless which renders it less entertaining than the original if yall want a serious story have a different studio direct it so that you can have more grounded fight scenes with real stakes in one of the many lackluster action scenes mulan rode into battle with multiple soldiers on horseback that were there to be shot at but did not fire a single arrow themselves in fact ive seen enough of the wuxia genre as an asian myself to say that none of the action sequences deliver the way western critics or chinese shills have propped them up to be a spectacle watch any of jet lis or donnie yens other films and compare them to this execrable adaptation    i feel like i could add more to this list if i rewatched it but i cannot sit through this again this film may be entertaining for kids and this may look good for the big screen but for movie buffs yall will come out of this feeling either disgruntled or completely nonchalant
Sep 10 2020,negative,this was so disappointing the action was cheesy and there was no character development   the whole story focusing on her chi and the introduction of the phoenix was corny on top of that she had hardly any lines  its like kung fu hustle but mulan themed and instead portraying itself as a serious action
Sep 10 2020,negative,not what we expected we are demanding our money back
Sep 10 2020,negative,absolute horrible movie action scenes are bland and confusing due to horrible editing scenes that gave the movie purpose complete cut out or changed they even added a new female villain that switches sides for no reason at all
Sep 10 2020,negative,dont promove a realistic movie putting out some things that people want because you want to be loyal to the legend but after you make a non sense irrealistic action
Sep 10 2020,positive,this movie is an artistic and symbolic take on a journey that many young ambitious women must take when remaining true to themselves keep in mind that reviews likely reflect the opinions and experiences of the writer as related to the roles of women although i am not often the first in line for disney movies i believe this one is worth a good review
Sep 10 2020,negative,pretty terrible all around honestly the acting the story the charactersit definitely pales in comparison to the original
Sep 10 2020,negative,no emotional stakes  they give mulan super strength from birth with no need for brains or strategy so so boring and dumb
Sep 10 2020,negative,the story line is unreasonable boring and flat it is a movie you will forget right after going out of theater
Sep 10 2020,negative,everything was great just great  tell the battle happened and then it was just bullshit  that she reveals her own secret identity was so stupid  and the plot moving forward with the same level of stupidity  they exile her just to accept her back and even they make her lead them   and as a result the third act is just nonsense
Sep 10 2020,positive,i loved it i thought they were true to the story and culture and i loved the cinematography its a whole new take on mulan so dont expect it to be the same as the animated version
Sep 10 2020,negative,absolutely horrible must avoid as a fan of the original mulan animated movie my favourite disney movie of all time i cant muster up the words to describe how horrible this was
Sep 10 2020,negative,they took my favorite disney princess and one of my favorite if not my favorite disney movie and turned it into this soulless boring badly edited trainwreck   if i could rate zero stars i would
Sep 10 2020,negative,i get it is trying to tell the original ballad but the problem is when you make a character a mary sue and strip her of character development and reliability with distracting cgi stale acting have scenes that feel like theyre missing and underwhelming fights it just doesnt work
Sep 10 2020,negative,slooow burn painful slow burn at that they really needed a comedic relief somewhere my ten year old fell asleep i fell asleep
Sep 10 2020,positive,the film depicted in a very transitional way its costume and make up were very accurate and pleasing however the film is very different from the original cartoon the biggest difference is that there isnt any singing in the live action version its sad to say that i think it would have been better if the film was directed by an asian director
Sep 10 2020,negative,too many movement in the camera made me have motion sickness and i had to leave to the bathroom for most of the movie duration
Sep 9 2020,positive,i like it you must go in with the mindset that it is a live action adaptation of an earlier animated movie so needs to adopt some of the elements and beats from that source it is not meant to be a historical film or a cultural study or a documentary on the original hua mulan per se instead it is the tale of a young womans journey so yes i did enjoy it
Sep 9 2020,negative,i was all for a more serious mulan movie but holy crap this missed the mark   making mulan a superhuman fighter from she was a child just completely ruins the moral of the story    she is supposed to be worse than her peers an overcome it by determination and hard work from what i can tell the moral has gone from   your gender cant limit your options if you work hard and smart enough you can overcome the physical differences youre born with and do anything   to   just be amazingly superpowered from birth and you will be physically stronger than any man     i was actually worried that this adaptation would lean too heavily into a feminist narrative but ironically it seems to have done the opposite it has diminished mulans amazing achievements by just making her a superhero    one scene that particularly bothered me is how they replaced the scene of mulan climbing the poles by using her head and using the provided weights as an advantage into a scene where she just outmuscles every single man in her regiment how does that make any sense     horrible interpretation of one of my favorite disney movies
Sep 9 2020,positive,it is a beautiful visual film it is a very interesting work from the female point of view the director managed to bring lucidity to a story that could easily be a silly and dull fairy tale if you are watching watch without using the original film as a base
Sep 9 2020,negative,mulan live action was boring they took out all of the scenes and characters that made me laugh and smile then replaced them with bad cgi action scenes and characters whose names i never bothered to learn  there were a few amazing scenes from the animated movie that i was really looking forward to seeing in the live action but they were completely written out i mostly wanted to see the scene where the emperor and china bows to mulan it is incredibly empowering and an inspiring scene but instead it is replaced with a boring action scene where a character i dont care about died sorry if this sounds vague i wanted to avoid spoilers but this is how i felt about the movie
Sep 9 2020,negative,really bad trash tier cgi the protagonist from the start is overpowered makes no sense no mulan arc no mushu movie is garbage
Sep 9 2020,positive,when i first saw the trailer i had chills and it was on the watch list i definitely liked the movie very accurate on how women were treated and what it was expected from them it is definitely about mulan our empowered women but the thing that i missed the most was mushu who in the animated movie was a very loved character
Sep 9 2020,negative,less bippity boppity boo more slash bang wallop and deeply unsatisfying     the visual sensory is amazing given the choice of vod or cinema this would be better viewed in the cinema its an ok film if you watch it without preconceptions of the original animated version its a hard and gritty retelling that takes its self to seriously and if you go in loving the animated version you will be disappointed with this one the films written in a western way but at the same time want to appeal to a chinese asian audience in trying to appeal to both they appeal to neither finally to not have mushu but have a phoenix and shape shifting witch
Sep 9 2020,negative,garbage mulan the character is made out to be a new super human so that she can do everything big by herself thanks me too movement garbage no real quality character development or inspiration another car wash dvd to be easily forgotten in a short period of time
Sep 9 2020,negative,pure undiluted garbage  as simple as that
Sep 9 2020,negative,breaks my heart to say this was absolute trash the original was my favorite disney movie growing up so i had high hopes the acting was bad the writing was horrible and the direction was hit and miss some cool shots and others that seemed to try and point to symbolism but just fell short and felt confusing i dont see myself ever watching this again i will stick with the og mulan not one original song yes i know they played a couple of the melodies here and there and no mushu how could you
Sep 9 2020,negative,bad camera angles bad actorsbad soundtrackbad effectsbad storynothing compered with the originalthey also force something to happen like yea her hair fell on her face so what why is she droping  down like a rocknonsense i m vrey happy i did not pay to watch this movie i would reather burn the money than waste  two hours   i respect the work that they put to create this movie but is just bad  and they coulde ve done so much more like in aladin or the lion king
Sep 9 2020,negative,okay save your time and buying disney and just go dust off your og version of mulan you wont fall asleep its more realistic and is a prefect mix of both comedy and being serious
Sep 9 2020,positive,while the cinematography and camera work is beautiful it misses the mark with the heart and emotions within the characters that really drives the animated classic home
Sep 9 2020,negative,they tried so hard to make the movie realistic yet there is no blood in any battles if you are going to make it real go all out and make it a war movie on top of that there is no disney in the movie no comity no imagination no fantasy and no heart it is expecting to watch a big adventure but getting a documentary
Sep 9 2020,negative,the worst disney live action movie yet undercut all the emotional scenes and got rid of all the best characters waste of time and money
Sep 9 2020,negative,boring  film i dont know how critics found it good a film with no charm and a routine plot
Sep 9 2020,negative,gosh this movie is worse than i thought the story is a completely mess the characters are unlikeable they dont have a personality and in compare to the original mulan it doesnt hold up at all after the disaster of artemis fowl i think this is just the beginning of disneys doom with live action remakesand i really hope so
Sep 9 2020,negative,boring and half assed cash grab had potential adding the witch and phoenix but everything was incredibly anticlimactic cringe after cringe
Sep 9 2020,negative,it reminded me of rise of skywalker  it caused me to rewatch the animated movie which was excellent  unfortunately mulan 2020 fails in comparison in all levels to the 1998 excellent animated version  too many missing elements and cgi was wasted on stupid bunnies scarfetc  the only saving grace was jet li and donny yen  main character has no expression whatsoever dont watch this watch the 1998 version instead
Sep 9 2020,negative,you dont know if you should compare it to the original or not if you dont its a bland emotionless movie devoid of personality if you do its even worse
Sep 9 2020,negative,script writing directing character development were all horrible are you kidding disney this movie has nothing but a few beautiful sceneries there is a huge lack in depth for this movie and feels like a white persons interpretation lol
Sep 9 2020,negative,they took out mushu from this film with the goal to be more realistic and then proceeded to put a boring uninteresting witch do i even need to say anything else  every single attempt of this movie for a funny scene just failed miserably  mulan is definitly one of the most fun and loveble protagonists on all of disney history in this movie she is plain out bland  who edited this movie the scenes are horribly put together to the point that they dont even make any sense  the characters are not flashed out at all theyre just there  if youre special you can do everything if youre not well just stay be and wait for you to be rescued that was the lesson i learned from this movie  none of the action seuquences worked it just looked like they fighted using rubber swords  the emperor accepted mulan being a girl in literaly 30 seconds  mulan actions didnt have any consequences any dramatic beat that the original movie has completely lost it  the acting is horrible the actress did a terrible job as main character the other actors didnt wok well either  this movie is a offense to its animated counterpart absolutly horrible would never recomend
Sep 9 2020,negative,nothing new beautiful art direction but empty screenwriting
Sep 9 2020,neutral,started out with really bad acrobaticsit really did not pick up steam until the without spoiler the secondary female appeared and her story really enhanced the movie and life lesson   loved the introduction of mulan at the end bymulan this movie felt like the last jedi lots of good cast members but a no show for the directori guess i am glad i spent 30 and not 100 family of 5should have thrown in mushu to save the dayagain it felt like watching the last jedi all over againand that is a shame
Sep 9 2020,negative,possibly the worst edited movie i have ever seen its choppy as hell and actually made me physically ill oh and the acting is bad as well great work disney
Sep 9 2020,positive,i never saw the animated version of which i am thankful people that have to compare for whatever reason just need to feel the importance of that fantasy i will watch that version eventually however not liking this film is a littlodd to me its a very good filn not great but good its star is very good but shes not jennifer larence and this movie is not hunger games anywat 7510 is my take
Sep 9 2020,negative,this film raises many questions chief among which is who is responsible for this how in the hell did this dumpster fire cost 200 million dollars did a group of 8 year olds write the screenplay evidently not because then they would have had more money to use and a better script  it watches like a straight to video adventure film or an average chinese adventure movie minor characters had zero development or screen time so there was no bonding or emotional attachment formed with them the final scene is the only one which carried any emotional weight whatsoever there was no continuity to the movie she just jumped from set piece to set piece as a result the film had no flow and never pulled you in or sparked anything in you besides confusion and maybe indigestion a disjointed affair that seems like a student film who had access to big budget sets its like the screenwriters director dp editor and visual effects supervisor never talked to each other during production like they just went out shot some stuff and had to attempt to kluge some semblance of a movie together out of these disparate pieces after the fact soundtrack was so middling to be almost nonexistent basically just a drum line when they did blend in some of the original themes they were altered and so lightly performed that you could barely hear them and added nothing to the scene green screen was used for almost all of the close up shots why they clearly went to china for the gorgeous scenery use it at times it felt like they relied on it because they forgot to shoot some scenes on location cgi was disjointed and the dialogue was painfully bland although im told that at times if they had said the same words in chinese it would have much more impact and meaning to it sound design was a shambles khan was still clomping away like he was on cobblestones while he ran through the avalanche i came in with low expectations as the original was a masterclass in artistry storytelling and character development it had you invested in the characters and their journey this remake leaves you remarkably cold at every turn and confused in others due to scene hopping with no coherent transition between them or exposition provided they timidly delve into the traditional chinese films with the wire work which was used from time to time but never fully committed to the style it lands in a no mans land between the east and west film styles and as a result is not noteworthy from either point of view only positives are the beautiful chinese landscapes and a few of the long lens shots with real horses running not visually marvelous rotten tomatoes critics not at alloh and jimmy wong of course altogether an embarrassingly poor showing from disney that only proves how much theyve lost the plot over the last 20 years chasing easy remake money rather than trying to make true art like the original
Sep 9 2020,negative,this is a bad movie turned absolutely rotten by comparison to the near perfect 1998 animated original poor editing making action shots cause bland or confusing thanks to the lack of any musicals talking dragons or slapstick friends your left in a bleak world that still attempted to retain the viewers attention by having mulan be a superhero in the form of cartoon movement explained as qi  the movies will spend time having mulan be dressed in traditional dresses and makeup to show how out of place she is doing so but when it comes to dressing the armor of a warrior something which represents her choosing her way risking life leaving the family and risking her relationships with them jump cut to in the suit getting up to leave the movie fails to understand why scenes like these were in the original but still force many in
Sep 9 2020,positive,the liveaction mulan was great on its own it shouldnt be compared to the animated version it was culturally appropriate and accurate
Sep 9 2020,negative,terrible acting do not waste your money
Sep 9 2020,neutral,i liked that they changed things but man there is no emotional weight in this movie im all with changing it from the movie but my god not some of the subtle best things 
Sep 9 2020,negative,wow lots of things left to be desired from this movie the character development is incredibly weak the cartoon version had much better relationship building and dialogue action sequences were incredibly predictable and repetitive how many times can she do an absurd flipjump to kick a weapon honestly the witch addition why totally hollow story arc distraction the phoenix wow you can cgi colorful streamers the only plus was the decision to not make a subordinate love interest this time around i highly recommend not wasting 2 hours of your life to watch this over hyped movie
Sep 9 2020,negative,its okay as a new story but it doesnt seem like its the same mulan we all know and love and it lacks of that so characteristic disney magic
Sep 9 2020,negative,went out of my way to create an account just to voice my thoughts on this movie its by most standards awful the acting is inconsistent and unintentionally hilarious partly due to the absolutely atrocious dialogue i will admit the action is sometimes cool but mostly silly with no weight the pacing would be fine if the intended moments hit as they were supposed to but they dont some of the shots are aesthetically beautiful but because of the rest it feels hollow i cant trust rotten tomatoes ever again if a movie of this quality has 70 by critics they must be corporate money puppets devoid of all integrity and taste if you ask me i would kill for a little originality from disney as they are a company capable of creating amazing films but their risk aversion is causing them to play things so safe that everything is formulaic and trite glad i wasnt the one to pay to watch this walking corpse of a once fun and charming movie
Sep 9 2020,positive,very dazzling worth watching it in theaters
Sep 9 2020,negative,terrible editing bad story not even realistic
Sep 9 2020,positive,is it a perfect film no but what film is none overall in terms of filmmaking this version of mulan stands tall on its own while it has some similarities it really feels like a different telling of this classic tale that has been told for centuries it is a well made and incredible story and it didnt even need a dragon or any singing to make it like that while i do love the original this one feels like its own film and i love it just the same from the stunning visuals to the incredible action all the way to the characters and the way niki caro tells this story so well done disney youve made a wonderful live action reimagining thank you
Sep 9 2020,positive,10 star for yifi lius marvelous battlefield performance
Sep 9 2020,positive,visual stunning but does not have heart of the original actress playing milans portrayal and perhaps script take away the fun joy and beauty of original tale
Sep 9 2020,negative,this movie was an utter piece of garbage the story lacks any depth some of the more memorable characters were completely removed the editing is obnoxious and frantic and the characters are horribly acted this movie claims in my opinion the rank of the worst movie of the year and i havent forgotten artemis fowl yet another classic ruined by the money thirst of modern disney
Sep 9 2020,negative,takes all emotion out of the story and although the action is possible that is really the best thing i can say about this movie
Sep 9 2020,positive,an excellent retelling and fresh take on a beloved classic with a talented asian cast and introduces the very asian concept of chi the boundless energy of life that everyone possesses but might not have harnessed to achieve greater things those looking for faults will surely find its flaws but overall its a very enjoyable disneystyle war story that still retains the essence and morals of the original legend
Sep 9 2020,positive,mulan is another movie in the line of disney remakes of previous animated films and is in my opinion one of the best theyve made so far    niki caros gorgeous direction on top of a winning performance from liu yifei make for an extremely engaging movie that manages to harness what made the original film so special while forging its own path the action scenes here are also absolutely stunning in both scale and choreography making great use of some really fun homages to previous chinese films with wirefu     all around i found mulan to be an absolute blast and certainly living up to the name of the movie that came before its an incredibly empowering film that kind of made me cry absolute buckets i will be watching and rewatching this for years to come     455
Sep 9 2020,negative,another kowtow to the chicoms and a defacing of a disney classic has disney done anything of value since mulan 1998 aside from the pixar stuff and since that same time every sequel has been getting worse and worse and worse this movie was a shameful rendition of a total classic
Sep 9 2020,negative,what a bore and soulless piece of crap im a huge fan of the original and i was totally ok with this more serious tone with no music and more respectful to chinese audiences this movie is crap though lmao so boring and you can tell the whole thing was filmed on a sound stage its just a trifling remake not worth spending money on
Sep 9 2020,negative,the new mulan movie was worst than i expended and i have low hope for the movie already the mulan character dont need to work to be the best because she all ready strong unlike the animated one were you can see she fail work harder and smart to be the best the only thing that i like is when they change the lines for the seance of mulan and her father talking if she was born as a boy
Sep 9 2020,positive,i personly really like this version bold move disney
Sep 9 2020,positive,its rather good a good plot development
Sep 9 2020,negative,lacks of character development and the sequence are soooo fast  no emotions no comedic relief but salute to donnie yen for executing his character properly the emperors character lacks of wise vibe
Sep 9 2020,negative,as mentioned before by others  the sets and costumes were stunning but the storytelling and directions felt clunky and heavy handed  i did not feel drawn in mostly because i never got a reason to care if the emperor or the bad guys won the war in extension i therefore had difficulties understanding mulans goal too  when the witch offered milan to team up there we chers and yells of do it do it in our small family audience  i am not sure that was what the creators intended
Sep 9 2020,positive,mulan 2020 was a very great movie for me if you hate it i dont care im really amazed to this movie  the disney cartoon version was better and i think the whole world agrees i kinda agree to that but but but im more convinced that this 2020 movie was a remake of the original ballad and not the 1998 movie in a good way   i think many doesnt appreciate and accept the ballad of mulan they more prefer the disney cartoon version than the true original version which is so sad heres my list of everything i observed    film making qualities  its more colorful than what i expected it makes you feel how colorful chinas culture was not like a pathetic always red color themes for china  it presents a new style of cinematography that we did not saw in western films it clearly shows that its different and very unique   all cgivfx are not distracting they flow with the story it doesnt make you look into it and say its bad vfx right there so its a great job  locations makes you wanna think that china is bigger than what you think many kinds of places are greatly shown filming some of this in new zealand is an a  musical score was great even its not the type of score where you get chills and goosebumps like in avengers endgame and star wars movies but its still flow with the story and not distracting i appreciate having the songs in instrumental little sad that i did not heard the  ill make a man of you but its okay at least its not a pathetic chinese music stereotypes  editing is also not distracting and it giving a new vibes too the choreography was clearly shown through editing so its not bad  story qualities  the chi thing was really a brilliant idea for me so that we can see the deep meaning of what mulan what really wants to do which is a minor mistake in the mulan 1998 where theres a line she sang the reflection  somehow i cannot hide who i am though ive tried when will my reflection show who i am inside which we did not know as audience whats shes hiding that time shes still not a soldier until it becames a plothole mulan 2020 clearly shown not told whats shes hiding its her chi  i hope theres still ghost ancestors but i think it will not work but still they can think in more creative ways like theyre just voices etc  i really understand how many have changed from the 1998 movie this 2020 version was more inspired on the ballad of mulan as it was credited in the end credits while the 1998 movie was based on the book fa mulan the story of a woman warrior written by robert d san souci the people misunderstands this movie into a remake of 1998 movie but no this was a different remake  i also understand how some has changes like not cutting her hair the last fighting scenes were different cause i know many of the scenes in 1998 movie doesnt apply to the chinese cultures beliefs and traditions   i hope they brought the lines and moments from the 1998 version like you may look like a bride but you will never bring your family honor the father and mulan scene before the announcement people bowing on mulan scene etc  while im watching it i expected that this movie will not bring any nostalgia for the 1998 movie but no they never disappointed the nostalgia is still there from having a brush to paint her lips the flower comb same placing of the armor and swords of her father bori khan looks little more like shan yu the training montage even though mushu and crickee was gone but the horse are the same having mulan bathing in the lake being smart and what i did not expected to be in the movie was the avalanche scene im so glad they kept it even its a different method its so great chills and goosebumps are still there wow  last fighting scene was okay to me not suspenseful but its still great an b to me  theres still magic of course its a disney movie magic happens every movies of disney  last thing this movie have also so much questions left im guessing they are already planning for the sequel the sequel would answer the questions did mulan take the chance for being one of chinas decorated soldiers how about hongwei and mulans relationship her sister would have a bigger role on the sequel and who was the man matched with her commander tungs life hongweis life etc  what i missed about from 1998 version to this version was the clumsiness and sassyness  of her even though she have the chi clumsiness could have been added more we need it more    theres something off i dont know about it but what i know is that we are poisoning of having the knowledge of the 1998 movie if we can imagine theres no 1998 movie this movie would be so much great   mulan 2020 a more historically and culturally accurate disneys mulan that focuses on drama family culture loyalty still has a charm on audience and still makes you expect the unexpected
Sep 9 2020,negative,worst live action film
Sep 9 2020,negative,the mulan rework turned an originally great story into nonsense save your money and wait till it is included in disney plusif you even watch it
Sep 9 2020,negative,no mushu just another mary sue overpowered
Sep 9 2020,negative,only redeeming quality of the film was the scenery and cinematography otherwise its just awful the scene flow was constantly off no real character development of anyone no real character struggle like in the original the witch character was very out of place the concept of qi and more i could keep going on but i wouldnt recommend someone paying extra to see this on disney and just wait until december when its free 
Sep 9 2020,negative,so we ordered this last night and here is my review im highly disappointed while it was a good movie it was sooooo far from the original movie that i question why they even bothered they butchered it didnt keep the same names mulans name wasnt ping changed characters and cut some out no cricket no mushoo cut out a billion scenes changed scenes and the most upsetting thing of all there was no music all the songs were cut out    it almost makes me wonder if they even had the rights to the original to recreate it in the first place i have never seen a remake so far off from this one it was a whole different movie with small similarities
Sep 9 2020,positive,i never saw the cartoon version which made it easier for me to accept this film as a standalone action film  i loved it
Sep 9 2020,positive,it was a great entertaining watch nevermind some mistakes but overall a good movie to enjoy
Sep 9 2020,positive,this is a super gorgeous visual feast i   admire the greate spirit of mulanand l love yifeis exquisite performance 
Sep 9 2020,negative,i tried so hard to watch this movie till the end it was hell what a waste of resources talent and of course the legendary story of mulan itself a disgrace emotionless movies with no logic at all beautiful outside terrible inside
Sep 9 2020,negative,what you see is what you getbut nothing more  the movie is shallow no substance even the animation had more depthaltogether the movie was a big disappointment
Sep 9 2020,negative,this live action drowns in its own glass of water unfortunately it presents a very bad edition it is boring and in many moments you ask for it to end since you are not interested in the main characters either
Sep 9 2020,negative,stop ruining childhood movies with corny remakes how about an original story for once
Sep 9 2020,neutral,it would have been better giving it a different name but the pacing and characters still felt meh compared to the classic
Sep 9 2020,negative,the action was goofie there was absolutely no character development the humor missed the mark on every ocassion and the plot made no sense
Sep 9 2020,negative,meh it passed the time seems about right i wanted to love this movie especially since mulan is one of my favorite disney princesses shes strong courageous puts others above herselfbut this wasnt the same in this film mulan has a smidge character arch she realizes she shouldnt lie gets cast out due to being a woman and then two scenes later people start helping her the character arch for one of the villains is also laughable and incredibly predictable during the climax of the movie my family and i just started making fun of it because of how ridiculous it was additionally they stripped almost all of the humor out of the movie which was incredibly detrimental to the enjoyment of the film to cleanse my palate i watched the original one and was flabbergasted by how much better it was mulans character developed from a scared woman who just wanted to protect her father to a confident and strong warrior the songs and humor added to the movie and i get that they wanted to make it more respectfulbut it came off as rushed and downright boring at parts i loved how in the animated film they did the classic show dont tell with mulans character when she was getting ready for the matchmaker they showed she was kind by saving the girls doll from the boys with toy swords and that she was smart by making a move that allowed the one man to win the checker game in the live action the told us they told us that she had lots of chi they told us women werent respected like men basically dont waste your money and wait till it comes out for free on disney plus
Sep 9 2020,negative,never watch a movie that support the wrong thing also the acting were so bad lead female gotta learn how to act again
Sep 9 2020,negative,while shot in a more beautiful and culturally accurate way but the film was overshadowed by plot holes and a lack  of depth that the original films charm is completely undermined
Sep 9 2020,negative,this has spoiler   1 a disapointment for a fan of 1998 mulan when it is about a normal girl trained hard to bcome a warrior but 2020 mulan is about born warrior  2 not a fun movie to watch although expected to be a more serious movie then they should have made it more adult rated like a proper war movie if they want to inherit the disney family movie role then they should make it fun to watch without mushu is without fun  2 the pheonix is bullshit the director never study the history and culture properly pheonix does not represent a woman warrior but it is used as a representation of emperors wife they represent beauty and peace spirit of pheonix does not guide people to war it is so wrong to call a 5 tail pheonix apeared on screen as she bcoz a female pheonix only has 2 tails the fact that pheonix is well known in chinese culture that is similar to any birds of paradise the male bird always looks more extravagant than the female bird and therefore it is so wrong to use the pheonix in the movie i bet they never did study at all  3 the only correct reference is the hawk which represent warrior as gong li refused to be called a witch bcoz shes a hawk spirit and supposed to be a warrior the sad thing is chinese respect witches and witches had some high social status  wrong verb used in this movie may be they want to use the verb monster which in chinese called 精 represent an animals that can turn into human in chinese mythology there are fox jing snake jing spider jing turtle jing etc but never called a witch wrong verb  4 the 1998 mulan exhibit her intelligence and leadership to save the emperor she leads and guides the trio and use her tricks to wind the battle in 2020 mulan it is more like a rambo one woman show a woman who have no idea and left her team mates locked in a fight against enemies eyes rolling  5 the movie scenes never touches any emotions a lot of great moments in 1998 mulan but 2020 mulan just did those scenes badly the moment she make a decision to leave her family the battle etc those are the impactful moments but 2020 mulan did them badly the battle the martial arts the actors are good but the whole sequence just really badly done i call it badly directed  6 i feel like wasted my time and money please do me a justice worst disney movie ever
Sep 9 2020,negative,very poorly done movie the cinematography was very bad half the actors they chose were not needed in this film the action was poorly done and the editing makes scenes feel choppy at times for 200 million dollars you would think that you would have done better than this mulan and her father were the only redeeming moments of this film this movie should have been a huge epic film and instead felt like a small adventure movie
Sep 9 2020,negative,mulan now has super powers doesnt use her smart to overcome her training she can do these amazing kicks tho oh and also alot of matrix wall running     the original was more realistic and heart felt than this stupid real wanna be pull off no music arghh its such a bland movie dont pay 30 plus your disney subscription to watch this     mulan in this movie is invincible lol
Sep 9 2020,negative,so boring not funny  unlike the original animation   at the same time it even not more closer to original legend compare with previous version

Sep 9 2020,positive,straying away from traditional disney singing and dancing and mirroring a more traditional oriental setting while recapturing the spirit of the original movie this was truly a shot in the dark that hit its mark
Sep 9 2020,negative,it seems incredible that the same studio that gave us avengers did not use the special effects to the level that i expected they promised us an action movie with epic confrontations and it falls short

Sep 9 2020,positive,a very well put together movie 
Sep 9 2020,negative,going off script for a classic should be a high bar get it right and you can create something lasting and brilliant get it wrong and we end up with cats 20 sometimes a classic is just that leave it alone this updated story had no common arc the characters were dull and confusing and the whole thing was disjointed build a puzzle instead
Sep 9 2020,negative,the movie looks pretty good even though the effects are lackluster at times and you can clearly see the money spent on it with that said if you want a compelling relatable character and a story that makes sense watch the animated movie
Sep 9 2020,positive,i felt the female director behind it loved mulan she was great
Sep 9 2020,positive,the fight choreography is top notch and the battles are truly epic in scale
Sep 9 2020,negative,it was definitely overrated and tried too hard to follow the original disney movie sequence of events wouldve much preferred them actually just making a different movie about this historical character acting was relatively far fetched and lacks sincerity and way too hollywood the american english speaking is also weird

Sep 9 2020,positive,unlike previous liveaction remakes of beloved disney animated films mulan does not rely heavily on the nostalgia factor for success but instead makes a strong case for its existence by enriching the story introduced in the original 1998 filmi love it
Sep 9 2020,negative,it was like watching a bollywood movie with chinese characters
Sep 9 2020,positive,not a movie that needs to be overthought mulan is a beautiful spectacle which honours the original animated feature if you grew up with mulan and loved her like i did then you will thoroughly enjoy this tale
Sep 9 2020,positive,i understand that this version of liveaction took a bold move and may not please everyone but i found this adaption really refreshing and beautiful
Sep 9 2020,negative,get rid of the disney logo and its a brated movie the story was nothing mulan didnt work for it realistic does not mean boring want realistic mulan watch mulan rise of a warrior much better this is a very western lens
Sep 9 2020,positive,its the best movie causing me to go see the second round and will go to see the third round at the end of this week the heroine is very beautiful
Sep 9 2020,negative,if not because liu yi fei and donny yen are playing there i wouldnt finish the movie less humorous less entertain and too stuffy as not expected
Sep 9 2020,positive,this is a grown up mulan perfect for the times 
Sep 9 2020,positive,im glad they didnt do a duplication of the original or make it a musical
Sep 9 2020,positive,great cinematography production design and costumes solid cast could have been improved by including the songs from the animated version story needed more depth
Sep 9 2020,negative,not nearly enough humour to score as a superhero movie but the plot is so wildly implausible that it does not qualify as anything else despite the beautiful scenery and characters
Sep 9 2020,neutral,thin not for kids but also not for adults  would be angry if i watch in theater
Sep 9 2020,negative,it had nice visual scenery but was just not a good movie it stripped everything that made the original good importantly the humor but also the music the camaraderie between mulan and her friends and her unit milans clumsiness the emperors kind heart and more this movie is another remake did without any politics to blame
Sep 9 2020,negative,boring waste of time
Sep 9 2020,negative,i cant believe disney went in the wrong direction to make a remake of my favorite disney classic film no songs no mushu no other characters that we know from the classic movie sorta they through in new stuff like this bird witch and naming the bad guy something completely different whats wrong with shan yu no laughs at all either it somewhat follows the story but skipsmisses out on too many parts that i enjoyed its also very slow going i really didnt enjoy hardly any of this movie mistakes were made and now disney has to pay the price of user bad reviews on it stick with the 1998 version and not this
Sep 9 2020,negative,the worst movie this year weird story and weird characters go watched the original animation version again and found out i couldnt find any plot to give any compliment
Sep 9 2020,negative,poor production bad music 
Sep 9 2020,negative,mary sue is a text book example of shtty writing it is mind boggling that a company like disney doesnt even know that it is sad
Sep 9 2020,negative,the script writers should be ashamed of the monstrosity they made of mulan they turned a beloved kids tale of female empowerment and courage into a horrendous bad chinese fantasy fight movie bruh a witch chi powers what in the world were these writers and directors thinking
Sep 9 2020,positive,if you are watching the movie erase the animated version from your mind you have to watch this movie understanding chinese culture and with an all asian cast they hold true to the culture this is the best live action remake disney has done
Sep 9 2020,negative,wow disney turned mulan into rey skywalker there is no real character development that was pretty bad
Sep 9 2020,positive,breathtaking visuals and stunt work that actually shows mulan fighting something could be done more with the fight scenes but hey its a family film despite a lackluster retelling of the animated film i think this movie stands up on its own
Sep 9 2020,negative,i would not recommend
Sep 9 2020,positive,must see loved this film and the performances liu yifei tzi aka and gong li are amazing in it  the story of mulan goes back to 400ad and this is niki caros vision of it today  loved every minute of it
Sep 9 2020,negative,worst disney movie i have watched in my life so many plot holes poor character development stupid antagonists being too serious for its own good no comedic relief super fake cgi of the phoenixjust to name a few mulan has just received the mary sue treatment all the brains and the hardwork she had in the animated movie is replaced with born with great chi nonsense
Sep 9 2020,neutral,the movie feels to forced with the characters and funny scenes  the new character was interesting but was rushed definitely the music wouldve probably made it a little better and missing mushu and other characters of original movie animated movie way much better
Sep 9 2020,positive,its probably the best liveaction movie disney has already produced to date
Sep 9 2020,positive,the family thoroughly enjoyed this movie
Sep 9 2020,positive,this is a grown up mulan perfect for the times 
Sep 9 2020,negative,this was an unexpected movie about the origin of the force prior to the establishment of the jedi or sith orders its part of the expanded star wars universe and has nothing to do with the original cartoon
Sep 9 2020,positive, i can enjoy them both for different reasons at a time when there is not much new to watch mulan is a breath of fresh air
Sep 9 2020,negative,this movie fails to capture the magic of the original im very disappointed i spent money on premiere access if youre reading this do yourself a favor and wait until december when its available to regular disney members
Sep 9 2020,positive,i think the movie was beautifully done the actors were great martial arts visuals were good and scenery breathtaking
Sep 9 2020,positive, i recommend watching it without comparing it to the animated version the two are different  but in a good way
Sep 9 2020,positive,excellent mulanloyalbrave and true for love of family 1st glory is within
Sep 9 2020,positive,this more historically accurate portrayal of mulan was great
Sep 9 2020,positive,enjoy the f out of it
Sep 9 2020,positive,mulan really reflects on many of the prejudices that at that time and even now people have about being a woman in a mans world as the song says  but this version does it in a more mature way at times the film feels with a somewhat fast pace and many of the reflections are lost by not being studied in a more profound way besides the edition is a bit loud but visually it is fantastica really moves away from the source material but it does it for the better mulan is that movie that makes you think that all the power you have you get when you accept who you really are
Sep 9 2020,positive,even though it wasnt the exact story from the animation theyve stuck with the main lessonmoral of the story 
Sep 9 2020,positive,perhaps if more audience members could look past the need to be a killjoy whenever disney makes a remake they would see how great of a movie this is 
Sep 9 2020,positive,this movie was beautiful it showed young girls that nothing should stop you from greatness
Sep 9 2020,positive,a very well put together movie 
Sep 9 2020,neutral,everything in this movie doesnt make any sense
Sep 9 2020,positive,great movie waited for so long to watch 
Sep 9 2020,positive,i thought this was a very entertaining adaptation of the mulan story 
Sep 9 2020,positive,beautiful to watch solid theme and perfectly cast
Sep 9 2020,positive, i can enjoy them both for different reasons at a time when there is not much new to watch mulan is a breath of fresh air
Sep 9 2020,positive,this movie hold its own on the pedestal of classics
Sep 9 2020,positive,a fantastic adaption loved the actress and actors
Sep 9 2020,positive,straying away from traditional disney singing and dancing and mirroring a more traditional oriental setting while recapturing the spirit of the original movie this was truly a shot in the dark that hit its mark
Sep 9 2020,positive,the film was exciting from start to finish  i would say the best disney live action to date
Sep 9 2020,positive,the film takes the correct approach steering away from the originals beloved musical comedy tone towards a vibrant war epic 
Sep 9 2020,positive,im gonna be neutral for this review i really like when the fight scene but it feel so boring because we are watching disney movie like im saying maybe disney tried to make something different and make storytelling for their live action more mature than the animation version so i think its a good movie although this movie doesnt have any sing part while we watch the movie
Sep 9 2020,positive,yifei is a convincing lead she looks tomboyish enough when dressed like a soldier its a better movie than the current rating
Sep 9 2020,positive,excellent mulanloyalbrave and true for love of family 1st glory is within
Sep 9 2020,positive,this movie was awesome i like the story line kept me interested and the fight scenes were great for a disney movie
Sep 9 2020,negative,1 the only asian in this movie are the actors literally everyone else is white  2 this movie goes for realism yet has mulan running along walls and literally defying gravity and laws of physics also people use drapes and stuff and fling them around like whips which after a bit of research into common sense turns out its not realistic  3 i think the only name that is ever spoken in this movie is mulans name and her male name  4 this movie is 2 hours and there was like no character development it showed that the men whose names i dont know because they never said it have a very close bond even with mulan but theres like one scene of them actually talking and it shows nothing  5 no offense to liu yifei but her acting isnt good in the beginning she makes a joke about her makeup being so thick that she cant make any facial expressions but throughout the movie she has the same face for everything the only difference is that shell half smile every once in a while same goes with jet li as the emperor he literally has no facial expression at all  6 everything that made mulan great they took it away so this is just an empty shell and a failed cash grab    overall it wasnt a good movie that wasnt necessary seeing their past live actions these last 3 years or so and i wasnt surprised that it was bad i still have hope that disney can make another good movie their story telling style and method just doesnt work with live action
Sep 9 2020,positive,beautiful landscape visuals wardrobe color coordination and a pretty its a good movie
Sep 9 2020,negative,its worst should better watch the cartoon
Sep 9 2020,negative,when compared to the original this movie has no heart what so ever absolutely horrible
Sep 9 2020,positive,i love it hope there will be a sequel
Sep 9 2020,positive,this is a grown up mulan perfect for the times 
Sep 9 2020,positive,the film is incredibly well directed by niki caro the scenes of actions are very choreographed i am jawdropping with the look of this film
Sep 9 2020,positive,i thought the movie was amazing dont believe the naysayers and decide for yourself
Sep 9 2020,positive,the cast was phenomenal every single one and they made the best choice to play mulan i will be adding this one to my collection highly recommended
Sep 9 2020,positive,perhaps if more audience members could look past the need to be a killjoy whenever disney makes a remake they would see how great of a movie this is 
Sep 9 2020,negative,time wasting movie  doesnt worth to pay for it
Sep 9 2020,negative,i really wanted to love this movie i loved the animated version and was so excited for this film it didnt hold any of my kids attention at all they are 6 7 and 11 they all thought it was boring i kind of have to agree what could have been a great movie was dull and like a cold dead fish there was no music or humor the animated version had great music and humor its a shame that they felt they need to go in a serious and dull direction go rewatch aladdin or jungle book instead of paying extra on disney  for this one
Sep 9 2020,negative,definitely not what i was expecting great actors but make all those changes to the story really ruined the movie strongly disappointed
Sep 9 2020,negative,imagine being worse than a movie made in 1998 that you tried to remake
Sep 9 2020,positive,a worthy adaptation of the classic original with a few interesting twists
Sep 9 2020,positive,this really fell short of what ive been expecting for a very long time   1 they really cut out all the things that made this movie so good the songs the witty banter and life the animated movie had those special moments that got you hooked or gave you chills just to name a couple     the part where the father talks about the cherry blossoms and relates it to her      that powerful moment where she cuts her hair and chooses to go for her father        the ending with the family and shang   2 you took shang out i mean weve all been waiting for that hunky character to come alive  3 the spirit of her family reminded me more of a fancy kite made me miss mushu and the funny moments   4 it seemed like they pulled the movie from all different movies the witch 47 ronin final fight scene saving the emperor anyone think of pirates of the caribbean the city and visuals the great wall  5 why did they change her family name     they seemed to rush the whole movie disney really dropped the ball with this one it was like they didnt know what to do it was just weird and lacking in connection of all the live actions i wish this one had been done closer to the original animation i hope they do a redo of this one they dropped the ball big time
Sep 9 2020,negative,the plot is mediocre  filled with cultural appropriation stereotypes and condescending orientalism shame on disney
Sep 9 2020,negative,the movie was far off from the original not a movie that kids would actually sit and enjoy watching it was boring and uninspirational another action movie without any comedy drama or romance they took out everything that made the film great and left a serious mess of a movie disappointing
Sep 9 2020,negative,mulan 2020 did not offer anything new  the animated version was much more entertaining i feel asleep in the middle of the movie
Sep 9 2020,negative,i personally love the original mulan it was so funny and i loved the storyline cant say the same for the live action movie 
Sep 9 2020,positive,its right in the middle  a little bit of disney but quite serious
Sep 9 2020,positive,well written and entertaining
Sep 9 2020,positive,im happy that disney loses mushu this time firstly of all he does not go with the non comedic live action the theme is supposed to be more serious and probably maybe you guys are not aware of that fact that chinese dragons do not breathe fire and this despite how mushu is funnycute it should not look like a lizard
Sep 9 2020,negative,this movie was not worth its 2999 i recommend you spend that money to buy yourself something else instead there were many things wrong with this movie and it would not be possible to list them all    first their interpretation of chi is wrong they have made it out to be something that warriors have and determines how good you are at fighting and whatever well being a chinese viewer this was very wrong and made be cringe several times    second they took away the important parts of the original legend in the original legend no one knew she was a girl and this led to it being a big surprise when she was promoted to a general and revealed herself for the first time the movie completely got rid of this theme and instead made the reveal rather early on this defeated the original theme of the story and is rather insulting to the actual legend    third the additions of the story just made it worse they added in a phoenix which is supposed to represent her family and her spirit and all this is actually just plain lack of story writing skills since they sort of use it as an excuse for how she escapes or does something another thing they had added was the whole witches and turning into birds plot since when was that a real thing at least the phoenix was partly metaphorical but the witch was none of that the thing that makes mulan good is that it is realistic and can happen in real life adding in those things but it that much more fake    fourth the fighting scenes were really not that good they overly dramatized her kicks sword fighting and added in a lot of unnecessary movements that would never happen in a real battle she is untouchable too apparently her constant spree of always winning is really annoying    all in all dont watch this movie save those good thirty bucks for other things
Sep 9 2020,negative,it is by far the worst  adaptations disney has made in the last decade  and i do not exague although i did not expect a 100 adaptation with the animated version see the good mushu in action as many expected or fantasy themes in the disney style since these issues had been previously clarified by the production the film continues being bad this film does not do any justice to the mulán history with very bad performances a notorious very low budget and actors that at least in the line that handled them in the film were very wasted as the case of jet li  when they see it they will understand me furthermore it does not have the necessary force the story feels without a joke and hurried and of pylon a great contradiction with the theme of not including fantasy themes and they put a character as empty and mediocre as a witch was who does not contribute anything more than wondering what everybody wants why the hell if they got that they didnt get mushu personally there have been other much better adaptations and they have not been so faithful to their animated versions it seemed that i was watching a movie from the 80s with a terrible script and visual effects  regrettably they had to achieve a lot and they threw it out 
Sep 9 2020,negative,the animated version was far far better
Sep 9 2020,negative,movie was absolute trash i feel robbed i want my 30 back
Sep 9 2020,negative,i was really looking forward to this remake if there was one disney that had the potential to be an epic live action movie it was mulan i was so disappointed i think i probably hate it just as much as i hate the avatar the last airbender live action film mind bogglingly bad they turned mulan into a girl who was born with superpowers instead of the girl who perservered through hard work grit and intelligence they turned her into some kind of chosen one who can defy gravity and can perform some crazy straightoutofthematrix moves completely unbelievebale and cringey terrible
Sep 9 2020,neutral,another liveaction remake that is inferior in every way to its original animated film this feels like a film designed by committee trying to please everyone but ends up being just a bland generic predictable and just plain boring movie some of the cinematography and sets look nice but everything just feels soartificial clean and soulless the world doesnt look lived in it looks like a stage play of mulan all of disneys live action remakes have this issue legendary chinese actors like donnie yen gong li and jet ali deserved better
Sep 9 2020,negative,cheezy as heck in a bad way poorly delivered lines from most of the cast small and boring sets bad writing silly stuff not worth your time
Sep 9 2020,negative,the original mulan was one of the best disney movies they took everything that made mulan amazing out the cricket the grandma mushu the music any comedy at all gone
Sep 9 2020,positive,technically stunning and happily willing to do what other unsuccessful disney remakes havent it strays from the animated predecessor to breathe and tell its own version of this story and while this mulan belongs perfectly in 2020 it gives those of us hoping for nostalgia enough nods to feel satisfied
Sep 9 2020,positive,fantastic it was not like the original but amazing in its own unique way 100 would watch it again and again
Sep 9 2020,negative,only 2 minutes in and i already noticed how bad the editing was for a 200 million budget movie i was quite disappointed to say the least
Sep 9 2020,positive,after reading many negative reviews i was not expecting a good movie i watched it intending to kill time but it turns out i love it its definitely different from original one but bring different views of the story 
Sep 9 2020,positive,liu yifei is the best actress you can find for mulan
Sep 9 2020,negative,the story was unrealistic in a bad way emotionless acting from everyone and dull in general i feel bad for anyone who paid to watch this they deleted all the epic scenes and humor that made the original great and replaced it with trash watching this was really cringey especially at the overly cheesy moments trying to be emotional but failed the filming is average any typical chinese kungfu movie looks like this dishonor on disney and their cow one star for the end credits songs overall f
Sep 9 2020,negative,everything that made the original great was taken out
Sep 9 2020,positive,im not quite sure why theres so many negative reviews but i loved this movie also i wouldve spent so much more going to the movies with my family so i didnt mind paying the 30 to watch it at home i definitely recommend
Sep 9 2020,negative,nice style design but bad storytelling
Sep 9 2020,negative,im not really sure who the target audience was for this  neither adults nor children will enjoy this film  it was boring the action scenes fell flat and the elements that made the animated film a classic are missing  watch the trailer  its all you really need to see
Sep 9 2020,negative,i didnt think much of crouching tiger hidden dragon so i care even less for this movie i really dislike how they turned it into a fly by wire movie really pulled me out of the story    no heart terrible cgi the main actress was lifeless might as well have been a cartoon cut out    the only good bit was the banter among the squad team that is to say the the supporting cast carried the movie even the match maker was better than all the leading actorsactresses    if you are a fan of the original you will only be disappointed
Sep 9 2020,negative,omg could barely sit and watch this for 2 hours the dialogue was some of the worst ive ever had to listen to in a movie  save your  ladies and watch something else
Sep 9 2020,negative,complete different story to the original animated mulan   poor dialog removal of key characters such as mushu and the commander and adding new villains and magical aspects to the movie no character growth  a simple overpowered character just a bad movie that shouldnt be even be called mulan call it the chi girl
Sep 8 2020,positive,overall a good remake and enjoyable the horse scene reveal was magnificent bummed to some some key parts removed like the emperor bow scene but thats not historically accurate i guess 
Sep 8 2020,negative,horrible remake lost all the magic of the original movie and made unnecessary and irrelevant changes by doing so they took all the fun out of the movie and just provided a boring story that didnt make sense unless you watched the original movie where did nonexistent chinese witches and the bad interpretation of chi come from
Sep 8 2020,positive,great alternate story from original and awesome fight visuals
Sep 8 2020,negative,its a film that really insults the culture and treat the audience like idiot
Sep 8 2020,negative,boring and irrelevant
Sep 8 2020,neutral,one of the worst adaptations of recent years a bad editing a story that has nothing of the legend it had to be a realistic film there are magic and fighting out of physics is not consistent
Sep 8 2020,negative,that is a travesty of good story never watching it again
Sep 8 2020,negative,i loved the animated film this has little resemblance to that fun classic film this is melancholy and mulan looks like a woman not a man making the premise hard to believe
Sep 8 2020,negative,if you are thinking about watching this movie i suggest you dont as i am speaking from personal experiences i was tremendously excited to watch the live action mulan movie as mulan is my favorite disney movieprincess i was deeply distraught when they changed the whole plot of the movie from taking away mushu the songs which mulan is basically a musical  and by putting a witch like what the hell you would think that with billions of dollars disney makes and having 3 writers draw up this scrip they movie would a spectacular movieno with mulan being possibly the only person of color to have a live action movie they would try as hard as they can to keep to the original script and only make adjustments as needed like in all the other live actions this movie is a disgrace to the film industry and disney shouldve kept this for themselves i hope they make another better version if waited days months for this  disney im deeply disappointed
Sep 8 2020,positive,such an incredible  inspiring movie for any female ive also watched with my husband and he enjoyed the movie so much that we had to watch it again the next evening
Sep 8 2020,negative,looked more like 70s saturday morning kung fu theater
Sep 8 2020,positive,thoroughly enjoyed this approach without the music or wisecracking dragon  action scenes were great script was wonderful  acting is superb
Sep 8 2020,negative,where the dragon at
Sep 8 2020,negative,there was no heart or emotion everything seemed monotone and stilted reasoning for key parts didnt seem to make any sense everyone was going through rigid forms and following their katas with their partners they werent sparring but all the sudden mulan and honghui start fighting and then the commander confronts her on why shes been keeping her chi a secret but there was no way for her to show off her ability beforehand we were shown nothing the witch taken an arrow for mulan was stupid with mulans and her chi sense either one could have either caught the arrow or dodged it also not cutting her hair means her long hair should have been in her face so much while she was flipping around and fighting short hair would have kept it out of her face there was alot more silliness too that almost made me just turn the movie off it was very hard to get through
Sep 8 2020,positive,beautiful locations and cinematography exciting action scenes nice family interactions
Sep 8 2020,positive,this live action its far from original but the diferences are interesting the story its dinamic and fresh i love the mulan caracter i think was amazing the performance
Sep 8 2020,positive,watching mulan 2020 made me want to watch mulan 1998 i kept trying to separate this remake from the animated version but it kept using music and lines that reminded me why i liked the 1998 musical this new version features some beautiful visuals and exciting action sequences even if the story isnt as lighthearted or as fun as the original as far as disney liveaction remakes go this one isnt bad yet its still proof that these updated versions arent necessary
Sep 8 2020,negative,not only was the movie hyped up to be an incredible remake  but the expectation was so high that 2020 mulan was a complete let down from the very beginning of the movie the filming was ridiculous and more unrealistic than a talking dragonwhich was not in the movie throughout the movie you are waiting for a climax or some scene to get you on the edge of your seat and never once did that happen the movie dragged and tried pulling in a new character which even offset the movie even more
Sep 8 2020,negative,good grief when is disney going to stop remaking classic animated movies which dont need to be remade the original was really good how about make an original movie disney this does not do the original story justice not a good movie on its own even worse when compared to the original animated film
Sep 8 2020,negative,the number of things this movie missed seems to be endless and thats a damn shame growing up mulan was one of my absolute favorite movies because i was finally able to see someone who looked like me on the screen and not only that she wasnt your typical disney princess she was a badass who brought honor to her family while still remaining true to herself this movie missed that by a huge landslide    and then when disney announced that a liveaction remake was in the works i heard disappointing news about various things mushu being cut shang being cut hello where is the original asian male love interest representation why cut him and bring in some random new guy the classic songs being cut and so forth i thought alright lets just give this movie a chance i sat down at home with an open mind paid the 30 only to be utterly and completely disappointed     the only redeeming qualities of this movie was the amazing action scenes the beautiful colors and seeing more asian faces on the screen not playing typical archetypes other than that like i said the laundry list of misses about this movie have no end just to name a few the character development was lackluster with both majorminor characters ling chien po and yao had like 12 lines each whereas in the original we were allowed to get to know them better and truly understand their personalities shang was sorely sorely missed and honghui barely did the guy any justice at all mushu was missed even more than anyone else and him being replaced by a phoenix makes no sense to me disney has made amazing movies with illustrationanimation like coco and so forth how hard is it to animate a small dragon also how is an animated phoenix any more easier andor authentic as a dragon in the chinese culture oh and dont get me started on this new introduction of the concept of chi  i get that that is a common concept in asian culture as ones energy or life force as i get chinese herbal medicine from time to time and they speak of chi during my consultations but was this even in the original mulan no so why are we bothering to introduce it and by introducing it it makes us viewers feel like if you have strong chi like mulan and only if you do you can accomplish anything otherwise good luck whereas compared to the original mulan movie it was through tenacity courage and the loverespect she had for her family and her country that she was able to conquer all things i think the original sends a much better message to everyone     all in all amid all the mistakes this movie made i think its biggest one was naming it mulans remake it wasnt a remake because it felt like the telling of another story and if it had been marketed as a loose rendition or another asian historical tale sure it might have passed but this was simply unacceptable
Sep 8 2020,positive,i went into the viewing of mulan thinking ill like this im sure its fine however i fell in love with this film its performances its cinematography and its story such a beautiful film loved it
Sep 8 2020,positive,disney does need to stop with the live action remakes but this one was nice to watch and enjoy
Sep 8 2020,negative,i liked to the og a lot better
Sep 8 2020,negative,no original songs did not follow original movie story a terrible disney remake
Sep 8 2020,negative,im such a huge fan of the original yet this remake absolutely did it no justice theres so little reaction and emotion in the main lead for most of the scenes that i honestly felt like i was watching robots on screen instead of actual humans with emotion and personality if you wanna see mulan done right go watch the cartoon
Sep 8 2020,positive,brilliant everyone seemed upset when it came out that it wouldnt be a musical but they incorporated the songs in the score brilliantly dont get too caught up in comparing it to the original cartoon geared towards children action and emotion loved it
Sep 8 2020,positive,mulan is visual eye candy that delivers attentiontodetailstunningoutfits adrenlinepumpingseamlessfightscenes a smatter of enjoyable comedic moments and a powerful performance by heavensent liu yifei as mulan shouts out to jet hestillgotit li as the emperor jason scott lee as scarycampyawesome bori khan ron yuan as the gravelyvoicetoughasnails sergeant qiang yoson anas the man who tamed mulans heart honghui and the rest of the cast it hit the spot engaging entertainment left me wanting more cant wait to see mulan 2
Sep 8 2020,negative,just pretty bad i went in knowing it wasnt going to be like the cartoon but all the changes to the story made it worse bad filming they didnt develop or build any chacracters and their relationships at all the settings dont flow and the fight scenes are bad it just felt like they knew what scenes from the original they had to keep in and everything else was full in the blanks with their new storyline so it never fully fits this was a film for asian representation but produced by an fully nonasian crew and it shows
Sep 8 2020,negative,to turn mulan into someone she was not  is truly a travesty to the original disney film so disappointing and sad
Sep 8 2020,negative,the story seemed disjointed  no songs no moo shu no humor missed a great opportunity to make a great remake disappointing
Sep 8 2020,neutral,no spoilers this movie was disappointing to say the least this movie didnt have the same strong powerful effect on me as the first one i thought this movie would be realistic and that was false the main actor doesnt really even talk and in the new movie its hard to follow this storyline because they are skipping past so much so you have to stumble around just to keep up you assume a lot of what is happening between characters and its just poorly written    minor spoiler  i dont like how she was born with powers to begin with the power of this story is that she had to work hard to save her father she didnt prepare before hand the strength of the story is that she had to save her father and defy social laws she had to work more than twice as hard as men just to be at the same level in this movie shes just the chosen one and it makes the story much less empowering as a women it doesnt connect you as much as it does alienate you    one other thing is that its hard to believe that she hid her female identity in the movie the way she did very unrealistic circumstance did she just not sleep how were the men always asleep at the exact right times just doesnt make sense
Sep 8 2020,negative,i went knowing about the changes from the cartoon but as a movie is also flat not exciting and unplesant to watch the action scenes are terrible and the director niki caro doesnt know how to film them bad movie
Sep 8 2020,positive,love this film dont understand the poor reviews it is kickass empowering and absolutely gorgeous yes it is different than the animated movie but i love that it gets to be its own story maybe people here have issues with other biases they dont want to admitthis is classy and quality movie cinematography acting musicgorgeous made me cry and want to charge into battle the story we need  hope it gets nominated for awards
Sep 8 2020,negative,do not spend 30 on this trash pumped waaaaay to full with disney steroids visually there were some cool bits but the writing and plot were maximum trash levels
Sep 8 2020,negative,boring and silly looks like a low budget bollywood movie
Sep 8 2020,positive,not bad not half as fun as the animated version though
Sep 8 2020,negative,mulan has always been kind of a second tier disney movie but maybe the live action movie will be more interesting nope they phoned it in very stale
Sep 8 2020,negative,what a bad overall movie giant flop i feel sorry for all the great artists involved in the world building those visuals are amazing beside of that everything fells short i cannot believe how disney assigns such movies to poor directors and does not follow through with good producers on the side if you really want to honor a culture and female power just tell a great story in a good way
Sep 8 2020,positive,not worth the 30 my daughter and i were wanting all the similarities of the cartoon version there was zero music  which tells the story the acting was good but its not worth 30 when you already pay for disney  i recommend waiting until it releases in december
Sep 8 2020,negative,oh poor unfortunate actors  who had to act to such a horrible script  i cant understand were the 200 million bucks were spend  when the special effects and the makeup were so bad  oh poor unfortunate viewers  keep calm keep calm  you just lost 2 hours of your life  and have 30 less in your bank    i really cant understand why they made a remake of a legendary movie that was way better in every imaginable aspectmulan1998 the jokes the songs and the characters from the original animated movie were all sent to trash nothing is based on the disney renaissance era   however i have to admit that christina aguilera like always was perfect in the end titles as they were rerecorded songs from the original movie
Sep 8 2020,negative,never got down to business  never defeated the huns
Sep 8 2020,negative,you took out every thing everyone liked on the animated version to do a more accurate story and yet you have her jumping around like some kind of super heroe in the very first minutes of the film   even though i didnt agree with the idea of removing mushu the songs and shang i tought we would get the original version of the story of mulan instead we see a generic chinese movie that not even the chinese people liked lmao  yes lets take all fantasy and music factors on the animated version we did but lets add a phoenix and superjumps and fights no normal person can do lets make the girl be just perfect from the beggining and not learn anything other than stay true
Sep 8 2020,negative,i can see what they were trying to go with this remake by doing a darker tone however it really fails that way but not even having the original message and is basically a totally different story
Sep 8 2020,negative,literally the worst     between terrible cgi and awfully choreographed fight scenes they turned the childhood movie many grew up loving into a pile of cringeworthy plot and unneeded characters     cringe dialogue cringe characters    disney stop ruining perfectly good movies with awful live actions renditions
Sep 8 2020,negative,trash just watch the original and dont bother with this its a disgrace
Sep 8 2020,positive,the movie was an entertaining kung fu wire fu time if you enjoy the old kung fu style movies you will enjoy this if you enjoyed the classic mulan animated film you may be disappointed theres no singing and dancing here no wushu either this film keeps the magic with chi and a shapeshifter witch thats giving me white haired witch vibes that i love this new mulan is an addition to the classic film twin sisters that have very different personalities highly recommended for people who want to be entertained with great fights and story ps love the witch soooo cool
Sep 8 2020,negative,plot and dialog were terrible acting by liu who plays mulan was terrible boring movie with characters that are not fleshed out and seem disposable and uninteresting 3 stooges that try to be funny but are not the only decent aspect were the visuals do not pay 30 for this movie
Sep 8 2020,negative,terrible mulan is now like a destined warrior who has some magical power like the force in starwars only its called chi acting is rough with a very few exceptions the plot is all around the place which makes all the characters feel uninteresting action sequences are cartoony complete disappointment
Sep 8 2020,negative,this movie is so confused  they should have made an historical epic instead of forcing a war drama to become a familyoriented movie  sleepinducing in some parts
Sep 8 2020,positive,its different from the animated version but i find that refreshing
Sep 8 2020,negative,what a waste of time  disneys animated version of mulan already butchered the story from its original chinese origins but this live action version takes the butchering to a whole new level  first they turned mulan into a jedi and gave her the powers of the force its called chi in this movie  then brought in a whole new villain with dark magical powers that can transform into animals and possess other peoples bodies and minds  then they dumb down the true villain of the movie and made him nothing more than a bandit who has some daddy revenge issues   the chinese actors in this movie should be ashamed of themselves for taking part in this train wreck of a movie   i want my money and time back
Sep 8 2020,positive,really good acting awesome special effects gripping story with powerful and relevant themes
Sep 8 2020,negative,another miss no growth as a character story wouldnt be understandable unless you already knew what this is about    every single character in this movie couldve died including mulan and draw zero emotion from the audience most wouldnt even change the plot    the dialogs are truly the worst i rather be executed than exiled ok stay and well kill you i guess ill go then wft
Sep 8 2020,negative,it was boring i really missed mushu
Sep 8 2020,negative,the plot was rushed movie felt like was cut to 30 of its original film
Sep 8 2020,negative,they ruined it everything good is gone
Sep 8 2020,positive,i thought it was a great remake and loved the easter eggs from the animated version
Sep 8 2020,negative,the movie feels like i just bought a fake rolex stunning visuals and superficial appearance but lacks substance and quality as a whole
Sep 8 2020,negative,i knew theyd turn this into just another asian martial arts type of movie when the original was so far from just another asian stereotypical movie  knowing that going in i at least expected the action to be very good but it was just soso   also the characters were so greatly underdeveloped there was no one other than mulan who you felt a connection to unlike the original  what also was underdeveloped were the major original scenes the movie attempted they were so rushed it was as if the director just put it in there to appease original fans but didnt care to give the scenes any of the same dramatic flair that the original used to hook you into the movie  i am so disappointed in how they did this remake
Sep 8 2020,negative,tried to be a film with an epic setting biggest issue was with character development  hard to invest in any of them  protagonistantagonist
Sep 8 2020,negative,this movie is horrible tried watching it 3 times but cant even make it pass the 30 minutes mark i want my 30 back
Sep 8 2020,positive,a great film inexplicably underrated
Sep 8 2020,negative,it was so boring that one would wonder what is the point of coming up with this live version  the animated mulan was already great
Sep 8 2020,positive,movie was good i enjoyed it a lot
Sep 8 2020,positive,much better than the animated version
Sep 8 2020,positive,i enjoyed it very good martial arts and acting
Sep 8 2020,negative,it has completely lost the feminism power of its original predecessor characters are poorly written so you cant empathize with them
Sep 8 2020,negative,horrible soulless no spark
Sep 8 2020,positive,the movie is very good very recommended it has the heart of an epic movie it amazes moves and amuses you alike actress liu yifei is amazing in the character of mulan and for all those who comment and criticize for the absence of the songs and the character of mushu i know you will not enjoy it a tip that i recommend do not watch this type of movie using the animated movie like the trailer because it will be you alone who will ruin the experience anyway the movie is very good and probably in my top remakes in live action
Sep 8 2020,negative,man save your money and watch the trailer it is so much better than the movie
Sep 8 2020,positive,thank you disney for producing a movie that showcase the chinese talents martial arts chinese culture and the beautiful scenery of china it just fills my heart with glee and makes me proud to see this film excellent cast chosen for the roles amazing fighting scenes and most importantly the values and lessons embedded in this film    mulan is a story very close to my heart thank you for producing a film that is worthy of the legendary historical character
Sep 8 2020,negative,terrible movie that shouldnt be paid for on a streaming service
Sep 8 2020,positive,i was really enjoy this movie and i dont care about the previous mulan so prefect
Sep 8 2020,negative,its a beautiful retelling all right but it lacks the components that the original mulan was so great with it felt like it wanted to separate itself from the original but if that was the case why make it a remake of mulan could have been a whole movie separate from mulan the movie also felt rushed in so many scenes as well
Sep 8 2020,negative,within the first 5 minutes i knew what it was going to be it is more like a bland bollywood historical flick than a hollywood block buster the chi thing is dumb af tried to love the movie but it is so boring and bland could not even finish it
Sep 8 2020,negative,flat if disney had even remade the animated film shotforshot without adding any new content i would have been entirely on board  instead its entirely humorless god comparing freewheeling mushu to the largely impotent pheonix is a perfect illustration of the difference between the animated film and this one and filled with unimpressive action sequences  the character development is absolutely minimal with only the witch and donnie yen showing even a modicum of growth and that was entirely unexplained  id skip it unless you are willing to tolerate the movie for the scenic wide shots
Sep 8 2020,positive,i actually watched this with my niece  thought it was pretty good  i thought it was a classic chinese adventure  flick with a disney twist  im glad mushu was gone  replaced with a phoenix  i was never an eddie murphy fan there were parts that covered a lot of the old story  incorporated new elements that i thought fit very well over all i really enjoyed it  so did my niece definitely give it a chance you wont be disappointed
Sep 8 2020,negative,made an account just so i can rate this movie ive waited for this live action movie and i am so disappointed i hate how they added a powerful witch as an enemy and just wow i loved mulan in the original how she was using her intelligence and hardwork to be the best but way to go ruining it by overpowering her with that chi thing character development is so horrible remake is bad not worth to watch again even the fight scenes are so boring just where did that huge budget went
Sep 8 2020,negative,disneys mulan combines semiaccurate representation of chinese culture with western style filmmaking and thick american accents the resulting film feels like a confused product that couldnt decide who it wanted to milk money from more    the film over all takes itself very seriously but how seriously do they expect you to take it when theyre delivering dramatic spoken word renditions of donny osman lyrics    as with practically all of disneys live action remakes mulan realistically offers very little of substance over the original but at least it creatively justifies its own existence by leaning more into realistic representations of the story its telling too bad we all know that there was most likely no creative reasoning behind the decision and that it was most likely done to surgically extract the money from the wallets of chinese audiences    probably the best of the disney remakes of late but thats a pretty low bar at this point
Sep 8 2020,negative,really disappointed
Sep 8 2020,negative,a lazy cashgrab that is visually interesting but lacks the heroes journey and any sense of character development
Sep 8 2020,negative,bad writing and bland
Sep 8 2020,negative,walt disneys mulan remake perfunctorily recycles the worst aspects of the 1998 animated version and roundly fails to convincingly execute the few deviations that it does attempt this is not awful its just inert a lifeless bit of product that will probably neither satisfy diehards nor enrapture an entire new generation of fans
Sep 8 2020,positive,perhaps if more audience members could look past the need to be a killjoy whenever disney makes a remake they would see how great of a movie this is 
Sep 8 2020,positive,this remake is good if you dont expect it to be the same as the animated one this kind of hua mulan is more real i dont mind the lack of singing comedy or romance i liked the changes they made in shangs character sorry but i really cant imagine a singing mulan for this remake this may not be the best but it is good enough but i have to point out that the absence of ill make a man out of you had a huge impact
Sep 8 2020,negative,holy shit this was so boring i fell asleep
Sep 8 2020,negative,did not give justice to the animated film at all they took out 90 of what people loved about the original film actress is so plain as well
Sep 8 2020,positive,enjoy the f out of it
Sep 8 2020,negative,like all the other remakes its lacks anything original and the new stuff never really matters
Sep 8 2020,negative,the way im rating this movie tell everything   worst disney movie ever
Sep 8 2020,negative,i made an account just so i could leave this review and warn others not to waste their time or money on this disappointment of a movie this movie lacks everything that made the original great no songs no humor no sidekicks horrible character development if disney wants to make a new movie then great but dont call it a remake in this movie mulan is just born with superhuman abilities and rides off to the rescue there is 0 growth other than her barely learning how to be herself
Sep 8 2020,positive,i will watch it again this movie deserves to be seen on the big screen
Sep 8 2020,positive,the film continues to disneys usual level
Sep 8 2020,positive,i loved it i liked everythingthe performance the actors the effects the music the history the changes that they made
Sep 8 2020,positive,im glad they didnt do a duplication of the original or make it a musical
Sep 8 2020,positive,excellent mulanloyalbrave and true for love of family 1st glory is within
Sep 8 2020,positive,best movie ive seen in awhile good job disney
Sep 8 2020,positive,sumptuous with some outstanding costumes and cinematography this movie showcases the international elements in chinese culture and values
Sep 8 2020,positive,exhilarating wellacted and empowering mulan 2020 brings honor to us all by offering a unique retelling of its beloved animated counterpart
Sep 8 2020,positive,the girl became a soldier the soldier became a leader the leader became a legend they still did include reflection as a soundtrack  respect the movie displayed a deeper meaning for being loyal brave and true
Sep 8 2020,negative,over all extremely boring the original animated version was much better ill never watch it again
Sep 8 2020,positive,i loved the movie i loved the soundtrack best princess 3
Sep 8 2020,negative,i gave mulan 05 points because she doesnt have zero the actress is so bad i feel that mulan has only one expression throughout the film even the stuntman is more expressive cant believe disney spent  200m on this movie mulan in the cartoon is flexible strives to be strong while mulan in the liveaction is buffed from scratch has no character development no emotion bland feminism is only added to the trend two powerful armies  the huns and the chinese  had several hundred soldiers rushing into each other
Sep 8 2020,negative,such a waste of time 
Sep 8 2020,negative,i would give this higher rating if its marketed as a prequel to star war universe happened in some planet thats a random mixture of elements from china still the screenplay is 25 stars at best its got season 8 level bad
Sep 8 2020,negative,this film is very bad it has nothing to do with either the cartoon or the mulan legend  ridiculous script eyeandear bleeding storyline noncharacterizing side characters and action scenes i miss in early bruce lee films
Sep 8 2020,negative,made a rotten tomatoes account just so i could write this review disney is trash and their new live action makes are similarly trash with big budgets to compensate dont know why they didnt spend their 200 mil budget on a decent innovative screen writing and director instead of getting someone whos only capable of massacaring the original movie by regurgitating the exact same story line with a poor casting heres my dot pointed summary on why i hate this movie so much     1 no mushu   2 no mushu to make the story more realistic but has a magical witch as the main antagonist   3 poor casting through the entire movie   4 exact remake of original except she falls in love with a fellow solider instead of commander the best bit about the 1998   5 no musical sequences or even good music  6 half of the characters are just asain and not even chinese   7 fails to exploit such an interesting nuanced culture really skips over any cultural scenes straight to the borderline trash action scenes
Sep 8 2020,negative,as an asian girl from taiwan who love to watch mulan cartoon movie thousand times i must say that i am so disappointed to the crystal liu vision of mulan  i will give some points of my view about this movieno bombs  1 this mulan is more like an emotionless actress  2 too many political considerations  3 lot of original classic characters disappeared   4 the costume design and background are confused  5 logic of some parts and story line dont make any sense  6 the movie mentioned chi all the time chi makes mulan to be a special woman but thats not the point the point is mulans courage  7 rouran armies are that stupid to kill   8 wtf is phoenix made for  9 where is the singing part  10 give me back my mushu and shangli
Sep 8 2020,negative,lacked any humour of the original the fight scenes were poorly choreographed and visual effects seemed to be oddly budget level
Sep 8 2020,negative,lots of plot holes and its just plain strange   mulan in the original movie became a great warrior because of hard work and ingenuity in this version it seems like she was just born with great supernatural combat abilities when shes in the army training she had to hide this ability bc shes just so much better than everyone else they called it the chi of a truest of souls as if it justifies the fact that she didnt have to work for it if they had shown she was trained by her father whos a martial arts master since she was young or even learned it from a scroll she found in a cave or something it would have at least made more sense but the movie showed none of her training progress it literally opened with mulan as a 10 years old girl doing parkour on the roof chasing a chicken   in the original she trained her ass off more than anyone to prove herself worthy so when she reached the top of that poll it felt satisfactory and vindicated you wanted to root her her  but in this version she pretended not to be able to reach the top then once she accidentally revealed her chi ability she decided to do it with ease to shut up everyone  she might as well be a dc superhero   in terms of the plot you will find yourself saying why would she make that move while she could have done this multiple times or simply youd just scream what    the avalanche in the original was a genius plan this one felt like an accident she did not anticipate    the villain fell into the cliche of talking way too much before making the kill only to be stopped by the main character    a lot of moves in the fight sequences either defies physics or were perhaps included for the cool factor hell of a lot of catching flying arrows by hands climbing vertical walls by running long flowy fabrics as weapons and jumping absurdly long distance then slowing down and landing softly like a bird i grew up watching these moves used in chinese kung fu movies in the 80s and 90s and even i thought mulan 2020 overused it it legit felt more cheesy than cool   movie did a terrible job of building likability for mulans friends in the army their characters are so poorly developed with so little screen time that you wont even remember which one is yao therefore when they all stood up for her and go i believe mulan when she tried to convince the general after already been exiled for hiding her identity you wont feel any emotions for this comradery in the two times it showed banters between her and her friends the camera pretty much just stayed on her and the jokes felt super forced like why do these guys care for mulan or trust her so deeply they had no memories together sure they vowed to fight for one another but there needs to be more than a mandatory military vow for them to risk their lives standing up for her    dont even get me started with the hawk character i was excited to see in the trailer that they made her a witch it had the potential to be epic but her character had no logical development arc and the change of heart to be good was sudden and random it was very much daenerys in the last episode of got her magical powers are insanely strong shapeshifting teleportation combat hypnotization even physical possession which did not make sense that shes just a slave of the human villain might as well made her the new main villain or let her betray him and take over the khan army literally in final minutes of the movie she sacrificed herself for mulan because she thinks theyre similar in that theyre not accepted for who they are ones a witch and ones with super combat power i guess they met once before this last moment btw at least show her following mulan around many times before bc shes intrigued by this strong woman so they would have some sort of connection     overall the acting was very stiff she had so little range of facial expressions that it didnt emote emotions she literally had the same expression while holding her half dead mancrush and while chasing a chicken there were many mannerisms and movements she could have done that would made key moments much more powerful that didnt happen for instance in the original when mulan came home to face her presumably dishonored father she immediately fell to her knees bowed and apologized in this version she stood on the same level with him looked him in the eyes and they talked it out come on this is ancient patriarchal china a daughter who broke the law and believed she greatly dishonored her entire family would not have stood eye to eye with her dad the movie failed to pull on the heart strings and made you truly root for these characters like the original did the visuals and the choreography although spectacular of course in disney tradition blurred the focus on the supposedly great story while it should have enhanced
Sep 8 2020,negative,it was okay but it lacked the original disney feel 
Sep 8 2020,negative,its so bad im so sorry for the artists who hired for this title so boring
Sep 8 2020,negative,even with more developed visuals mulan is an ultimately inferior movie compared to its animated predecessor with little to no weight to its emotion and a timely yet less developed message that couldve been told with more earnest finesse
Sep 8 2020,negative,the worst movie of disney and the worst actress of the world this movie gave me nothing nothing
Sep 8 2020,negative,the story line is so boring  without any surprise your best choice if you cant fall asleep at night  so disappointing
Sep 8 2020,negative,i am a chinese but not live in china but i have to say this is the terrible disney movie i ever seen first mulans makeup was horrible and ugly second ignored histories and no music and no mushu every scenes including special effects were disastrous dark and grey color made this people heave no souls third acting in this movie was other disastrous havent you seen crouching tiger hidden dragonwhich was direct by lee i never heard chi in my culture this was racial stereotype in hollywood movies for a long long long time      you told me mulan was a warrior i thought she was in the animated movie 1998  2020 version denied mulans wisdom and all efforts it was luck    that she had magic or she was ordinary liked any other girls    i bag disney please please stop destroying my childhood ok     ps liu yifeis acting skill sucks
Sep 8 2020,negative,one of the worst live actions and the biggest reason is that it isnt the same movie or legend you are naming it after i can handle most changes heck i even like the magic bird lady but the whole movie just doesnt have the same goals and motivations anymore and that that i do not like at all
Sep 8 2020,negative,the movie plot is nothing new comparing to the animated version main actresss acting is really stiff barely could see her make any other facial reactions on different scenes a disappointed disney movies for a 20years old fan like me
Sep 8 2020,positive,well i honestly dont understand those who are saying bad things about the liveaction remake of mulan this movie was the perfect example of how a live action remake should look like not just adapting the original frame to frame to live action which a lot who are now complaining complained back then because of this but taking the base and form a new improved story keeping those elements that worked great in the original yifei liu was amazing as mulan and honestly as a huge fan of the original i didnt mind mushu shang or cricket not being around for this movie nor did i miss the singing because the callbacks to the beloved songs in the orchestral music were amazing my only problem was that the ending wasnt as grandiose as it was in the animated but thats it i love this movie and i would truly appreciate that those who are angry because disney dares to ask an additional fee for a movie that should have been seen on the big screen stop trying to destroy this movies score how interesting that whoever i talked to everyone loved this movie and they are just as dumbfounded as i am as how it has an audience score like this butthurt people are seriously the biggest problem of the past couple of years
Sep 8 2020,positive,emotional roller coaster for all two ours and that is all i expect from any movie i watch do not get in to analyse the movie as a strict remake of the animated one from 1998 that would be wrong in so much levels watch it as a complete new experience story that emphasis on the values that if u want to success u need to try harder never give up and be true to yourself something beautiful that i can share to my daughters without fear there is no courage cheers
Sep 8 2020,negative,sterile is just about the only word i can think of
Sep 8 2020,negative,a native of the northern wei dynasty he would not live in hakka tulou besides hakka tulou only began in the song dynasty please pay attention to the details when doing this historical subject otherwise it will become a comedy      i am disappointed the war scene looks like a childs play secondly hua mulans character portrayal is not good enough this character obviously has a lot of room for shaping but whether it is mulans choice to face her own motives or the armys acceptance of mulans female identity  the process is too simple and scribbled which greatly weakens the core emotional concentration of the film      in the end liu yifei couldnt do it either she was too soft she lacked the strength and indomitability of a fighter facing complex emotional scenes her thin acting skills could not hold up the characters so that when i watched the entire film i felt that mulan  no charm at all
Sep 8 2020,positive,it stayed true to the original mulan with a couple of interesting twists mulans chi was a brilliant addition it allowed her character to truly shine my least favorite character was the witch overall mulan was everything i hoped it would be
Sep 8 2020,negative,the writing the characters and the plot was all one dimensional with most lead characters and heroines you want to see them grow and succeed but not mulan mulan lacked any depth emotion and joy you could not connect with her because of the writing and acting jet li deserves better treatment than to change is voice what a shame for disney this is one disney movie that needed some joy  it needed a song to give it life     if i watched this in the theaters i would of walked out and asked for my money back
Sep 8 2020,negative,this was unfortunate disney should have never changed anything in mulan this wasnt worth remaking the movie i hope they give it another try and remake it like the 1st movie in the future
Sep 8 2020,negative,complete twisting a great original story   main actress doesnt fit into this role fake and awful acting
Sep 8 2020,positive,family absolutely loved this movie inspirational to our youth and wonderful for our girls to have a heroine they can look up to
Sep 8 2020,positive,if you werent a good fan of mulan and you cant barely remember the original you will love it
Sep 8 2020,negative,this is probably the worst live action remake so far dont get me wrong its quite pretty but the story is bad and the story is the heart of it unfortunately its more serious tone drain the fun out of the movie mulan just doesnt earn the viewers respect through hard work and dedication she was apparently always great she just forgot its simply not worth the price
Sep 8 2020,negative,really disappointed with this movie i think disney should be disney knowing that we are going to adapt the cartoon version to real life version i think we should keep the essence of disney cartoon movies singing dancing and funny scene should be not deleted from the real life version just see how beautiful aladdin lion king and of course beauty and the beast were they can make the cartoon version into the real life version without reducing the essence of disney movies the plot was also terrible i think there is no clear plot from the beginning of this movie and where is mushu it should give the funny essence to this film and mushu is a very identical icon for mulan beside mulan herself where is ill make a man out of you and reflection part they also the icons of mulan disney really need to consider their aim in adapting the cartoon version to real life version is it to bring out the nostalgia feeling from the old viewer or is it just to make a new viewer because the plot is very different with the cartoon one the only good thing about this movie is the beauty of mulan character and the existance of donny yen thank you
Sep 8 2020,negative,this movie was disappointing i cant believe they did mulan like this first of all im gonna list all the good the cinematography and acting of each character woot thats about it i think asians actors are coming out strong in the hollywood spot light and im a huge supporter of that great but why am i scoring this so low i love originality but the problem is that disney try mixing elements from the previous animation and the folklore stick to one that is why i hate this movie so much i cant stomach mary sue characters there was no journey or struggles they took out the love interest iconic songs and removed iconic characters can you imagine what the original animation wouldve been like if those characters never existed yeah 2 hr political documentary all the ignorance and sexist remarks that she put up with made mulan so endearing in the original animation not because shes a great fighter or have magic chi powers if anyone is interested in a live action mulan movie watch the hua mulan movie from 2009 i dont recommend this movie but in honestly i want more ppl to watch it to support the talented cast not for the story
Sep 8 2020,negative,my first impression of this film came from walking in to my living room to see my roommate watching it i stood there for a good 15 minutes trying to figure out what he was watching before i gave up and just asked him when he told me the title it did not bode well as i had been planning on watching the new mulan myself later  though i was hesitant i did watch the whole film from start to finish it was everything i had worried about after that fifteen minutes calling this film a remake is simply inaccurate its unrecognizable as disneys mulan the story has been drastically changed and key characters from the original animated film are nowhere to be seen moreover this film lacks the charm of the animated film taking a more serious approach that falls flat due to poor acting and bad special effects   im not sure who this is a film for but one thing is certain if you enjoyed disneys original animated mulan then this isnt the film for you
Sep 8 2020,positive,loved the film please give it a chance judge it on its own lot of people work hard on this film liked it or not its okay i personally do
Sep 8 2020,negative,the movie missed a lot of key elements to why the original was successful  when you take away the songs the motivation to why mulan is who she is it become a different movie this is not disney
Sep 8 2020,negative,if theres a no stars option i will put it
Sep 8 2020,positive,if youve seen the good chinese martial arts movies then youre not gonna be too impressed itd just pass but if youre an american that hasnt seen a good modern martial arts movie and dont like dubbed movies this is a good movie thats all in english donnie yen did good in fact most of the actors did fine but the story and direction wasnt really there you really need to be an animated mulan fan and know how that movie went in order to understand this film but if you have nothing to compare it to you might get lost about why honor was so important or how she turned into a boy suddenly  fight scenes arent as good as many chinese martial arts movies wish it had more humor kinda cool that the main actress also sings in the credits in chinese but her voice isnt nearly comparable to christina aguilara  still its worth supporting but it would be better if disney and others can find a normal way to represent asians rather than in a period piece last i checked there are more asians alive in modern times doing modern things in the modern era than all these fantasized ancient exotic period pieces
Sep 8 2020,negative,the cartoon version of disneys mulan was more realistic than this hot pile of garbage im certain the star wars movies screen writers took over this movie turning an inspiring story about a girl taking up her fathers mantle to prove herself in battle through hard work into a story about a girl with jedi powers dropped into ancient china
Sep 8 2020,negative,the character development that i loved about the original story was not there in this movie at all the interactions between characters felt very shallow and unfulfilling i felt that the kung fu cinematic style could have been more refined to look more styled and less cheesy in parts they could have done a lot more to draw us into the character of mulan rather than just fallow the outline of the story it could have used a lot more refinement and improved with a later release
Sep 8 2020,positive,i am a big fan for liuyifeiin the past all the character she played were beautiful from the sight of mani am so glad the director of  mulan show her beauty from a womans perspective  in the original chinese tale of mulan story mulan was a normal girl without the chishe had a traditional and peaceful way to continue her life as a daughter a wife and a motherbut she was chosen by the life to take the responsibility for the whole familywhich was caused bye her love for her fathershe tried to act like a man when she firstly entered the armybut whatever she didshe couldnt get the good feedbackeven though she didnt give up and found out the she could solve the problem in the girls way with the quality such as sensitive softy and weaknessthe moving part of the whole story was not the magical girlbut a normal girl with the target and never give up 
Sep 8 2020,positive,overall its a good movie  i can feel that the director wants to convey something to us through the movie  it may be that a foreign director wants to make a movie with a chinese cultural background but fails to grasp the essence a bit like american chinese food i feel inexplicable when watching  moreover there are too many things that it tries to convey how can a twohour movie express so much meaning clearly    after ignoring those that movie is amazing    this make me uncomfortable while watching it
Sep 8 2020,negative,beautiful to look at but completely soulless the remake removes much of what made the animated version joyful and inspiring i understand the desire to make this film more serious but they failed badly especially as disney never met a primary colour palette they didnt like in all honestly the sad and scary moments from the animated film hit harder shan yu is much more managing than bori khan and despite a pg13 rating the movie still makes war look quite bloodless this mulan is super from the start using the force er i mean chi to kick butt from day one the editing is strange and jarring the pacing is poor and there is a neverending stream of expository dialogue there are barely any characters with any development and the acting is quite stilted i enjoyed some of the stunt work especially the horse riding stunts which were spectacular overall hugely disappointing baffling and underwhelming i really really wanted to like it but its just poorly made
Sep 8 2020,negative,has some dull moments    i didnt like the movie in general  mushu is not in the movie
Sep 8 2020,negative,whats up with crouching tiger hidden mulan ive been looking forward to a more realistic take on mulan or at least something different than what i got  i would have taken a live action musical version were talking moulin rouge meets fearless i am very disappointed disney      not even a single lets gets down to business to defeat the huns
Sep 8 2020,negative,the movie goes against everything that made original version great i could understand most of these changes but they just dont work the whole war aspect was executed poorly and mulans character development was nonexistent instead of breaking through barriers and proving selfworth this mulan is supernatural kung fu avengersstyle superhero  no struggle in overcoming yourself bettering other men or using clever strategies  this movie is flawed on so many levels that i will not have enough space to describe it all only redeeming quality of this film is its cinematography  the film looks absolutely stunning
Sep 8 2020,negative,garbage wasted 2 hours i will never get back although i started warming up to it mid movie i was very underwhelmed with the story itself i literally put the cartoon mulan right after  just to heal my childhood soul lol just dont save your money and just wait until december super overhyped movie that was not worth the wait so disappointed
Sep 8 2020,negative,i went in with no expectations i was fine with no songs no mushu etc and still finished the movie confused and disappointed    mulan shouldnt have been made into a superherojedi with superpowers there were too many extra characters who needed more backstory it might have worked better as an epic tv series to give time to learn about the characters and connect with them but i didnt feel connected to any of the characters at all i wanted to like it but theres really not much to like
Sep 8 2020,negative,a lifeless joyless husk of the original appreciated the attempt to honor chinese cultural themes but completely destroyed mulans character as well as every character relationship sloppy cgi and horrendous editing     mulan didnt need to be a jedimarvel superhero to be valid she was fine the way she was these liveaction cashgrabs by disney are lazy and they make me sick
Sep 8 2020,negative,super boring this movie has no idea why so many ppl loved the animated mulan character
Sep 8 2020,positive,i say this film is nothing short of perfection its far more realistic than that plebian cartoon the heroine is absolutely brimming with personality very relatable the storys central theme is simply genius its a wonderful film that the whole family can enjoy and the fine people who made this film possible deserve all the thanks in the world
Sep 8 2020,negative,oh my that was 15 hours of my life i wont ever get back and yes i couldnt take it anymore and didnt make it to the end of the movie     the acting was good but unfortunately the script not so much resulting in this really unbelievable mush     that said its a disney movie so i should have expected what is perhaps a movie about war amongst other things to be more star wars than vikingsgame of thrones when it comes to that subject matter
Sep 8 2020,negative,a terribly written story with a terribly written main character that completely undermines the original lessons of the animated film a once normal girl who used wits and cunning to overcome the oppressive nature of a discriminating culture to save her nation is now a superpowered mary sue who can do no wrong
Sep 8 2020,positive,best live action remake disney had made so far
Sep 8 2020,negative,its like a chinese action movie pretending to be a disney one and vice versa it should have gone full speed on either ends    for a chinese action movie there were sloppy editing that i can clearly see were cgi manipulation also shes still very pretty and her hair from a shampoo commercial when she decided she will show her true gender that is after weeks of infrequent baths and just coming off some battle i mean come on what shampoo and skin care does mulan use     for a disney movie it lacked the music and her dragon    i think the worse for me is that the story when compared to the animated one is far more absurd the strategizing she did in the mountain pass in the animated one is more believable than this live one where the mongols seems to forget the laws of physics when using a catapult  the reason by which her gender is revealed and the way wherein she has gained support in her mission to rescue the emperor is more believable also in the animated version    if you will forgive the stunt editing and forget that theres a perfectly fine animated version then maybe this live version can pass your criteria
Sep 8 2020,positive,the majestic visuals and contrasting colors wouldve been much better in a cinema
Sep 8 2020,positive,absolute perfection and you can feel the intense emotions and love through out the entire movie mulan 2020 put lion king 2019 to shame
Sep 8 2020,negative,complete 180 from the original film character development is boring such bad writing
Sep 8 2020,negative,well i dont know where is mulan i always understood this movie were going to be based on mulan 1998
Sep 8 2020,positive,i thought this was a very entertaining adaptation of the mulan story 
Sep 8 2020,negative,so terrible the worst liveaction movie ever by disney
Sep 8 2020,positive,i had huge expectations over this film having mushu in it or not unfortunately i founded really disappointing theres is no soul mulan lost her must the development ofher story the overcoming motivation and even the charisma were lost though the actress was engaged with the role  the others characters were meaningless and were barely given a name  the phoenix was a disposable replacement for the lovely dragon and the witch was the real leading role  the edition was poorly made and grossly unfair with what could be a masterpiece whether it was to be faithful to the animation or the original tale
Sep 8 2020,negative,painful if i werent asian and felt like i should support this to honor my ancestors of course i would have saved 2999 and spent it onliterally anything else  the lines were so cliche and themes so on the nose theres no absolutely depth  some great actors in their other works and choreography though  its really a shame bad writing and direction can turn this story of a female heroine into a fortune cookie level stereotype
Sep 8 2020,positive,i felt the female director behind it loved mulan she was great
Sep 8 2020,positive,even though it wasnt the exact story from the animation theyve stuck with the main lessonmoral of the story 
Sep 8 2020,positive,i love all the cast i can say that its almost the perfect casting
Sep 8 2020,negative,it was a major downgrade from the original it tries to hammer this message of you can do it by showing mulán but then alienates you by making her have superpowers
Sep 8 2020,negative,literally signed up for rotten tomatoes for the first time because i disliked this mulan version that much
Sep 8 2020,negative,was expecting exciting fight scenes i was let down the original cartoon is much better the actress also failed to portray mulan well  too feminine and poor acting overall the movie was not as intense as id like it to be
Sep 8 2020,negative,as boring as the lead
Sep 8 2020,positive,loyal brave and true to mulans story the singing is an intricate part in disney movies but i didnt miss it at all watching mulan this movie evoked something from me the other disney live action remakes couldnt i was brought to tears this is a  film that is respectful to mulan
Sep 8 2020,positive,best movie of disney yet
Sep 8 2020,negative,not for kids to watch  dont waste your time
Sep 8 2020,negative,its very very ackward for me as an decent chinese people to hear such weird of the english they spoken i know it has its chance to be made into a 4 star movie clothing background setup yifei lius performance however the bad habit of producing chinese trashing movie continued on this movie quotes can be as ridiculous as it can the first 20 minute of the plot have already blown my eyes how bad it can be for the rest of the movie matchmaker i wonder if any american ever heard of such thing its actually marriageinducer  and i still wonder could anyone speak auspicious in their daily life
Sep 8 2020,negative,it is another attempt by disney to make money with a simple script and a basic characters leaving behind all the good things of the original disney surviving even from its older films
Sep 8 2020,negative,totally boring and completely forgettable all of the memorable aspects of the original are stripped no songs no mushu what else even was this story about they introduced some lame magic aspect that the mary sue i mean mulan uses to explain her mary sueness what remains is overly corny and feels very forced its hard to believe this movie was expected to hit theaters and be a blockbuster this is a straight to vod movie for sure 
Sep 8 2020,positive,my family really enjoyed this movie mulan is so empowering the storytelling could be better but my kids loved it very much
Sep 8 2020,negative,ill give one star for the acting and a half star for ming na wens cameo    that being said this movie was horrible i wont post any spoilers but save the 30 dollars and just wait till december watch this
Sep 8 2020,positive,she is wonderful her family is proud of her she is the most handsome in the battlefield my children love her
Sep 8 2020,positive,i enjoyed watching mulan 2020 i really liked the new love interest for mulan in this movie although the movie doesnt have the original songsmushu it still has its own beauty and style there are many scenes that are unique and interesting the colors fight sequences and the portray of the ancient chinese culture are all very well done and exciting i liked the changes this movie made from the original animated version if you want to hear the old songs or see mushu just go watch the old one
Sep 8 2020,positive,this is definitely one of the better live action disney remakes to come out  while it isnt better than the original and couldve used more development for some of the newer characters i think this remake is better than what people is giving it credit for  dont listen to the audience score everyone judge it for yourself
Sep 8 2020,positive,i totally love it crystal liu has an amzing perfomance suggest to someone who have not see it yet its abosolutely a great thing
Sep 8 2020,positive,the movie was great i had a wonderful time watching it
Sep 8 2020,positive,disney dropped some of the original elements of the animation on the film which is a pity but the overall picture is good
Sep 8 2020,negative,had so much potential and i really wanted to like it but it was just bad so disappointed worst live action adaptation disney has done so far
Sep 8 2020,negative,while the visual aspect of this movie was beautiful there was little else left to redeem it the characters were one dimensional it was heavily plot driven and i was left craving the original not worth the money
Sep 8 2020,positive,really enjoyed this live action version of mulan going in i had reservations since it sounded like it would be very different from the animated version what with no singing no mushu the comedic sidekick dragon and no li shang while thats true having no musical numbers among other changes was definitely in line with the more mature dramaaction vibe of the film depicting mulan as a warrior with independence and autonomy strengthened the character and worked for the story all of the scenes are also beautifully shot and the movie as a whole is visually arresting glad i watched it and i expect ill be watching it again soon
Sep 8 2020,positive,my family and i really loved this fresh take on a disney classic it had bits of the old movie tied in with homage to many martial arts movies i love this genre
Sep 8 2020,negative,as a chinese person it was so difficult to watch the whole movie is full of incorrect props set and information this is we call whitewash
Sep 8 2020,negative,i dont even have to compare it with the original to show the disgrace this movie is  the edition is awful some times mulan just appears in another side in no timethe music and the dialogues coming from the original feels extremely forced it was supposed to have a more realistic story tell me please what part of the witch like the one showed in the movie is realistic also there is the issue of marie sue since mulan was a girl she was perfect at everything once again the journey is meaningless i can go on for hours but its painful so thats it for this time
Sep 8 2020,negative,in this version mulan pretends to be a man while actually being a robot this movie is missing the heart that made the disney version memorable
Sep 8 2020,neutral,disney tried its best as it tried with aladdin to insert a great value version of a bollywood feel at a true to chinese film piece  the problem is whole the goal is admirable it is just as entertaining as a junior league sporting event versus its professional counter part    chinese films have already adapted the story of the ballad of the magnolia flower mulan more truthfully and accurately to the old folk tale  disney shouldve stuck to its more whimsical version of the tale with its loved memorable songs funny characters and revised story    on a side note the movie done in mandarin with english subtitles mightve made the movie ring more true to the genre it is trying so desperately to replicate
Sep 8 2020,negative,they somehow managed to turn mulan that magnificent movie that earned a special place in our hearts those years ago into an unrealistic bland and forgettable pg13 action superhero movie and most definitely not in a good way honestly i could go ranting on about how mediocre and unadorned this movie turned out how it sucked all of the life out of the far superior originals but i will give it the benefit of the doubt by saying that it wasnt the worst to come out of disneys live action cash gra i mean remake collection
Sep 8 2020,positive,once i got over the fact that this wasnt a musical i really enjoyed it great movie
Sep 8 2020,positive,watch it for the spectacle but the characters and relationships could have been given more real depth story elements and the fight scenes could have been vastly improved and the ending given more emotional impact  it could have been so much better
Sep 8 2020,negative,its pretty bad no character growth with the chosen one stuff in this movie the original animated movie was much better doing a rewatch of it would be more enjoyable than watching this
Sep 8 2020,positive,the latest disney live action film is really fantastic there are some elements from the 1998 film so they didnt completely ignore it yes there is no talking animal similar to no talking parrot iago in aladdin but they wanted to approach this with more realism and wanted to respect the chinese culture just watch this with in open mind  thats all and youll love it there is an important message in the story of mulan 2020 which fits with the current times in the world we live in personally it was enjoyable with some nice surprises yes there is a fee for early premium access on disney  which is no different than putting this out in public theaters first but eventually it will be available on disney plus for everyone later this year as standard listing im one of those who like to purchase a movie ticket on opening weekends so of course i had to make the jump and bought the virtual movie ticket on disney plus streaming it was definitely worth it while being safe and comfortable at home i thought it was the right decision by disney considering the pandemic situation there were some emotional and happy moments which is a unique movie that helps bring a smile to your face during these unprecedented times not perfect but i really liked it a lot disney certainly made it up after what happened with lion king in 2019 i really do support the filmmakers and disney for taking a bold approach of making something fresh but working within the basic story structure of the animated version definitely a thumbs up
Sep 8 2020,positive,ok mediocre disney reimagining movie starring some girl and the wonderful donnie yen this movie is just ok that means theirs some good and some bad first lets start off with the characters they all feel off in the original they all have feelings and heart but in this they most of the times lack that it feels super long too even though its only an hour and 40 minutes this is another movie ill forget about but this movie had real potential in spots i felt like they couldve done more and the villains sucked mulan had her moments but they didnt put enough time and effort for the audience to care about  this is another disney movie that will be lost in the shuffle
Sep 8 2020,negative,i love all the top tier martial artists  but hate the new trend incarnation of animation to live action cash grab movies disney is puking these out for millennials  and the new breed of children that have the attention span of goldfish
Sep 8 2020,negative,the movie was so white washed the only thing that wasnt was the actors in the screen they decided to remove mushu to make the story more realistic but they added a witch that could transform into anything very realistic when the emperor fights he was so useless and the way he fought the huns was so unrealistic when he caught the arrow and mulan kicked it was unrealistic i had more hopes for this movie i love history and i thought since they wanted to make the movie more realistic i had high hopes since disney has a huge budget but i was really dissapointed
Sep 8 2020,negative,i was disappointed what i loved about the original mulan was that she was ordinary she didnt know anything about fighting she bravely took her fathers place in the army she struggled in the beginning but ended up overcoming the challenges to become a great woman that every little girl looked up to in the live action mulan they gave her this chi it came off as a superpower which gave the audience the impression that a female could never go to war without having superpowers that she would never be equal to her male counterparts without having a superpower to make her great
Sep 8 2020,positive,i really enjoyed mulan i found it entertaining and loved the story line
Sep 8 2020,positive,it was entertaining i did miss the the music from the animated film however the story line was good and updated well the action scenes are good
Sep 8 2020,negative,i was expecting a retelling of the animated film however this is a completely different story this movie is average at best the female lead is very wooden and not charasmatic at all it is hard to  become invested in her character she is born with magical powers and has no compelling arc whatsoever the film is quite boring and incredibly long i would rate this on par with dumbo as the worst of the live action remakes to date hard to believe they blew 200 million on this thankfully disney is doing a lot of belt tightening so maybe they will focus on story and character development going forward my advice would be to skip this and instead watch the original animated mulan on disney
Sep 8 2020,negative,wow i set the bar low and yet this film dug 6 ft under that bar this is the most boring of the live action disney films to be fair they are all bad but somehow this film beat them all    i will not compare this with the animated version just my honest opinion on this film as is    one pro is the scenery and costumes are very beautiful i enjoyed the backgrounds and shots of nature another pro is gong li jet li and donnie yens individual scenes show casing their martial art skills    the rest of the film is a jarring experience as it all feels forced together scenes do not flow into each other and the scenes alone are incredibly boring the story does not feel properly woven together the characters lack any real chemistry or at times purpose their personalities are so flat that i did not feel any interest in rooting for anyone     the first half of the film feels as if it is missing background music that would help deepen certain parts yet we sit in silence the latter half has fitting background music so i dont know what happened there    the film takes itself way too serious that it lacks any balance between humor sadness happiness etc its all serious with a few cringe humor parts serious cringe moments    my biggest complaint is that this film feels like what white people think chinese people andor culture are its an outsiders interpretation of something they did not grow up with or experience    overall i am shocked how bad this movie is completely flabbergasted
Sep 8 2020,negative,completely lacking in the disney magic if taken as a more traditional none disney movie its still pretty dull at best an average action movie very forgettable
Sep 8 2020,negative,this movie is just bad not just compared to the original but on its own the story is simple th characters defy any laws of phisics imaginable which means they are never in any danger because they can basically do whatever they want if at one point she started to fly i wouldnt even have been surprised the editing is bad to the point that objects and characters just jump around in space and worst of all the whole idea of female empowerment is simplified to the point that its just embarassing
Sep 8 2020,negative,lets put the awful story telling and bland character development aside for a second and talk about just how badly made this movie is the pacing is erratic and scenes are rushed through as fast as possible with no time to breath then there is zero natural segways into the next scene just oh i guess were here now oh i guess shes on a roof now oh the battle is starting does disney just not know how to make a movie any more this is the nuts and bolts of film making studios figured out decades ago this feels feels like a hard regress 
Sep 8 2020,positive,is the best disney live action movie you have to stop thinking that the movies will be an exact copy of the original
Sep 8 2020,negative,might as well call it a completely different movie than mulan it has absolutely no references to the amazing original movie that came out very disappointed
Sep 8 2020,negative,poor fights weak story better to stay with the animation
Sep 8 2020,positive,we watched it with a group of 6 and everyone really enjoyed it i liked it more than the alladin and lion king remakes 
Sep 8 2020,negative,a terrible remake that shares the name of its original and little else instead of giving us that rousing inspiring story of a girlturnedwarrior in the face of incredible social cultural and physical opposition we were given an altered story where the girl already has everything she needs inside of her from the getgo shes introduced as a powerful woman imbued with a magical essence that will let her conquer anything conflict to overcome training to undertake hardfought victory you wont find these here because when opposition raises its head this mulan squashes it with her magic    the entire training sequence from the original film is replaced with a montage of vapid training sequences that tell us nothing about this mulans grit courage or character     the unique characters from the original film replaced by a bunch of cardboard cutouts who get maybe one scene together with mulan where they share some form of camaraderie and show a sliver of dimension you will struggle to remember who is who because the movie doesnt care about them and doesnt even bother to introduce them or paint them in unique colors     the bad guy is replaced with a laughable villain who is not nearly one fourth as frightening shan yu from the original instead this villain relies on an a wholly new witch that does all of his bidding and hard work for him mulan has qi and the new bad guy has a witch with her own qi without it these characters would be nothing disney thinks that your main characters shouldnt actually work do anything for themselves or have any sort of arc from point a to b to c just a flat line that never changes its like disneys writers have no idea how to write a character arc  which is ironic because the original film has character development in spades    the film tries to paint a positive theme for the strength and independence of women but all disney does is neuter its own message by putting qi as the crutch of the two main female characters without it they would never have made it as far as they did as opposed to the original film where mulan actually had to work hard for her respect and ultimately her victory there was no magic guiding here then     and why replace the family ancestral dragon with a phoenix that does literally nothing but look beautiful and fly around at random points through the film    i could go on and on dont waste your time with this one or if you do dont give disney any money for it we need to stop encouraging this garbage
Sep 8 2020,negative,one of the worst films made by disney a pity that mulan was focused only for the chinese audience
Sep 8 2020,positive,beautiful retelling more grown up than the animated length feature the visuals are stunning
Sep 8 2020,negative,boring and nothing like the cartoon
Sep 8 2020,negative,completely butchers the previous iterations plot in an effort to seem more mature then pumps in nauseating physics defying cgi bs to go along with mulans new super powers  which take the place of her previous incarnations ingenuity and tenacity erase all the other characters because who even liked them and add in an absolute avalanche of plot holes and your left with this dumpster fire of a film
Sep 8 2020,neutral,the movie is so average 
Sep 8 2020,positive,well directed story followed original for as much i think it possibly could love it as much as the original well done
Sep 8 2020,negative,this is a prime example showing that newer and more expensive does not always mean better mulan raised a generation and now it also disappointed one
Sep 8 2020,negative,this movie is a joke most videogame movie adaptations i have seen have been better adaptations than this garbage even the last airbender is  a better adaptation     it almost felt like a parody pretending to be serious at times it reminded me of shaolin soccer    the people responsible for this have brought dishonor on themselves on disney and their cow
Sep 8 2020,negative,it was awful they took all the good things of mulan and tossed them away just to add some super unrealistic things
Sep 8 2020,negative,can i rate less than one star please save yourself the time and watch the far superior animated classic instead
Sep 8 2020,positive,mulan is a disney live action remake available on disney the story is about a young chinese girl who disguises as a male warrior to replace her fathers position in the army to fight off the ruahan threat against the empire   visually it was a good stunning movie but the story cut corners it did not explain very well it reminded me of  crouching tiger hidden dragon but that storyline was much better  there was too much hype but less entertaining with no musical numbers like any other disney movie  it was missing the magic and the essence of a kids movie  the cast was strong with jet li as the emperor and the beautiful yifel liu as mulan along with a well supporting cast  i would say this was an okay disney movie not the best but good to watch once
Sep 8 2020,negative,the movie was trash they shouldve just stuck with the original mulan
Sep 8 2020,positive,honestly this movie is getting a lot of hate but i liked it and honestly it kind of irritates me the way people are criticizing it on monday people will sit there and complain that the force awakens was just a rehash of the old material so then disney thinks okay lets not do that again and now theyre mad that this is not a rehash of the original material    a lot of people wanted a shot for shot remake of the animated movie and thats not what this is the narration at the very beginning of the movie the first line is there are a lot of tales about mulan and this is one of many this movie feels like a good middle ground between the animated classic and a martial arts epic this feels very much like a chinese tale which people seem to forget this was exactly that way before disney ever animated it and put it in theaters so if you like both the animated mulan and things like crouching tiger watch this movie and you will likely enjoy it if you expect the animated great but designed for children even though adults enjoy it to animated classic watch something else this is a really good martial arts chinese folktale movie
Sep 7 2020,positive,this film is amazing the scenes the characters the sceneries i love it
Sep 7 2020,negative,i have been a supporter of these liveaction remakes but it was horrible  the actress who plays mulan was boring and they actually ruined her character by making her good at everything   in the original animated movie she became a good warrior with determination and hard work  by making her already better than everybody else in the new one they took away her heart and soul and just made her an strong empowering woman for the masses  the original character was already strong and didnt need to be altered   i do appreciate that disney tried to be different with this movie   i do not expect or want a carbon copy of the animated movie but the script was also very bland
Sep 7 2020,positive,it was a pretty good movie one thing to keep in mind is to simply keep an open mind when watching it dont expect to see an exact copy of the animated version even though there is no singing i think it still held up well for a live action version
Sep 7 2020,negative,it was ok replacing mushu with the bird witch wasnt worth it the phoenix seems unnecessary the scenery was quite beautiful but doesnt make up for being kinda boring a good film should never have checking if its almost over   mulan was basically a mary sue with chi powers superpowers my biggest complaint is the plot hole during training so if anyone failed to meet the commanders expectations they wouldve been kicked out of the army so its fair to say her father wouldve failed and be sent home meaning she really didnt need to go in his place in fact she couldve failed and be sent home and not worry her father anymore this film is not worth the thirty dollars please wait until december
Sep 7 2020,positive,a masterpiece definitely awesome
Sep 7 2020,positive,we watched and really enjoyed it last night  my daughters are already on their 2nd time  it was a great movie
Sep 7 2020,neutral,the whole movie lack of imagination and logic the movie creates the story to express some idea of feminism even it disobey the regular logic
Sep 7 2020,positive,very well done   albeit difficult avoiding randomly singing the songs   but incredibly beautiful film
Sep 7 2020,negative,the 1998 version was more realistic than this one
Sep 7 2020,positive,better than i expected and one of the best live action remakes kept some good nods to the original while making this fresh more accurate to the original poe
Sep 7 2020,positive,although there was no dragon and romance i thought the action was great
Sep 7 2020,neutral,great visuals and a decent attempt at a nonshot for shot remake but several key roles are overacted ie the emperor or miscast the films greatest flaw is the intentional move to a more mature lookfeel by eliminating the comical dragon and the musical numbers but the filmmakers dont take advantage of this by adding in more mature elements or significantly better character development the result is a film that feels like youre watching someones memory of what mulan was
Sep 7 2020,positive,spectacular not for kids our family loved the movie way to go disney
Sep 7 2020,negative,its a soulless body of a movie i didnt feel any emotion throughout the movie like you would watching the animation after the last few live action adaptations i have little faith in any upcoming attempts by disney good luck little mermaid
Sep 7 2020,negative,i understand they wanted it to match the original chinese story if mulanbut this could have been done much betterthere was no humor in the movie which supposed to be a disney signaturethe acting was bland and the screenplay felt like a first basic draftthe directing was also crazy with the camera angles for fight sequencesthe just drags on as you wait for it to finish overall the movie had potential with the lead actorbut many other roles were miscast and they just didnt use the emotional potential that was possible from the story that was providedyoull prob be watching your phone while it plays or you might fall asleep during this moviefor the record i enjoyed aladdin and thought it was a good adaptationthis one they dropped the ball
Sep 7 2020,negative,wow this movie was such a disappointment firstly all disney songs from the original were removed due to wanting to keep the movie realistic however the director decides to add a witch and an ancestral phoenix that does not speak important characters are removed such as mushu whos grows with mulan throughout the original film and adds humor and flare mulans grandmother who encourages mulan and shane mulans captain who she falls in love with in the original film the film feels very fast paced due to the fact the audience does not know what the characters are feeling through song none of the characters are emphasized besides mulan which is so disappointing we go from  knowing the names of soldiers in the original film to just soldiers in the new film hey disney if youre gonna do a remake how about following what made the classic so great having a girl become a woman through hard work and dedication and struggles of becoming a soldier instead of saying she is super human by having chi her whole life
Sep 7 2020,negative,this movie is a disgrace to all disney movies the remake is totally different from the original its one thing to adjust details in a movie to appeal to new audiences but totally disregarding the original without paying homage to any of the characters or music is uncalled for the only thing i appreciate is the deepening of some characters but not even a cameo of the cricket hurts my heart  if i could give 0 stars i would and another thing for those who have seen the original it is like a treasure hunt to find any resemblance to the first one
Sep 7 2020,positive,i loved the movie loved how they didnt make it exactly like the animated i like how it was more serious if you want to laugh watch the animated one but if you want to watch a mulan movie that seems more realistic watch this one you cant compare it to the animated one because it has a different style and mood the acting is great the shots are great and the scenery is fantastic there were parts where you could tell it was cgi but most of the time you could not i cried at the end it was very emotional it bought up more about how she disguise herself i wish i was able to see it in the theaters
Sep 7 2020,negative,the cartoon version was miles better was sort of disappointed  wait until its on netflix dont waste 30 bucks on this film
Sep 7 2020,neutral,if you dont take the animated movie into account and just judge it on its own merits it was fine  it wasnt the worst movie ever made but it certainly left way too much undone to be called a great movie and certainly not worth the 30 for a film not shown in theaters  it paid the bills  the cast was great the cinematography was beautiful  the story was fine but felt shortsided and could have been more than it was  the interactions between the majority of characters could have filled more space and it didnt  overall not crap but nothing ill watch again right away
Sep 7 2020,positive,i really enjoyed it even though the character of mushu was not  included in this adaptation
Sep 7 2020,negative,souless version of the animated version
Sep 7 2020,negative,bad acting and story line and failed humor when they tried no development whatsoever and i didnt find myself wanting to invest in any of the characters 
Sep 7 2020,negative,not worth watching whatever this is
Sep 7 2020,negative,they removed everything that made the original so memorable i can understand that they wanted to make a more gritty action film but they didnt even do that the side characters are forgettable and mulan has the emotional depth of a teaspoon and the story it self makes no sense
Sep 7 2020,positive,i loved the movie it was so amazing
Sep 7 2020,negative,mulan feels like a stupid mix of the disneystar wars trilogy with scenes from mad max road fury it has no essence it is not epic mulan does not grow as a character does not suffer and does not inspire empathy hua mulan 2009 is better if you feel the characters
Sep 7 2020,positive,i was hoping disney would take this opportunity to make an action hero out of mulan  while i throughly enjoyed the musical cartoon version it would be so inappropriate in a live action version  this is a war movie but treated gently so it can be enjoyed by the entire family i disagree with those who would say it lacks magic  it had a different kind of magic that is present in some of the more artistic martial arts movies both my son and my daughter are equally enthralled and empowered by this movie and the scenery costumes choreography and art direction are stunning to look at of course there are cheeky disney moments but i want those in my disney movies personally and it keeps it light while also emphasizing the bravery of the characters against a serious ominous threat  it never goes too dark and manages to maintain a familyfriendly balance of the heavy subject matter         in terms of disney live action remakes in general i disagree with those who want to see the cartoon redone line for line and change nothing  those movies have already been made and probably executed better in the cartoon version  when im watching a live action remake im looking for the key story elements to be there but also some creative expansion upon the story and maybe how it might have been in a slightly more realistic sense while keeping the magical intent of the story this new version of mulan did that for me when i want to hear the old songs i can go back and watch the cartoon it would have been too cheesy for a character like mulan who is such a strong and brave warrior woman i love seeing a powerful female action hero represented in a respectful and aspirational way on top of that it is done with the beauty and elegance of martial arts these kinds of movies were not as prevalent or as well done when i was a young girl and it makes me happy to see that my daughter gets to enjoy movies like mulan
Sep 7 2020,negative,a charming story of overcoming has become a failed superhero story not suitable for younger audiences and lacking in deeper meaning its just not worth worth the time
Sep 7 2020,positive,i should preface this by saying 1 im not a huge disney fan and 2 ive never seen the animated version of this movie i got pulled into wanting to watch this when i saw the trailer back in february it looked like it could be pretty great despite being a disney project im so glad i gave it a chance i loved it i thought it was visually spectacular i hope we get to see on the big screen at some point wellpaced had a really likable cast especially the lead actress and that it managed to walk the line between 100 family friendly and challenging the status quo at least for disney fare i found there to be tons of queer subtext and that pleased me so its formulaic true but without giving away any spoilers i can say that some major cliches were avoided and that was refreshing if i had kids id happily sit and watch this with them several times over
Sep 7 2020,negative,after watching this movie i had to rewatch the animated one to get rid of the bad aftertaste it left im ok with the idea of getting rid of the fantasy parts like a talking dragon but why replace them with a witch that only serves to patch over the missing plot pieces as a guide somehow it felt like i took a dozen bathroom breakes and missed a few minutes of the film each time there was just no connection between a few scenes
Sep 7 2020,negative,not good nobody seemed to like it that watched with me the classic is much better
Sep 7 2020,neutral,pretty colors do not make up for a lack of humor back when mulan was a regular person that worked hard to become awesome both genders could rout for her but now that shes born that way shes essentially a superhero that humans cannot relate to
Sep 7 2020,positive,the best disney live action if you want to sing or see mushu just watch the original but has a live action it have a great story telling and is something new the other live actions have failing  showing the same and thats too borring like you know exactly whats going to happen frame by frame story the cinematography custom desgins the details its excellent
Sep 7 2020,positive,a very enjoyable movie different from the animated but still very good
Sep 7 2020,negative,horrible dont watch it the worse live action so far and even if this wasnt a live action to compare with it is just a waste of time and not worth watching
Sep 7 2020,positive,i absolutely loved the movie  love the female empowerment aspect that was added
Sep 7 2020,negative,yet another miss for these remakes it isnt a horrible film but by removing the fun it is a pointless and predictable yawn fest
Sep 7 2020,positive,i thought the movie was bland and didnt have enough heart the storyline and main plot also completely ignored the main point of mulans character it was an okay time
Sep 7 2020,positive,this movie was amazing the story line with gong lis character was so interesting and mulan and her father have some of the most beautiful scenes quality film and already streamed it twice
Sep 7 2020,negative,the awful butchering of a classic
Sep 7 2020,negative,who was this for it was too violent for kids and as an adult i found it boring and wish i could get my money back the acting reminds me of the old kung foo theater it seems overexcited and fake       the movie had none of the magic from the cartoon it didnt creat any kind of character development that made the cartoon so good     why did yall cut out musho removing him killed put the stake though the heart of the movie      i made no connection with the characters they could have been nuked from orbit and i wouldnt have cared     the mandalorian has better computer generated special effect so where did disney spend the budget for this movie it was not on writing actors or graphics so where was the money spent
Sep 7 2020,positive,mulans story has encouraged a lot of chinese girls and young women im so glad to see that this movie pointed out that the importance of the responsibility to the family as a mother and a daughter i want my kids learn this this is why many asian families could survive during bad times being yourself and follow your heart are important but at the same time taking your responsibility is also very important they are not necessarily conflicted with each other   the only thing i dont like   in history mulan is an ordinary girl she has no super power this is why the story has moved a lot of people however in the movie mulan is talented and powerful
Sep 7 2020,positive,its a very different flavor of mulan from disneys 1998 animated version this is one of the best live actions by disney and that is even without the singing mushu or li shang i would have loved to see more character development and i felt the pace of the story was a bit fast overall i enjoyed it i also appreciate the women empowerment theme
Sep 7 2020,positive,worth the money to see great fun and excitement 
Sep 7 2020,positive,acting was horrendous 
Sep 7 2020,positive,love it my girlfriends favourite disney princess
Sep 7 2020,negative,from the beginning the movie did not attract my attention so i prefer the animated version
Sep 7 2020,negative,literally the worst movie i have ever seen
Sep 7 2020,positive,such a great movie  not like the original movie at all but it has just enough to remind us of the original  when watching the movie dont go in expecting what we saw in the first mulan because its not     and honestly this is how all the remakes should be an entire new movie but with just enough to reminds us of what we grew up with
Sep 7 2020,negative,i have no idea what i just watched but it wasnt mulan the story was gutted and made worse it wasnt enough to just be a woman she has to be a woman with special powers ie chi her struggle with who she is was nonexistent in the live action also when she saved everyone no one saw her actions and then she just shows up like i was a woman this whole time  then when they accept and trust her it just feels so out of place i could say that for almost every moment in this movie
Sep 7 2020,negative,acting is bad and scenes are completely off comparing to chinese history the movie is just embarrassed to watch
Sep 7 2020,negative,disney cares nothing for good story telling feel style cinematography quality cgi or character development disney only cares about costume design so gaudy in the hope that you are so distracted by it to forget about the rest
Sep 7 2020,negative,it would be hard to think of how they could have made a less imaginative movie
Sep 7 2020,negative,no build up of any characters if you didnt watch the original cartoon movie you be confused sometimes and playing catchup the only emotional parts were between the father and mulan disappointing movie overall and the worst movie of 2020
Sep 7 2020,negative,boring bland basic the acting was stale there was virtually no humor no music this is disney still right 
Sep 7 2020,positive,mulan was an original remake and not a complete rehash of its cartoon counterpart like some of the other live action disney movies were i felt there were a few things the movie nailed and a few things it could have done better its not a masterpiece but it is shot incredibly well and you can get behind the story i did feel the writing was a tad lazy and some of the changes the characters made throughout the movie didnt make sense to me i just felt it needed to have a little more detail behind it to believe the changes that they made     overall its worth watching kids will love it and i think adults will be divided there is a pretty awesome cameo at the end of the movie 6510
Sep 7 2020,negative,this movie doesnt know chinese culture serves no feminist value other than empty virtual signaling betrays most things that made the anime such a good movie and such a feminist statement and mostly its not even an interesting story satisfyingly told
Sep 7 2020,negative,mushu   uh oh wait he gone
Sep 7 2020,positive,this fresh take on an animated favorite had me shouting girl power   yes mushu and the cricket are not in it but the take is more realistic gritty at times i love also that mulan did not need a relationship or romance to define her watch it and then watch it with your girls
Sep 7 2020,neutral,ok to be fair it ok movie if it wasnt base on disney movie and they made it too serious like no time for singing or love between milan  shang by the way where was he the the movie also how can you replace mushu like for real
Sep 7 2020,negative,i had to make an account to rate this as low as possible i couldnt sleep last night because of how bad this movie was please get rid of this movie forever
Sep 7 2020,negative,they looked at what was good with the original mulan and went but what if we didnt do that
Sep 7 2020,positive,the thing with this movie is that you can see where they were going for which is getting out the element of comedy from the original animation and making it more about mulan stading up for what she thinks it is right and for that we can applaude but when you take an element out of a movie that everybody knows you should fill up the gap with something and for me they didnt it made the movie kind of empty and it was just yeah i already know the story and the thrillin just wasnt there so i think that overall it is a good movie to pass time but it doesnt scream great production awardwinning screenplay
Sep 7 2020,positive,loved it  visually stunning with great acting and a humorous story line filled with wonderful honk kong style fight sequences  a simple yet enlightening story  my family all enjoyed it
Sep 7 2020,negative,when i saw the first trailer of this movie i was excited because i actually thought disney was going to take this story in a new direction and make it their own after seeing the movie its the same issue i have with the liveaction lion king even though this isnt as bad as that its the same movie without any of the charm or energy of the original film the absence of the music and characters like mushu and shane made the film feel empty and the film was really boring and uninteresting dont waste 30 on this movie
Sep 7 2020,negative,i really wanted to like this movie because it has gorgeous visuals and the dp outdid themselves in some of these shots and the cast is fantastic especially the always solid donnie yen but i just dont why its boring its an epic film shot on a grand scale but the actual action is mostly generic and despite solid acting i just didnt feel any attachment to the characters mulans journey felt rushed going from civilian to hardened soldier in an eyeblink making her skills and competency feel unearned in later scenes i dont care how naturally talented you may be no one is born being naturally good at war sorry i despised the hawk witch lady frankly as 1 she felt completely unnecessary to the plot which made any scene she was in drag and 2 when disney announced a year ago that this version would forgo fantastical elements like mushu in favor of a more grounded genuine interpretation of the story of mulan i was a bit sad but i could respect some things had to change in favor of that vision fine then the trailer drops and hey heres witch woman shape shifting into a freaking bird whoops so much for forgoing those fantastical elements in favor of a more grounded genuine interpretation right     so we have weak script boring fight pieces and unnecessary characters the final yawninducing nail in the coffin is the occasionally wonky cgi and editing im sorry but disney had an extra 56 months to smooth out this film if it looks this bad after almost half a year to polish it up how horrible would the original theatrical release have been we watched this on a high end 65 4k set with a 912 atmos surround sound system so those flaws were right in our face i can only imagine how much more glaring they would have been in a theater honestly they probably would have been noticeable on an ipad at 30k feet somewhere over the continental us     ill end this review with the same advice i have been giving my friends that chose not to purchase it this weekend wait until it is free later this year its an ok film if you havent watched it yet and it isnt a complete waste of a couple hours but it absolutely is not worth 30 dollars the original is free right now so go watch that instead better character development better action scenes and actual heart three things that are sorely lacking from this live action adaptation
Sep 7 2020,positive,nothing groundbreaking but visually stunning and overall entertaining
Sep 7 2020,negative,lame story and was boring  as usual the graphics were great  you cant please everybody without watering your product down mulan is a prime example of producing the syrup to thin you end up with an inferior product
Sep 7 2020,positive,as a fan of mulan favorite movie as a kid i absoluty love it its alwasy good to see a fresh new look of disney and this movie is soo mature as the people who saw the original one on the movie theather the music the photography  the acting everything is perfect
Sep 7 2020,negative,terrible castingacting not reflective of source material
Sep 7 2020,negative,this movie compares to its animated counterpart the same way disneys hercules compares to dwayne johnsons hercules its a live action reiteration of the animated film that doesnt do it justice in any kind just a version of the story you definitely werent expecting and didnt need
Sep 7 2020,negative,worst liveaction movie ever mulan was my favorite animae when i was young i was so excited to see many chinese face shown in the moive i had even so wellprepared to see it for several times in the theater but right now i cannot say enough how disappointed i am about it
Sep 7 2020,positive,bold unique visually stunning
Sep 7 2020,negative,painful to watch the acting is bad poor storytelling the movie is just like other typical chinese war movie with weird cg effect
Sep 7 2020,positive,decent movie but nothing special secondary characters acting ability overshadowed lead interesting subplot that didnt go anywhere studio pandering and a how do we kill off the villain quickly to maintain the runtime resolution pull down what could have been a good movie
Sep 7 2020,negative,extremely underwhelming did not do justice to the animated version and this was not a kids movie  my daughter was extremely disappointed she didnt even sit through 10 minutes of the movie shes 3 12  she loves the animated one but this one was a massive letdown
Sep 7 2020,neutral,i did not like this movie and i had high expectations
Sep 7 2020,negative,hard to relate to the yaolingchien equivalents the matrixstyle fighting scenes pushed the film beyond the ideal fantasy threshold
Sep 7 2020,negative,waste time and money can totally skip this movie and disney
Sep 7 2020,positive,incredible something totally different from other live actions too bad it was not released in theaters
Sep 7 2020,negative,no sense movie seriusly is orrible
Sep 7 2020,negative,in all honesty this movie takes itself entirely too seriously
Sep 7 2020,negative,kept saying to myself have an open minddisney always was great at story telling turns out they removed the story and character developmentpart and turned this into an action fantasy film i could have saved 30 and watched all chinese action pics in netflix
Sep 7 2020,negative,the battles are super boring and exaggerated ugly makeup the witch look so bad   only like is the true to family   mulan was the worst actress ever and to bad that she know already how to fight because this show that you born with it you cant make it lol
Sep 7 2020,positive,good visuals but lacked core i dont mind they didnt stick to the original but it was soulless as its not bad but not goodod either
Sep 7 2020,positive,beautiful movie faithful story and i was genuinely surprised how a western director could assemble such a chinese styled movie even though there are a few elements and scenes that made me cringe a bit as a chinese loved how they had the disney songs incorporated into the film score
Sep 7 2020,negative,i honestly dont know how to write a review for a movie that was so terrible
Sep 7 2020,negative,boring uninspired and corny af as you might expect from a movie that the filmmakers even admitted to have had vetted by the chinese communist party they even went as far as casting an actor who looked like chinese leader xi jinping to play mulans father by all means watch it if you like your mulan sanitized by chinese state censors
Sep 7 2020,positive,i did not hate this movie it had its strides in both directions i know a lot of people are upset about the cost but i enjoyed watching it at home my family actually saved  money after adding the cost of the platform in comparison to going to the theater plus we get to keep it and watch it several times if we werent in a worldly crisis with limited entertainment i probably would have given it a solid 3 stars due to its darkness and imbalance felt it had so many powerful deep moments that was not balanced out by the whimsy and humor that you usually find in this sort of film i do see where they tried if the youth in my home were younger i am not sure i would let them watch it the youth in my home havent asked to watch it a second timeand i do feel this is because of the imbalance and limited joyfunhumorwhimsy  i enjoyed the feminine power i also enjoyed the spiritual emphasis i miss the grandmother really they could have added her with the mood they were setting i dont necessarily miss mushu as i feel he is quite a selfcentered character the spiritual presence of the phoenix was appreciated offered many talking points for family discussion much warmth to all
Sep 7 2020,negative,it was ok my biggest gripe is the hype it was ok but the story of fa mulan is boring nothing we havent seen already
Sep 7 2020,negative,did not hold my interest had to watch it in 2 sittings
Sep 7 2020,negative,boring and badly written might have been written by a group of 7 year olds feels disjointed and generally has no flow graphics is good ay least
Sep 7 2020,positive,its a good movie for children but for someone who used to watch chinnese colosal drama this movie is kind a stiff and lack of emotion here and there kind feel disappointed because this one movie that im looking forward to maybe some of the reason was because the actor has to talked in english it would probably feel more exited if the dialog were in chinnese
Sep 7 2020,negative,a film thats all show no heart and overpriced it will leave you empty and emotionally stagnant mulan lacks all the strength dedication and charm present in her animated version
Sep 7 2020,negative,awful just awful dont even waste your time with this trash
Sep 7 2020,negative,first off im a huge disney fan and was really excited for this movie when i heard it was pg13 i wanted to see mulan stabbing people but what i got was a watered down mess they took away all of mulans personality making her bland and way too perfect i did not laugh once in the entire movie and i was super sad when the bird lady died for no reason even though the film is not geared toward kids there is no blood or explicit images that would rate it pg13     they seemed to be changing their classic story under the guise of making it like the original but i looked up the original legend and they only got farther away from it mulan is a chinese ballad telling of a women who took her fathers place as his son in fighting off nomadic tribes after a long and successful career of about 12 years she returns and with her fellow soldiers receives promotions and money she turns down a highranking position and the troops drop her off at home where she finally reveals that she is a women they have some nod to this in the beginning of the movie when shes running with the hares which is part of the ballad but other than that they totally made everything up in order to shape it into a new and western story      lets seesomething positive i liked the costumes and i liked the original voice of mulan presents the new mulan to the emperor at the end the set and cgi was welldone too    so i ask disney why would you change such a beloved and awesome movie when 1 you didnt even stick to the original story and 2 when a live action of mulan already exists mulan rise of a warrior 2009 with higher ratings so far please dont waste your time and money on this movie just go watch the original that i find more moving and beautiful it breaks my heart that they messed it up so bad
Sep 7 2020,negative,it was really bad the best song in all of disney and its not in there along with other key roles that made the movie what it is this is trash tier movie
Sep 7 2020,positive,the movie is amazing and i am very excited about it some people have to understand that is very logical for this movie not to be exactly the same as the animated version because that version is for children and that is the reason that there is a speaking dragon and all this stuff to make it fun for the kids this movie tried to show the world what really matters to life honor honesty family royalty and i have to say that they nailed it also the whole production was amazing and with very good actors some of the being very popular among the asian especially chinese viewers
Sep 7 2020,negative,this movie is so bland and the acting is so awful the fact that this movie is 30 extra dollars on disney is a joke its another garbage disney live action remake
Sep 7 2020,positive,the first hour was terrible bad dialogue and so many holes the film gets better when all the characters stop talking and start fighting which is the best of the film the dynamics of the villains among themselves is poor and without personality to the point of using a phrase by kylo ren star wars in the same tone   the problem with this film is not its intentions but how to get there when you look and say i like this and i like that  but why you did that  why it was so easy  why you are acting against your personality  mulan has no character development she is the best from the beginning she does not evolve as a soldier she does not evolve her powers  this film looks like a new justice league where the scenes were ripped off and you can say from far that there is something its missing
Sep 7 2020,negative,this movie has neither the soul and spirit of the 1998 animated version nor the cultural authenticity you would expect of an all chinese ensemble not to mention the gaping void left by the absence of mushus comic relief and the iconic songs even if i were to judge this independently from the animated version the characters are poorly developed if even at all the dialogue is stiff and shallow and the story has jarring lapses in logic it disappointingly straddles between meek homages to its animated predecessor for nostalgias sake and contrived tokenistic expressions of chinese culture and feminism
Sep 7 2020,negative,i did not like it at all the only okay thing was the action
Sep 7 2020,neutral,this movie fell flat it was mostly fighting scenes and very little character development including mulan herself it can be done and jojo rabbit is a good example for actors and directors to follow 
Sep 7 2020,negative,something beautiful with no substance is worth 30 seconds of effort than a feeling of shame
Sep 7 2020,negative,do not waste the 30 to stream this its utter rubbish who are these critics that are rating this as a 78 what a horrible movie geeze did the director and writers even think about character development at all the answer is no my friends and i laughed during the movie thats just how bad it is    if youre a fan of atla think back to when they made the liveaction movie of avatar now think of mulan at the same level severely disappointed
Sep 7 2020,positive,it was awesomereally enjoyed it also i really liked being able to watch it at home
Sep 7 2020,negative,if you thoroughly enjoyed the animation in the 90s that depicts mulan developing into her own unique warrior through her perseverance cunning and grit prepare to be completely disappointed she is rey
Sep 7 2020,negative,both story and characters are all lack of depth more like a grade c action movie bad storytelling very disappointing as an asian disney fans the girl plays  mulan lack of facial expression kinda bad acting
Sep 7 2020,negative,not for the little ones make no mistake this is a war movie although disney went out of their way to make the combat relatively bloodless the impaling of soldiers and breaking of bones is pretty graphic a well earned pg13 rating
Sep 7 2020,negative,the story isnt told with any real freshness the english being spoken was said with a kind of stilted archaic tone it was actually embarrassing sort of like listening to a stereotypical 1930s hollywood studio idea of how white people think the chinese would speak english the action was very thin and boring i guess there was no money for extras the idea that mulan is born with abilities and is special makes no sense in the true mulan legend shes an ordinary girl who saves her emperor theres nothing special about the movie
Sep 7 2020,negative,great effort to rip a disneys classic rubbish
Sep 7 2020,negative,im not going to act like the original was a master piece but everything it did right they completely ereased in this  a great female lead that had to overcome adversities lets make her a mary sue  supporting characters with personality lets make them completely boring generic ones  a not always funny magical character lets replace it with a silent bird  songs that instrumental to show the feelings of a character remove them what the character is going through internally is not important  scenes that made you care about the characters ie mulan putting on the armor and running away gone    avoid this piece of crap like the covid19
Sep 7 2020,positive,enjoyed by the entire family young and old visually it was just beautiful i would recommend it to anyone
Sep 7 2020,negative,i was looking forward to this movie as the original is one of my childhood favorites unfortunately the original has more heart in the first 20 minutes than this entire movie hopefully the 2050 remake is better
Sep 7 2020,positive,well acted choreographed and visually stunning  i thought they left a little on the table where they could have gone deeper with dialogue and character development
Sep 7 2020,neutral,pretty casting but lack of character development colorful scenes but poor choreograph and screenwriting leaving awkward moment for some scenes 2 hours of movie nothing surprising as each moment is predictable and knew what its going to be with the animated version still strongly prefer the animated version
Sep 7 2020,negative,what were they thinking this movie is so dry of emotion and drive that enabled the first movies success totally not worth a 30 purchase 
Sep 7 2020,negative,the removal of the pole scene where mulan uses her wits and newfound skills to climb the pole signifying her transition from girl posing as a soldier to soldier alone would even ruin the original film    but to for some reason make mulan a super powered little girl from the word go absolutely kills this films capacity to even tell a heros story because if you have no strife to overcome then what on earth are you overcoming    mulan shows us that disney has no idea how to make a movie anymore and even worse no idea how to make a strong female protagonist      they only know how to manufacture mary sues  they did this with rei in star wars which was almost handled well but immediately botched in the first 10 seconds of the 2nd movie      folks talk about the removal of mushu and while the lack of comic relief wasnt alone a killer in this movie it is a detriment     every ingredient in this film is wrong  from character design character choices character growth there was none and all this so we can kill our main badguy on screen     even the chosen setpieces and the makeup makes no sense  i can see the eyeliner on our mongual horde leader are you serious  the makeup is obvious the effects are subpar and someone over at disney needs to take a physics lesson      ive never been more disappointed in a film
Sep 7 2020,negative,was excited but didnt make me feel anything 劉亦菲is cute so theres that
Sep 7 2020,negative,its not for the people that grew up with the animated version its not for the chinese because they already have the 2009 version which is more true to its story its definitely not for kids it has no disney magic its boring as hell theres no character development and their excuse was they wanted to keep it realisticwhere the f did the witch come from they got rid of the dragon but put a pointless ass phoenix  ijust dont get it
Sep 7 2020,negative,i expected no less from disney but still managed to be disappointed no humor no songs or the disney feel to it if it didnt have the name mulan as its title then it would have been just another mediocre movie at best forgettable but not terrible but for a live action remake of the beloved classic mulan absolute trash save your money and 2 hours of your life that youll never get back i mean i dont know how else to convey it but man was it awful
Sep 7 2020,negative,every moment that made this movie powerful is simply ignored by this remake ok so no mushu because this was going to be realistic but theres magic a witch what the hell the action looks bad the acting is not that good the pacing is awful and at the end you just dont understand who thought that the script they used was any good idea and the director only makes it worse what a disappointment
Sep 7 2020,positive,beautifully shot and great take on the story im a huge disney fan that is not usually a fan of the live action remakes but mulan breaks the mold for me
Sep 7 2020,positive,truly enjoyed the film
Sep 7 2020,negative,i found the film weak with weak characters
Sep 7 2020,negative,terribly paced soulless and messy film i had was looking forward to the release just to be completely disappointed with the direct disney took with the character such a bore dont waste your money or time on this trash
Sep 7 2020,positive,i watch every disney remake without comparing to the original mulan was a movie i hadnt seen in decades and this one had a serious tone action and kept you engaged it was a good movie that i would recommend but definitely disneyfied in its plot
Sep 7 2020,negative,mulan is one of my all time favorites but this version was disappointing they spent too much time on this new witch character and didnt have any other character development with the men she fights alongside they easily could have kept mushu in the movie if they would have gotten rid of the phoenix dont even get me started on how horrible the fighting scenes were donnie yen is an incredibly gifted fighter yet they barely even show him the fighting was that of old cheesy kungfu movies where people can apparently run up down and along walls because whats gravity overall very disappointing dont waste your money or time on this one
Sep 7 2020,neutral,pacing felt off questionable editing choices costumes were on point and the cinematography had some good moments
Sep 7 2020,positive,great movie waited for so long to watch 
Sep 7 2020,neutral,laughably bad acting and special effects particularly given the huge budget for this film some of the tweaks to the plot left the storyline falling flat there was no buildup or excitement when mulan finally started succeeding at her training nor in the ending battle scene it was just boring i also thought it was strange that this remake removed some of the fantastical elements from the animated version mushu etc to make it more realistic yet instead heavily focused the magical concept of chi akin to the force in star wars just very disappointed in this version
Sep 7 2020,positive,beautiful land action packed where they went wrong was in the attempt to distance themselves from the animated classic they didnt take advantage of the scenes that truly pull on the heart strings totally worth the price deserved to be seen on the big screen hopefully after covid well get a chance to see it in a dolby theater 
Sep 7 2020,positive,this is the only mulan version that ive seen and i thoroughly enjoyed it along with three other adults i noticed many reviewers are comparing various versions thank goodness im not influenced by the past as some seem to be
Sep 7 2020,negative,took everything that made the original great and threw it in the bin  replacing it with boring characters and zero emotional attachment
Sep 7 2020,positive,mulan was excellent and well worth the 30 dollars to watch it early the movie felt magical from the second it started to the very end while i will agree that some of the cg was less than fantastic the actual plot and story of the movie was great i love how well they show woman power and how mulan was never powerful enough until she accepted the fact and shared the fact that she was a woman the witch also realized it was worth it to follow a strong respectable woman than someone who was a jerk to her i also like the fact that we got to watch fighting scenes without really any gore it was an easy watch and i will definitely be watching it again
Sep 7 2020,negative,it wasokay  it lacked the fun and flair of the animated version  effect style was irritating and unexpected to see in a disney movie  imho there wasnt much there to draw young viewers to the disney brand
Sep 7 2020,negative,movie was too serious i only smiled when i heard the music but other than that it was me trying so hard to like to the movie but couldnt
Sep 7 2020,negative,meh  writing not that great  nothing new  nice special effectes
Sep 7 2020,negative,it was boring the magic of the animated version was lost in this one
Sep 7 2020,negative,bad casting bad story dont waste your time
Sep 7 2020,positive,its fine and is the best of these live action remake but feels dated and foreign  like best bollywood film 2000 ever made
Sep 7 2020,positive,i have been waiting for this disney remake since they first started announcing them a few years back  i was glad it wasnt like the ones before where it was verbatim the cartoon  although i did miss mushu
Sep 7 2020,negative,remake of shaolin soccer mashed up with kung fu hustle
Sep 7 2020,negative,the makers did not know the true essence of the original mulan cgi is weird acting is lukewarm it replaced everything that made disneys mulan animation great and produced a boring forced live action
Sep 7 2020,positive,some of the best scenes were beautiful and the action was well done but character development was not great and the story fell a little flat 
Sep 7 2020,negative,i am exceedingly disappointed by the fact that disney released this monstrosity of a remake no songs no correlation to the original plot this was the absolute worst movie that disney has ever released boring monotone im in shock you had a recipe that has proven successful and you made something else and its terrible
Sep 7 2020,negative,the effect movement sound and the view is amazing but the action of the main actor mulan is kinda bad  this is the most disappointed point of the movie
Sep 7 2020,positive,this live action mulan focuses on mulan and her journey as a warrior it is inspiring and it teaches many valuable lessons i highly recommend watching it
Sep 7 2020,positive,beautiful to watch solid theme and perfectly cast
Sep 7 2020,positive,my daughter and i were fortunate to watch it on the big screen she loved the movie so much as did i beautifully shot and emotionally engaging its not perfect but entertaining so catch it if you can
Sep 7 2020,negative,if you love cringeworthy unrealistic action moments you know the kind that look as glaringly animated as they areand you hate watching characters grow and develop meaningful relationshipsyoull enjoy this movie more than i did i miss the days when action didnt have to be fantasticaland that was ok because the tension didnt come from people catching arrows and morphing into birdsit came from how much we cared about the characters it was hard to care about mulan when she couldnt have had more than twenty lines in this movie i wanted to see her bond with new friends in the military learn to use her intelligence to compensate for lack of physical strength struggle with her exile and identitybut those things were quickly andor superficially addressed i give it two stars because it looked pretty when it didnt look animated
Sep 7 2020,positive,loved it the story line was great and instead of a mouthy dragon the pheanix was more symbolic of the time
Sep 7 2020,positive,the movie balanced the fan service needed to remind me of why i loved the original along with a stronger story that gave us a fully developed protagonist and antagonist
Sep 7 2020,negative,disappointing it was cheesy and the dialogue predictable the visuals and fight scenes were cool but overall we were extremely disappointed not worth the money
Sep 7 2020,positive,i thought the movie was sensational 
Sep 7 2020,positive,this movie was awesome i like the story line kept me interested and the fight scenes were great for a disney movie
Sep 7 2020,positive, i recommend watching it without comparing it to the animated version the two are different  but in a good way
Sep 7 2020,positive,this is by far the best of the disney remakes the story is very similar to the animated version but takes some new direction   the songs and mushu are missing but as you watch the movie you can see that there was no place for songs or a comic relief like mushu fortunately we still have the animated version for that  loved this movie
Sep 7 2020,negative,help me to understand why there is no mushu and little to no character development and fairly weak writing its like disney wanted to make a martial arts movie with a female superhero instead of doing a live action movie of their classic animated mulan sorely disappointed disney sorely disappointed and to top it all off i spent 30 to be this disappointedsmh
Sep 7 2020,positive,this movie hold its own on the pedestal of classics
Sep 7 2020,negative,the movie is bad from beginning to end the great thing about mulan is that she was a woman who manages to improve herself and uses her intelligence to stay in the army she was not strong nor did she have extraordinary abilities but her courage and will take her to learn everything she needed instead in this movie she is born with these abilities no other woman could have achieved that instead of empowering women weakens them the message is only if you are born with powers can you succeed
Sep 7 2020,positive,i like the animated version as well but im also a fan of chinese movies like crouching tiger hidden dragon and hero  i didnt miss the songs but did enjoy the score of this new disney version  the actors acting action special effects costumes direction  and story were all excellent
Sep 7 2020,negative,unpolished cringy martial arts  too much corny cliches  speeches every aspect of the movie from script logic  chemistry seems to fall apart in the movie hate it
Sep 7 2020,negative,the chi the witch and the kung fu were all unnecessary its like the legend of mulan was so big for the writers they needed to give her some kind of super power to show how great she is  changing the name of the mongols and editing the voice of jet li were also weird
Sep 7 2020,positive,not having seen the animated version this has beautiful cinematography  scenery whether vfx or real story wise already well told performances are varied flat pan delivery by the supporting veterans but li yifei is good and so is her kinda love interest and the comical fat kid most notable is her father who resembles my old friend tony chan hahaha action sequences adequate entertaining but not outstanding
Sep 7 2020,positive,i agree that i kinda liked the animation better but this is a very beautiful and moving movie i wish it was a bit longer and has more story to it i kinda like a series out of it
Sep 7 2020,positive,i liked that it still followed the basic structure of mulan but wasnt a total rehash either
Sep 7 2020,negative,horrible movie do not waste your money boring
Sep 7 2020,positive,i think a lot of the backlash this movie is faced with are external factors politics completely not representative of the production and quality of this movie this was such a great movie i was crushed that mushu my dear dragon wasnt going to be in the movie but it was fine it was implied and i absolutely loved it regardless give it a try it wont disappoint
Sep 7 2020,negative,the music was amazing the acting was good the fights were decent but the story is just stale plain and dull it was too simple and was executed badly in fact it was a watereddown version of the animated film removing instead of adding    mulan having chi appears to have robbed her of any character development whatsoever and does not fit quite well her expert skills are robbed of their worth if she was born with it nobody likes a mary sue they wish to see their character grow from their actions and build up their skills    the actors did well it was the script that failed them most people who dislike this movie actually dislike the main actress ideology not the movie the ones who like it are mostly bots that disney deployed in an attempt to cover it    the humour was severely lacking as the few humour scenes it had been underwhelming it was numerous in the animated version and actually complimented the tension    the side characters have also lacked any character development as well they were crucial to the plot in the first animated version and the main characters in the second    what was most atrocious about the film was the removal of mushu everyones favourite dragon who made them laugh cry and cheer at his actions replacing him with a phenoix that is basically a glorified cheerleader who didnt add anything to the story at all    the heelfaceturn of the witch lady was by far the worst plot point the way it built up was so stale you could use it as concrete her end was also not very poetic either they should have her willingly be killed by mulan mulan who sees no other choice has to accept that    even the boss fight was anticlimatic and boring the only fight that was worth watching was the battle scene disney had more money than it could hold and should have spent it more on improving the scenes the fact that 200 million was spent on this movie makes this even more confusing considering how weak it was    all in all it was a subpar movie carried by its music and nothing else i hope disney learns that to make a good movie you have to put in the effort not money    edit found out this was a film in concentration camps they even thanked them in the credits why disney
Sep 7 2020,positive,i enjoyed the action and actors live action success
Sep 7 2020,negative,the message of this movie is the exact opposite of the previous one listen  children either you are born as a jedi or you are not and you will spend the rest of your life performing  menial tasks no matter what hard you try only the chosen ones  reach the top  disney is trying desperately to join the women empowerment movement but its obvious they  do not have the slightest clue what that even is the princess mentality of being born special is deeply rooted in disney the result is often comical when they end up with a frankenstein mix of their old self and their desperate effort to keep up with the times
Sep 7 2020,positive,great story yifei does mulan so much justice
Sep 7 2020,negative,liu yifeis acting is too bad
Sep 7 2020,positive,its really excellent adaptation of hua mulan legend my kids all totally immersed into the movie    one thing is bugging me the characters should be converse in chinese not english
Sep 7 2020,negative,the costume and prop designs looked strange and inaccurate this movie is a bastardized western view of ancient china
Sep 7 2020,negative,my honest opinion on mulan its boring the fight choreography is great bombastic and full of energy like any good martial arts movie should since it focused much more on mulan knowing how to fightbut thats it everything else was bland the acting was extremely stiff and had almost no emotion or i should say real emotion to it the actors could act but it was more like play dialog and not with the passion or fervor of a good play     comparing it to the animated adaptation of the story it doesnt have the same heart the animated movie just had its story down and told it not only better but in a more interesting way that both respected chinese culture but made people more aware of it both negatives and positives    all in all its like a 255 and it only ranks that high because of the choreography and set design
Sep 7 2020,negative,waste of time i did have high hopes but left completely disappointed
Sep 7 2020,negative,in conclusion its horrible   barely funny moments   pathetic fight scenes that remember you to bad jacky chan films   incredibly bad story telling decisions for example by introducing witchcraft called chi   doesnt come close to the original disney mulan film    i recommend not to waste any money on it you will be disappointed
Sep 7 2020,positive,i fell in love with the heroine
Sep 7 2020,positive,i enjoyed the movie
Sep 7 2020,negative,a waste of time little character development and a boring way to tell a great story
Sep 7 2020,positive,phoenix is so beautiful
Sep 7 2020,positive,if you want an honest opinion free from politics it was accually a good popcorn movie som silly fun jokes a well casted mulan    cool scens and a lovely eviroment and nature    would definetly recommend to you who dont care about political things and just want a good movie
Sep 7 2020,negative,no intensity all the dramatic scenes from the original are rushed in the new one seems like a really rushed movie
Sep 7 2020,negative,doesnt worth the money and time watching it complete garbage
Sep 7 2020,positive,best disney live action adaptation
Sep 7 2020,positive,definitely disneys best adaption of a class to live action yet special mention to liu yifei for the amazing portrayal of mulan which certainly was a tremendous challenge also probably going to watch it again with more friends
Sep 7 2020,negative,the army of both sides was like a joke they repeat loyal bracce true again and again for nothing the characters lack depth and the appearance of a few characters is redundant
Sep 7 2020,positive,best adaptation of mulan in the world so far love the exciting fighting scenes fantastic surround sound cgi color beautiful scenery acting skills and the moral messages  dislike the rush should be a 25 hours film
Sep 7 2020,negative,put aside politics the movie itself is a very bad adaptation of the original story the choreography is boring any modernday hong kong movies can make better battlefight scenes yet the worst part about mulan 2020 is it betrayed the original idealogy of the mulan story leading character chose to join the army not because of her love for her father and family but based on what she replies to gong lis role its her duty to serve the emperor and country wtf the direction of writing is very likely influenced or requested by the china authority to fit chinas censorship but storywise it just doesnt work and make me sick very difficult to sit through the whole film
Sep 7 2020,neutral,found it hard to relate since each character line sounds a bit off not natural at all some characters are introduced in a way that is too straight forward keep an eye on that guy cricket the action scenes feel too edited really far from an asian movie like ip man also there is a lot of cheesy scenes that take from the little realism you feel at times there is a battle for china but there is no drop of blood in the whole thing
Sep 7 2020,negative,well its different from disney other remake but different doesn not mean good its probably  a casual watch on big tv screen but dont expect much
Sep 7 2020,negative,look at the main actress face there is no feeling  changing through the movie
Sep 7 2020,negative,wow that was such a bad movie and i had low expectations my wife and i actually had to take breaks just to digest watching the whole thing the whole film had no memorable characters and was edited so choppily scenes just seem to happen haphazardly  at one point we just burst out laughing cause the character hopped on a horse and teleported miles away behind the enemies all of a sudden im embarrassed for disney
Sep 7 2020,positive,i just watched this with my daughter and believe me she was clapping a lot it was just so refreshing such a positive feel good movie inspiring movie do not read the negative reviews these people are just bored and have nothing to do but say negative things about a really good film who doesnt want women empowerment girls kids adults people of all ages would love this movie and to those who are pointing out facts whoever said this waa based on a true stoey its just funny people this is fiction movie the most beautiful film of the year so far for my family definitely amazing watch this and you will feel good
Sep 7 2020,neutral,it was a good watch but i feel like they tried to combine the animated movie and live action version and it just turned out kind of corny i think with disney classics like this they either need to stay true to the animated version or take a more realistic approach to it combining them did not work out well in my opinion also the graphics were horrible like low budget hallmark movie bad it was the first thing i noticed and it stuck out the entire time
Sep 7 2020,negative,the liveaction mulan is actually not benefiting from its renewed version missing the energy provided by the songs and layer of humor which were very present in the animated version its plot feels rather generic and execution doesnt get much flair of originality making mulan feel like the poormans crouching tiger hidden dragon
Sep 7 2020,negative,disney took the magic humor and charm that made mulans animation so great and turned it into a empty flat and boring wirefu film that might keep some people entertained but in the end it will not justify the existence of this live action
Sep 7 2020,negative,as a fan of disney movies and being raised watching all  the classics i got to watch those new real adaptations of movies that i loved when i was a kid some adaptions are ok like beauty and the beast and aladdin  bit after watching the new mulan my only thoughts are disney why the fk are doing this to this classic   not only the new movie doesnt follow the original story but even if it was a regular chinese movie it would be one of the worst ive seen  the new movie was so shallow that it couldnt even translate the values and ideas the original movie succeeded to do meaning how women can succeed and be strong within a world among men and the struggle they have to go through  last but not least disney should really be ashamed to make people pay a premium access to watch this kind of mediocre adaption this might be the end of the disney i used to know  disappointed
Sep 7 2020,positive,good to watch as a standalone movie but was a disappointment compared to the 1998 animated mulan pacing felt clunky and rushed while there were great visuals and big names i didnt feel a strong connection to the characters or see notable character development from an american perspective the concept of a strong female warrior in this film felt weak compared to the animated version which is unfortunate considering this day and age roughly 20 years later personally did not like the addition of mulan having chi it took away from the idea of success through hard work and clever wits of a normal person not blessed with supernatural ability in addition how disney handled the witchs ending felt cliche and like a copout
Sep 7 2020,positive,action is beautiful but the director should include some joy in the movie
Sep 7 2020,neutral,a visually stunning but cheesy film    from the beginning we see and hear of this phoenix guardian that is supposed to protect mulan but i did not realize it would be a supporting actor in the film    also 30 not worth it    i made a rotten tomatoes account just to review this film because it was so bad
Sep 7 2020,negative,pure garbage not powerful as the original one close to the legend or a good movie on his own
Sep 7 2020,positive,loved everything about this movie imagery was awesome and it was well shot would watch it again
Sep 7 2020,negative,where are all the memorable characters did they just make a whole live action movie just for the moral message remake a beloved movie when theyd better have made another movie with another name and be done with it
Sep 7 2020,negative,terrible movie it was so boring hated the over used of colour and make up in the village scenes  i have never seen a chinese movie where girls wore make up like that was that the directors   attempt at making it magical the movie was not funny its so different from the original that everyone loved growing up the tone of the movie was not disney at all if this wasnt branded disneys mulan i would of thought it was just some average main land chinese movie what a waste of 200 million dollars
Sep 7 2020,negative,for me it spat in mulans legacy the photography the symmetry the contrast of colours is flawless but it leaves a lot to wish in the script  the mere fact that mulans prowess in battle was because of her gift and not achievement challenges the core of the story stating that she made it because she was born special not that any girl can get to the same  the lack of failure at the beginning of the training is disappointing as a viewer it teaches no lesson of resiliency and not giving up that epic moment when shang dismisses her and in the morning she throws the arrow at his feet that for many of us girls and boys meant you have to keep going until you make it  after the battle when she comes back and is given the leadership of the army just because it tastes poor all the its a woman she will never worth anything and making them swallow their words is lost to me that without counting the love interest that could be or could be not present and all would have been the same
Sep 7 2020,negative,i feel like they changed things that didnt need to be changed it was already a great movie why does she need chi its not a super hero movie
Sep 7 2020,positive,it was better than i had expected  after reading the audience reviews i really didnt have high hopes but i thought it was reasonably entertaining  my wife absolutely loved it and the kids thought it was pretty good  it was really nice to look at though the colors were a little too disney bright  a lot of people complain about the acting and that was probably one the weakest parts the acting did feel a little kung fu movieish at times  i also thought that mulan and some of the others felt more like jedi knights with all the flying around and catching arrows n stuff  overall it was a decent movie with some nice emotional parts that made my wife cry
Sep 7 2020,positive,once you rid yourself of expectations from the animated version and stop comparing the two it was a great film that differed in the right ways and still stayed true to its message
Sep 7 2020,neutral,what an absolute waste of time another live action disney remake of a good and enjoyable movie into some boring and useless dross    not worth the extra money to get through disney    waste of time avoid until its on freetoair dont pay for this garbage
Sep 7 2020,positive,i love the movie it gave great depth to the movie even tho mushu wasnt in the movie and the comical wasnt there i believe the movie was well groomed the actors and actresses did there job and did a great job gong li was wonderful i love her and donnie yen was superb he always is in whatever movie he plays in then jet li as the emperor was phenomenal as always i cant remember how to spell the actress that plays mulan but damn she was a warrior in her own right and did mulan justice so all in all mulan made me cry and i love a movie that can make me cry everyone did a damn good job i give it 2 thumbs up
Sep 7 2020,negative,this is an awful movie both in the context of a disney remake and as a standalone movie very poor character development poor supporting cast around mulan and generically bad villains there is so much wrong with this movie from the story pacing and tone that makes it almost unbearable to watch at moments i know disney remakes can be hit or miss but make sure you save yourself the time and money and miss this one disney should be ashamed of itself to charge monthly paying disney  members an additional 30 for this movie it is wrong to begin with but you add in how bad this movie is and it is absolutely a shameful money grab disney should  offer refunds to anyone who bought this as this would be a film i can see some people walking out of at the theater
Sep 7 2020,negative,what was fun and enjoyable from the animated film is completely non existent here what people say is a visual spectacle feels like a cheap english dubbed crouching tiger hidden dragon which i also didnt like and missing the mark on the feminine themes its so blatantly missing
Sep 7 2020,positive,mulan is a great movie its beautifully filmed and is filled with what i call interesting action acrobatics trick riding and clever schemes there are many magical fantasy elements you dont have to be familiar with disneys animated version to understand what is going on i think disney was smart to not make this into a musical 
Sep 7 2020,positive,i dont know whats wrong with everyone it was good
Sep 7 2020,negative,the worst movie ever
Sep 7 2020,positive,enjoyable if its your first time following the story of mulan but if you watched the original animated version there wont be much suspense since you know every step of the plot    while the theme of being true to yourself and female power is overdone the last few years its saved by blending it with more unique and less explored east asian values of family honor and devotion to family  this is probably the films strongest point    i expected a lot more spectacle from the action sequences  this film had the potential and the resources to make an epic action movie with incredible martial arts actors like jet li and donny yen but they completely wasted it  the action sequences were choppy and lacking in creativity  any standard kong fu martial arts flick will have more entertaining fight scenes  the fight scenes cant even hold up a candle to films like matrix reloaded or say any jackie chan film    i also felt the editing was terrible probably a result of mistakes when shooting  there were huge visual gaps in the action sequences  it happened quite a lot but one of the more egregious examples is when she hops on her horse on one side of the enemy lines and then next cut someone magically is behind enemy lines crouching behind a boulder it just felt really disorienting weird and left me wondering how the hell do they not show even a glimpse of the process    im all for having female directors but i think disney made a mistake not hiring someone with a martial arts directing background  would like to have seen this movie made be ang lee or someone like that  i think it could have been 10 times more epic    overall i think its a mediocre film at best  could be a fun movie to watch if you have kids but really could and should have been better
Sep 7 2020,negative,its basically the same situation where the movie producer just throw in well known actors and actresses and hopefully itll be good theres no humor too damn serious the tension is always there and it made me feel like i need to take break just horrible movie the dialog and story was just terrible
Sep 7 2020,positive,unlike previous liveaction remakes of beloved disney animated films mulan does not rely heavily on the nostalgia factor for success but instead makes a strong case for its existence by enriching the story introduced in the original 1998 film     as the remake is intended to be more faithful to the chinese poem on which it is based it offers a more nuanced exploration of traditional confucian values than the animated film the twofold advantage of this is that it allows disney to tell a thematically resonant disney story in a manner that respects chinese culture and flesh out mulan in ways that the 1998 film could not     mulans heros journey revolves around four confucian values in particular  loyalty bravery truth and filial piety or as the film calls it devotion to family much of her inner conflict comes from her struggle to embody all of these values at once and this is successfully captured by liu yifei lius range is demonstrated in her ability to shift seamlessly between the different facets of her character from being a tenacious warrior on the battlefield to being a devoted daughter to her father and a strong woman     the characterization of mulan is another welcome change made by the 2020 remake key turning points in her transformation play out differently this time round but these changes reinforce the aforementioned themes and make the film more empowering and impactful this version of mulan is without a doubt the most compelling character from a liveaction disney remake to date    one issue with the film is that some of niki caros stylistic choices distance you from the action and emotions when they should be doing the opposite battle scenes for instance lack a certain punch due to the use of quick cuts and caros choice of shot anglessizes its a bit of a shame that these scenes do not do a good job of showcasing the talents of the cast who also happen to be skilled martial artists in real life similarly caros decisions in quieter and more poignant scenes can cause you to feel detached from the characters and events when you should be fully invested in them     while these missteps do hold mulan back from excellence they do not undermine disneys commendable attempts to make a familiar tale even better
Sep 7 2020,negative,this is so boring and bad movie im will cancel my disney plus cos this stay away from this movie
Sep 7 2020,negative,terrible they have changed all the original story plus the chroma key effects are way too poor for a disney movie it looks like a cheap tv movie
Sep 7 2020,positive,nonspoiler review    i went into this movie with high expectations i loved mulan 1998 i didnt know it at the time but i was ready to pick this movie apart i was even critiquing the movie as it was playing which forced my wife to say stop you are ruining the movie i never do this in a movie theater but times have changed this mulan never had a chance the plot character development pacing dialogue musical score visuals and climax did not sit well with me i just wanted more it couldve been better i needed it to be better     movies are the ultimate first date you watch it once you hate it and never watch it again but mulan meant too much and i couldnt let go i was disappointed but it wasnt terrible by any means naturally i became obsessed i debriefed by watching and reading reviews i took advantage of the premier access and skipped to parts i hated and rewatched this film in its entirety a second time     im glad i did     mulan is still the young woman who took her fathers place in the army she must fit in with the army and fight an enemy while not revealing who she really is while much of the story is the same this mulan faces a different character challenge this mulan is not focused on her identity and selfworth you will not find any dialogue based on my reflection the internal conflict mulan faces is being someone she is not and how it holds her back from becoming the true warrior she and everyone needs her to be this layers more complexity from the original and really sets up the audience for a tough training camp experience quite nicely     this movie improves upon themes of communal acceptance and female empowerment the characters are in full control over key decisions and are not victims to the situation new character xianniang works well with pushing mulans character forward and overall chemistry is good the fatherdaughter relationship feels more moving in liveaction than it does animated the new sister character allows us to see mulan with no guard up this mulan is much more muted and reserved in public which makes sense for the time the cinematography and visual effects were meant for the big screen its a beautiful movie and it was really meant to be seen in theaters its very apparent if you dont have a widescreen setup it explains why some visuals just feel a little off    the biggest problem with the movie is the source and execution of mulans potential its a key part of the movie from beginning to end although mulan isnt a superhero film some edits make it feel like a marvel film its never properly explained no rules limits or leveling is established and is inconsistent throughout the movie its a distraction in the climactic scene and diffuses any danger we feel for mulan the climactic scene is also the poorest constructed scene too many new ideas intersecting with little setup it feels anticlimactic after watching this scene again i have less problems with it but its still very convoluted and challenging for audiences    supportive character development is poor and doesnt set up the audience to care for these characters in battle their relationship to mulan is not firmly established and it feels more like they are colleagues than brothersinarms we are left to assume they are close instead of shown pacing and delivery of some dialogue is off and falls flat the score doesnt feel as epic as the movie should feel in certain moments     mulan is a true reinterpretation it might not be saying much but mulan is one of the best liveaction adaptations from disney no it doesnt deliver the same feelings or messages as the original its not a perfect movie but it shouldnt have to be for you to enjoy it and even love it you just need to get past its animated predecessor shadow
Sep 7 2020,negative,they added characters and took out the best character ugh another disney remake ruined
Sep 7 2020,positive,exhilarating wellacted and empowering mulan 2020 brings honor to us all by offering a unique retelling of its beloved animated counterpart thats different in story tone and execution but still retains its spirit
Sep 7 2020,negative,if i laughed or cried it was always for the wrong reason at no point did i feel contentment when the credits rolled my only emotion was relief which rapidly turned to rage this film was a shameful undertaking
Sep 7 2020,positive,i absolutely loved it  loved it  perfect
Sep 7 2020,negative,what an actual shitshow stale superhero y chinese shilly just not my cup of tea some parts were interesting which bumped it up to 2 stars
Sep 7 2020,negative,absolutely terrible not fun to watch at all
Sep 7 2020,positive,my family and i were really surprised by how much we enjoyed this movie  disney basically created a slightly more grownup version of the cartoon movie and really gave it some good girl power and moral fiber without being preachy  multiple thumbs up
Sep 7 2020,positive,this iswithout a doubtcuttingedge film making
Sep 7 2020,positive,visually stunning a moving tale with wonderful fight scenes this remake is well deserved my daughter and i loved every minute
Sep 7 2020,negative,pacing of this movie was poor it tried to show the pretty costumes and fights while forgetting any character development
Sep 7 2020,negative,not like the animated version  no music no mushu no shang cricket made in to a man an added sister no grandma  idk just not what we were expecting kids werent interested at all
Sep 7 2020,negative,this film was disappointing and boring the characters were bland the only good one was xian lang who later died which was disappointing then we have no mushu like what and mulan who was also very bland overall this film was honestly a d
Sep 7 2020,negative,in addition to removing the songs that were in the original they also stripped out the heart emotion and character development which actually made it feel more unrealistic than the animated version
Sep 7 2020,positive,i loved mulan i felt it perfectly balanced its need to create a new story while hearkening back to the original animated film it really was live action in the sense that real people were really acting i also enjoyed the diverse group of excellent asian actors i highly recommend this movie
Sep 7 2020,positive,we actually really enjoyed it perhaps seeing the audience reviews at only 55 we were expecting worse but we felt that some of the cast did a really good job the action beautiful and the end result enjoyable to watch my 10 yr old daughter was happy to see an asian woman heroine and she actually liked the more serious tone and action sequences we all loved the nods to the original cartoon version and were happy to see some traditional chinese wire work included which we feel is integral to chinese mythology took off one star because it was a little rushed and sugary at the end although we loved the sword delivery but wasnt sure about the historical accuracy of those weird round villages also felt that the emperor jet li could have done a little more in his scene with the bad guy well danny yen could have been used more too solid four stars from our family
Sep 7 2020,negative,didnt include major characters from the original excluded the major original soundtrack made it boring and disappointing that it was nothing close to the sheer charm of the original
Sep 7 2020,positive,best movie ive seen all year mulan was fierce and amazing
Sep 7 2020,negative,why do they feel the need to change classics and make them strictly worse so many plot holes with such clumsy writing   why didnt the witch just catch the arrow why didnt the bad guy just kill the emperor howd the bad guys suddenly stop being elite warriors that could be easily beaten by the ragtag new guys that didnt even finish their training and have next to no real world experience fighting just really poorly written not a terrible execution but with a disney budget they couldve done a lot better
Sep 7 2020,positive,ok so im going to begin with saying i really enjoyed this live version i think its different enough from the original and ive no problem with that mulan is my third favorite princess so i had fun watching this film however it has a lot of issues this film lacks the humanity that made the original film so special this is for sure a disney film the battle scenes are pretty bad executed and some of the martial arts choreography could it been so much better and some of the edition was not great this film could it been as good as hero house of flying daggers or crouching tiger hidden dragon which are some of my favorite chinese films and it wanted to be that but sadly it cut shot and it didnt reach that potential now as a chinese tale i do love the spirit of this film the characterization of mulan who in the liveaction version has a much greater sense of duty to her family and her father in the animated film mulan went to war in part because she didnt feel comfortable in the role she was meant to play at home in this new movie mulan goes to war to protect her father and you can feel that which reflects the original theme of the ballad which it rumor to be made in the era of northern wei research the ballad of mulan that in addition to the concept of qi chi makes the liveaction version of mulan more of a story about honor than female empowerment and potentially more honoring to the chinese traditions if you go in with no expectations know that its a fun film to experience and so glad we did i missed the songs but i love the hints we got through the movie about them and i do missed mushu but the cinematography is beautiful and the music score is spot on overall i enjoyed the film not in my top 5 disney films but still fun to watch
Sep 7 2020,negative,this movie is bad very bad from actor story everything
Sep 7 2020,negative,empty lifeless and boring no emotion and songs just a sad sad remake
Sep 7 2020,negative,i was really looking forward to this movie i was extremely let down i dont ever write reviews for movies if you are a disney fan and enjoy the original mulan dont even bother watching this nothing against the actors but the writers and director should be ashamed at what they have put out 
Sep 7 2020,negative,a painful laborious bore of a film its symptomatic of how much film making has deteriorated in just the last 20 years by contrasting this mess with the original it copies stripped back story plot holes contrived set up of events and then cgi splashed all over it to try to distract from the mess its made for low demand audiences which seem to be all disney is capable of catering for 
Sep 7 2020,positive,the story was well done the movie visually stunning
Sep 7 2020,negative,one of the worse disney movies ive seen terrible dialog lazy character development and exaggerated character arcs all made for an underwhelming movie     im telling all of my friends to save their time really disappointed  disney youre out of touch
Sep 7 2020,positive,beautifully filmed  stunning visuals and great acting  yes this is different from the 1998 cartoon but is actually closer to the original chinese legend  great watch for a different take on mulan
Sep 7 2020,negative,omg it was so bland and it had so many cuts between takes that there were moment the action was barely discernible
Sep 7 2020,negative,nothing compared to the original dont even waste your time wheres the dragon and music
Sep 7 2020,positive,perhaps if more audience members could look past the need to be a killjoy whenever disney makes a remake they would see how great of a movie this is apart from the very apparent fake action the movie encapsulates everything you would want from a 2020 movie the music is out only because the seriousness of this film would be ruined by songs the same goes for mushu i loved mushu in the original mulan but with what disney was going for in this movie it just wouldnt make sense i love that they made cricket into a person and the movie overall was fantastic just because its a remake does not mean you have to hate it guys
Sep 7 2020,negative,nothing like the original very disappointing
Sep 7 2020,positive,pay no attention to the nit pickers and naysayers this is a grown up mulan perfect for the times sumptuous with some outstanding costumes and cinematography this movie showcases the international elements in chinese culture and values kudos to all involved and thanks to disney for making this movie available
Sep 7 2020,neutral,you would think or i suppose i foolheartly assumed that the decision to remove any musicality from the movie due to tone and sexist lyrics would mean an updated rich narrative that would captivate us in a much different way instead they kept the exact same chronology as the original movie but exised the good plot points and for someeee reason highlighted what i assumed they were trying to avoid  im honestly left wanting a musical number after almost every scene  if i never hear the word chi again it will be too soon
Sep 7 2020,negative,at no point in this absolute trainwreck did it at all encapsulate the story of mulan    first its billed as a more realistic retelling of the story of mulan this is a flat out insult to the entire audience within the very opening minutes we see fight scenes like that in an 80s kung fu movie now i get it jet li is in this movie but running on walls dancing in midair and generally denying physics wholesale is not more realistic they could have very easily named this movie crouching tiger hidden mushu disney somehow managed to make a live action film less realistic than a mid90s animated musical for children    at no point was there any character development of any kind no actual adversity to overcome no palpable refusal of mulan to bow to tradition for tradition sake a major theme of the animated version and the actual story its based on she literally decides to end her facade as a man after a 5 second conversation with the person trying to kill her and her compatriots characters are completely static throughout and do nothing to make the audience care about them in the slightest    the dialog was well there was very little of it id be surprised if even mulan had more than 50 lines in the entire script conversations were completely forced and the cast had very little onscreen chemistry    that all says nothing of the fact that the movie was littered with low budget green screening that failed miserably at immersing you in any kind of environment    this movie is an absolute abomination and one would do well to spend their money elsewhere
Sep 7 2020,positive,this was totally amazing i love how disney is putting a fresh positive spin to their remakes the cast was phenomenal every single one and they made the best choice to play mulan i will be adding this one to my collection highly recommended
Sep 7 2020,negative,bad actress with poor acting performances bad story
Sep 7 2020,positive,by far the best liveaction adaption disney has produced from any of its animated classics this movie hold its own on the pedestal of classics
Sep 7 2020,negative,shame on disney for ruining another movie trying so hard to please a western ideal of what authentic chinese means that the writers ended up pleasing neither western nor chinese audiences all this movie shows is a fundamental misunderstanding that corporate disney has of its audiences the costumes look fake the make up looks terrible the scenes all look fake
Sep 7 2020,positive,i thought the movie was amazing  dont believe the naysayers and decide for yourself  cinematically stunning and story beautifully depicted  im glad they didnt do a duplication of the original or make it a musical  best movie ive seen in awhile  good job disney
Sep 7 2020,negative,inferior to the original animated movie in basically every aspect less entertaining exciting funny emotionally investing weaker story telling and pacing bad character development   after the umpteenth bad remake of a good original the question remains why sadly the answer seems obvious not only is disney creativity bankrupt but not even capable of recreating moments of former glory adequately
Sep 7 2020,neutral,in terms of action cool fight scenes and special effects this movie mostly nails it there are some dope action scenes however the plot feels less engaging since it seems like mulan has already mastered most things and it takes itself too seriously gone are the songs and other things that made the original so much fun
Sep 7 2020,negative,not sure what to say all the bad points have been mentioned not worth the money
Sep 7 2020,negative,how did disney mess this up so much  to put it simply this is a movie that had such a high special effects budget that they revolved storyline and plots around justifying the use of these effectswhich is a problem  everything that made the original mulan great was just not there  they incorporated virtues like loyalty and honor into the movie yet they were not really substantiated by the film  like if you fail the training camp you get sent homeso why did mulan take her fathers place to save his life ifworst casehe would have been sent home  it doesnt make sense  but aside from plot holes weak character development and overall story development the worst element was turning mulan into a superhuman  she is in touch with her qi and that pretty much makes her invincible and everyone else relatively foolish      the original mulan is a classic for a few reasonsits character growth overcoming adversity and hardships through will and virtue touching scenes that hold critical value to the film while also being of pure artistic value like when mulan makes the choice to run away from home realistic and romantic ideals that many coming of age children will have and already have learned to appreciate a gruff villain with a simple relationship with the protagonist but one that drives the protagonist to overcome trials and tribulations some catchy musical numbers that add another depth and layer to an already fantastic and balanced animated film      the new mulan has none of this  characters are inherently either strong or not mulan was pretty much a superhero since being a child mulans growth an journey is dictated by a witch whose only real purpose is to add magical effects to things every other purpose being relatively impactless to the movie if you had them removed and the results of her transformation has no real relevance to the story she decides to come out as a woman still does what she could have done the whole time as a man gets kicked out of the army and then there is a 180 flip and its agreed shell lead the army because sheisa woman there are no heartbreaking or touching moments because though there were attempts at this the story line and character development makes alot of scenes seem forced or redundant and only existing so you could say this movie is mulan and not star wars rise of china the ideals and virtues are constant themes that hold no real purpose or value since the protagonist is already a super heroine who could probably beat up the antagonist immediately but fails because the movie would be too short if she didntand the romancecome on the villain makes little sense and is just the stereotypical crude male with anger issues and an abusive relationship with his almighty witch who has for some reason pledged loyalty to him no musical numbers or really anything to add any layers or polish to this film  what i will say though is that the special effects are fantastic  because as everyone knows the reason you buy a cake isnt for the taste of the cake but because the cake looks cool  acting was either stiff or good so ill give it to disney that the cast seems relatively decent to good but an actor can only save a movie to an extent with good acting     i would give this movie 0 out of 5 stars just because its such a let down given every opportunity and extensive budget it had
Sep 7 2020,negative,very disappointed no musicals no cricket no mushu no commander falling in love her name isnt ping make maker judge isnt the same no horse during battle training no visiting ancestors there is a witch in it and she turns into the enemies leader falcon and she ends up helping mulan which has zero correlation to the original movie the huns arent called the huns i could go on forever its the worst remake disney has done and makes me skeptical on watching more new remakes waiting so long and additional time due to covid for a shitty movie that is completely different from the original do not watch or buy they need to redo it again
Sep 7 2020,positive,i enjoyed it a lot it was different than the cartoon and that was ok with me i can enjoy them both for different reasons at a time when there is not much new to watch mulan is a breath of fresh air
Sep 7 2020,negative,lack luster movie that did not have any direction or character development was it a kids movie kung fu movie romance tons of changes from the original that were distasteful and meaningless
Sep 7 2020,negative,horrible remake  not worth it if you have disney plus just wait no mushu
Sep 7 2020,positive,beautiful to watch solid theme and perfectly cast
Sep 7 2020,negative,lack of charisma and poor script
Sep 7 2020,negative,a lack luster production that couldnt decide if it was a kids movie action movie kungfu movie or sci fi its in ability to follow a consistent theme leaves you as a viewer confused and not invested in any plot or character development
Sep 7 2020,negative,roughdont pay 30 once i realized that disney was going to go a different direction than the cartoon i decided to look at it as a standalone movie and it doesnt work my family is really into king fu movies and it doesnt work as a king fu movie its charmless there is no character development bad acting and needless amounts of exposition and lore which dont go anywhere set and costume design is beautiful but it seems like more of a focus than the actual plot 
Sep 7 2020,negative,another live action disappointment the story was anticlimactic and between the bland dialogue and music lacked emotion
Sep 7 2020,negative,horrid  original was a masterpiece this is a below average souless film that costs 30 and was designed by disney higher ups to make a quick buck and prey off of peoples nostalgia
Sep 7 2020,negative,much prefer the animated classic it achieved much more with less time     cgi in this was meh no mushu is sad phoenix was kind of pointless dragon replacement bori kahn sp was undeveloped as a villain didnt really feel all that menacing the witch felt like a forced element to the story didnt really add much but certainly used time that could have been better spent developing other supporting characters or the antagonist combat was a bit boring kicking the spear was cool the first time the 3rd time felt chorelike magical chi as the source of mulans powerabilities does a disservice to her character developing from a klutz to a skilled warrior is much more interesting than starting at level 100 but having to hide it key scenes like stumbling on the burnt village felt much less meaningful in this movie than in the animated version animated version was able to go from musical or mushu related highs to somber lows seamlessly whereas the live version was disjointed and emotionally monotone     ultimately animated version had more soul elicited more emotion and was just a better told story im looking forward to watching that one and will continue to do so the live action sadly will likely never be watched  again by this disney fan
Sep 7 2020,negative,horrible movie and it didnt even include mushu which made it even worse idk why i even bothered 
Sep 7 2020,negative,its an inferior version of the original its mulan but with all the interesting and fun bits taken out
Sep 7 2020,negative,was looking toward my favorite disney movie  totally disappointed  costume was bad  acting was bad some scenery looks so fake   story line has none of the  humor from the original mulan scripts and content was bad   dont waste your money
Sep 7 2020,positive,mulan is a beautiful movie i recommend watching it without comparing it to the animated version the two are different  but in a good way this live action mulan focuses on mulan and her journey as a warrior it is inspiring and it teaches many valuable lessons i highly recommend watching it
Sep 7 2020,negative,truly legendarily disappointed  i was so excited when i first heard they were making a liveaction mulan but all its hype did not live up to the expectation heres why and it does contain some spoiler  1a complete lack of character development and facial expression mulans character could have had so much potential along with her fellow soldiers but instead they all end up with as much emotional depth as a kitty pool  2 an astoundingly disappointing soundtrack seriously its mulan there are so many scenes that could have had legendary soundtracks that would have enthralled the audience instead we are left with vague subpar references to the greater soundtracks of the original   3 no transitional scenes mulan is here mulan is there mulan is everwere how did she get there no one knows   4 spoiler instead of mulan working her butt off to become this powerful woman she has this magical like chi really   5 spoler you can have magical chi energy but no mushu are you serious   6 unrealistic fight scenes that just did not make the cut yes they were pretty cool but they were far and few between with unrealistic stylized fight scenes and barely any lines from out characters  7 the bad guy simply was not that bad he was about as scary as a wet rag  overall terribly unimpressive the only beautiful thing about this entire movie was the scenery and filming which was truly breathtaking they turned a strong independent warrior badass into a blindly loyal honorbound woman whose actions you simply cannot comprehend  the dialogue character development and choice in storyline differences was underwhelming and left my whole family wishing we would have taken back those 2 hours
Sep 7 2020,negative,they have chopped many of the scenes and there is a partial nude scene which isnt quite family friendly the storywise the movie fail by spoiling all the charisma of the old animated classic by adding chei but the main problem is that its main 2 characters are lost by keeping it so connected with reality which would rather give some comic relief to the movie which the movie lacks  allover the movie will surely bore childrens and will not satisfy the adult with its 3rd act which is childish the villain arent that good
Sep 7 2020,positive,the film continues to disneys usual level unfortunately no song clips
Sep 7 2020,negative,poor dialogue  ever worse delivery throughout this movie never stopped disappointing skip this like a child support payment
Sep 7 2020,negative,bland acting unnecessary characters lines delivered in a robotic corny cringeworthy manner there was a man snoring behind me during the action sequence this should give you an idea on how bad it was dishonor doesnt even begin to describe how underwhelming this was beautiful scenes cool stunts and costumes but honestly thats about it absolutely livid with niki caro
Sep 7 2020,positive,i like it so much i should have the courage to change
Sep 7 2020,negative,if we dont count the horrible effects and the bad acting you can still see the bad plot distasteful characters bad references and overall horrible decisions that lead to this tragic movie besides the fact that a live action managed to be less believable than a animation making mulan a superhero instead of an warrior adding witch and then leaving the worst decisions ever
Sep 7 2020,positive,i do not understand for the life of me what movie some people watched because 56 audience score is ridiculous this movie was beautiful it showed young girls that nothing should stop you from greatness the cinematography was beautiful the story was inspiring a much better message than cinderella she was note vying for the affection of some prince mulan was a fierce warrior with a good heart she understood the importance of family honor highly recommend this movie my husband  i enjoyed it very much 
Sep 7 2020,negative,i dont even know where to begin with this movie this was in my opinion the worst disney box office movie i have ever seen the script writing was terrible with corny lines and lack of substance the visual effects were ok but considering that this was a disney movie with a huge budget it really shouldve been a lot better out of all the live action disney remakes so far not only was this the worst one but it doesnt compare to the amount of effort put into all the other live action remakes like the lion king aladdin jungle book etc its like producers didnt care about this movie the original mulan movie animated was a classic along with the story the music and the comedic relief by adding mushu this movie had none of that  the story was awful they failed to add any of the original music and there was zero comedic relief i get that they tried to go for a more serious version of mulan and that they tried to somewhat go with an original story but come on what is this garbage its disrespectful to call this movie mulan im also upset at the fact that this was if im not mistaken the first major asian disney movie and they really messed up i really wished they just remade this movie and based it off of the original animated version maybe throw in some singing better visuals throw mushu in the mix maybe recast eddy murphy for the voice again bring back that nostalgic feeling of the original just redo it all im just upset because mulan is such a classic with some of the most memorable songs and they completely steered away from all that and not to mention this was disneys chance to appeal to the asian population and they completely botched it dont waste your time and money 
Sep 7 2020,negative,this was just absolutely saddening to watch im currently halfway through the movie and i just wanted all of you about to watch this movie to know that everything you liked about mulan is gone no singing no mushu no general shang not even the cricket is there it has been replaced by a fuggly lookin spider also theres no stable plot and no real character development just dont even know why they ever remade the movie to make it feel like anything but the original
Sep 7 2020,negative,little to no character backstorydevelopment disjointed movie scenes poor character introductions throughout the film a horrible lack in emotional capacity across all actors particularly mulan fighting scenes were beautiful to watch but rarely made sense mulan herself said maybe 150 words the entire film   any attempts at comedy or sadness were just painfully awkward to watch it was a terrible attempt at a film an even worse attempt as an adaptation and a poor excuse for a remake disney should issue an apology
Sep 7 2020,negative,the delivery of the movie was flat actors seemed to be reading lines not acting missed most of the comedic effects of the original what bothered me most of all is that this movie seemed more dated than the original 20 years ago less feminism in this 2020 version  mulan chooses family over her career the scenery was gorgeous and there was one good battle scene but i cant tell where the 200m budget went
Sep 7 2020,positive,i find it more exciting to watch this at the cinema
Sep 7 2020,negative,i couldnt tell you how accurate this film is to chinese culture its somewhat similar to the ballad of mulan however the original story from 459 bc the only issue is that the ballad of mulan is very realistic while the disney movie is none of the sort in fact theres so little realism that it was hard for me to feel any sort of attachment to any of the antiphysics humans prancing around on set    what made disneys animated mulan so special was her intelligence and personal struggle the live action mulan focused heavily on her chi and physical strength everyone around her was telling her story for her and that my friends is the definition of sexism
Sep 7 2020,negative,it was boring lacked the fun and heart of the orginal and i really dont know what the point was it was too violent for younger viewers but too boring for older ones and the lead is probably a good actress but the way they protrayed mulan from the start was cringe worthy especially the spiderman ripoff scene save your money and wait for it to play on regular disney plus
Sep 7 2020,positive,amazing amazing amazing i grew up watching the original and this was so much better powerful captivating and overall fantastic hope there will be a sequel
Sep 7 2020,positive,beautifully filmed masterfully told not the typical kind of disney movie and one that makes a great rolemodel for girls of all ages my whole family loved it including my thirteen year old son and 12 year old daughter i did as well my daughter recommends to buy grace lins book that is a prequel to the movie it explains a lot
Sep 7 2020,negative,made a rotten tomatoes account just to let people know how bad this movie was felt like a low budget knockoff film
Sep 7 2020,negative,worst movie ever thanks a lot disney 
Sep 7 2020,negative,this straight up feels like a flashier disney channel movie im just so surprised its so bad
Sep 7 2020,negative,the worst love action since m night shyamapans avatar the last air bender
Sep 7 2020,negative,this movie completely missed the mark no music from the original no mushu and just really boring at times really disappointed as i loved the cartoon version
Sep 7 2020,negative,script was stale acting was shit no mushu or music overall mulan 2020 lost the feel story and charm of the classic mulan
Sep 7 2020,positive,is the best disneys live action for many reason is diferent from its animated version mulans story an her original reasons to do what she needs  to do remain
Sep 7 2020,neutral,visually it was stunning but they removed all the humor romance music and character development of the original  also they made mulan do everything perfectly from the beginning leaving no room for character growth  as such it was never able to take us to great emotional highs and lows and seems to drag  worth watching but definitely not for 30
Sep 7 2020,negative,trash just trash cgi fights and poor casting
Sep 7 2020,negative,as a lifelong disney fan and chinese american i find this movie shockingly bad and downright offensive is this what disney thinks of chinese culture what a joke disneys entire batch of remakes of the classic animated movies has been a disaster in moviemaking if not in the box office i hope they rethink this strategy of remaking joyful animated films as serious live action movies with the worst scripts in the world and none of the fun of the songs and musical numbers
Sep 7 2020,negative,trash in every way zero comedy no character development what a waste of money 
Sep 7 2020,positive,if disney tried to recreate the cartoon it would have been horrible this more historically accurate portrayal of mulan was great 
Sep 7 2020,positive,beautiful landscape visuals wardrobe color coordination and a pretty feel good movie by disney meant to appeal to chinese audience or at least avoid offending the chinese censors but rather like empty calories that taste good but ultimately feels vacuous not an improvement over the original cartoon version just a bigger budget
Sep 7 2020,negative,no no no no no just no i had so many problems with this movie but lets start with the positives the acting was good and the cinematography and costume design were gorgeous however its a disney movie with a huge budget so thats not even all that impressive right thats it for the positives lets get into the negatives first off what happened to all the incredible songs mulan has some of disneys best and most well known songs however they dont take advantage of any of that theres a nice cover of the song reflection sung by christina aguilera however its completely wasted because they only put in the instrumental version as background they didnt put in ill make a man out of you not even as background during the training scene second the whole reason mulan was special was because she was just as good a fighter as any of the men without using anything extra in the film she basically has superpowers and is just better than anybody else for no apparent reason in addition the animated film demonstrates her getting better throughout the training montage by practicing and getting stronger whereas in the live action film she just needs to believe in herself in my opinion this warps the message of the film lastly the characters and their development were pretty weak ive heard some people say that the animated film had weak characters and development as well but thats meant to be a kids movie the whole point of this movie was that it was a more serious version so the characters should have been much more substantial the one star i gave this movie was because the cinematography wasnt awful but thats to be expected with disney anyway im not a professional critic or anything so take this with a grain of salt i just wanted to share my opinion on this movie
Sep 7 2020,negative,hard to watch and boring hard to watch because  it seemed like scenes were missing at times i was bored and zoned out the action scenes were basic or just poorly done the changes to the animated version were not good ie removing the dragon and the romance they would have better to not make movie at all
Sep 7 2020,negative,orientalism everywhere no researching no repect no knowledge disney did disney thing
Sep 7 2020,negative,so bad and flat i only finished watching it because already wasted 30
Sep 7 2020,negative,this movie was not it
Sep 7 2020,positive,this was the best live version disney has ever made thank you disney for an amazing movie
Sep 7 2020,positive,excellent mulanloyalbrave and true for love of family 1st glory is within  so nice to finally see a family film that isnt whiningcomplainingblaming 
Sep 7 2020,positive,30 plus subscription fee for a mediocre live action disney remake  save your money  oh disney how you will never get money from me for price gouging  thankfully there are other ways of watching films without wasting your hard earned cash     better than the terrible aladdin live action film but not by much
Sep 7 2020,positive,could have been great felt like a missed opportunity drop the love interest build on the fatherdaughter relationship that was teased between mulan and commander tung and give more time to the mulanxian lang the witch dynamic
Sep 7 2020,negative,lousy where is mushu it was very dry compared to the animated original i would not suggest this for your children
Sep 7 2020,negative,visually stunning  but with all the fun the laughs and music removed its not a well done story other than mulan no characters were allowed to develop or were shown depth
Sep 7 2020,negative,this sucks
Sep 7 2020,neutral,it was alright  not as fun as the animated film  i really liiked jet li and mingna wen roles small as they were
Sep 7 2020,positive,it didnt feel like a disney movie at all
Sep 7 2020,positive,i loved it i liked everythingthe performance the actors the effects the music the history the changes that they made i hope we would have the opportunity to see it on movie theater soon
Sep 7 2020,negative,failure to include the actual music was a complete failure on part of the director the director is quoted in saying things like it would be unrealistic to burst into song on the way to war the problem with that statement is that it is unrealistic for us to see magic on the way to war or birds turning into people and vice versa also overall this new release was a complete let down of a disney film i loved in the animated version
Sep 7 2020,positive,awesome movie for the whole family btw mulan has super powers in this called tchi
Sep 7 2020,negative,the movie was so slow pace i had to force myself to finish the movie it felt like it was supposed to look like an original stand alone piece but failed forcing me to compare it with the animation which is a masterpiece
Sep 7 2020,negative,give me my money back the movie felt flat  and the acting was uninspiring i could not connect to any of the characters the live version which i was so looking forward to totally ruined my alltime favourite disney movie uggh
Sep 7 2020,positive,enjoy the f out of it 
Sep 7 2020,negative,totally an american style imagination not a true chinese story at all
Sep 7 2020,negative,dont waste your money
Sep 7 2020,negative,how could anyone give this a good review the movie was horrible the original 1998 cartoon mulan is a timeless classic and this movie was just a mistake
Sep 7 2020,negative,what happened in this movie is a travesty to how great the original mulan no plot acting was horrible and the positive messages that you want in the movie were overshadowed by cheesy scenes
Sep 7 2020,positive,excellent actress yifei is so stunning and she really showed the perseverance of mulan in the face of powerful enemy
Sep 7 2020,positive,felt too artificial a little like avatar the last airbender in that i loved seeing it live but it just didnt have the magic of the original bad guys were a little muddy trying to be a few different movies and never really picked one to be good at
Sep 7 2020,positive,i thought this was a very entertaining adaptation of the mulan story granted it did not completely stick to the 1998 cartoon it did have some of the elements like instrumentals of a few of the main songs some similar lines character concepts etc if you dont compare this to the cartoon it is a great movie on its own still it would have been nice to keep mushu and some of the other characters i personally wouldnt mind little brother or the grandmother even
Sep 7 2020,positive,i dont know what other people are talking about this movie was awesome i like the story line kept me interested and the fight scenes were great for a disney movie i will watch it again this movie deserves to be seen on the big screen
Sep 7 2020,negative,no mushu no lets get down to business everything that made us live milan was taken out shouldnt have been a disney version of this movie no disney theme to it at all tried to be funny and change cricket was terrible what a waste of 200 milion disney could of had a backbone but seem to kneel to some other view on this movie
Sep 7 2020,negative,overly cheesy very bad casting decision the actress who plays mulan doesnt seen to have the ethos of the young heroine the roles are great in this film but the main actors and casts just didnt deliver a believable experience for movie goers its a shame because mulan is a great story disney should recast everybody and work on the script a little more hopefully in a few years they can give this story another chance
Sep 7 2020,negative,no character arcs   primarily action   chunky writing
Sep 7 2020,negative,wtf is that premier stream
Sep 6 2020,negative,i believe if they wanted to do the remake they shouldve been devoted to the original screenplay and the music i think it was the most terrible remake ive ever seen in my life i had to watch the original disney movie after to remove the bad after taste for a 200 million budget bad acting  cheap cgi boring and not emotional at all
Sep 6 2020,negative,really disney you spend millions and you can even put the scene when she cuts her hair you put a fénix following her but not mushu and you make the cricket as a human come on
Sep 6 2020,negative,dont get me wrong i am all for chineseasian representations but this is no more than a moneymaker targeting chinese audience the screenwriting is downright lazy its like they identify some major scenes and just do fillintheblanks with childish plots it has the heaviness of a historic film without the integrity it does not follow the folklore legend as it claimed to do the witch character serves no purpose but to move the story along why would she serve the villain like a slave just on a promise that he will elevate her status when all he does is call her a witch it cuts in the screen time for fatherdaughter relationship and the romance between male and female leads
Sep 6 2020,negative,overly cheesy and was too much like crouching tiger hidden dragon
Sep 6 2020,negative,this movie was bad and i would like to separate it from the original but its hard not to compare the two the took the main character from a strong willed and smart woman who made sacrifices for the people she loved and turned her into a boring one dimensional chosen one they took a movie that dealt with serious subjects in an engaging and powerful way and made it boring there was no comic relief no way to identify with the characters there were points where i just wanted to yell if you want to be a kung fu movie be a kung fu movie it would have been a better movie if it had been a kung fu movie   the relationships she has are not fleshed out and yet the movie was still too long they took away that she was smart enough to overcome physical weaknesses by thinking of ways to handle issues by being smart they took away the theme that family is the most important thing and twisted it into know your place and maybe be honest even if being honest would be a really stupid thing to do i still dont know if thats the actual message the were going for because it was done poorly it was the opposite of female empowerment because if anything the evil hawk lady showed that really if there had not been an attack the same kind of treatment would have been give to mulan mulans mother even says they will call her a witch when she is a kid it was confusing and it was bad and in the end i felt like after the movie ends really bad things will happen to the main character
Sep 6 2020,negative,its shocking how a cartoon version which was shorter flowed so much better this movie was my new disappointment of 2020 it felt all over the place rushed and honestly i only finished watching it because already wasted 30 id give it a one star but since they thought it was cool to remove mushu and replace him with some low qaulity cgi phoenix they dont deserve that extra half star
Sep 6 2020,positive,i love all the cast i can say that its almost the perfect castingeven though it wasnt the exact story from the animation theyve stuck with the main lessonmoral of the story 
Sep 6 2020,negative,they managed to take 6 minutes of a cartoon and stretch it out into a 50 minute sequence all while unable to write their own dialogue simply reading lines from 90s songs  i fell asleep 3 times
Sep 6 2020,negative,was fairly disappointing the beginning was so bad it dropped my expectations low enough where the rest of film was enjoyable
Sep 6 2020,negative,its official nikki caro has managed to ruin a disney classic 200 million and she managed to create dead backgrounds full of clean colorful scenery that are a mockery of the chinese culture the fight sequences are so watereddown and meaningless i dont think we would miss them at all and the attempt to copy the formulas of chinese popcorn action flicks are laughable the dialogue is empty and to add insult to injury they removed mushu in lieu of a phoenix that serves no purpose except to try and connect the story to ancestry so now we dont even have humor they even copied the scene from the xmen cartoon when the wings shine behind jean grey  nikki caro had one job watch hero and crouching tiger hidden dragon then call ang lee and ask how do i do this couldnt even do that   200 million for this what a joke
Sep 6 2020,positive,i loved the movie they made a mulan that dove into a lot of the cultural and feminine accepts that make mulan an icon i love how the changes added to the deeper meaning of the character and story
Sep 6 2020,negative,every part of this movie just made me miss the original
Sep 6 2020,positive,the film takes the correct approach steering away from the originals beloved musical comedy tone towards a vibrant war epic the happy meal diversity finds itself replaced with what at least seemed like a sincere attempt to depict the meaning of family within a collectivist in culture and the extent to which those bonds can drive someone to crumble under pressure or achieve
Sep 6 2020,negative,the worst live action ever the witch was unnecessary the phoenix was unnecessary and even though the movie is 30min longer than the animated one it tells far far less things than the animated one theres zero character development the achievements on the movie arent earned by the protagonist seriously dont pay for this piece of sht
Sep 6 2020,positive,truly enjoyed the film  i did not feel the switch to small screen impacted the integrity of the experience
Sep 6 2020,negative,do not watch it the worst disney movie that i have ever watched and its 30 very boring moviedont waste your money on this movie disappointed
Sep 6 2020,negative,they removed everything that was great about the original mulan and removed it jokes were bad my fam and i were calling the rouran the moron because of how poorly they were done not worth the money
Sep 6 2020,negative,i understand why they made some changes because of cultural reasons other changes were dumb and pointless
Sep 6 2020,negative,mulan lack of facial expressions really poor acting like she did not belong there
Sep 6 2020,positive,visually from the filming locations to the sets to the costumes this movie is a sight to behold absolutely stunning the fight choreography is top notch and the battles are truly epic in scale the cast is wonderful and brings so much heart and feeling to each of their roles but still go ahead check it out yourself and make up your own mind about this movie
Sep 6 2020,positive,the film was exciting from start to finish  i would say the best disney live action to date
Sep 6 2020,negative,heres the thing it hurts the place that mulan already had in our hearts if it was some random film itd be ok although i think the biggest issue is its not even clear who the target audience might be i watch the whole film with a straight face really disappointed and i cant think of any fan new or old who wouldnt be 200 million on what exactly go back to school whomever decided on this progression of the plot and character development sad stop ruining great things disney
Sep 6 2020,negative,horrendous movie mulan is my favourite movie and this tragedy is not mulan no mythical songs characters and scenes
Sep 6 2020,negative,a pilot similar to star wars chi  force  as stated in the movie only son can weld chi
Sep 6 2020,positive,it was ok its nothing like the original  and thats fine and even though they removed a lot of the original storylines it felt like it was rushed there were no emotional moments little to no character development mulan went from a strong young girl to a soldier hiding her strength and then back to being strong and dont even get me started on the weird action sequences instead of zooming in they would just cut to the same angle of the shot but it enlarged without actually zooming in it made it feel jumpy and fastpaced as i mentioned before it felt rushed nonetheless it was a nice movie but it the end  just  bland
Sep 6 2020,negative,no musical themes no mushu mulan doesnt feel like the character from the original which we all loved character has no arc no build up no flaws no personality
Sep 6 2020,negative,worst disney movie ever made in my humble opinion disneys getting sloppy
Sep 6 2020,negative,huge disappointment actress acting was   very weak and not convincing at all
Sep 6 2020,positive,i thought it was pretty wondrous and i felt the female director behind it loved mulan she was great
Sep 6 2020,negative,horrible nothing like the original missing so many great songs and moments dont recommend
Sep 6 2020,negative,so watered down i am just not liking this at allone of the biggest blatant cash grabs out therenot good
Sep 6 2020,negative,i enjoy disney for a lot of their family friendly and fun movies but good lord could they have sucked any more fun out of this movie that made it enjoyable to begin with to put this thing out so much made no sense to dispose of and add for the live action poor choices by the director was really looking forward to this and i just feel meh about it i wont bother watching it again
Sep 6 2020,positive,the best live action ever
Sep 6 2020,negative,missed all of the great moments the original has flow of the movie is choppy acting is subpar
Sep 6 2020,neutral,the movie in and of itself wasnt all that good to be honest as usual with disney they take the charm out the whole thing the animated version had life comedy and various other elements this live action was not it i wanted to like it but i couldnt i dont know why disney chose this movie to be ultra realistic but it didnt work im afraid for the little mermaid live action nowdisney stop ruining great movies and franchises because you make horrible decisionsif it aint broke dont fix it
Sep 6 2020,negative,how do you get a movie so wrong when there is litterally a blueprint out there on how to do it right bad fight scenes bad main and side characters bad story just all in all a bad movie
Sep 6 2020,positive,love the movie is not the same as the cartoon but the message is clear love it
Sep 6 2020,negative,honestly just utter garbage i never review any movies but i had to say something about this because of how bad this piece of rotten destructive garbage
Sep 6 2020,positive,the new mulan looked like something ive been begging for in this surging era of liveaction disney remakes namely something different i dont need inferior liveaction versions to shorter animated classics and as disney enters into a more modern trove of remakes the courage to adapt becomes noticeably less theres a reason the 2019 lion king was simply a sludgier superfluous version that was beatforbeat the same and its called 15 billion dollars worldwide people want their nostalgia as they remember it thank you very much the mulan remake looked to be taking a different route it eliminated the songs the comic relief sidekicks and overt supernatural characters it was going to be more serious more mature and more actionpacked and i was all for it the release was pushed back several months due to covid and finally lands on disney but at an extra cost i would advise fans to wait this new mulan 2020 isnt worth your time and its certainly not worth an additional 30 to be disappointed by    mulan yifei liu is a young maiden in old china who has trouble fitting into how society says a woman should behave the emperor jet li orders all families to supply one male into the royal army to combat bori khan jason scott lee and his powerful witch xianniang gong li mulan takes her family armor and poses as a man to take the place of her ailing father she wants to serve but shes also hungry for adventure and over the course of her training she will come to fully understand her real power    i knew within minutes that this movie was in trouble in a flashback we watch young mulan chasing after a chicken not listening to her father causing havoc and consternation from neighbors but then she effortlessly climbs to the roof of her neighborhood and then as she falls off is effortlessly able to recapture her balance and land perfectly like she was spiderman from there the first act tells us that mulan is not just a superpowered being of high chi think midichlorians and the force but also potentially the chosen one like anakin skywalker and she must hide her real power to not bring disgrace to her family im sorry but this makes little sense i understand the oppressive cultural expectations for women at this time and how womens real value as judged by their society was through marriage and childrearing however were now in a world of magic where living superpowered beings walk among us mutants in xmen but rather than valuing this its shunned because shes a girl that seems even more preposterous to me the screenplay followed the captain marvel feminist theme and its about a woman finally coming into her own power shunning the restraints and embracing her full potential against the wishes of frightened men if after reading all of this that sounds like a good start for a movie let alone a liveaction remake of mulan then have at it dear reader for me this began as a thematic and tonal mess that didnt get better by making mulan a superpowered being it eliminates her relatability and the stakes of the movie shes no longer an ordinary girl who struggles to do her best now shes essentially a god who just has to turn on her powers and subdue easily outmatched opponents thats a significant loss and mistake    if you were going to be a martial arts epic where characters have super powers then be that movie and give me epic showdowns between epic warriors give me a heavy dose of magic realism and eyepopping imagery chinese cinema has plenty of examples of these kinds of movies in recent years one needs to only start cycling through the filmography of zhang yimou for spellbinding supernatural martial arts epics like hero and house of flying daggers and 2018s shadow if youre going to be a heightened world of extraordinary combat then build your movie around that tonal decision and start from there in mulan 2020 people exist with amazing abilities but nobody treats this with the recognition it deserves there appears to be a prevalent form of sexism as powerful men are seen as impressive but powerful women are seen as frightening and dangerous often derided as witches there was room for exploration of gong lis 2046 memoirs of a geisha character and the parallels with mulan both women feared for their powers and apparent threat to a hierarchy that wants to exploit them but not include them my girlfriend was irate throughout the viewing and pointed specifically at the witch character and declared theyre going to give her a lame redemption story where she sacrifices herself at the end to save mulan and i will hate it and boy oh boy did she hate it    alas mulan 2020 cannot sustain itself as a supernatural martial arts epic as an action spectacle every moment is shortchanged which is not good when you have a whopping 200 million budget the action consists of a handful of characters at most and only a short display of activity there are no strong action set pieces and welldeveloped sequences that keep your excitement pumping there is some acceptable fight choreography here and there but little to tickle the imagination or approach the poetry of something like crouching tiger hidden dragon i dont know if director niki caro whale rider mcfarland usa feels confident enough as an action director of big visual spectacle and that uncertainty leaks throughout the finished film take for instance camera movements meant to be stylish but instead becomes perplexing as our big bad villain and his crew ride toward the outer walls of a village they leap from their horses and ascend the walls and the camera shifts 90 degrees to follow the movement smoothly thats a good stylistic choice then mere seconds later as they reach the top the camera will abruptly shift again 90 degrees then back again but the characters havent shifted their stances or perspectives caro has taken a stylistic flourish that had meaning and seems to be hitting it again and again but without the earlier context it becomes confusing arbitrary and annoying and it happens multiple times because the movie doesnt fully embrace being a martial arts spectacle when it does employ super human tricks it runs the risk of being goofy mulan has several moments where she kicks flying arrows into her foes as if she was a soccer player setting up a wicked trick shot i welcomed a martial arts epic version of mulan but the filmmakers were too timid to commit    there are several moments that left me scratching my head in the adaptation process take for instance mulan deciding to take her fathers place in the animated film its a big moment and we watch her slice her hair with her ancestral sword put on her fathers armor and its treated like the big characterdefining moment that the story demands its like watching a superhero transform and suit up for battle in mulan 2020 this moment is denied to us and we skip to her turning around already in armor and riding off why why wouldnt you want to savor and dwell in a moment of great drama and a turning point for the character likewise late in the movie once mulan accepts her destiny and not to compromise her powers she strips her fathers armor piece by piece and flings it off herself while riding into battle i understand the symbolism of her stripping away the uniform of entrenched masculinity but two things wasnt this her familys armor that meant something of value and isnt wearing armor a good defense in a battle whats the point of removing the supernatural ancestral elements from the animated film to simply give mulan a flying phoenix that mainly serves as a cursor to point her in the right direction    let me open up one headscratcher and how it could have been resolved mulan has a younger sister but her inclusion is practically meaningless mulans parents worry about her capability of being docile and husbandmaterial but they have the younger sister who will serve their needs the movie doesnt present the younger sisters perspective shes just a bonus daughter its a confounding creative decision but i think with a little more shaping it would have justified itself this sister could have been resentful of her big sister for being selfish and rejecting her eldest responsibilities that would protect their family these duties now fall onto her with the added pressure of being the only daughter who has a chance of attaining a good marriage this could and should cause friction between the sisters a divide that can be healed over the course of the movie dearly missing from mulan 2020 is the ability of its titular heroine to share herself she doesnt have her magic companions coaching her so she has no audience to confide in as a result mulan feels so impassive and inscrutable my solution she writes a series of letters to her sister to explain her actions as well as her daytoday fears and hopes and in doing so it opens up the mulan character as well as provides an outlet where her sister can learn and relate to her that would have worked and it would have justified the younger sister in the narrative as well as provide mulan herself with an ongoing opportunity for reflection expression and confession    sadly i also had serious reservations about lead actress yifei liu the assassins forbidden kingdom from her first moment onscreen as the adult mulan her line readings were overwhelmingly flat this may well be a byproduct of her speaking english as opposed to chinese and on that front why couldnt this movie have been entirely chinese and subtitled i understand disney would view a foreign language version as less profitable but if youre going for a more serious more grownup version of mulan set in ancient china how about trusting americans to read regardless liu certainly has the right look to anchor a movie but her acting is too stilted there are many actors who have great martial arts skills donnie yen jet li jason scott lee that arent called upon why hire actors with great fighting capability and then give them precious little to show off my favorite performer in the movie was mulans father tzi ma the farewell    after watching mulan 2020 i then rewatched the 1998 animated original and my opinion of the liveaction remake sank even lower the animated film has it beat in every measure the mixture of drama and comedy is deft the emotional core of the character is fierce and the supporting characters have distinct and discernible personalities and the songs arent too shabby either the villain is more menacing and has those very necessary moments to establish their villainy the bad guys in mulan 2020 have no memorable moments that make you go oh thats a baddie plus the handdrawn animation is beautiful and allows far more emotional expression for the characters making it even more transporting but also engaging if youre a fan of the original i cannot see how you will enjoy mulan 2020 and if you paid 30 for that opportunity i imagine youll be even more incensed if it was going to be different the new mulan needed to fully embrace those differences and develop its new big screen story to be best suited as a martial arts epic for older viewers if it was going to make mulan a superhero it needed to embrace this decision and heighten the world mixing in fantasy foundations the moments needed to matter and be a reflection of our heroines emotional journey mulan 2020 is a frustrating disappointment and another reminder for myself that liveaction disney remakes will rarely if ever even come close to recreating the charm and magic of their predecessors    nates grade c
Sep 6 2020,negative,the movie had some good moments and beautiful scenes however much like the latest star wars movie unnecessarily lazy and just plain crappy writing ruined a perfectly good movie youd think with all the money and people disney poured into this film that they could have spent more than 30 seconds thinking about if things made sense     and hey remember how films like the original disney mulan had actual character and plot development yeah well if youre into that youre sol on this film and hey i paid 30 for crap but i really shouldnt be surprised disney has been nothing but garbage lately
Sep 6 2020,negative,dumps all over the original and send a bad message to kids for her being the chosen one not fun at all
Sep 6 2020,negative,we were looking forward to seeing the movie because we thought it would be like the original it did not have the characters from original it lacked all the music and singing from the original no humor it included a witch whyfor a disney movie it was disappointing 
Sep 6 2020,negative,not very entertaining or believable
Sep 6 2020,positive,perfect more mature than animation sends a positive message
Sep 6 2020,negative,10 minutes in and there were already 3 major plot changes not a good watch wish i would have just watched the original again
Sep 6 2020,negative,never have used rotten tomatoes before in my life but this movie was so alarmingly poor that i felt the desperate need to make an account just to rate this movie i went into mulan 2020 expecting something similar to all of disneys live action movies something not great but at the very least decent and sometimes funny or gritty in an interesting way a solid 3 star movie mulan has no identity plot wonder or joy it is purely terrible from the cgi to the writing to the plot i rarely hate a movie the way i hate mulan then when you consider people are paying an absurd 30 dollars plus a monthly membership to see this movie it really leaves a poor taste behind    it is historically culturally and narratively inaccurate to the original animated movie the poem and chinese culture in general and while i went in expecting it to be inaccurate the changes made were not only inaccurate but not even enjoyable changes they managed to weaken what was otherwise a strong narratives in the original animated movie and things simply do not make sense for most of the movie the story has no idea how to set up a plot and create tension it references the original animated movie but the references almost ruin the movie further as it reminds me i could be watching the better version of that movie    if you want to watch a live action version of mulan go watch the 2009 version made in china not only is it better and more accurate its gritty and the romance and story feels like it knows what it wants to do unlike this hunk of trash i would sooner have enjoyed a dissonant version of mulan live action where eddy murphy plays a talking dragon while a hyper realistic cricket hopped alongside him at least i would have forgiven the historical inaccuracies because they were following their original animated movie    tldr its a far worse movie than you think it is dont watch it unless you can watch it for free and want to make fun of it
Sep 6 2020,negative,felt like watching a  bollywood movie going to watch the original now bye
Sep 6 2020,positive,the family thoroughly enjoyed this movie not sure why its getting so much flack maybe its because i never watched the animated version as a stand alone it was very entertaining and had a great message for my two young daughters 
Sep 6 2020,negative,this is quite a disappointing and terrible film all things considered    despite running for 2 hours there was no character arc or any actual emotional scenes with mulan with everything that was supposed to be emotional being skipped over very quickly
Sep 6 2020,positive,i struggled with this movie mulan 1998 is one of my favorite disney animation movies and i completely understand that disney has a history of not properly representing a culture i have no issues with making this movie into a chinese epic but ive seen way better chinese cinema before it seemed like they wanted to make it a kung fu movie which i would have loved but the pacing was off really off it was less like a waltz through the story and more of a race i felt like the audience had to rely on their knowledge of the animated movie to know why something happened the way it did i kept thinking ah yes this partoh its over ok i guess thats that i felts like the visuals and costumes were beautiful and well done but the action scenes seemed thin if youre going to go for it go for it get the best martial artists and make it a true action movie with mind blowing stunts and martial art skills but the thing i missed the most were the feels this movie didnt move me it didnt give me goosebumps when something exciting happened the struggle mulan goes through wasnt heavy enough i felt like this movie may have had its heart but it definitely was missing its soul
Sep 6 2020,negative,it lacks the spark that the animated movie has
Sep 6 2020,negative,beautifully shot but wasnt enjoyable to watch the characters were underdeveloped the story was stilted and seemed unwilling to commit to any message beyond the sheer spectacle of the fight scenes
Sep 6 2020,negative,this movie was so bad i feel insulted mulan is the story of a woman overcoming challenges through hard work determination courage etc but in this version mulan was just born with what it takes to be a warrior then they turn her into chinese elsa her house is all wrong too that is a hakka house that is found in southern china but mulan lived far far north costumes are caricatures    and then this movie has some of the dumbest plot movers ever people walk into the most obvious of traps without prompting people spill their teams top secret battle plans to the enemy and let said enemy go even after the enemy swears to stop them i cant believe how dumb this movie was cgi was terrible i expected bigger scale battle scenes sadly this one was not blockbuster movie quality the only highlights were seeing donnie yen and jet li
Sep 6 2020,positive,i absolutely loved this retelling of one of my favorite animated disney movies the movie balanced the fan service needed to remind me of why i loved the original along with a stronger story that gave us a fully developed protagonist and antagonist
Sep 6 2020,neutral,i felt the film lacked character development and some of the charm from the original
Sep 6 2020,negative,another lowcost production chinese movie
Sep 6 2020,negative,stay away the animated version is much better
Sep 6 2020,negative,the worst movie ever  disney has reached the bottom  they spoiled everything that people liked in the classic disney cartoon
Sep 6 2020,positive,i never watch mulan the animated version and i dont much about the historical events that said the story is pretty good maybe the moralizing tone of it in the end is a bit much the action is not at the level of hero or crouching dragons but its well done and filmed the actors are amazing and they are solid in their roles their was a nice sobriety about it the music was catchy some things are very disney like no blood no display of injuries not much expositions to the world of men all this for the ratings for young people that might pass for adults its a hard swallow i give it 70 because of the acting and good actions this isnt worth 3040 really nothing about movie does wait for it in cinema or when the price makes more sens but i do recommend to go see it its not a bad movie
Sep 6 2020,negative,dang it i wanted to like this movie no i wanted to love this movie and it was just so dang bad no joy no humor no nobility they took a poop on mulans amazing bravery and replaced it with chi its just so bad whyyyyy
Sep 6 2020,negative,alright film meant absolutely nothing    amazingly managed to have less to say than the original made 20 years ago which had eddie murphy as a pigmy dragon teaming up with a pet cricket     erased the old message of mulan for some at best sketchy additions    its entire message is that absolute loyalty to the chinese state is the most supreme good    equality for women secondary  grit and dedication all you need nah magic powers    had some funnycool moments some of them i probably wasnt supposed to laugh at involved mulan repeatedly teleporting because the director apparently couldnt be bothered to explain space between camera moments disappointing overall could have been much better disney somehow fully selling out
Sep 6 2020,positive,for western audiences looking for something similar to the cartoon animation this is very different to the cartoon version for chinese audiences who are used to watching ancient cdramas this also is different the movie aims to please a global audience both old and young so viewers need to bear this in mind     ive read a lot of negative reviews from both western and chinese audiences and as someone growing up with both cultures i think the movie was beautifully done the actors were great martial arts visuals were good and scenery breathtaking there are many references to chinese culture that may not be obvious at first glance but if you read behind the symbolisms and meanings eg phoenix brave true loyal filial piety there is a lot of references to chinese culture and is a very touching movie
Sep 6 2020,negative,visually the movie was motivating however the story telling of the movie was not motivating at all glad i didnt spend money at the theater but still not worth 30 wait for it to stream on disney with your subscription because this movie was simply not that great
Sep 6 2020,negative,just as ridden with boring exposition as all the other disney remakes and lacks anything that made the original fun the cgi is laughable at times and for a more realistic take on mulan the plot is highly unbelievable
Sep 6 2020,negative,this was the worst live action remake we have watched from disney disney needs to stop trying to please everyone and stick to what made them what they are today this movie removed important characters and changed scenes that now have little or no emotional effect that you felt even as a child in the original disney ruined a classic
Sep 6 2020,negative,its just boring and you have to pay an extra 30 bucks as well as having disney plus
Sep 6 2020,negative,tbh its not a bad film but you cant help but compare it to the original without the humour and music i didnt feel like there was much left
Sep 6 2020,negative,whereas other disney remakes have coasted on nostalgia or just recreated the original shotforshot mulan carves its own path beautifully filmed yet clumsily rewritten it is encouraging to see these kinds of movies try something new mind you the end result isnt the musical epic you may remember but a grounded and mostly unengaging companion piece that gets only a select few ingredients right
Sep 6 2020,positive,i really wanted to love this   my issues revolve around the believability of the plots logic also there are really silly timing issues in short it was overly simplistic but frankly the animated film was far more logical and believable than this so theres really no reason this couldnt have been more normally for a disney movie id given them slack in the silliness area and not that musicals cant be serious but if youre going to remove the musical nature of a film then i assume its because you want me to take your film more seriously
Sep 6 2020,negative,more than having terrible pacing and terrible dialogue the worst sin of the movie it was boring
Sep 6 2020,positive,loved it the story line was great and instead of a mouthy dragon the pheanix was more symbolic of the time
Sep 6 2020,negative,it wasnt disney and it wasnt mulan it was a poor plot crouching tiger hidden dragon made zero sense
Sep 6 2020,negative,monotonous acting the cast should be questioned
Sep 6 2020,negative,i feel like with this fim the writers were unsure of what they wanted to do while the special effects where cool at times you could also see how lazy they got when it came to certain scenes i was personalty taken out of focusing on this new tale of mulan when they played the music from the original cartoon i think i would be ok with one or two noods but this was done with the music and even the characters names lazy writing again from disney
Sep 6 2020,neutral,the action scenes reminded me of crouching tiger hidden dragon i thought disney couldve done better with the writing 
Sep 6 2020,positive,mulan has always been a favorite in our house and the live version did not disappoint we enjoyed the more realistic viewpoint of the story and it was more respectful to the chinese culture only negative it was missing a little romance at the end
Sep 6 2020,positive,nice reality remake of the classic but its been disneyfied and sits in between the animated version and a full blown actionadventure epic  understood it is to appease all audiences but really wish it went one way or another  great to see all the asian powerhouse actorsactresses in one movie gong li stole the show with her character and acting  some cheesey scenes and the dialogue wasnt always flowing but quite a beautiful tribute to the animated classic
Sep 6 2020,negative,lame on ever level not funny nor connecting 
Sep 6 2020,positive,straying away from traditional disney singing and dancing and mirroring a more traditional oriental setting while recapturing the spirit of the original movie this was truly a shot in the dark that hit its mark
Sep 6 2020,positive,ok mediocre disney reimagining movie starring some girl and the wonderful donnie yen this movie is just ok that means theirs some good and some bad first lets start off with the characters they all feel off in the original they all have feelings and heart but in this they most of the times lack that it feels super long too even though its only an hour and 40 minutes this is another movie ill forget about but this movie had real potential in spots i felt like they couldve done more and the villains sucked mulan had her moments but they didnt put enough time and effort for the audience to care about  this is another disney movie that will be lost in the shuffle
Sep 6 2020,positive,the majestic visuals and contrasting colors wouldve been much better in a cinema
Sep 6 2020,positive,i have waited 5 years to see mulan and i have to say mulan deserved to be on the big screen it was really good it should be put in theathers i always wanted to see it in theathers and not just on tv at home i am glad they had an all asian cast to play the roles perfectly i thought it was nice to have ming na wen in there as a cameo i liked how there was some things that referenced the cartoon version like the  the avalanche mulan walking up the mountain was like her climbing the pole mulan saving honghui from the avalanch was like her saving shang i knew she would ended up saving him even though there wasnt alot o funny moments but it did have some settle hummur i really liked that it wasnt a copy i liked that it was kinda of different so i am hopping it  will be released in theathers so i can have that experience i always wanted
Sep 6 2020,positive,could have been a bit more connected but honestly thought it was a good movie nothing can replace the original animation i grew up with but all in allnot bad
Sep 6 2020,neutral,disneys latest liveaction adaptation directed by niki caro this time around this adaptation received a pg13 rating making it the first disney liveaction remake to be given such a rating and that is because this is a more realistic serious war film as opposed to an energetic vibrant fastpaced film such as the 1998 animated film i didnt hate this film i actually quite enjoyed the stunt choreography and action sequences film the locations and gorgeous shots so it pains me when i see this films production budget was 200300 million but it definitely will not receive that type of response unfortunately though i didnt care much for the story this time around it really drags on at times this film is about a half hour longer than the 1998 animation and you can definitely feel it while you are waiting for something to actually happen there are also plenty of supernatural elements included this time that dont lend themselves very well not serving much of any suitable purposes    the larger cast i found myself enjoying but unfortunately the films lead liu yifei as mulan i felt she was quite wooden interactions between her and other characters were not as strong outside of the action sequences id say its biggest flaw is the lack of humor or charm that made the 1998 animated film pop onto the scene can you imagine if 2019s aladdin had taken place without a genie overall this adaptation is fine but probably nothing youll watch and remember much of in a few weeks the liveaction adaptation of mulan will become available for all disney subscribers on december 4
Sep 6 2020,negative,if they want to make it authentic they should have made it an actual chinese film it sounds extremely unnatural to have chinese actresses and actors using foreign language to pretend that its their native language i couldnt enjoy it without thinking it sounds so awful when they speak
Sep 6 2020,negative,caro later explained that the songs were deleted because she felt it didnt fit with her realistic vision of the film    also niki  inserts a witch that transform into a falcon and has claws instead of finger  inserts ninja from naruto that can climb walls    mulan is not mulan without the reflection and ill make a man out of you musical scene shouldve just stayed with the original one
Sep 6 2020,negative,seriously disney     this movie sucks all the essence from the original animated movie no longer is mulan an ordinary girl struggling with what her society feels should bring honor to her family and who makes the sacrifice of risking her life in order to preserve what she values most  her fathers health and safety instead of a real empowered woman who works hard to achieve her goals and who proves her society wrong mulan is simply using her natural talents to fulfill her duty and find her rightful place she is an exception to the rule not an example for us mere mortals to follow shameful and depressing     this bland adaptation is yet another live action cash grab that adds nothing only takes away from the far superior original a waste of time and money
Sep 6 2020,positive,a very well put together movie while it does differ heavily from the original disney version and losses a lot of it humor it once had the movie does a good job in telling a more realistic version of the classic ballad while still leaving some mystical elements within to keep it entertaining to the average viewer it takes a good step a from movies such as the lion king reboot were it was pretty much a carbon copy of the original although unless money is no object the 30 price tag to view is likely too much for a lot of people it would be better to wait until the movie is freeon disney to watch or if it comes to theaters for the classic movie watching experience  if you can afford the premium access then this movie is well your time to watch and hopefully you can build you own opinion the movie instead of by just looking at the one off opinions of strangers on the internet
Sep 6 2020,positive,the film is incredibly well directed by niki caro the scenes of actions are very choreographed i am jawdropping with the look of this film  as much as they took elements like mushu mulans grandmother and the songs the film did not lose essence it won a different one even more with the addition of the character xianniang played by gong li  and its not a cliché thank you disney        i have more words haha
Sep 6 2020,negative,horrible movie i didnt care that mushu wasnt in it but i knew the minute the comedic characters were removed this was going to be a drama the story itself was dry they had something with so much potential to work with and just burned it to the ground i dont understand
Sep 6 2020,negative,a total failure cheap performance of all characters ridiculous plots messed up chinese background its a cheaply made kids movie at most
Sep 6 2020,positive,great movie waited for so long to watch even thought the 2999 is little bit expensive but def worth the price
Sep 6 2020,positive,enjoyed by the entire family young and old visually it was just beautiful i would recommend it to anyone
Sep 6 2020,negative,that was so bad id rather watch an adam sandler film marathon than this ever again
Sep 6 2020,positive,my 8 year old daughter and i watched the movie together on disney the experience is better than we expected as a chinese parent my version of the story was different but the outcome was the same for my daughter and me too many others give bad reviews for political or other reasons but we just want to keep it true it is a very enjoyable action movie from disney simple to understand storyline very good casting beautiful locations and fabulous phonix
Sep 6 2020,negative,skip this one it makes no justice for the original at all what a waste of time
Sep 6 2020,positive,i thought the movie was sensational it really hits the chinese virtues which i really enjoyed it drew on the true aspect of mulan and what she was all about the acting was great granted there is always that one or two subpar actors the artistry was beautiful and i love how it really drew you in i always thought the chinese culture was beautiful i am glad disney did away with the singing and mushu yes the animated version was great but this version really touched base on who mulan really was
Sep 6 2020,negative,the best part of the movie is when it ended and the credits starts playing
Sep 6 2020,positive,beautiful poetic and amazing mulan is one of the best adventure movie of the year
Sep 6 2020,negative,no funny grandma no mushu no crickets and new hawk woman character awful movie 
Sep 6 2020,negative,it didnt do justice to the animation nice photograhpy here and there but thats about it skip this one
Sep 6 2020,positive,i think you will enjoy the live action mulan regardless but if you also enjoy chinese martial arts movies youll understand part of its inspiration more
Sep 6 2020,negative,it was pretty terrible actually musically dead demeaning to women they are only as good as men if they have super chi otherwise meh and the action sequences were no better than the kung fu theater fights from when i was a kid also the bad guy conflict was dumb this witch lady is a psychotic mass murderer because no one takes her seriously and she has nowhere to go but then we are supposed to be glad that she takes an arrow for mulan nope in every other instance she blocked those arrows just stupid agenda driven nonsensical writing
Sep 6 2020,negative,this was an absolute disgrace im having trouble finding words to express just how bad this was total money grab by disney dont waist your time  or money
Sep 6 2020,positive,any woman would be filled with power and confidence after watching mulan
Sep 6 2020,negative,a mix of culture scene with a blank script disney tried to appeal asian or plainly chinese audiences with a flat and unexplainable superpoweralike qienabled women figure and twisted ideology of family
Sep 6 2020,positive,better than other live action disney movies better than the ratings suggest
Sep 6 2020,positive,good  some cool action sequences  has a good story  separates itself from original    bad  a little boring  separates itself from original a little to much
Sep 6 2020,positive,it completely exceeded my expectations
Sep 6 2020,negative,no buildup no pay off no reward and by far the worst live action remake ive ever seen i honestly regret even deciding to out my eyes on the travesty for even a second its wasnt worth my time it wont be worth yours either
Sep 6 2020,negative,the star wars sequels in one movie scenes hard to watch due to terrible cgi and terrible acting mulan but everything that makes it mulan a standalone movie that definitely stands out unfortunately
Sep 6 2020,positive,masterful well written no singing  musical nonsense a must see
Sep 6 2020,positive,this film was a huge disappointment the story is replaced with mindless action and kung fu style action scenes the film has its moments but overall the story is so convoluted that you never really feel for any character including mulan which is a real shame sadly id suggest just watching the original on disney for free 
Sep 6 2020,negative,was very shitty movie worst part they took mushu out also change the whole storyline i wish i could get that time back that i spent waisting watching it
Sep 6 2020,negative,disney really fumbled the ball on this one it seems like they tried to make a serious kung fu movie but decided on doing that late in the game the movie seems so rushed the dialog is cold and unfeeling relationships between characters is unclear and the action shots are redundant i get it they were trying to make a more traditional movie  but it fails at being even that the they sprinkled little nods to the classic like similar lines that end up just sounding forced     overall disappointing i was excited for an action kung fu movie but got a soulless knock off instead
Sep 6 2020,positive,good action but good for me too good story and i liked the 2 hour length we will watch it again
Sep 6 2020,negative,bad acting and boring the original was much better 
Sep 6 2020,negative,the dialogue was boring for a kids film the characters were forgettable the action was just okay the witch scenes felt forced mulan had very few lines in the entire movie which makes it hard to like her as a heroine
Sep 6 2020,positive,this movie was amazing admittedly if your looking for a replica of the animated movie this is not that movie as it only has some of the same storyline but if your looking for an amazing retelling and reimagining of the story then this is a truly amazing creation this is definitely a must see for any true disney fan
Sep 6 2020,positive,it was better than i expected loved the fight scenes they did an excellent job 1010 recommend
Sep 6 2020,negative,take the animated classic remove the music the humour and dragon and this is what you get plotline is stretched at best and makes some rather large leaps of faith which ultimately brings a confusing hodgepodge of events which make no real sense    best to avoid this one
Sep 6 2020,positive,great movie  cant wait to see it again
Sep 6 2020,negative,if we compare to the cartoon this is crap there was so much hype about this that im glad i watched this at home definitely not worthy of the big screen they shouldve done it in chinese this way they would be able to get decent chinese actors and the leading actress would do better instead of being insecure about her english i cant understand what she says rip i believe the director doesnt like the original story and decided to change it dumb woman rip too man they put a phoenix and a witch but they couldnt put a tiny dragon is it because the dragons voice is black and they didnt wanna black guy shitty movie
Sep 6 2020,negative,i didnt expect much from a disney cash grab but this broke the low bar id preemptively set this film was simultaneously overly complicated and simplistic lacked any and all of the joy and relatability of the original and felt profoundly messy convoluted and superficial none of the characters felt like believable people you wanted to root for none of the rare moments of comedy landed and none of the weak rushed buildup that shouldve given mulan depth and motivation came together in a sensible or significant way     the addition of the witch woman character as mulans darker counterpart was wholly unnecessary and distracting didnt make sense thematically and took away from the fact that mulans struggles are directly informed by her lesser status as a woman thus abandoning the opportunity for meaningful social commentary altogether the decision to give mulan a sister also felt bizarre and out of place since it went absolutely nowhere as did the decision to replace lishang with two new stiff onedimensional characters mulan never develops meaningful interesting relationships with these additions only help to highlight what this film lacks again the charm of the original     this same problem appears with the music the remake isnt a musical but there are references to the original soundtrack in the score and in some of the dialogue that leave you with a momentary placating hit of nostalgia before you realize that what youre actually watching is soulless boring and vapid ive seen that this was done to increase historical accuracy though i have to question how concerned the filmmakers are with that accuracy since im pretty sure this magical witch woman who can turn into a hawk has never existed     as my friend said about 15 minutes into this bitter disappointment this movie feels like when you need to sneeze but cant its hollow its depressing and though its almost on the verge of something good it never ever delivers
Sep 6 2020,negative,bad casting shitty storyline
Sep 6 2020,negative,i watched this movie doing my best to avoid comparing it to the original letting it stand on its own merit but even then there are so many problems with mulan  first the characters are static even the protagonist she starts out as a superhero and never has to change the training montage is pointless and uninspiring because mulan is already all powerful and no reason to learn anything new what results is a film that feels as hollow and empty as its shallow characters the action scenes provide the only humor though unintentional the dragon ball z  esque choreography has more to do with bollywood than anything else anyways it was bad
Sep 6 2020,negative,lapsap disney supposed to be musical but theres nothing at all
Sep 6 2020,positive,it was a great movie this version compared to the animated one which i love is more realistic and exposes how women were and still in some cultures treated as the weak ones who have no vote nor right to speak up their thoughts because a woman should be obedient and dedicated only to their family mulan gives a revolutionary change to this belief and empowers herself by acting up for her family amazing movie
Sep 6 2020,positive,this movie has some great moments like mulan finding her place however this is still very disney an entertaining movie to little girls but too fairy tale for adult
Sep 6 2020,negative,1 first of all the significance of mulan as a character is that she is not the chosen one she could be anyone and she succeeds by working harder than anyone else and by working to become a clever warrior she isnt simply born one of the greatest warriors of all time one of my favorite scenes of all time is when she retrieves the arrow at the top of the pole in the original this movie begins by throwing that conceit in the garbage saying that her chi makes her essentially magic and naturally good at everything if you want this movie to be empowering for women and young girls i dont think the premise that you dont have to work hard to achieve you should just naturally be good at everything is a healthy one 2 the acting is superb i think all of the parts are very well cast especially mulan and her father who provide nearly all of the emotion contained within the film 3 the cgi in this movie is absolutely terrible at times great at others there is no concept of knowing which at any given time in the movie 4 though i am a bit sad at the exclusion of the songs i understand it as a stylistic choice unfortunately they try to remedy this by including song lyrics as dialogue and it comes off very clunky every time they do it 5 there is little room for any sort of subtext in this film prepare for gems such as you are my slave and at one point donnie yens character straight up says i am your commander to introduce himself how much better would that scene have been if he had intervened in the conflict and peoples natural response to his authority revealed his character or if someone questioned his position and through that we learn that mulans fellow soldier comes from a place so isolated and rural he doesnt think to recognize the generals golden armor as a sign of higher status poor writing indeed 
Sep 6 2020,negative,mulan deserves better   best actors  promising trailer worst movie
Sep 6 2020,negative,boring and soulless
Sep 6 2020,negative,the directing is on par wit a disney channel show    poor choices with the score   weakest of the live action remakes   all the others i found myself smiling  not in this one
Sep 6 2020,neutral,it forgot about a lot of the important life messages that the original animated version taught us
Sep 6 2020,negative,not nearly as good as the animated version
Sep 6 2020,positive,so i expected this movie to be cheesy and overly cgi driven what i was surprised by was how it contrasted the actual trailer the movie took many liberties and steps away from the original animated one all of the changes are refreshing and seem to tell a more complete story the emotion felt more real because of better storytelling that makes us believe her sacrifice for her father and country more also no mushu and ancestors though they were just an accessory anyways means that the storytelling had to be carried by the actors and the relationships which were far more real feeling the choreography in the film was stunning they mixed traditional kung fu style choreography with hollywood style sword fighting and because of this it really gave a heavy not do chinese filmmaking without it losing its mass appeal for the general international audience that may not be into kung fu as much the cinematograpy was astonishing thats all i can say it used new perspectives movements ways of cutting that ive never seen in film which propelled the story in ways i though were brilliant now lastly for those who are worried about her superpowers she doesnt really have them she has a high amount of chi which is vital energy that is held to animate the body internally and can be expressed in eastern medicine with different martial arts i couldnt help but feel like chi is essentally like midichlorians but the way they use the skills she has is more similar to kung fu than it is magic or superpower its not gratuitous it is tasteful it doesnt solve all of her problems and she still has immense struggle throughout the movie which seems a much more lofty reward that is fitting for her sacrifice presented at the end
Sep 6 2020,negative,poor directing skills poor screenplay poor culture knowledge poor fighting design poor art design poor leader actress actingjust everything is so poori cant imagine how disney spend all 200 million dollars it looks only worth 2 million
Sep 6 2020,negative,nothing like the original movie the story is totally changed
Sep 6 2020,positive,mulan is an action film with heart reflecting its theme of loyal brave and true  its different from the original disney animated film as its not a musical and no mushu sidekick comedy  there are a few laughs along the way as well as some beautiful sets and kickass action sequences  a few pacing challenges prevent this from being 5
Sep 6 2020,negative,first thing this is not a remake like the other disney movies it is more of a full blown action drama with zero blood for pg rating and as such it sucked  but even by only looking at the movie as new mulan movie it was bad the effects were bad the camra work bad and the story was full of holes waste of time and money
Sep 6 2020,positive,really enjoyed the fresh and mature take on a classic movie great movie
Sep 6 2020,negative,boring af disney is obviously more capable than this crap
Sep 6 2020,positive,amazing movie a mix of old and new that keeps you guessing watch out  for the witch hawk
Sep 6 2020,negative,they said that they wanted it to be more realistic  wellit wasnt
Sep 6 2020,positive,like most of these  disney live action remakes  mulan lacks the spirit and heart of the original   my grade c
Sep 6 2020,negative,feels like some sort of bad dream  where i accidentally watched a power rangers remake instead of actually clicking to watch mulan
Sep 6 2020,positive,i really enjoyed this movie and prefer it over the animated movie since this a more mature version would had preferred to have seen it in the cinema but at least we have a large screen tv with a sound bar
Sep 6 2020,negative,it lost all of charm and wonder    youll love it if you love a story about a girl born with innate qi superpower abilities who when she sees a legendary creature for the first time is not surprised at all and in the middle of a battle strips off her armor lets down her hair and does bad 2000s chinese cablework thats supposed to mimic wuxia films    remind me again why does the most power witch in the kingdom take orders from a nobody and how does she die from one arrow when she can take on armies at once    if this movie teaches you anything its that girls cant do anything unless theyre born with super powers and take a shot for every time they say loyal brave true
Sep 6 2020,positive,great cinematography the storyline is pretty similar to the animated movie the story is about confucius values such as duty honor and filial piety i felt that what was lacking was the dialogue it felt forced and one dimensional however if it was filmed in chinese it would have been possible to add greater richness to the dialogue
Sep 6 2020,negative,you cannot just shoot a movie from the story line of cartoon with minimum changes movie is for adults and needs to develop the characters and story with certain depth not that straightforward as a cartoon for kids ang lee was smart to reject the invitation to direct this movie as a chinese i think he also learnt that this script only the first half is mulan and the rest is joan of arc with happy ending  overall it is just an ok movie but not a mulan as it should be
Sep 6 2020,negative,remarkably unremarkable and falling victim to the classic uninspired and unnecessary disney liveaction remake clichés   a onedimensional protagonist who despite not being a marysue based on source material is portrayed as one due to lack of emotions and character development antagonists whose motivations are thin and often dont make any sense a soundtrackscore whose only noticeable quality is a reoccurring leitmotif from the cartoon original sfx that look horrible despite a huge budget for the film humor that doesnt land scripting that was fine until something was supposed to be funny and then it took a nosedive in quality pacing that was fast enough to make the movie forgettable because i could not become emotionally enveloped in a scene a color palette that looks like my cat just puked out rainbow goldfish crackers     the only two redeeming qualities were the casting which was excellent and some of the shots of the landscape look up google images of various chinese landscapes in 4k and scroll around and you might be more entertained by that than by this movie
Sep 6 2020,negative,dialogue was poorly written and feels like the actors are not talking to each other but reading the script the addition of chi and witches are terrible and out of place  the emperor accepting a duel from someone infiltrating the city  that weird phoenix flying in the sky at random time  barely any character development with the comrades and what the hell is that love interest out of nowhere  and if you can have witches why not mushu no music this film is terrible
Sep 6 2020,negative,terrible acting skills we dont have that makeupjapan does we dont have phoenix in our temple our buildings in that age dont look like theirs we dont have witches  and why didnt mulan cut her hair before she joining in the army
Sep 6 2020,negative,absolute trash no mushu or great music
Sep 6 2020,positive,i feel like audiences were a bit too harsh with this film yes it doesnt have funny animated sidekicks but that was part of the movies power such that its not an exact replica of the animated film the downside is the movie did need a bit of comic relief and it did feel a bit stiff at times but overall it was a solidly good film  meet the new film on its own terms and youll enjoy it  and the new witch is awesome
Sep 6 2020,positive,a worthy adaptation of mulan although i wish it was in chinese and that some things were handled differently i really enjoyed this adaptation of one of my favorite disney movie it had heart really good action and likeable characters
Sep 6 2020,positive,i think that is movie is amazing it may not be what the 1998 mulan was like but it is more true to the ancient chinese story of mulan the visuals and the cinematography were amazing and the characters were too some people were not pleased with this movie but it was so good   i hope you like it
Sep 6 2020,negative,loved the original  if you are going to turn this into a live action epic with no music then go all the way  be real or be a cartoon  trying to be both does neither well    the battle scenes were cringe worthy bad  one example the imperial army goes into small clusters of shield wall turtle formation so the enemy rolls out a trebuchet  with pinpoint precision on their first shot from about 1000 yards they decimate an entire formation ok its a movie  this is fine  mulan starts looking around in panic to figure out what to do as she spends about a minute doing this they reload and decimate a second formation  mulan grabs a couple helmets off dead soldiers and rides towards the enemy  next scene mulan pops up about 200 yards behind the enemy hiding behind a wall of rocks on which she has placed about 20 helmets to look like she has a group of soldiers with her  it is totally inexplicable how she carried 20 or so large steel helmets traveled 700 yards through enemy lines without being noticed and set up a row of helmets all in about 45 seconds  but it gets worse  they turn around the trebuchet to fire at mulan except this time the crackteam of experts that can hit a small formation on each attempt fires over mulans head and hit near the top of the mountain above her about 1 mile away causing an avalanche  criiiiiinge  these constant leaps of absurdity were so distracting i couldnt enjoy it  i want my 30 back
Sep 6 2020,negative,a beautiful story terribly told characters acquire superhuman abilities but only seem to use them when the plot makes it convenient story action and character development all stunted by seeming removal of scenes that help things to make sense for example during one battle mulan mounts a horse and then is next seen just seconds later behind enemy lines without them seeming to have noticed or cared a phoenix appears throughout but mostly just serves as a quest marker to prod mulan along my wife is chinese she told me that the animated version was one of her favorite childhood movies she described this one as the worst movie ever i have yet to determine if she was being hyperbolic
Sep 6 2020,positive,i love the original mulan and this is not that movie after watching it twice  i felt like this did a better job trying to live out the ballad legend from china both in style and filming if you can watch it as its own story rather than comparing it to the original  it has an epic design that should encourage a new generation of warriors
Sep 6 2020,negative,for me this movie didnt really make me care about any of the characters i could not feel any of the emotions they wanted me to feel the editing was bad as things where just happen like if they just needed to check things off a list the villains didnt seem like they had a presents in this film their army looked small and none imposing as well not really sure if there was anything good about this movie the costume design and sets were nice but thats about it
Sep 6 2020,positive,a solid reimagination of the story of mulan there were some moments where you needed to really take a leap to believe a characters decision but great fights cinematography and i loved it when the music such a nice way to give homage to the musical
Sep 6 2020,positive,mulan will be all childrens idol because she is so cool  she kick the badguy ass  i also like xianniang  she is a witch  but helps mulan a lot  actually im kind of getting the couple xianniang and mulan   the music is very amazing  christina aguilera  has a beautiful voice and i love the loyal brave and true  go and see it or you will be regret
Sep 6 2020,negative,story and characters are silly but worth watching for cinematography could possibly win best cinematography
Sep 6 2020,positive,finally i watched itand its e of my favorite movies nowi will watch it again with my daughter
Sep 6 2020,negative,weak boring and while the old movie had something realistic this new offer bad magics to create a different story butreally boring and sometimes with nosense
Sep 6 2020,positive,i believe hua mulanbrave loyal true im cryingwith my puppy
Sep 6 2020,positive,epic lavish and exhilarating take on the well known chinese legend  nice more mature take on the animated hit sets and action sequences are breathtaking and definitely one of the best disney live action remakes loyal brave  true always
Sep 6 2020,negative,lots of special effects with very little character development you just dont really care what happens to the characters the entire movie feels very meh dont waste your money
Sep 6 2020,positive,its totally a disney movie dont be so seriousenjoy it with your family 
Sep 6 2020,positive,my mom has been waiting to see this called me everyday this week 2 c if i had bought it mulan  was amazing and filmed sooo well the dp did the damn thing similar to the animated feature bt totally different this movie felt realistic and raw in my opinion gave mulan  depth
Sep 6 2020,negative,the 2020 mulan feels really awkward to watch it struggles to find an identity is it a remake of the disney classic or is it a chinese epic the 2 doesnt really mix well good thing about the movie good action production and visuals other than that it falls short it also kind of alienates the female audience since mulan in this film from the get go is very powerful she is not relatable enough compared to the disney classic where you actually root for mulan and see her go through hardships they had 5 months hiatus they could have used that to polish and reconsider some scenes if they had the chance    overall its a movie where you just play it in the background for the noise while doing something else important
Sep 6 2020,negative,visually interesting but thats about it inexplicable cut away scenes a plenty used to show off attention drawing camera moves instead of to push the story forward
Sep 6 2020,positive,absolutely amazing filmand i didnt expect mulan to be this beautifuli like the colors
Sep 6 2020,positive,the cinematography is really excellentl loved it disney makes fabulous movies this is one of them 
Sep 6 2020,positive,it is a great movie i have seen recently and this movie has a splendid scenery all actors  are awesome  and im moved by the relationship  between mulan and her father  the core value of this movie is loyal brave and true  it does express such value and i believe  every girl can get power from mulan you can do everything when you or true to yourselfmulan is a village girl at beginning but she grows up to a general to protect her family and her country its very encouraging i love it so much and i cant wait to see it again
Sep 6 2020,negative,why disney why just make your cartoon with real people dont change the story dont bend the knee to china mulan is a mary sue like captain marvel you took out mulans journey to becoming great through her knowledge and resourcefulness  second the battles look like something my friends and i would record when we were kids back when we had camcorders and vcrs ie no blood blades not contacting and or hitting on the blunt side and people dying third and most important you took out mushu
Sep 6 2020,negative,being a chinese singaporeans im used to seeing some good fighting movies leave kunfu alone other western movies had some incredible fight scenes as well mulan fight scenes is just subpar the phoenix looks like a kite the story line is very asian american dont waste your money like i did
Sep 6 2020,positive,i love this moviereally worth to wait 
Sep 6 2020,positive,very nice cinematography and great sound editing the story while simplistic at moments keeps you interested and moves the story along at a nice pace nice ending   and feel good vibes i cant say enough about how visually and sonically appealing this movie is though even if the story had been less enjoyable i could have watched just to enjoy the spectacle nonetheless the story was also enjoyable so a job well done
Sep 6 2020,negative,something is missing in this movie  i am not talking about mushu or anything like that i am talking about the life essence of the movie  only the first part of the movie is enjoyable  everything else is blank and weird in the movie mulan just become stronger because she got that bigger chi  that look like force from star war they could had make it better even if they dont add any magic or chi because animation didnt even have a lot of magic interrupt with the story  the only magical is mushu and also the side characters are blank like they are just in there for the movie to continue if they are adding magic in it a least add mushu casting are amazing but the way that story goes is terrible i am giving 1  star and half because it is mulan and for all the amazing actors i am not good at english so sorry for any mistake that i make
Sep 6 2020,negative,i didnt necessarily have high hopes going into this movie in the first place but i was genuinely very upset that i didnt like it at the ending there was no disney princess magic that i adore and was hoping for it definalty strayed away from the original movie and did my heart dirty its my favorite disney princess movie it was missing literally all of my favorite things from the original muchu cricket literally all of the other characters and the music everything was changed i want shang i want romance there was this other guy who was kinda there to be her love interest but there was no development with that all the scenes from the original movie that i loved werent in it either for instance mulan cutting off her hair mulan working her way up to become a good soldier and not just being born like one the king of the rock scene literally any scene with the three dudes in the original any humor at all you know i could go on and on but i dont really feel like thinking about this movie any longer it was not lighthearted and funny like the original it was like a war movie that kept dragging and dragging i kept watching to see if it would get any better it didnt i even fell asleep half way through the movie the only good things i have to say about this movie are the gorgeous costumes and landscape i would recommend that you not spend 30 to watch this movie and just wait till december its not that good
Sep 6 2020,positive,so excitedmulan it reminds me of my childhood memoryloyal brave and truethumbs up 
Sep 6 2020,positive,i never watched the mulan1998i enjoyed this one 
Sep 6 2020,neutral,this is not mulan this is an entirely different story with similar characters i find your lack of mooshoo disturbing also the phoenix might be the most unhelpful character of all time hes kind of just there for moral support and all this garbage about chi i just cant enjoy it this movie is just to serious for me to enjoy and takes all the fun things from mulan like mooshoo and the songs out
Sep 6 2020,positive,a good movie but can be better
Sep 6 2020,positive,nice moviewe kept our eyes on the movie and couldnt look away
Sep 6 2020,positive,mulan live action has become my top 5 favorite movies    the message the movie delivers is so good my whole family loves this movie thank you niki liu yifei  and the production team for delivering such a lovely and epic movie in such a pandemic
Sep 6 2020,positive,it is truly amazingthough i miss mushu 
Sep 6 2020,negative,not worth your time first 13 is interesting and begins to build a memorable story sadly it then self implodes with eye rolling cheesy dialogue and a script that goes the easy and unbelievable path this left me feeling angry for the lost opportunity to tell a story of a breakthrough female in a male dominated world
Sep 6 2020,positive,i really enjoyed it its not a carbon copy like the other disney remakes and the changes work out for the best the changes are obvious no mushu but this works with the originality of the film  i was expecting a train wreck but i was really happy with it i would recommend this
Sep 6 2020,positive,shes so beautiful and brave specific and great

Sep 6 2020,negative,this movie was absolutely horrible it lacked the heart and imagination of the original the acting was wooden and the editing was odd to say the least dont waste your time and money on this garbage
Sep 6 2020,positive,love the girl  a women became a warrior thewomen can show themselves power  the best movie in 2020 for me  
Sep 6 2020,positive,i was so looking forward to this film it has its moments but overall very underwhelming
Sep 6 2020,negative,personally i was expecting it would touch my heart but no mulans acting skill was terrible
Sep 6 2020,negative,bit of a disappointment slow paced and poorly written lots of lost opportunities
Sep 6 2020,positive,as a girl i hope i can do everything
Sep 6 2020,positive,they did a great jobi really dont understand why there are bad reviewsplz dont act like a robot
Sep 6 2020,positive,amazing filmreflection is my number one disney songi cried every time
Sep 6 2020,positive,like the movie mulan 
Sep 6 2020,positive, wow i personally enjoy this movie a lot maybe its not perfectbut i really like it and thats all i wanted
Sep 6 2020,negative,the worst live action ever
Sep 6 2020,positive,absolutely brilliant with reminisce of the old mulan 22 years ago this is a must see for families culturally honest and significantly asian cast shows this for it is true honest and damn good watch
Sep 6 2020,positive,loved everything about mulan 
Sep 6 2020,negative,very disappointed disney lost the chance to make a memorable live version of a cherished movie instead the story was bland and uninspiring i know that is a challenge to make a live version from an animation but they make too many mistakes showing that whomever lead this project wasnt a real fan of the original movie nor the original mulan story   keep your stuff together disney you dropped the ball real bad with this one mulan deserved much more
Sep 6 2020,negative,the acting cgi and editing were all atrocious i couldnt believe the low quality for a disney film
Sep 6 2020,positive,the director and yifei have made mulan a stunningly beautiful film with dazzling colors and rich details
Sep 6 2020,positive,loved the fight scenes and yifei liu is so beautifuli cried more than once
Sep 6 2020,positive,mulan teaches everyone that women can achieve just as much as men
Sep 6 2020,negative,good soundtrack meh movie
Sep 6 2020,negative,no where near the original animated movie worst disney movie ever
Sep 6 2020,positive,made my eyes watery and my mouth gasping for air for its stunning visuals lavish costumes and set and spectacular fight scenes
Sep 6 2020,positive,created an account just to rate this movie like the fighting scene amazing song by christina aguilera no dancingdancing etc  good kbye
Sep 6 2020,negative,mulan is a perfect fighter right from the start no character development no special goals she has to achieve except to get some stronger upper arms by carrying water to be ready for the final challenge her superpower is her innate chi   does not stand up to comparison with the original
Sep 6 2020,positive,in my opinion its really fresh exciting and action packed would strongly recommend for a family movie or even a date movie i dont get why karens dont like it i like how they carry chinese virtue into this movie strongly recommended to watch 
Sep 6 2020,positive,mulan offers a good balance between calling back to its roots and giving a fresh take on the story
Sep 6 2020,negative,so many missed opportunities and strange edits after postponement from the pandemic couldnt you smoothen it out when you have extra timeto polish the product the cg is very jarring and perhaps not much can dazzle the audience now hardly historically accurate considering all the witches and wireworkassisted flying stunts
Sep 6 2020,negative,it simply sucks no story no culture thing just simply a twohour waste thing try use the 2 hours to do something else rather than this
Sep 6 2020,positive,excellent  wow  engaging and inspiring  great retelling of the mulan story  great cast
Sep 6 2020,negative,just an overall bad depiction of mulan the creators might think its a unique story from the original but it just felt unauthentic very bad editing acting and overall flow no character build up no scene of mulan transforming into the soldier very much lacking scenes showing how she matured into a strong soldier of course theres no mushu and captain shang which i knew before watching but they didnt add anything else so it really felt lacking a lot of dynamics mulan travelled to the training grounds by herself and did not travel with the other soldiers so that part was also cut from the original mulan movie they tried so hard to put some funny dialogues with the trio friends but that even became an awkward scene theres no po ling or yao in addition to this the fighting scenes were subpar and it became quite awkward when mulan kept doing the same flying kick moves just a huge disappointment i dont care that we have the movie on our disneyplus acct we will never watch this movie again
Sep 6 2020,positive,our family really enjoyed this movie
Sep 6 2020,positive,the picture of it is really beautiful of course the story and the soundtrack of this movie are also great
Sep 6 2020,positive,the movie is a very different concept to the original mulan animated movie its certainly not like a musical i would see this as an independent movie on its own love the graphics and actions and the values it imparts i also like that it is very attentive to cultural intricacies and did not attempt to westernise the story very original
Sep 6 2020,negative,spoilers tldr  just watch the original its better and doesnt cost you 30    while 2020s mulan can be compared to the recent liveaction adaptations of other beloved disney movies and seem to be a step up it still sits far below the original animated film in all aspects the original mulan 1998 conveys clear themes of empowerment for a variety of characters through its runtime while the 2020 adaptation lacks any such development for any characters     mulan has been reduced to a character who has little to no challenge getting her way instead of the strong woman from the original the animated mulan portrays a smart woman who knows her limits but always strives to be better and achieve what she sees as her ultimate goal of fitting in and bringing her family honour this new movie decides to replace mulans wit and cunning for a strength via magic which completely undermines what made the original so special to many including myself    the first couple minutes sees a fully capable 7 year old perform gymnastics off the top of a building and thus introduces a magic system of chi which is utilised throughout the film as a get out of jail free card which mulan can utilise whenever she sees fit in order to nearinstantly win a fight i fail to see how someone could watch the original film and deduce that mulan is meant to be just as strong as these people 3 times her size via magic instead of wit     it appears to me that the original message of being strong in different ways has been completely neglected mulan is simply a better fighter than everyone else due to her inherent chi the point of the original films message through the be a man song and training montage is to show that mulan is more resourceful than she is strong instead this movie chooses to just make mulan an awesome badass outright    the music is the most confusing thing about this film it requires a viewer to have seen the original to fully appreciate many scenes but then chooses to forgo the original messages these songs conveyed    i could go into the multiplicity of other issues i see with this film including  the lacklustre romance that i can not believe was even included when done so poorly  the lack of a clear male character who goes through an arc parallel to mulan  the inclusion of another strong female role who ends up reinforcing this narrative of  you can only be as strong if youre magic  the horrible fight choreography  and the list goes on    i will give props for casting an all asian cast to adapt this film it is sad that their performances go to waste on this travesty of a script i also understand that this movie is meant to be more true to the original source material but follows the story posed by the original film more so than the folk tale anyway which is why i draw the comparison    to conclude i see no reason in watching this film if you have access to the original by reducing the smart and resourceful mulan to a mary sue who is given everything she wants at every turn this movie chooses to opt out from any sense of empowerment the extra runtime is not remotely warranted and only serves for this film to make more and more mistakes further disgracing this character
Sep 6 2020,neutral,i dont know why it has come differently from what i expected missed the influence of mulan animation where are mushu and the other using phoenix i did not like and even its appearance is very cool i have not seen disney events at all well the story tells of a brave girl from a small village but using mulans name and then missing mulan animation supplements is not good for me  even jason scott lee acting as bori khan did not bring realism due to the physical body appearance better ron yuan would have acted as bori khan  this movie lost the touch of real mulan story because you change it a lot
Sep 6 2020,negative,main characters is just so  worst
Sep 6 2020,positive,sometimes i wonder how disney nails it each and every timelovable characters
Sep 6 2020,negative,this move waste my time
Sep 6 2020,negative,the editing were awful and the plot was too cramped and forced im very disappointed with the villain as they lose very easily theres no use putting the villain at all its pretty anticlimax especially the witch  and the most disappointing part is they eliminates a lot important small details from the originals  luckily didnt watch this on theater  poor movie by disney they should stop making remakes of the original legendary animation movies they had as the og watcher are adults by now and gen z probably would agree that this movie is a miss  1 star
Sep 6 2020,negative,i had zero expectations tor this film and even that wasnt met
Sep 6 2020,positive,a warrior become a leader and a leader become a legendim so glad to see my favorite milan
Sep 6 2020,positive,whooooo is that girlll i seeeeeeeoh myself
Sep 6 2020,negative,terrible movie it feels like a cheap chinese kung fu movie
Sep 6 2020,positive, how does liu yifei achieve such beautiful stuntsi really adore her
Sep 6 2020,positive,i am very satisfied with the growth and awakening of mulan in this movie
Sep 6 2020,positive,things i like    the production value   the cinematography   the color grading and color accents   every frame looks like a painting   the beautiful scenery    the battle sequences   i like the sets the palace the throne room the village    my favorite scenes   the scene with mulan and the witch in the sulfurous landscape   jet lis moments at the third act   whenever the witch was kicking ass    things i dont like   i hate almost the whole first act   i hate the dialogue so much and script   the dialogue were extremely clunky and cringey   many of the scenes where redundant especially at the beginning completely unnecessary    a lot of scenes in the first act were boring and dont really add value to the story   i really hate their lines the way the writers chose to word what the characters say the parallel conversations from the 1998 mulan were perfect why did they have to change the words of i know my place it is time you learn yours and she could be killed if i reveal her she will be were already perfect why change it   i found a lot of the side characters flat the mother and sister are so boring unlike in the animated film where grandma and mother had interesting dynamics   mulans friends in the camp werent really fleshed out this was really a missed opportunity mulans 1998 friend group were so such a joy to watch    overall    stunning visuals beautiful cinematography color grading production   good fight and battle scenes   flat side characters boring dynamics between characters   clunky and cringey dialogue redundant boring scenes that could have been replaced by scenes that could have developed the relationships of the characters better   bad first act good third act    i dont really like this movie but it isnt boring and i hope disney would make more movies with stunning visuals and strong female characters
Sep 6 2020,negative,how you gonna make the genie aboo and everyone for aladdin but you leave out mushu for mulan whack af disney
Sep 6 2020,positive,disney did an amazing job they didnt disappointed at giving us this real perspective of mulanwatch it twice
Sep 6 2020,positive,personal favorite disney movie primarily because of its themes
Sep 6 2020,positive,great animation moving score thrilling plot and a graceful portrayal of heavy topics
Sep 6 2020,positive,the parti suddenly miss my fathergave him a phone call
Sep 6 2020,positive,what a great movie hope it doesnt get a bad sequel
Sep 6 2020,negative,the movie was far off from the original and it was boring and noninspirational another action movie without any comedy drama or romance they took out everything that made the film great and left a serious mess of a movie i am surprised disney would cast such a mediocre performing actress liu yifei she has the competition poker face in the entire movie disappointing
Sep 6 2020,positive,theres nothing i can say but amazingi love mulan 
Sep 6 2020,positive,loyal brave true i absolutely loved it
Sep 6 2020,positive,great movie there was more to milans back story so that she didnt just mary sue her way through like disneys 1st attempt on the story i also like how they stay more true to the actual story this time around from the looks of the reviews a lot of people dont like it because it doesnt follow disneys cartoon version but that attempt ignores so much of the actual story to begin with so people hating the movie for that reason have no legitimate reason for their bad rating
Sep 6 2020,positive,great story and visuals a tribute to classic kung fu within this disney movie
Sep 6 2020,positive,thumbs upwell done 
Sep 6 2020,negative,this movie seriously feels like disney cant make up its mind on how to do remakes which i get a good chunk of people who are going to see this are loyal to the animated movies myself included but if you make the gutsy choice of not going with the flow of the animated movie and make a more reality filled version with no talking dragon and all the fun flair please stick with it     i was disappointed by the first trailer learned to respect how it might be time for a more serious tone for this story only to be let down again by an opening sequence where a little girl chases a chicken on rooftops and sticking a perfect landing from god knows how high without any injuries or repercussions the action scenes need an explanation the character developments need an explanation the amount of slowmotion facial closeups for not that much emotion need an explanation adding in bits and pieces from the animated movie as we go along and learn how this is actually a fantasybased movie too irked me to no end sprinkling in reflection was cruel to me     but on the plus side whoever was framing the shots not fight scene related and those who worked on the phoenix i could have watched that glittering phoenix happily for two hours straight instead of the movie and come out more satisfied deserve praise and recognition i hope to stumble across their handiwork in the future  oh and gong li still rocks whatever role they throw at her she deserves better
Sep 6 2020,neutral,disney has done it again they made another washedout liveaction remake of their classic animated feature attempting to cater to both the western and chinese markets but ended up pleasing either they took out all the things that made the original great and turned this movie into an empty chosen one story that failed to deliver the originals most important message with genuine effort you can be extraordinary even if you are born an ordinary person
Sep 6 2020,negative,this movie was so boring compare to the first onecan i give less then half a star pleaseno heart no comedy sad to see
Sep 6 2020,positive,mushus not present no musical part however it gave me more than what i needed to seei love it 
Sep 6 2020,positive,yesssss not only isnt it shot for shot but its original and good the costumes are amazing the set design fantastic cgi very little very good and choreography fantastic and awesome this movie is beautiful to look at in every way hope it gets oscar nominations i know people are upset that this movie took away the songs but by doing so it made the movie very different and original and realistic take it from me im a theatre nerd i was happy and surprised that they at least kept the funny side characters that mulan trains with i loved the use of wire works the villains are given layers which is nice the witch is cool and scary and does connect to mulan which is cool in empathetic ways i love all the characters it was nice that mulan was a mary sue meaning wasnt good at everything i love the nods to the original they kept some music as the background music which was cute i have to say they depicted the training ground and mulans day to day struggles better in this adaptation the animation is still fanatics but this one isnt trying to be better just trying to tell a new story of mulan check this out definitely the top 2 of liveaction remakes
Sep 6 2020,positive,loved it beautiful and catching
Sep 6 2020,positive,mulan gives me strengththanks disney
Sep 6 2020,positive,mulan was enjoyable n really my fav after aladdin
Sep 6 2020,positive,inspirational movie for your daughters a lot of lessons to be learnt here beautiful set pieces beautifully done
Sep 6 2020,negative,its not that its the worst movie but how has the older animated disney rendition far superior in just about every way all of the characters and songs u love are not in this movie at all    i would advise saving your self the 30 and either watching the animated mulan on disney or waiting till it becomes available in december
Sep 6 2020,negative,hot garbage what the hell was with the pheonix     also please consider remaking with shang
Sep 6 2020,neutral,lots of missed opportunities here however the movie did succeed in one thing it succeeded in making me want to rewatch the original animated film to wash the bad taste of such a lackluster live action adaptation      sidenote the unstoppable force of shan yu who made use of intimidation and sheer power of will and tenacity devolved into a khan who relied on underhanded tactics and an overrelliance on a magical force of which he had no respect for
Sep 6 2020,positive,stunning visuals and great pace but the gem of the movie is the depth of each character each one is driven by a force they believe in and whether or not you believe in them we are given the chance to understand what drives them there are so many underlying themes to this movie that are inspiring its never too late to take the noble path love this movie i regret not getting to see it in the movie theater several times gong lis work on her character  just amazing what she did would give it 5 stars except they dubbed over jet lis voice why
Sep 6 2020,positive,the grand spectacle and fantastic stunts are definitely worth watching it again
Sep 6 2020,positive,it was awesomemy whole family loves it
Sep 6 2020,positive,stay up until 3 am to see mulan it is so wonderful did not let me down
Sep 6 2020,negative,sort of like a disney star wars movie set in ancient china but joylesstoo serious in tone mulan rey uses her innate ability to utilize chi the force to jumpfly around fight scenes like a jedi and battle an evil dark robe wearing sorceress a sith no musical numbers no loveable companions no cricket a 30 dollar charge from a streaming service you already paid for and worst of all no mushu alright thats it dishonor dishonor on this film dishonor on disney dishonor on this films cow
Sep 6 2020,positive,mulan is incredible the best disney princess movie ive ever seen
Sep 6 2020,negative,not good apparently the story was supposed to be a drama but the costumes were comical and didnt seem to be a proper reflection of china during the time period that this was set in the storyline wasnt the best and the acting was soso would not recommend i would have liked to have seen more emphasis on real chinese culture throughout
Sep 6 2020,negative,how the critics liked this movie is beyond me it was a serious melodramatic movie about mulan having a strong magical chi power rather than what the original animated movie shows viewers and thats that with hard work and perseverance you can reach the top regardless of being a man or a woman no sign of mushu no singing all of these disney live actions are just not good i havent liked one when comparing it to the animated film dont fix what isnt broken disney the only live action that got close to being good was lion king but thats about it dont spend the extra money just wait till its released for free it redbox has it for rent trust me youre going to be sadly disappointed 
Sep 6 2020,negative,im not even going to mention the fact that these chinese characters speaks perfect british accent i rather it was chinese and reading subtitles    the movie just take something out of childhood mulan i rather they created a truer to life darker less dramatic version more action something so daring that only quentin tarantino would think of instead whats left is a ruined classic but i guess it is for disney and they gotta make it pgs if thats the case just leave the original to it perfection    i know there was another version of chinese mulan which was a darker but better cinematic created in 2010 its not a master piece but it was a lot better than this
Sep 6 2020,positive,it was really an amazing film i love the actions part so much
Sep 6 2020,positive,my family eat popcorn and watch the movie although it was a pity that we couldnt go to the cinema we are safe at home
Sep 6 2020,positive,the war scene is very thrillingbut its not bloody its suitable for people of all agesim going to take my little brother to watch it
Sep 6 2020,positive,this movie is really wonderfuli decided to give it full marks its my dish
Sep 6 2020,positive,just watch it and enjoy being entertained its beautifully done with authentic awesome chinese actors and an amazing female director whale rider enjoy
Sep 6 2020,positive,im being generous because i really wanted to like this movie and as a standalone movie its decent its tempting to keep comparing it to the original but try not to    it has a different message than the original but feels a little rushed they could have elaborated on some parts and cut out some others  but overall its a decent movie not amazing but not horrendous i wish they had spent more time thinking about the dialogue but the acting was superb regardless
Sep 6 2020,negative,the movie did not give justice to my favorite disney animated film no songs no magic no humor no wushu and the cricket it was too serious for me and actionpacked 
Sep 6 2020,positive,honestly you need to watch this movie like you havent seen the animated one if you put all the differences aside its a great movie not like the last airbender that everything was changed and it was horrible this movie was changed a lot but it was great 
Sep 6 2020,positive,if you want an exact replica of the animated original like lion king did then you will dislike the movie i know that for sure but if you give the film a try judging by what the movie is and not for the legacy of the 1998 mulan film then you may find depth and art in this piece  in my personal opinion i felt more involved in chinese traditions in this film rather than in the original
Sep 6 2020,positive,what should i say its amazing
Sep 6 2020,negative,the cartoon version is better horrible movie
Sep 6 2020,negative,the story did not catch my attention at all they basically did another movie and slap mulan name on it disney did very good for the beauty and beast live action   but did not fo the same treatment for mulan for some reason
Sep 6 2020,positive,it really was an amazing film 
Sep 6 2020,positive,this is the best live action adaptation of disney princess so far  mulan ftw myfavedprincess
Sep 6 2020,negative,lacks all of the magic of the original disney animation so bad i actually requested a refund
Sep 6 2020,negative,the movie is mediocre and hollowthe cgi is just bad ive seen tv shows with better cgi tbh the comedy is stripped away by yanking mushu out of it making it almost soullessi dont know how this got green litonly redeeming quality is outfits and acting kind of so it gets 210 from me
Sep 6 2020,positive,my girls are cryingwell worth the money paid for a family
Sep 6 2020,negative,awful they took the heart out of this movie absolutely terrible 
Sep 6 2020,positive,i preferred this live action movie than the original animated one awesome fights beautiful cinematography and a solid storyline
Sep 6 2020,negative,lousy fight scenes too westernized
Sep 6 2020,negative,for the most part the movie comes off as a humorless bland boring
Sep 6 2020,negative,disney has forgotten how to tell a story this movie is about two women with super natural powers  what happened to the story of the girl who became a soldier for her family where is the comic relief where is the inspiration  was there even a memorable tune  the original was an inspirational musical this is just a bad war story that is boring
Sep 6 2020,negative,trash terrible writing terrible acting no character development complete insult to the original mulan movie and the history behind it this utter disgrace of a movie should be banned for the betterment of society
Sep 6 2020,positive,this was a breathtaking inspirational story i may enjoy this better than the original and be a man is my ringtone this is really the best liveaction remake so far i loved seeing jet li and donnie yen in this film as well it was a cross between western films and eastern films and it did it well for a while i even forgot it was a disney film well done    i was a skosh disappointed that there were no songs however there was background music that is very familiar as several scenes and the closing song promises to be something i will learn for karaoke i would have liked to see romance or sexual tension of some sort the small bit they threw in was less than satisfying    over all i say see this film yes right now the 30 is ridiculous but it will be free in december i was not disappointed and i hopeyou enjoy it as well
Sep 6 2020,negative,bruh dont watch this 
Sep 6 2020,negative,it was very boring a lot of irregularities and the movie seemed to cut through scenes noticably quick it seems most of the budget was spent on the costumes the music was forgettable the characters were also forgettable the script was awful and felt like a bunch of puns they didnt really show the nobility of the chinese culture in the movie disney live film cgi is very noticably bad its also very easy to notice the villagers are sets in a few panels you can see strings and boards attached the message is nice but way too dumbed down even for children i wouldnt recommend paying for it and i suggest waiting until its available in december it was not worth the 30 price and was underwhelming someone should tell disney to first work on perfecting their craft before throwing out a bunch of live action films they should stick to animation
Sep 6 2020,negative,no spirit of the ancestor can be found in this film seriously disappointed inferior in every way   cgi sucks comedic moments fall flat the writing was bad dramatic moments have no emotion or feeling
Sep 6 2020,positive,i hope to see mulan again in the cinema the movie scene is really beautiful
Sep 6 2020,positive,i prefer the animated version but that doesnt prevent it from being a good movie
Sep 6 2020,positive,mulans new interpretation can be said to be very successful
Sep 6 2020,positive,this is absolutely a beautiful move with simple story dont think it too much
Sep 6 2020,positive,it was a great movie and my family and i enjoyed it very much
Sep 6 2020,positive,mulan is so charming
Sep 6 2020,positive,amazing film the message is strong its different than the original version which for me has more value a lot of people will criticize because its not the disney vibe musical  but i think they did a amazing job by bringing the message in another way dramatic powerful and amazing action as well
Sep 6 2020,negative,waste of time and money to watch this movie they ruined such a classic disney animated movie the editing is really bad acting is bad the action is horrible the storyline wasnt even good and why was there a freakin witch  that didnt bring anything extra into the whole plot horrible plot twist even the cg of the phoenix wasnt even that great the only good thing was the cinematography at certain parts people were really looking forward to it and disney took this in the wrong direction
Sep 6 2020,positive,mulan family viewing was held and the family loved the film especially my children they loved mulan
Sep 6 2020,positive,mulans message is a good one even if the movie uses some underhanded tactics to convey it
Sep 6 2020,positive,when the familiar soundtrack sounded i still cried it was great
Sep 6 2020,positive,a good movie viewing experience ready to watch it again
Sep 6 2020,negative,what happened who was allowed to produce and direct this masterpiece of straight garbage mulan the cartoon is about a woman who fights for her honor but also discovers who she is meant to be in life a warrior this movie portrayed nothing about that nice try at the attempt to just mention the words but not do anything to show it so rushed where the hell is mushu or cricket main characters were straight missing nothing like the disney cartoon this is a disaster worst disney remake  thus far 2020 year has been horrible and this adds to that 
Sep 6 2020,positive,beautiful scene graceful performance although it is a pity that there is no mushu dragon but i still like this film
Sep 6 2020,negative,i wish i had stuck to the original mulan and had not wasted my 30 on it i miss mushu and li shang too much the song that li shang sings in the original movie was something i remember fondly from my childhood so i guess this one was just never going to stack up in my books
Sep 6 2020,positive,the witch played by gong li is very attractive to me
Sep 6 2020,positive,a beautiful reimagining of the classic film
Sep 6 2020,positive,the effect of watching in the cinema is very good
Sep 6 2020,positive,with beautiful pictures and neat movements the mulan actress is completely vivid in her interpretation of mulan there is no more suitable actor for mulan than her the directors lens expression skill is also very good its a great movie
Sep 6 2020,negative,terrible just like the other disneys remakes mulan is born perfect and she gets no character development at all and my suspension of disbelief was completely broken by how unrealistic the army acted in regards to her true gender
Sep 6 2020,negative, the characters lacked background story   they removed some important scenes in the animated movie like the part where she sang reflection   the battle is not as intense in the animated movie and everything is fast   mulan is not the same without mushu   they casted jet li and donnie yen yet they didnt show much of their martial art skills   phoenix is just flying around doing nothing   they should hire a director who is very good in directing battles   they didnt build up 3 of mulans friends   what makes a disney movie is their amazing story and music disappointed that there was no musical at all
Sep 6 2020,positive,the movie is really good its definitely one of the best remakes of a disney movie with a modern teist i dont understand why the audience score is so low its unfortunate that it didnt get the big screen i think the low scores are honestly from haters because the storyline and the videography is amazing
Sep 6 2020,positive,this movie is great and deserves a high rating tq
Sep 6 2020,positive,this film is the best adaptation
Sep 6 2020,positive,liu yifei is now the first idol of young asian women
Sep 6 2020,positive,i have to say that i like mulans reallife version very much
Sep 6 2020,negative,the movie had some great artistic shots good choreography where it fails is the story it lacked depth there really was no character development them introducing chi to this movie detracts from her animated counterpart
Sep 6 2020,negative,it was a complete waste of time boring and dumb
Sep 6 2020,neutral,i knew the movie was not going to have singing and missing characters like mushu and shang along with others but i was still excited for it and wanted to see what theyve done with it     so before i get into the actual movie lets talk about the price the movie is 30 thats not including youre already disney price i see a lot of people complaining about the price but in the end its not an issue why because if you already have the subscription and you went to see mulan in theaters thats what like 20 if you go with someone plus snacks which is like 5 per item and on top of that you have a disney subscription at home so really think about how much youre spending and saving    my only issue with the price was that i didnt think it was worth the 30 and would recommend you waiting for it to come out free in december now lets talk about the movie    there may be some spoilers here but hey if  you saw the animated film you already know what happens well not really no songs missing characters like mushu and names are changed except for the name mulan the movie starts off with mulan already knowing martial arts and shes able to use the force just like luke skywalker but in this movie its called chi hope thats how its spelled the overall movie was very boring 20min into the movie and i already said to myself i didnt like it but i carried on hoping that there would be something to keep me in it there wasnt the fight scenes were meh not very long and nothing special about it other than her using the force there was no humor in the movie and a lot of it was very dry and you just sat there wanting something special to happen but it didnt a lot of the movie things they did just didnt make sense or wasnt needed and weird like khans bird is a witch or a chi force user and i felt served no real purpose and we all know in the animated version mulan ping goes to take a bath in the water and the three guys find her there well in this movie she goes to take a bath but her i supposed love interest for whatever reason finds her there takes his clothes off and goes into the water with her talks to her for about 10sec telling him mulan that hell have his back then walks out of the water really what was the purpose of that oh hey theres a man in the water let me take my clothes off and talk to him for a sec and just leave nothing awkward here lol     i just hope that for future live films disney plan to make like little mermaid and hercules that they stick with the original story and dont change it im fine with little things changed here and there but dont try to do something completely different or theyll fall very short like this movie did
Sep 6 2020,positive,i like the new take on the legend of mulan  didnt mind it was different version than a
Sep 6 2020,positive,this movie makes me want to travel to china more
Sep 6 2020,positive,this is an excellent disney movie
Sep 6 2020,positive,it was a wonderful live update the cinematography was flawlessly executed   costumes have a lock in award nominations its a disney movie so the battle action scenes have not one drop of blood making it acceptable for any age to enjoy jason scott lee was perfection as the villain all the actors were superb to be fair   they got the elements almost perfect considering i loved the cartoon
Sep 6 2020,negative,disney ruined the movie
Sep 6 2020,positive,a fun disney movie with an interesting premise
Sep 6 2020,positive,mulan is my favorite princess because she is nice and tough and she comes with brains i love her
Sep 6 2020,negative,this film is about as bad as i expected it to be though i did enjoy some of the action scenes from the titular character they write her as someone who is perfect from the start rather than her attaining these skills from her journey to find her self identity the character mulan is given almost no personality at all these last few complaints have some bias from the original but the lack of music comedy and the absence of the character mushu made this movie nearly unwatchable i would never suggest watching this again and would strongly advise others to not pay 30 to watch this below average film
Sep 6 2020,negative,this was the result of a studio not fully committing to one market and therefore pandering to both mulans stunning visuals and satisfactory acting by its cast minus jet list voice dub and the incredibly weak villain cant make up for its lack of a coherent storyline and pacing issues needed better editing and time to develop certain characters motives it seemed as though the movie couldnt decide between being faithful to its source material hence the mystical elements that arent really explained just assumed and disneys animated original as an asiancanadian this was the live action adaptation i was most looking forward to and its sorely disappointing to not even be a little impressed with this movie one wonders if the movie would have fared much better with a stronger asian presence in the production crew director fight coordinator costume designer and a little better editing to help the movie make sense at least then the movie would commit to one vision a little more and we would have a clear understanding of where it wanted to go instead of have random dramatic moments with little lead up just to give nod to the animated original
Sep 6 2020,positive,another fun disney movie
Sep 6 2020,positive,mulan is good because its adventurepacked funny and heartfelt mulan is truly great because it handles the topic of gender roles nearly flawlessly coming across as neither arrogant nor disrespectful mulan may not be a princess but this film is disney royalty
Sep 6 2020,positive,5 stars is as high as i can go huh oh well finally an asian heroine love the art style music and story
Sep 6 2020,positive,mulan go aheadancestor bless you
Sep 6 2020,positive,completely memorable for all the right reasons
Sep 6 2020,positive,neither good nor bad they try to mix two stories and it doesnt add up the essence of mulan is lost
Sep 6 2020,positive,a movie that is fun and entertaining
Sep 6 2020,negative,was an embarrassment to the original was a huge fan and it stayed true to almost none of the key story or likeability of the original    my kids got bored mid movie and left the room
Sep 6 2020,positive,i really enjoyed this movie it has a look and feel that is different from the animated version but the same story that i have always enjoyed also beautiful cinematography
Sep 6 2020,positive,mulan is just great everything about this movie is awesome it is fun griddy heartfell thrilling and it tell an amazing story
Sep 6 2020,positive,great movie mulan is so beautiful
Sep 6 2020,positive,one of the most powerful disney movies
Sep 6 2020,positive,mulan is the chinese tale of a girl trying to save her father and bring honor to her family
Sep 6 2020,positive,i loved this movie it was so well done and it was amazing how mulan changed throughout the movie
Sep 6 2020,positive,i really loved this one
Sep 6 2020,positive,mulan is so brave shes the princess counting on herself not other man i love the actions part
Sep 6 2020,negative,very awkward acting with lousy boring generic story line typical blockbuster cast quality only have many famous actors and actresses and nothing else
Sep 6 2020,positive,an amazing film with an amazing story with some of the beat artwork in any disney movie to date
Sep 6 2020,positive,loved it the scenery was so beautiful and the storys tale of courage honor and commitment to family is just as beautiful
Sep 6 2020,positive,beautiful film about empowerment love courage and finding ourselves at crossroads
Sep 6 2020,negative,boring somehow this film managed to cut out virtually all of the meaningful moments of the original as well as all of the humor theres no emotion no romance no dragon or cricket no glory theres a reason disney had to charge so much for it before the reviews got out
Sep 6 2020,positive,mulan takes a captivating funny and heartfelt journey to the east with sweeping musical numbers and extravagant presentation
Sep 6 2020,positive,very good story and the best princess
Sep 6 2020,positive,amazing cinematic shots really beautiful scenery and shots that seemed historically accurate but little to no character development and some of the fight scenes seemed like they were out of a cheesy bollywood action movie
Sep 6 2020,positive,mulan is so beautiful
Sep 6 2020,positive,after plopping down 30 my expectations were high  even with those high expectations  both my 20 year old daughter and i really enjoyed watching mulan  i hope disney will continue with this approach rather than what they did with lion king and aladdin
Sep 6 2020,positive,the movie was good with really great actors but this isnt really mulan its a similar story but its not mulan
Sep 6 2020,positive,cmon people just watch it and enjoy being entertained its disney recreating a centuriesold simple legendary tale not mad max
Sep 6 2020,positive,i have watched it three times
Sep 6 2020,negative,simply didnt dig deep enough in cultural importance and female heroin script and dialogue was too clunky and bland
Sep 6 2020,positive,my absolute favourite
Sep 6 2020,negative,really disappointing the characters had no weight i barely even knew their names and the movie itself had no personality it was just a typical action movie and a mediocrebad one at that
Sep 6 2020,negative,as a stand alone movie it was ehh okay if you will disneys remake formula all over this one time watch at best as a disney movie taking the music out was okay i was still excited to watch but there was no emotions none in the movie no character development either so you dont feel for any of the characters emotionally not even mulan herself random things are thrown in and the most pivotal points in the original are glossed over like nothing in the remake disney really had the chance to make this great and imo they really missed the markagain
Sep 6 2020,negative,a poor recreation failing to capture the lightheartedness of the original the cinematography and fight scenes were nice but ultimately failed to make up for the lost singing soundtrack
Sep 6 2020,negative,not a good movie didnt have the emotional feels usually expected from a disney movie action scenes left much to desire and the story was bad especially when compared to the original
Sep 6 2020,positive,one of the best disney movies ever
Sep 6 2020,positive,the best princess movie by far thats all i have to say about it
Sep 6 2020,negative,did not enjoy this movie at all  most of the live action adaptations are good this one is not
Sep 6 2020,negative,im chinese and i thought this move was boring as hell nothing happens mulan was too over powered without training my favorite part in the cartoon was when she was training and sang tells her you are not suited for the rage of war so back up go home youre through then mulan proves him wrong by climing the pole with the weights this shows mulan had to struggle and train her ass off to get where she is the live action dont have any of that i dont see any struggle     also the live action keeps on pushing the idea of being true to yourself but mulan was already over powered so i guess only be true to youself if you are super strong and have magical power but dont be yourself if you are weak     this move was just lame
Sep 6 2020,positive,it was cool with a little fighting
Sep 6 2020,negative,painful plot holes clumsy screenwriting inconsistencies and contradictions  not a single dimensional character humorless and lifeless its a kids movie so what can you expect  disney doesnt need talented directors screenwriters or actors anymore just create a hollow shell of a movie that looks good in trailers and rest on their laurels what happened to adroit storytelling skip if you can lifes too short to be duped by their remake cashcows
Sep 6 2020,positive,yeah as usual great characters great songs great action its expected
Sep 6 2020,positive,this is the first live action movie disney made from a cartoon that i really enjoyed  wonderful job  i highly recommend
Sep 6 2020,positive,i guess the bad thing was i feel like the film was rushing the plot also i loved the songs in the animation but i understand it would not fit as a musical with all the action and emotional moments
Sep 6 2020,negative,animated was way better its a meh could have been alot better
Sep 6 2020,positive,funny interesting main character
Sep 6 2020,negative,rey from star wars meets mulan enough said
Sep 6 2020,negative,terrible  this is definitely not the meaning of a live action
Sep 6 2020,positive,with all the reviews online thrashing it i expected the movie to be bad like 15 surprising it wasnt its average 35 if you dont compare it to the original disney animated film both films are based on a chinese tale but they differ in the vision and style of it if you compare it to the animated film then its a 25 below average for stripping crucial scenes and characters out of it the spirit of the story just changes and it weakens the movie i chose not to compare them is it worth 30 only there was at least 3 people watching it otherwise wait for it to be free on disney
Sep 6 2020,neutral,beautiful to look at but mostly feels flat
Sep 6 2020,positive,if you expecting a complete remake of the original you will definitely be disappointed there is no mushu but who else would be able to top eddie murphy i personally couldnt stand the lion king remake or new lady and the tramp  both being mere shadows of the originals the original mulan was perfect as is and this was a great expansion on the first
Sep 6 2020,negative,if i could give this a 0 i would the continuity errors and how the hell does mulan go from dirty soldier to pristine with makeup in the next scene save your 30
Sep 6 2020,positive,amazing cinematography action scenes sweeping landscapes and acting  our whole family enjoyed it    yes its worth the disney premium  subscription
Sep 6 2020,negative,this movie destroyed my childhood experience its inferior to the cartoon in every respect  especially the story beats
Sep 6 2020,negative,disney really missed the mark on this one the best thing about mulan is that she was an ordinary girl who used her smarts wit and strength to save china instead of keeping this essential component of the character for the live action version disney chose to make her a witch instead seriously i am so tired of disney movies that make it seem like the only way a woman can be powerful is if she has some sort of magic i am disillusioned with this new version of one of my favorite disney characters on top of that they ruined the bad guy the original bad guy was awesome and scary but disney made him look weak by adding some random witch this new witch character really took away from what made the story amazing and instead brought an element of absurdity that made no sense to the original story if they were going to put some ridiculous magical character they should have just kept the dragon sidekick  i was really looking forward to this movie and i am upset that it was so disappointing it was even a bit boring
Sep 6 2020,negative,dont waste your time
Sep 6 2020,negative,worst disney movie remake corny costumes were awful and the characters had no real feel to them
Sep 6 2020,positive,this is fantastic strong beautiful graceful and worthwhile it inspires niki caro directed this movie and was the embodiment of what mulan represents a woman rising in strength i cant flaw it in any way the acting was phenomenal  thank you disney
Sep 6 2020,negative,great cast but the movie says yes magic is the only way women can be warriors the movie feels rushed as if someone said lets write it shoot it and release it in two months ok im surprised they didnt leave a starbucks cup in the final edit finally no music not even a song thats just sad
Sep 6 2020,negative,cliche and disappointing storyline is redundant gaudy and deviates from original plot    disney could have done better not worth it
Sep 6 2020,positive,good movie i really enjoy it the mulan is the best crystal liu is bad ass
Sep 6 2020,negative,remove the unnecessary birdlady and this is a 3 star
Sep 6 2020,positive,if you are expecting a lighthearted liveaction version of the original then you will be thoroughly disappointed that being said the liveaction 2020 mulan movie was great to watch and had some amazing shots which would have been made better on an imax but my 4k monitor did just fine it strayed a lot from the original but one has to consider that the original was pretty racist in many ways especially stereotyping many different cultures and peoples unfortunately it did not include any songs that were not backgrounded music and i think that is what makes so many disney movies easy to enjoy i do think that some of the original songs would not have made sense in the context of the mood of this movie finally i would like to point out that unlike most of the other liveaction remakes especially the lion king mulan is very different from the original i think in this case that is a good thing because one it isnt racist but two it stands on its own not relying on something else overall i think it is a good movie to watch that is enjoyable for everyone
Sep 6 2020,negative,to much computer effects bad jokes in bad time and a weird mix between mulan animated an mulan the ballad
Sep 6 2020,positive,a unique take on the original that took on powerful themes disney made mulan a girl boss
Sep 6 2020,positive,i exceptionally enjoyed this masterpiece of a movie  the songs from the original animated movies
Sep 6 2020,positive,how you enjoy disneys remake of mulan depends on if you are the one of the intended audience written directed and marketed by a western company made me feel the mulan story has become less authentic and aimed to please western audiences i enjoyed the cinematography which shows a wide range of beautiful landscapes however there are so many elements that seem out of place includes basic costumes makeup even the marshal art elements the story itself also lacks character development shes already a child prodigy  no need to train to be a soldier a major sore spot of the plot line is that she decided to reveal that shes a woman to the chinese general way before the war ends which is so blatantly western even the actress herself lacks the wide range of emotions i would expect to see from playing the lead character overall its a decent entertainment thats about it
Sep 6 2020,positive,beautiful cinematography a bit too graphic and intense for younger children
Sep 6 2020,negative,i was expecting something different but this is definitely just plain bad this is a mediocre action movie that results insulting seriously it totally miss the mark with all its terrible special effects in the effort for making a girl look like a super heroine contrasting severely with one of the great messages about the older mulan who was a girl who entered the army struggled with rushed military training having little tools to her hand and even so beating all the odds and being a war hero in mulan 2020 that idea is not present at all and its changed by a girl who has a strong chi being really fortitude of spirit and by having that to have practically super powers wo grab arrows in the air to kick them and stab enemys to magically appear from behind the roron army yeah not even mongols were respected in this movie at all and to participate in some lame fight scenes i cant support this movie the older one is way more efficient delivering the right message and by giving instead another one of and old emperor who also has almost the same super powers than mulan bad movie disney please give a push to your older movies since aladdin you have fallen hard i really hope this to ve your rock bottom
Sep 6 2020,negative,the only good part was the background but other than that disappointing
Sep 6 2020,positive,the film is very different from the animated one but without leaving details of the original film its a new adaptation not the best in live action but not the worst speaking of the movie it takes a long time to start but in the development with the villains it does not take hold and finally the final battle was what i liked the most about the outcome of the battle as was the transition of the battle      in my opinion in general points it is to hang out and enjoy
Sep 6 2020,positive,such a great movie with amazing fight scenes
Sep 6 2020,positive,mulan was amazing i want to watch it again disney redeemed themselves after beauty and the beast with this movie beautiful remake slight shift to the story and it works loved it
Sep 6 2020,positive,it is quite different from the animated mulani prefer this version to animation version
Sep 6 2020,negative,nice colors no comedy character development emotion or anything at all this movie left me sooooo disappointed in every aspect even as a stand alone movie their are plot holes no feelings are care for any characters the cgi is really bad i guess you can say its ok bc its the first movie out in months dont pay for this movie
Sep 6 2020,positive, i cried twice in the cinemai was moved when mulan decided to face her true self 
Sep 6 2020,negative,if i could give 0 stars i would that was atrocious
Sep 6 2020,positive,themovie was great mushu was not on and instead replaced by a phoenix but who cares the story line was more acurate to what the culture knows so that is also fine as americans we may not like what it does now but for those that are familiar to the history of mulan would appreciate it more than us overall it is a great movie and very touching
Sep 6 2020,positive,great popcorn family movie mulan is more intense that i anticipated but never goes off the railsits for kids but its old school cinema and super beautiful its so well done i hope i get to see it on the big screen after im vaccinated
Sep 6 2020,positive,if only the movie were as powerful as its first trailer this would have been an absolute masterpiece unfortunately like the beauty and the beast live action it fell short
Sep 6 2020,negative,general story good cgi and some of the acting seemed subpar also the screen play wasnt great you could tell what was going on in fight scenes u til a moment of slow motion to give a reference
Sep 6 2020,positive,this is a good movieone of the best remakes  the landscapes are stunning and fighting scenes are terrificthe music is also so beautiful you will enjoy it if you dont compare to the original its not as good as aladdin though
Sep 6 2020,negative,as a native chinese the biggest issue i have is the bad writing many dialogs are poorly written culturewise from both westernamerican point of view or asianchinese point of view i can get past the predictable plot since its a liveaction remake but the story is very inadequately executed and several plotpoints are absurd and ridiculous many times i found myself asking  huh why would they do that    moreover even though its marketed as an action movie the movie is also lacking any impressive action sequences which could have made it more entertaining battle scenes feel small and many openfield sets feel confined and cramped i was expecting lotr or avenger level battles but instead i got a couple of dozen people doing some badly designed and executed martial arts in an enclosed movie set dont get me wrong you have a group of very well trained martial arts actors donnie yen jet li jason scott lee but feels like someone from a kungfu store in a stripmall came up with the fighting sequences hell the matrix has better fighting scenes than this    overall the starpacked mulan is an actiondrama lack of both what a shame
Sep 6 2020,positive,amazing shots of natural scenes i know some of them might taken from new zealand but the director really knew how to portrait and arrange the scenes the quality of image was astonishing   the plot was bit disappointing because this isnt the same plot but rather new interpretation of the original ballad based in the 11th century legendary   i think liu overall did a great job i can see her becoming a symbol not only to asian americans but also a symbol of female empowerment bravo
Sep 6 2020,positive,this film has stunning visuals beautiful cinematography excellent balance and transitions between action sequences moments of solitude and reflection simply gorgeous in and of themselves and a fantastic score that somehow enhances the emotion of it all
Sep 6 2020,neutral,does not pay homage to the original like other recent disney remakes quite let down as the trailer was pretty good too many times watching this movie i was scratching my head as a lot of the action scenes made no sense mulan may be good for youth but perhaps the adult audience can give it a pass glad i did not pay to see this 
Sep 6 2020,positive,this movie incorporated some info from the original movie but it mostly incorporated the real life storylegacy of mulan that lived hundreds of years ago and her culture this movie is great like the original but also can stand on its own out of all the adaptations disney has made this was the best one if i can rate it more than 5 stars i definitely would
Sep 6 2020,negative,as every other disney remake they rely on your sweet sweet childhood memories to paint over the disappointment the continuity falls through i cant tell if shots were taken out or if there was so much reshooting throughout the filming that they forgot to go back and fill in holes and transition points the dialogue is weak the visuals fall through too often and you will only truly know how to connect name to faces by looking at promotional posters character motivation is unclear or nonexistent or somehow fits in this sense of nationalism that feels misplaced and also there is just this very weak plot line with reasonings for why things are happening that just do not make sense critical scenes in the original version were powerful and shocking yet become weak and unbearable to watch because of their butchery the fatherdaughter relationship for mulan was not built up as it was in the original and felt so antagonistic because they only focused on the conflict between them and the animation was just subpar on what disney can truly offer if i could go back i would stop myself from buying this the only joy came from all the mocking and jokes my family and i made over this low quality fiasco disney has turned mulan into also phoenix guide what even was your role you just flew around and looked pretty
Sep 6 2020,positive,loved everything about mulan the script the acting the action the messages the scenery the special effects fantastic
Sep 6 2020,neutral,way too many cringe worthy moments  fighting scenes were so so  story twist compared to the animation were enjoyable so theres potential  missed opportunities  like the release directly to streaming
Sep 6 2020,positive,missed the songs and some of the animated characters but the live action fight sequences more than made up for it
Sep 6 2020,positive,its really a pleasant surprise to have jet li
Sep 6 2020,negative,this movie is a poor example of a live action remake it neglects the integrity of the original movie and argues that a woman can only be strong and impressive if she is gifted with chi that men lack instead of just being a strong woman and warrior of her own merit this movie missed and neglected so many opportunities to allow chinese culture to truly shine such as having the movie in chinese with english subtitles this movie is an utter disappointment and i would not recommend watching this movie if you enjoyed the original or just dont want to waste 2 hours on the mediocre creativity from disney
Sep 6 2020,positive,the movie is based on the original story but from a new perspective which is refreshing
Sep 6 2020,positive,disney definitely put efforts into building a woman warrior i love the action scene when mulan fights with enemies i can tell they research a lot into the ancient war and chinese culture from the details in the movie gorgeous actress amazing story a mustsee movie thank you disney
Sep 6 2020,positive,absolutely loved it a must see for everyone
Sep 6 2020,positive,the original mulan is one of my favorite animated films and this remake brings honor to the mulan family

Sep 6 2020,negative,i really wanted to like this movie but it was uninspired with a boring plot with no stakes wooden acting and zero character save 30 and watch the original 
Sep 6 2020,positive,loved everything about mulan the script the acting the action the messages the scenery the special effects fantastic
Sep 6 2020,positive,the movie keeps its original story with some adaptations to the 2020
Sep 6 2020,negative,do not pay 30 i loved the original because it taught you woman or man you could do just about anything if you work for it here talent skill and power isnt earned its something youre born with totally unrelateable poor attempts at humor and the only times i remembered it was a disney movie was sadly during the action parts 
Sep 6 2020,positive,fantastic movie the directing was great the story was what mulan is straight and to the point they focused on chi which was nice the acting was also very good
Sep 6 2020,positive,this is must watch
Sep 6 2020,positive,this film has stunning visuals beautiful cinematography excellent balance and transitions between action sequences moments of solitude and reflection simply gorgeous in and of themselves and a fantastic score that somehow enhances the emotion of it all

Sep 6 2020,positive,movie is great its very different from the animated film in all the best ways stays more true to the ballad of mulan
Sep 6 2020,positive,this was one of the best live action adaptations this is a more mature version of the story
Sep 6 2020,positive,i guess the bad thing was i feel like the film was rushing the plot also i loved the songs in the animation but i understand it would not fit as a musical with all the action and emotional moments
Sep 6 2020,positive,i found the movie to be a bunch of clips edited together there was poor transition scenes and weak emotional connection
Sep 6 2020,positive,i totally recommend this movie this and aladdin have been the only liveaction that i have really liked mulan fits so well it was emotional and empowering
Sep 6 2020,positive,its epic gorgeous and respectful of chinese culture
Sep 6 2020,positive,family friendly appreciated the values modeled definitely better than disneys other live action remakes
Sep 6 2020,negative,while i understand that this is closer to the story of mulan and not the animated movie from 1998 i feel left wanting more more substance more action more heart where the movie succeeds is in the cinematography beautiful scenes what it needed was more story and heart it is almost as if they forgot they were telling a story and threw in a guy half way along to remind us about the story the action scenes were seen in the trailer substance was lacking due to the runtime and the story that needed to unfurl it was rushed when touching on the animated movie it fell flat the wittiness and comedy were replaced with oh by the ways and oh ya insert punchline here moments and even then felt like they were ticking a box
Sep 6 2020,positive,good story and special effects uplifting voice for equality
Sep 6 2020,positive,never saw the cartoon so i wasnt sure what to expect with this one but it was a really good movie love that my granddaughter saw it and wants to be mulan for halloween
Sep 6 2020,positive,the action scenes are breathtaking enough even though other movies have done it better unlike a lot of live action disney remakes this one tries to be different and does it in spades there is still some comedy in this movie which was nice though some of the new story elements took away some more empowering moments and emotional ones too i still found myself lovingappreciating it the visuals were spectacular and it made me wish i saw it in a theater but the story captivated me a i didnt think about that too much
Sep 6 2020,negative,the first 30 minutes are great and the visuals are stunning but past that the characters are flat and the dialogue is terrible the film feels both rushed and too long
Sep 6 2020,negative,bad lead actress the cartoon versions much much better period
Sep 6 2020,positive,focused on the development of history and character the true essence of mulan outstanding film
Sep 6 2020,positive,absolutely jaw dropping a stunning take on the orginal film and legend mulan without feeling like a complete scene by scene remake lion king the beautiful visuals story telling and nods to the animated film  such as the orchestral soundtrack and quotes give a nostalgic feel to those who love the first movie like myself i believe anyone who is going in thinking the movie will be very similar to the original should change their expectations and give this stunning movie a chance to be its own
Sep 6 2020,negative,bad acting bad script the movie felt rushed and did not do the original cartoon justice at all
Sep 6 2020,positive,mulan 2020 strays from the original story of the animated version yet retains the same message the visuals are incredible though some parts of the cinematography throughout the film just dont work too busydistracting although it wouldve been enjoyable to see all the old characters and scenes it made the most sense to carry the film in the direction it was taken in the director and writers managed to ground the film in reality even with the exception that it includes magic or chi as a plot point given this the film still makes it possible for anyone to achieve the main goal message that this film preaches loyalty bravery truth  and devotion to family
Sep 6 2020,negative,if this movie existed in a world without the original i would have given a 3 or 4 star but in comparison this is pure garbage
Sep 6 2020,positive,amazing i think it captured the essence of the original mulan 1998 and the history of china the beautiful scenery and the powerful message completely captures everything i loved it and if you love actionadventure and comedy this movie is for you
Sep 6 2020,negative,disney please stick to the script we dont want you to change the classics this movie was your worst mistake ever youve ruined mulan
Sep 6 2020,negative,the movie took all the parts of the original mulan and failed to incorporate the most memorable aspects of the movie no singing no mushu or the cricket lack of comedy movie felt more like a remake of crouching tiger hidden dragon than it did of mulan disney has given us a huge flop and failed to deliver to its viewers
Sep 6 2020,positive,excellent recreation of mulan  loved the plot cinematography portrayal of characters  different from the cartoon which is appreciated  love to see different cultures being portrayed through mainstream film  also does not hurt to have more female heroes for women to identify with
Sep 6 2020,positive,the film represent the true real legend of the story mulan and not the anime one weve been serve sevral years before this version emphasizes and amplifies the image of the warrior that true chinese legend tells adding the witch character only strengthens a womans skill in a war
Sep 6 2020,positive,this movie is really wonderfuli decided to give it full marks its my dish
Sep 6 2020,positive,its hard to say whether the impact would be any greater without the sillly forced english speaking there is enough entertaining action and a few touching moments but ultimately it is not as rewarding as you might hope
Sep 6 2020,positive,it was great i loved the story and the vfx the casting for the movie was outstanding the costumes hair and makeup specially the costumes were spectacular and the storytelling was spot on its a very fresh interpretation for a very popular tale
Sep 6 2020,negative,i wanted to like this movie so much  but this isnt even close to being mulan its a completely different movie its witches parkour and fake martial arts terrible    however if you just look at it as an action movie its something i would watch on hbo or netflix not something i would otherwise pay to see
Sep 6 2020,negative,the movie was a far departure from the animation version no cricket character no mushu not to mention the preditory nature of the release 30 to watch on top of a subscription fee oh and if you decide you dont want disney anymore you cant watch the movie you spent 30 on this movie is just sad disney is really becoming harder to stomach
Sep 6 2020,negative,this is the type of garbage you get when disney tries to make a movie for a chinese audience remember the reasons you loved the original movie the music the humor the lovable characters disney decided to replace all that with people defying gravity by running up walls and doing horse acrobatics using the magical force of chi theres very little substance here but hey its pretty
Sep 6 2020,negative,this is like most of the remakes a massive disappointment with the one exception being the jungle book  most of the five star reviews look like they were paid for and written by a pr team where the hell is the music and the charm of the original  its never funny never inspiring never engaging the acting is awful poor character development  and absurd magic chi the force i guess story is ridiculously dull  its like watching a 200 million student project almost fell asleep several times     the action is kinda cool as it can be for a pg13 and the sets are beautiful so it saves a star
Sep 6 2020,positive,i absolutely loved the movie
Sep 6 2020,positive,cmon people just watch it and enjoy being entertained  its disney recreating a centuriesold simple legendary tale not mad max its beautifully done with authentic awesome chinese actors and an amazing female director whale rider enjoy

Sep 6 2020,negative,waste of time completely unrelated to the original no motivational music witch woman changes the whole dynamic of the story so dumb

Sep 6 2020,positive,so proud of the amazing work and visuals
Sep 6 2020,positive,mulan is so brave shes the princess counting on herself not other man i love the actions part
Sep 6 2020,positive,amazing live action remake of the original well worth the money paid for a family of four id highly encourage you to not boycott this movie a lot went into this production and it shows with covid and a lot of theaters closed i can appreciate any production company thats still trying to bring entertainment to our lives even in an albeit different setting you can either support them or lose them forever
Sep 6 2020,positive,amazing job the best disney live action adaptations are the ones that dont follow the original to the tee but instead take the basic concepts are go a slightly different route and this is a perfect example i didnt want it to end and for those of you complaining about having to pay the price of around 2 tickets to see this its worth every penny i loved it
Sep 6 2020,positive,i absolutely loved the movie
Sep 6 2020,negative,corny tacky cash grab the script was complete garbage and the acting was subpar they said they didnt put mushu and cricket in the because they wanted to make it more realistic but then turn around and put a woman who can shape shift into animals and other people and dont get me started and the cgi the only thing this movie had going for it were the short fight scenes long story short im done with disney live action
Sep 6 2020,negative,mulan 2020 was a chore to watch the main character was bland and there was no chemistry among the cast the pacing was rushed and the acting was barely average in the end i felt nothing for the characters the film may have excellent visuals and set design but the screenplay and direction were really bad
Sep 6 2020,negative,waste money and time
Sep 6 2020,positive,i just got done watch mulan and it was a very awesome movie it has an all star cast that does not disappoint the story was beautiful and the action was great i give it 5 stars
Sep 6 2020,positive,i absolutely loved the movie
Sep 6 2020,negative,what has happened to disney look how far have they have fallen they went from making unforgettable family classics to this garbage    to be honest i went into this with a negative perspective knowing in advance all the changes they made that said it was worse than i expected it was like watching a cheap foreign film with good and terrible green screen effects in english  it youre expecting a good family fun mulan film this isnt it theres a bad chinese version with subtitles out that is much better than this crap
Sep 6 2020,positive,i thought the remake was even better than the original
Sep 6 2020,positive,not sure why there were so many critical reviews it was quite good so there arent any songs so what it had good acting and a good story 
Sep 6 2020,positive,they didnt ruin it after aladdin i was horrified and also skeptical of there subsequent live action remakes im so glad they went in this direction a beautiful film about empowerment love courage and finding ourselves at crossroads it was everything i hoped for as the original disney version was my favourite movie growing up and an incredible cast
Sep 6 2020,negative,the movie mulan thoroughly disappointed me i do not recommend watching this overpriced movie that does not live up to the expectation of the original the plot was overall sloppy and completely rushed from beginning to end i felt as if disney did not care or cater to the viewers or the previous movie honestly no excuse can cover the fact that they ultimately did not care about the movie and had no regard to the actual culture this is honestly insulting
Sep 6 2020,positive,so proud of the amazing work and visuals
Sep 6 2020,positive,so proud of the amazing work and visuals
Sep 6 2020,negative,super meh   nothing about it felt disney if youre going to changeadapt a classic tale then it needs to be great   it wasnt   mulan2020 or mehlan as well are calling it is like crouching tiger hidden dragon meets troy   except those movies were actually good   very disappointed
Sep 6 2020,negative,boring no funny no music no romance no mushu no cricket no lee shang 
Sep 6 2020,negative,the movie was trash the overall writing was poor and the constant action cuts were completely jarring
Sep 6 2020,positive,i absolutely loved the movie
Sep 6 2020,positive,it did not have many of the original mulan scenes and musical portion but all in all it is a mulan story great cast and very well done enjoyed if for sure 
Sep 6 2020,negative,it was more like a trailer where they rushed through bits with no flow to the storyline even if they made it a series it would have been much better than what i saw this could have been the next game of thrones if they made it into a series
Sep 6 2020,positive,best movie i watch this year highly recommend 
Sep 6 2020,negative,the movie was far off from the original from so many ways the main character mulan didnt tell the audience the whole story of her being a clumsy girl trying to help her dad not go to war and finding her way to be a part of the comrades the character lacks personality her lines are so little and doesnt tell us her journey like the original 30 for this movie is absolutely not worth it i feel even more angry that this movie has ruined my memories about the original mulan
Sep 6 2020,positive,okay mulan like wow absolutely beautiful see it my favorite live action disney adaptation yet the martial arts rock the sets and scenery are stunning the acting superb the story moving and the battle scenes epic this is a must watch
Sep 6 2020,positive,i absolutely loved the movie
Sep 6 2020,positive,mulan was incredible the best disney live action remake ive seen
Sep 6 2020,neutral,well i definitely went into this one with a lot of expectations but it ultimately turned out disappointing its a situation where the first half of the movie sets up a promise for a good time but then takes you to the peak and leave you high and dry i feel this movie could use a lot more depth than what was given i dont think its cinema material feels well suited for a streaming platform with chances to hit and miss
Sep 6 2020,positive,i loved everything about mulan  the script the acting the action the messages the scenery the special effects  fantastic
Sep 6 2020,neutral,felt like i was watching a low budget karate movie
Sep 6 2020,positive,this film had exceptional talentbeautiful visualsand a compelling narrative
Sep 6 2020,positive,very different from animated but it fit the times
Sep 6 2020,positive,i dont get all of the haters maybe people are uncomfortable with things being different from when they were a kid this version mulan was beautiful and strong cinematically and artistically from start to finish amazing cast they embodied the characters and made them so lovable the training scenes fight choreography was super awesome cinematography was so vivid and amazing we loved it i think you will too 3
Sep 6 2020,positive,touching and emotional
Sep 6 2020,positive,great movielots of actiongreat cast good storyeven bad a tear at the end
Sep 6 2020,positive,overall i think it was pretty great  nice action although not a typical disney movie for young kids as this was a more adult somewhat violent version compared to the animated version
Sep 6 2020,positive,was this really a disney movie
Sep 6 2020,positive,such a powerful piece connecting familytraditionand martial arts
Sep 6 2020,positive,so proud of the amazing work and visuals
Sep 6 2020,positive,did not miss the cartoonish elements at all
Sep 6 2020,negative,ruined my favourite disney movie i get not making it a musical but the other changes were too much acting was awful
Sep 6 2020,positive,did not miss the cartoonish elements at all
Sep 6 2020,positive,i enjoyed the fact that this new mulan kepy it simple they didnt try and outdo the original and it was great to see
Sep 6 2020,positive,modernperhaps more adulttake on the original story
Sep 6 2020,negative,if i could give this zero stars i would ruined my favourite disney movie
Sep 6 2020,positive,the plot of the film is fascinating and wonderful
Sep 6 2020,negative,literally made no sense at certain points also why is mulan a witch now and why are her powers essentially plot armour
Sep 6 2020,positive,i thought it was fantastic it was an exciting movie and i thought the storyline was captivating
Sep 6 2020,negative,the animated version of mulan was my most favorite movie as a child and was hoping that this movie will do well it missed a lot of opportunities in the end they didnt include the key parts in the original and as a half chinese i feel like theyre trying to make it seem like the dramatic chinese action movies without the dramatics i think they tried to make it as realistic as possible but the lost me with the introduction of the witch its a watch and never going to revisit again movie for me compared to the already scratched and replaced dvd of the original mulan for me
Sep 6 2020,positive,watch the movie on its own merits rather than comparing it to the animated version great action movie with strong female characters
Sep 6 2020,negative, very inaccurate portrayal of chinese culture the cartoon itself was more accurate   destruction of the struggles and character of mulan itself    badly edited especially the battle scenes location changes constantly without proper justification the backgrounds are definitely no where close to how china looks like   many cringe and cheesy scenes   was actually not just bad but boring checked the movie time lenght many times while watching the show
Sep 6 2020,neutral,poor effects poor acting poor writing    looks like a chinese tv fantasy drama rather than a 200 million dollar disney movie
Sep 6 2020,positive,the only disney liveaction remake that ive been genuinely looking forward to mulan is definitely the best of the bunch though thats admittedly a low bar to clear the main reason i think it works is that it doesnt necessarily feel like a live action remake more like a modern rendition of a classic tale the story of mulan goes back thousands of years and this version tries its best to be respectful to the legend itself and the culture which produced it i loved the cinematography i liked how many of the side characters get some kind of personality regardless of how little screentime they have and i enjoyed the choreography of the fight sequences which owe a lot to crouching tiger hidden dragon and the matrix fitting since the latter itself owes a lot to asian martial arts however the film is far from flawless from a practical standpoint the most notable issue for me is the disguise adopted by our heroine in the animated version mulan was drawn more androgynously and looked more like someone who could be mistaken for a person of the opposite gender but in the live action film yifei lu always looks like a woman regardless of what they do with her hair or costume she sticks out like a sore thumb and it makes no sense that nobody wouldnt notice also the battle sequences one of the best parts of the original and one of the films big selling points dont feel anywhere near as epic as they should do and with an unmemorable score throughout many of the big moments didnt hit as hard as they could have a lot of the films flaws didnt really hit me until after id stopped watching when i had a chance to stop and think about what id just seen but while i sat there watching it i never felt bored or annoyed it was a great viewing experience and with a few tweaks it could be even better im so glad it wasnt like the previous remakes which usually stuck so close to the source material that they were rendered completely redundant it has its critics but for me mulan is at the very least a step in the right direction
Sep 6 2020,positive,was a great adaptation of the animated mulan
Sep 6 2020,negative,so disappointing they butchered a classic movie took out all the disney magic it was dark and depressing almost turned it off and left but i kept thinking it has to get better but it didnt   taking our vitals characters was a huge mistake adding in characters with no storyline or point just made it confusing  they changed it so much they couldnt even use the fa family as in the original  lets not even mention the fact not a single song  garbage do not waste your time or money   i adore mulan but it was so bad i had to watch the original movie right after to remind myself that i do love the movie
Sep 6 2020,positive,watched this with the whole family  it was definitely worth the 30 i am blessed with two beautiful daughters and they both enjoyed mulan did anyone notice the character who presented hua mulan to the emperor  his court is actually the voice of mulan in the 1998 original highly recommended for the whole family 
Sep 6 2020,negative,it has bad effects and wants too badly to have the flare of a classic martial arts chinese movie but it fails its a shame because the cast is great except by the main couple
Sep 6 2020,negative,i honestly think this is probably the worst disney movie ever made  no wonder there was no cinematic release the fact this costs 20 on disney is a joke id never watch this film again other than for a cheap laugh at the unbelievably terrible over the top special effects unnecessary antics and just plain stupidity in this plot    the original was amazing this doesnt deserve the film title name  it is over the top pandering to a chinese audience and reminds me of 1990s bollywood   its honestly the biggest pile of garbage ever made from disney  it makes me sad
Sep 6 2020,negative,as a chinese american this movie was utter trash add mushu back in at least i can laugh at that like haha oh disney magic nonsense again i didnt need to watch this mockery of wuxia films waste of talent except i was never a fan of liu yifei terrible script the only upside were the visuals
Sep 6 2020,neutral,it was an okay movie all around with a good story but nothing that really pulled it never felt like a long movie it never dragged on but the story just felt so shallow characters and the storys foundation were never developed much more than the cartoon version so it didnt do much more for me than a childrens movie either  oh well
Sep 6 2020,negative,super bland no jokes nothing memorable about the sound track nothing emotional  pacing was just wrongyoud expect with such a long time training theyd be some character building we could enjoy in therenope  wasnt super crappy and made me mad just wont ever rewatch this movie ever so thats why the score
Sep 6 2020,positive,the cgi at the beginning of the movie low key sucked for a multi billion dollar company other than that this movie was amazing i loved it so much yeah its missing the songs but you can always watch the original animated movie if you miss it that much this live action adaptation was beautiful
Sep 6 2020,positive,great movie yifei is getting better day by day moreover she is pretty in every second of the movie
Sep 6 2020,positive,its overall a good movie has some solid acting some good scenery shots but did it feel like i was watching a disney movie no did it have any of that disney magic no did i kinda miss it yes
Sep 6 2020,positive,great movie for kids and adults loved how they seperated themselves from the cartoon version in subtle ways and in some major parts 
Sep 6 2020,negative,they ruined my favorite disney movie
Sep 6 2020,negative,bad with ridiculous moments and was sold as a live action but it is not
Sep 6 2020,negative,no mu shu and crikee very slow paced fell asleep
Sep 6 2020,negative,boring no humor none of the original scenes plus cost a fortune to access 
Sep 6 2020,negative,i just finished it it didnt have to be bad  watching it you can see so much bloody potential  its depressing how those opportunities are completely wasted  halfassed its almost as if this film had too many people involved trying to influence the storytelling it reeks of corporate disney assholes trying to control and change everything around instead of letting the creative people do their job  all that money wasted on unnecessarily dramatic effects instead of actual storytelling this was a pale shadow of how the legend of mulan should be told one of the strangest movies with some of the laziest storytelling ive seen in my life the over the top martial arts was bizarre  it gets annoying do people really enjoy watching constant power rangers like cinematic martial arts wushu is a dramatic art but this tops even crouching tiger hidden dragon in the corny martial arts category   it has a few nostalgic moments where they seem to put in some effort but 90 was empty  superficial a shadow of how the legend of mulan should  could have been told  all of the important elements needed for telling the story are missing whoever made these idiotic decisions on set deserves to be punched in the throat what a pathetic disgrace
Sep 6 2020,negative,the characters are bland they removed the best part of the original the songs and they removed the mongols and replaced them with a madeup group despite claiming to be historically accurate if you want to see a good mulan movie watch the original
Sep 6 2020,positive,finally a disney live action remake that isnt based off of their animated musical this is the remake worth watching
Sep 6 2020,positive,amazing i have always been a original mulan fan and this lived up to the name
Sep 6 2020,positive,very neat and smooth commercial film with no regrets it is definitely the highquality existence in the disney princess movies liu yifeis performance is fine
Sep 6 2020,negative,no songs new subpar plot super violent not what we expected bummer
Sep 6 2020,positive,as an asiani am very excited to see such a movie released globally
Sep 6 2020,positive,the best movie disney has done
Sep 6 2020,negative,the cinematography was beautiful but the story was boring there was little to no humor and it was a struggle to stay awake
Sep 6 2020,positive,the plot of the film is fascinating and wonderful
Sep 6 2020,positive,the fighting scene is amazing
Sep 6 2020,positive,i am very satisfied with this adaptationespecially the choice of actors
Sep 6 2020,negative,disney did not stay true to the original i understand things change but these are remakes for kids not adults not much for kids in this movie but i guess that is how it is now
Sep 6 2020,positive,classic mulan 1998 and remake mulan 2020
Sep 6 2020,negative,i had been looking forward to mulan for over a year i forked over 30 despite everyone making fun of me for doing so they completely botched the story of a beloved disney princess with poor stunt choreography shoddy editing work and virtually no dialogue the bathing scene was waaaayyy more sensual than the cartoon and i felt that they had completely undermined mulans ability as a warrior with the unbelievable stunt work the total lack of chinese accents within the film was truly startling i mean those were full on american accents did i hear a texas drawl at some point i will say there were a few key words and sentences spoken in the film that really gave young chinese women value and dignity if this helps a single little chinese girl that she brings her family honor by being brave loyal and true  then this whole two hour ordeal had been worth it
Sep 6 2020,negative,heartless movie reminded me of a bollywood movie but without the good music dancing and heart
Sep 6 2020,positive,the best disney princess movie ever
Sep 6 2020,positive,the actors did a good job
Sep 6 2020,positive,although i must say i missed the music  mulan is one of the best soundtracks that disney has  i went into watching it knowing that it was already going to be different and disney wanted to stay more original as i was watching i loved every moment of it  it was a live action film and not based on the cartoon  i love that they made mulan its own movie and not a complete remake of the original mulan
Sep 6 2020,negative,good visuals but evident in the use of green screen and cgi lacked the emotional impact of the original is boiled down to a series of learned lessons by the characters and some good action sequences
Sep 6 2020,positive,i really didnt even miss the music
Sep 6 2020,positive,excellent film my entire family loved it 
Sep 6 2020,positive,mulan is my favorite moviethe song is so nicei am so excited
Sep 6 2020,negative,i expected so much more from this movie  i am highly disappointed mulan has always been my favorite childhood movie and they completely ruined it was honestly a joke 
Sep 6 2020,positive,the acting is great
Sep 6 2020,positive,its a visually gorgeous film
Sep 6 2020,positive,so powerful and absolutely one of the disney remakes so far
Sep 6 2020,positive,i really loved this film
Sep 6 2020,positive,aside from the starstudded cast mulans epic hair flip entrances and stunning silk road views i enjoyed the postcredits songs by christina aguilera and coco lee more
Sep 6 2020,positive,first the movie cinematography was beautiful with rich colors and gorgeous backgrounds  the script of this movie was weak and whomever thought it was a good idea to turn this into a kung fu move should be hung by their thumbs for a day  if you took disney out of the picture and sold it as is the movie would be a home run with most kung fu fans i was not looking for the original cartoon mulan but i wanted more disney magic and less kung fu magic overall i enjoyed the movie
Sep 6 2020,positive,it didnt match the cartoon version of the movie it had its ups and downs with actors how the hell you gonna get rid of eddie murphy i did like what they did though and the main actress was very good so the movie is unwatchable it is still good i just wanted some of that 90s magic back
Sep 6 2020,positive,it was the perfect adaptation of a classic
Sep 6 2020,negative,it was dissapointing ive watched the legend of mulan 2009 movie and it was way better than this one adding the magic of the witch and the whole chosen one storyline was awful also like watching the movie and comparing it with the 1998 one you can see why the animated one was good timing fun and heart the songs helped with timing the comedy made it fun and helped tone down the depressing side of the story and it had a lot of heart thats just plain dead in the new one the 2009 one had a lot of drama it was sad as heck but still the story was so good that it kinda stuck with me  this new one is plain dissapointing
Sep 6 2020,positive,very well done movie modern perhaps more adult take on the original story did not miss the cartoonish elements at all
Sep 6 2020,negative,i cannot even express the disappointment of this tremendously fail of an adaptation i would never recommend it to no one and i seriously do not understand how can people say it was greatit was utter rubbish
Sep 6 2020,positive,not perfect script wise couldve used fleshing out in some places but extremely solid and effective great performances visuals action costumes make up music and even the new additions to the story are not only welcome but enhance whats already there
Sep 6 2020,negative,i had such high hopes for the movie but it was just boring from beginning to end they also took out all of the characters from the original movie that made it so enjoyable i know disney is a multibilliondollar company i dont care how much money you needed to get eddy murphy to play mushu again also there were no songs from the original movie which i was really looking forward to  all in all it was really eh like i thought i was watching a b rated movie from an unknown studio that i happened to pick up off of the clearance shelf of blockbuster before they went out of business
Sep 6 2020,positive,what a fabulous movie
Sep 6 2020,negative,the music wasnt the only thing missing from this version of mulan they also removed the humor and heart
Sep 6 2020,negative,honestly i feel like the movie could of been a lot better the original mulan cartoon version is way better it is would not recommend this movie to anyone i watch it all the way since was to kill time honestly at 3 am
Sep 6 2020,negative,this was not in any way a great representation of the original mulan 1998 this did not even scrape the surface of what the original mulan has held the theme of the story was so forced upon the actors and audience that the movie became unsatisfactory sure you have great scenery actors and a perhaps storyline but that came to waste when the presentation of dialogue and characters were made dull
Sep 6 2020,negative,im speechless ive loved mulan since i was a child and was super excited when i heard it was being remade as a live action film covid19 put a pause on my plans to see it in the theater so i was happy to be able to stream it but i was beyond disappointed once i actually saw it from beginning to end this movie was awful the script was horrible and action scenes were subpar ill be sure to stick to the animated film
Sep 6 2020,positive,great movie the main character mulan was played excellently just think that maybe they could speak in chinese and have subtitles because the english was sort of hard to listen to
Sep 6 2020,negative,was looking forward to this but it is the worst disney remake yet honestly there wasnt much to like about the movie bad graphics chi etc found the plotstory line very shallow somehow the animated movie had better character development and more investment     however the acting was really good casting gets a gold star
Sep 6 2020,negative,it was ok nothing really special then ending was nice but the movie overall as a whole was just ok  mainly watched it for donnie yen and jet li action which is nearly non existent and overly messed with vfx
Sep 6 2020,positive,mulan is not only a princess but also a fighter liu yifei has the excellent quality of mulan she is a good actress and the most suitable actress for mulan
Sep 6 2020,negative,even not comparing this to the original which you really cant help but to compare this is a boring bland movie the acting for many of the roles was almost lifeless  the scenes colors were so over saturated that everything felt distractingly fake this whole movie felt less realistic that the cartoon and nothing that happens makes sense the movie just had no soul and is just a bad movie in general
Sep 6 2020,negative,not as good as the og too many corny moments over dramatized pretty pathetic fight scenes didnt really connect with characters
Sep 6 2020,positive,such a powerful piece connecting family tradition and martial arts so proud of the amazing work and visuals
Sep 6 2020,negative,yet another unnecessary borefest from disney
Sep 6 2020,negative,disney proves once again that it doesnt care about character development there is no cohesive glue to the already disappointing setpieces
Sep 6 2020,positive,wow what can i say   was this really a disney movie  great movie  lots of action great cast good story even had a tear at the end  if you liked crouching tiger hidden dragon you will love this movie
Sep 6 2020,negative,i think this is a mediocre movie that would have received 3 stars if it werent for the fact that its animated counterpart is far superior in every way except for visuals it gets 2 stars for visuals besides that i feel like i wasted my time just rewatch the original or wait till december when this movie will be free on disney
Sep 6 2020,positive,touching and emotional very different from animated but it fit the times 
Sep 6 2020,neutral,the only thing asian in this movie is the characters they didnt even try
Sep 6 2020,positive,the story was changed for the worse i heard that they were trying to go for a real life look thats why no singing and sidekick dragon spoiler alert ahead the thing is mulan having superpower chi a witch who can turn into a hawk swarm of birds and possess people and a phoenix that is a family spirit animal that follows mulan around this all is far from real life they didnt have musical numbers but they could have had the instrumental versions playing during the times they were used in the original it would have played better for the fans the girlpower was forced there is one part where mulan tells the other soldiers that they had to protect the emperor the general doesnt believer her because you know woman so one by one the soldiers that were her friends start saying i believe her turned to my sister and said believeallmulan thats how it felt also the original ending was 100x better save your money and wait until it is on regular disney i know its hard to find entertainment for kids during this pandemic but this isnt worth the money
Sep 6 2020,negative,all hype no substance
Sep 6 2020,positive,i thought this was better than expected really enjoyed it yes there are some corny parts but really well done my family recommends 
Sep 5 2020,positive,it certainly lacked some charm of the animated original but overall a very good reimagining of the legend the humor didnt really land as it did in the original but the performance of the lead actress along with the stunning action sequences more than made up for that
Sep 5 2020,negative,its just a relatively really bad movie middling visuals and disappointingly bad acting and martial arts effects especially considering how much money was spent on production and the lineup of big name actors i had high hopes in spite of the leads despicable political leanings but the whole thing was just a resounding disappointment live action lion king and aladdin were better and i hated those remakes too
Sep 5 2020,positive,if you expecting a complete remake of the original you will definitely be disappointed there is no mushu but who else would be able to top eddie murphy i personally couldnt stand the lion king remake or new lady and the tramp  both being mere shadows of the originals the original mulan was perfect as is and this was a great expansion on the first solid acting and kept its own humor well along the journey while delivering a strong story with consistent action
Sep 5 2020,negative,this movie blows i cant believe i spent so much money on this crap not one song and no mushu zero emotion behind any character honestly i would want the witch to win and anyone who has seen the og would be like what freaking witch and thats when id tell you exactly dont waste your precious time
Sep 5 2020,negative,emotionally flat and visually entertaining rather watch the original mulan this mulan doesnt know how to act and gong li was relegated to a secondary witch sad
Sep 5 2020,neutral,it was an average movie i can tolerate watching for free but i cant recommend it to anyone if they would be paying 30 to watch it the story feels really dragging at times a lot of scenes really didnt serve the story at all and there are also some scenes from the cartoon which was integral but entirely glossed over with this one liu yifei playing as mulan also never showed any range in her acting the only emotion you will see in her face is at the start of movie and then youll see her with same expression on whatever situation till the end visually its good but some sequences show bad cgi while i do understand that disney had to cut the cartoon characters like mushu to capture visual realism its unfortunate that along with those being taken away the charmof the story also got cut its a bythebook film that wont really be remembered if you had to choose between watching the original cartoon or this one go with the original
Sep 5 2020,positive,good story and special effects uplifting voice for equality
Sep 5 2020,positive,family friendly appreciated the values modeled definitely better than disneys other live action remakes  missed the songs and some of the animated characters but the live action fight sequences more than made up for it
Sep 5 2020,negative,overall the movie is terrible not even trying to compare to the original animation  the entire movie gives me a feeling of a lack of money during production for example in mulans home the original animation featured crowd street include different style animal and buildings but in this version of mulan only one building exists and not lots of people live thereimagine there only a handful of people live there how can you show that mulan has been seen differently in the overall culture and both in the training camp and fighting in the city you also dont see many people exist although in the animation and this version the main character are those five people but at least show the rest of the army in a reasonable size the central city is also a joke i cannot even call it a city it more like a middlesize countryside and even in such a small set up mulan cannot even fight in there they have to go to a smaller location to fight although they have donnie yen in the cast roll why choose him when you do not even have any legit fight scene the music part is even worse it feels so uncomfortable as you do not get to hear even one complete theme music every background music feels incomplete i cannot even describe the feeling in my wordsmaybe you have to watch it to feel how horrible it is the art design and the script in my opinion are the only two things worth looking at but i guess both of them you have already seen in the trailer
Sep 5 2020,negative,visually stunning movie most of the acting is decentgood the story is fine but this version feels like its a movie pretending to be mulan this interpretation lacks the magic the playfulness and the care of the cartoon no shang no mushu no honor
Sep 5 2020,negative,this movie was so bad that ive created an account to voice my displeasure and disappointment
Sep 5 2020,positive,can hua mulan make the second film
Sep 5 2020,positive,some people dont like the movie because they keep comparing it to the animated version they dont realize its portraying the real life story and they did it so well some parts could had been extended and yes im sad they left out the music but overall the message was loud and clear
Sep 5 2020,positive,this film had exceptional talent beautiful visuals and a compelling narrative  disneys private from animation to live action comes to spectacular fruition in mulan  strict originalists might take some issue with changes in the format but to me every decision made to deviate from the original was for the better  the original mulan is one of my favorite animated films and this remake brings honor to the mulan family
Sep 5 2020,negative,the most anticipated and disappointing movie of the year they changed almost everything of the original film for worst
Sep 5 2020,negative,after watching this movie there are lots of question marks on top of my head i struggle with my inner self this is not the mulan i know and read about when i was growing up donnie yen and jet li was a waste of talent in this movie the chinese culture was misportrayed they should have hired someone with a good knowledge of the chinese culture to write the screenplay for this movie i prefer the animated classic mulan while its not 100 true to the ballad but it portrayed the mulan character more accurately this movie feels like another stereotype movie written by westerners i prefer and appreciate the animated mulan i think this is probably the worst version of mulan sorry
Sep 5 2020,negative,boring with unconvincing acting the colors of the outfits and scenery was a redeeming quality
Sep 5 2020,negative,they destroyed  mulan disney how dare u
Sep 5 2020,negative,it was a cringe fest from the beginning to the end of the movie i think the script and the director could have been better it introduced a plot armor that was so ridiculous not to spoil anything too much fantasy is used which takes away the seriousness of the characters situations the fight scenes are unimpressive and apparently mulan is stronger than regular men
Sep 5 2020,positive,fantastic movie the directing was great the story was what mulan is straight and to the point they focused on chi which was nice the acting was also very good many great names in this film the hate coming from alot of reviews is beyond me i enjoyed this movie well done disney 
Sep 5 2020,positive,i absolutely loved this movie im glad it was not made into a musical because i feel it would have been too distracting this was so well made with the beautiful scenery smooth storyline and acting with abundant action it was flavored with the traditional period chinese action movies it brought back the enjoyment i felt when watching the woman warrior cheng pei pei movies back in the 70s that were shown on the uc berkeley campus and in san francisco
Sep 5 2020,positive,the movie is good stop hating haters
Sep 5 2020,positive,best movie i watch this year highly recommend 
Sep 5 2020,positive,i didnt watch the original mulan but this was thoroughly entertaining and worth the 30 my 10 and 11 year old also enjoyed
Sep 5 2020,positive,i thought it was a good film it didnt need mushu or the musical numbers from the animated film which i still love to this very day
Sep 5 2020,negative,so disappointed nothing like the real mulan story
Sep 5 2020,negative,the movie made me yawn through the entire time mulan using chi makes everything she did unearned there were some scene transitions that didnt look good no character developments disney tv movies are better than this and they have a lower budget dont waste your money to see this not worth it
Sep 5 2020,positive,absolutely loved this adaptation i loved that it was truer to the chinese legend of mulan i am so happy they didnt add the extra sidekicks that the animated version had
Sep 5 2020,negative,the only good things are the cinematography set designs and certain not all fight scenes all the heart of the classic are gone in favor of breathtaking scenery in their attempt to tell a story of female empowerment they end up with a moral that you have to have magic powers in order to be a badass female warrior all of the struggles that made mulans character great have been washed out or eliminated
Sep 5 2020,positive,i enjoyed it  if you are expecting it to stick to the animated movie youre probably going to be disappointed  as for me i liked that it was truer to the ballard of mulan  i also think the actress  liu yifei isnt getting enough credit  i thought her acting was just fine and the fact that she did 90 of her own stunts  respect
Sep 5 2020,negative,they should have told its orginal story this one serves more like a visual treat rather than a complete disney blockbuster
Sep 5 2020,positive,this is absolutely  a beautiful move with simple story dont think it too much
Sep 5 2020,negative,really disappointed was quite obvious from the opening scene what sort of quality this movie would be definitely not worth watching
Sep 5 2020,positive,visually stunning and fantastic action more serious tone to the original but still remains some similarities love the new additions it made the story felt refreshed a must see
Sep 5 2020,negative,30 really disney not happy  not really likeing the cast or parts that made the last movie so good
Sep 5 2020,positive,i went into my watching of this knowing that this was its own thing and not a direct remake of the animated version doing this allowed me to enjoy the film on its own as an epic actionadventure movie with some kick ass stunt work gorgeous cinematography and perfect casting     as someone who is a diehard lover of the animated film i really respect the different path they went for this adaptation if you feel so strongly that you cant watch this without the music mushu etc the animated version is there for you for those exact reasons however the same story beats remain in this live action version and there are some great subtle nods to honor the original as well     this new version of mulan set out to carve its own path among the recent disney liveaction remakes where it decided not to remake the movie shot for shot but instead tried to stay more faithful and respectful of the original story of mulan    my one complaint is that i really wish this movie got the theater release that it deserved this film was made for the big screen and its a shame we didnt get to experience it in the way it was intended to be i also could have done with a little more humor but understand that with the tone they were trying to fit in this version too much humor would have felt out of place    overall i think everyone should give this film a chance and i cant wait to spend the rest of my weekend rewatching it
Sep 5 2020,positive,there are plenty of reviews here talking about weak scripts or lack or story arcs etc  listentheyre overthinking it  this is a beautifully shot film that tells a simple story of a young womans transition into a national hero  we dont get the villains backstory or deep history about secondary characters  because we dont need them and they wouldnt add to the story  its a simple tale but its effective  come expecting an enjoyable story and ride thats not overly complicated  i loved it
Sep 5 2020,positive,little bit surprised at the ratings i watched this with my sister after reading and watching some reviews i was expecting something terrible it was far from it firstly i believe the reviews and ratings are influenced mostly by two things 1 the main actresss comments about the hong kong police 2 the 2999 1999 price tag on disney   are you seriously going to downgrade this movie based on one persons comments what about the rest of the cast the director what about the 100s of crew membersim not sure i want a film to fail based on one persons views she is from china after all  as for the price tag all you have to do is wait a few months and it will be free on d crying about the price and lowering the ratings because you dont feel it is worth that money is poor behavior  let me first say that im reviewing an adaptation of a disney cartoon to live action movie i was never expecting a masterpiece i was expecting something entertaining and that is exactly what i got is this an amazing movie no is it a good disney movie absolutely both me and my sister enjoyed watching it  did i miss the songs no they incorporated the themes into the score did i miss the humor no did i miss the dragon maybe  decent acting main actress was very good decent fight scenes that could have been improved a little and decent plot i also liked the witches  arc not sure i had much to complain about  here are the two things i did not like the phoenix looked like a kite was not at all impressive and im also not sure what it brought to the film was in my opinion a pointless addition should have looked much better and should have had more of an impact towards the plot or something i just did not get it it was more distracting then anything else  although i did not think she was a mary sue she failed she fell she had to accept certain things about herself before realising her potential i did not like that the third act was all about her and that her team mates were relegated to a corridor fight  while she did all the saving lines like clear a path for her and go rescue the king or something similar left me feeling odd  this film was fun to watch and should inspire any child boy or girl
Sep 5 2020,negative,once in awhile you watch a movie then read the reviews then worry for the survival of the species that more than 50 of people enjoyed this silly mess of a movie is worrisome indeed
Sep 5 2020,positive,i loved it overall the design costume and set were brilliant and were appropriate i loved both the animation and this liveaction the actors and actresses that were cast were perfect for the roles i guess the bad thing was i feel like the film was rushing the plot also i loved the songs in the animation but i understand it would not fit as a musical with all the action and emotional moments however i totally recommend this movie this and aladdin have been the only liveaction that i have really liked mulan fits so well it was emotional and empowering
Sep 5 2020,positive,beautifully done the music is a great yet subtle nod to the original film
Sep 5 2020,positive,as much as i went in to this movie thinking i would not like it within minutes i was hooked the amount of action and story held me till the very end i laughed and was on the verge of tears and on the edge of my seat the entire movie for those who called for a boycott on this movie shame on you it was very good
Sep 5 2020,negative,no character development superpowers poorly written just watch the animated one
Sep 5 2020,negative,a wasted opportunity the visuals are by far the best thing about this movie everything else falls rather flat every change from the original seems to be for the worse even the entire feminist message regarding you can do anything comes up short as she no longer has to work hard to achieve it but instead seems to have magic powers from the very start without any of the charm heart comedy or message all youre left with is a less than mediocre action movie disappointing
Sep 5 2020,positive,it bothers me that people cant watch this movie without comparing it to the cartoon yes the cartoon was good the cartoons will always be better than the movie but its time to grow up and put on your adult pants while not flawless this was a good movie about living your true self dont cry to me that yeah but the cartoon was about becoming as good as the boys who cares the cartoon was the cartoon and this is an adult movie news flash the cartoon mulan is just one interpretation of many mulan legends  and its for kids i swear the world doesnt know how to be happy anymore and everyone just digs for reasons to whine
Sep 5 2020,negative,thanks to the covid 19 to save the movie from a box office disaster his place is not in theaters
Sep 5 2020,positive,a good film action is brilliant good cinematography good cast recommended 
Sep 5 2020,positive,this movie was able to truly capture the magic that was mulan im so happy that little chinese girls will be able to watch this and see themselves on the big screen representation is so important and i think niki caro did a great job of respecting that
Sep 5 2020,negative,mulan was born an ordinary girl not a superhero her success was because of all the extra hard work she put into her trainings not because she was born as the chosen one with super power or extra chi there was zero character development in this movie and frankly i didnt find it inspiring instead i found it discouraging because as long as youre not the chosen one you probably dont stand a chance in success
Sep 5 2020,negative,this was not the mulan i grew up with and loved this was an action movie with a g rating and how can you remove that wonderful music the fact that mushu was not going to be in the filmed should have been the first flag awful move
Sep 5 2020,negative,i found the movie to be a bunch of disjointed clips edited together there was poor transition scenes and weak emotional connection the phoenix and chi aspects were useless we can get rid of it and it wouldnt change the movie i didnt care about any characters because the movie doesnt give opportunities to connect or grow with them this movie could have done better if there was better story character interactions and dialogue
Sep 5 2020,negative,while i am a disney fan and am saddened that the new film wasnt going to follow the cartoon i was excited about the historical twist and action sequences of the live action unfortunately i wasted 2999 to terrible acting and  cheesy predictable character development
Sep 5 2020,positive,the movie is far from the original in a bad way
Sep 5 2020,positive,directed by niki caro starring yifei liu a remake that brought honor to the original classic cartoon the original disney cartoon mulan 1998 is in my top 3 disney movies of all time so when i heard they were making a live action adaptation i was both excited and nervous this version doesnt carry the music and some characters from the animated version they ended up changing some of the story without taking away from the original source material after a second viewing i realized i really enjoyed this version of this story i really do miss the songs and wish they were added but i feel this was a smart choice to keep things fresh and different so audiences didnt wait beat for beat what was going to happen in the plot the biggest issue with the film is the characters are just existing with no real development other than the character of mulan none of the characters gave any real backstory or emotion visually this movie is shot incredibly with some amazing locations and awesome fight choreography this was just enough to satisfy me as an adaptation from one of my favorite cartoons of my childhood 
Sep 5 2020,negative,worst liveaction adaptation ever made by disney
Sep 5 2020,positive,in live action disney remakes there is an oversaturated too colorful to be realistic quality to everything that makes each scene feel like youre walking into a candy store i believe this is meant to appeal to children reflect the colorful nature of the animated films and provide a sense of happiness it plays well during scenes of celebration but if it were up to me i would prefer more natural color schemes rather than pushed saturation for the sake of simply being colorful it seems to take some of the weight quality and sense of realism away from what were watching what it does for me is take the sense of danger out of the action sequences when things arent grounded enough in reality the stakes dont feel high enough to make us really feel a sense of danger when were supposed to that said within the confines that were likely provided by disney in terms of violence the fight scenes were pretty good if not a bit too pg for a pg13 film since they already had the pg13 rating i do wish they would have pushed the realism in terms of violence a bit more just to make us feel a sense of danger and worry for the characters the general lack of that was made up for the few times we got to see mulan do something like kick a spear into a mans chest which was quite satisfying    despite some of the dialogue being a bit cheesy and on the nose at times i think they accomplished exactly what they were intending to and made a pretty solid movie for their audience    its not perfect but its very good    was it worth the 30 absolutely im underselling it in this post a 30 ticket for a production this massive with so many good elements is nothing    what did they do well  most things the sets the props the costumes the scenery the casting the effects the visuals the music the nostalgic elements and callbacks to the original film which are ever present yet not overdone or unfitting there are more good things about this film than things worth judging niki cari did a great job     many people are saying this is the best disney liveaction remake yet and i might have to agree its a toss up between mulan 2020 and cinderella 2015    if youre a big disney fan and you want something dazzling and adventurous to enjoy or if youre just looking to kick back and watch something great for the whole family this is it
Sep 5 2020,positive,i love it beyond the fantasy of the script i think that every child should see this movie  if you criticize this movie badly because there is a witch and a phoenix bird then you did not understand anything
Sep 5 2020,negative,no music no le shang no dragon no cricket theyve changed the story absolutely gutted wish theyd never made it so i couldnt carry on watching the original mulan without the thought of this
Sep 5 2020,negative,terrible disney film lacking character development soul and disney magic    decent generic action film
Sep 5 2020,negative,what a waste of time and money all together even the 1998 cartoon version was better than this
Sep 5 2020,positive,i like mulan i like its scenery costumes and art special effects  i prefer the careful design embodied everywhere  it does not have to restore the animation or restore the mulan poem  it tells the story very well i never entangled that she must have a boyfriend or a partner i must admit that i like musu in the animation but that is another movie there are many chinese elements in the movie which gives me a lot of surprises thanks to the production team for presenting fujian tuloudanxia landformmagnolia the flower when mulan takes a bath is called mulan in chinese and the phoenix is the phoenix in the chinese totem in chinese culture the emperor is the dragon and the queen is  phoenix so mulan is a growing phoenix i was very excited when the beautiful phoenix appeared in addition i think exaggerated bridal makeup is really not very chinese  the clothing of court officials is very similar to japanese style but i still like it in addition chi or qi which is defined as in martial arts novels appear in this movie this is a real martial art   finally i would like to especially thank liu yifei gong li jet li and other actors and director niki caro you have presented the movie very well many oriental elements have been restored very well i feel the sincere attitude of the film crew to this story  thank you
Sep 5 2020,positive,the movie keeps its original story with some adaptations to the 2020  although some aspects on the story go rough they pay tribute to the story and the location of the movie merging it a bit with asian movies and their effects
Sep 5 2020,positive,watched it loved it  normally movies always show the girl getting the guy this time it remained focused on her and her journey loved the message it gave to young girls 
Sep 5 2020,negative,i am a huge fan of mulan and this movie is a tragic footnote in the storytelling history of this wonderful character    firstly while not as bad as the live action aladdin the acting in this film is appalling the writers and directors have no time to character development and centered mulans extraordinary power around her chi like it was some mystical supernatural thing that made her superhuman it took eastern philosophy to a whole new and embarrassingly cheap level    the characters were written so poorly i felt like i was watching a madefortv movie    hokey unbelievable unrelatable and boring there was no fire in this film no personality and the only reason i gave it three stars was because they sometimes included orchestral interludes of the original music it was an embarrassingly feeble attempt to bring this legend to the screen and disney should be absolutely ashamed of themselves  summary absurdly awful
Sep 5 2020,positive,for a film all about being yourself it certainly has an identity issue with its narrative 
Sep 5 2020,positive,the movie is based on the original story but from a new perspective which is refreshing i went into it with an open mind and absolutely loved it for what was presented
Sep 5 2020,positive,as a chinese i like this movie even though some people may say the costume and preps sometimes not so accurate but as a girl i feel empowered the witch is a surprise she gives this film another layer of meaning and what i also quite like is unlike other princess films the love story in this film is not so obvious but it highlights how mulan fight for realising her value and protect others during the war  overall this film is great to watch with your kids
Sep 5 2020,positive,it was good just mushy is gone
Sep 5 2020,positive,this was one of the best live action adaptations this is a more mature version of the story my sons loved all the battle scenes and the kung fu  choreography was well done also visually stunning the whole family enjoyed it
Sep 5 2020,negative,this was a missed opportunity for heroic women in fiction i thought the film had a few good moments of storytelling and cinematography but overall the character of mulan kept her head down and hid from the audience as much as the chinese imperial army with live action mulans subterfuge is less convincing and her skill is never achieved through hard work and convincing proficient instead she taps into some kind of inner chi to become a great warrior to me this reduced feminine excellence to a random magic the film does address stifling social norms and cultural gender roles that impact women some moments worked however whatever impact mulan achieved by her actions is eventually subdued by the films insistence on oppressive forms of honor to family and societal approvalthe very things that mulan tried to break away from to follow her true self with her dads permission mulan finally becomes a servant of the emperor therefore the heroine is eventually swallowed back up by the social norms she fought against mulan 2020 had a beautiful opportunity to make a bold statement about a heroine who forced society to confront flawed views regarding gender roles society needed mulan in order to survive a hostile threat but had no social means to find her and allow her to flourish growth was needed but society doesnt evolve because of mulans actions in this film it simply made a begrudging exception and finally in terms of modeling heroic behavior for young girls and boys i guess the message is pray that you have a lot more chi than everyone else if not then you had better know your place in society and be prepared to conform to traditional gender roles opportunity missed
Sep 5 2020,negative,poorly developed dialogue poorly developed characters core elements from the original movie removed for unnecessary elements that have no value added for the theme of the movie truly disappointed by disney here they could have done so much more with the material they had
Sep 5 2020,neutral,not a patch on the original animated version lacked substance and characters some fight scenes were ok
Sep 5 2020,negative,i get they wanted to tell a different version but in the end they used a lot from the original animated movie but with small changes that worsen this movie more and more from its already bad stands   there was no justification for the making of this movie specially after watching it     scipt is terrible acring therefore bad same with everything else i woudnt even say the effects or visuals are so amazing as some critics are saying     the soul humanity epicness drama and good lessons of the original are complitely abscent in this one and replaced with cheap tropes attempting for something
Sep 5 2020,positive,the first half part is fantastic
Sep 5 2020,negative,one of the most cheasy movies ive ever seen not to mention that it is pretty violent for a disney movie and some partial nudity honestly i hope to never see this movie again it was terrible
Sep 5 2020,positive,movie is great its very different from the animated film in all the best ways stays more true to the ballad of mulan great action and beautiful visuals the script is really good great lines one tiny nitpick is the abundance of slow motion
Sep 5 2020,negative,boring as hell characters are all one dimensional and unimportant mulan shows no emotion and barely talks the chi superpowers alienated mulan from being relatable also by giving her superpowers they took away the intelligence that she had some how the animated version with a talking dragon has more realistic fights than this one wendy wu homecoming warrior fighting scenes the only enticing character was the witch and she died stupidly phoenix plot line that came and went as it pleased the original had such memorable scenes climbing the pole to get the arrow finding all the dead soldiers the avalanche china bowing to mulan every one of these scenes if even included fell completely flat dont waste your money disappointing 200mil worth of pretty sets and cgi
Sep 5 2020,neutral,bad script and poor direction this movie really felt like a low budget standalone the scenery and cinematography are beautiful and rightly so since the budget was so high the actors fit their roles well but their potential seemed to be held back by bad story structure and irrational progression some of the scenes seemed rushed and bare without emotion or weight overall if i was shown this and told it was just a random one shot action movie set in china i would accept it and move on this is not mulan and it should not have been made out to be
Sep 5 2020,negative,this was a poor rendition of the original if you loved the original stay far away from this movie the scenes seemed chopped together and the characters were very poorly developed 
Sep 5 2020,negative,poorly made the transitions from one scene to the next were terrible i gave it one star just because of a particular scene with her on the horse while taking off her armor that was pretty nicebesides that sorry but it was pretty bad it was like watching an episode of power rangers 
Sep 5 2020,positive,i and the family thought it was great in every regard
Sep 5 2020,negative,absolutely garbage compared to the original cartoon disney movie they may as well changed it to a different name and i would of have rated it better rather than comparing it to the original movie     also whats with the main characters mainland chinese accent while no one in the village had it her father spoke perfect english and yet the main actress has to force her accent 10x stronger imagine living in a normal american household and you are the only child with a british accent what was that about     the fight scene are also very mainland chinese if you were trying to make a very realistic movie why even have people running up walls etc    watch it once and forget about it what an atrocity
Sep 5 2020,positive,i think this is one of best disney live action film yet nice plot of story full of emotion and satisfied ending of story
Sep 5 2020,negative,if the purpose was to showcase martial arts and lots of action they terribly failed if it was making it sublimely empowering they terribly failed too it lacks emotion the script was horrible the scenes felt rushed 30 stolen from us the audience
Sep 5 2020,negative,good image quality but it is not enough to balance with a poor storytelling  they took the main script from the cartoon but it is not as fun as the cartoon   poor attachement to the characters especially mulan  even the gender equality was more believable in the cartoon with mulan being a character that i could relate through her values and ingenuity ie the pillar exercice  well another disney movie that i could not see to the end because it was so annoying that i felt asleep and that was after my nap
Sep 5 2020,positive,grown up disney loved it
Sep 5 2020,positive,beautiful movie from a cinematography and choreography standpoint it lacks the heart and humor of the animated film but i think it can stand on its own
Sep 5 2020,positive,i dont think the dramatic and important moments were heightened enough by the background music or the acting but the ending was satisfying i still love the original animated version but this wasnt too bad
Sep 5 2020,positive,as long as you know going in that it is different than the original then you can enjoy this beautiful film for what it is it still honors the classic film and i can understand the changes that were made the whole family loved it
Sep 5 2020,negative,i liked a lot of what they did however unlike the original mulan had no real growth the first scene in the movie just showed how amazingly special she is in the original she was awkward and weird in the beginning but learned to fight with her friends while in training in the military i think that they should have taken that idea and applied it here
Sep 5 2020,negative,just a money grab for the weak mined
Sep 5 2020,negative,sitting through the 2020  liveaction of mulan is not worth 30 to see i can guarantee your that it was full of lush wardrobes hundreds of kung fu battles yawn and a magical phoenix who guides mulan through battles and helps conceal she is a woman  and not a man if discovered death would be her destiny there is also an evil woman warrior who also can change into  a flying phoenix or whatever she choses to battle the innocent with backdrops already seen in dozens of japanese movies it seems we are looking at an old  movie instead of a new version too long and not as entertaining as  disneys  1998 animated mulan deemed a classic
Sep 5 2020,positive,a little slow to get going but if you dont think of this as a remake its pretty great
Sep 5 2020,positive,im sure this film honored the chinese legend disney did a great job on that film
Sep 5 2020,positive,the movie was good but i still prefer the animation version it was way better
Sep 5 2020,positive,shame on disney for taking 30 bucks from people and shame on me for paying them its an okish disney movie you feel nothing when its over no female empowerment no excitement no happiness no sadness no nothing    they tried to do a crouching tigger hidden dragon type thing buy half assed so its not action its not comedy its not disney its nothing the sequences and situations are dumb they dont build the characters the sets and clothes are blah why did they have to make her a super hero with super powers type thing why no one else has them not everything can be super powers    i didnt want a lion king remake type thing i was excited that it was going to be realistic with no mushu or songs and a different story but somehow the animated one ends up being more realistic than this with logical scene transitions and better character arcs what do you know    the movie didnt want to make me throw up or anything but is not worth the 30 its to watch it on a sunday night when theres not much to do aladdin and beauty and the beast were better
Sep 5 2020,negative,unfortunately i didnt enjoyed it i tried to not compared it with the old version of mulan but it was a waste of time and snacks lol not worth it
Sep 5 2020,negative,scenes are rushed and missing sequence and a lot of scenes look cheap like a  power rangers episode
Sep 5 2020,negative,while not a sewed together travesty like maleficent was this really was a dull movie way to much pointlessly dense dialogue it couldve easily redeemed itself if it allowed more intense action scenes to occur but instead opts for woefully safe blandness hoping an odd new character insert here and there makes up for it sorry this is just a dissappointment and 30 is daylight robbery for it
Sep 5 2020,positive,i loved it from the cast costumes set design cinematography down to its soundtrack it is indeed a masterpiece the best live action ever produced by disney
Sep 5 2020,negative,this felt very much like an attempt to make it into crouching tiger hidden dragon  literally the dragon was hidden as there isnt a mushu  i knew that going in thinking maybe they were trying for something more realistic  however mulan from a young age has incredible chi and is already an amazing warrior  theres a phoenix instead of a dragon that shows up often why not keep the dragon  also now theres an evil witch with a notsurprising important impact to the end  the dialogue was hokey and often clunky  some battle sequences were good
Sep 5 2020,negative,its ok not bad but it could have been so much better if it had stuck closer to the original it lacks the character growth and humour that made the cartoon so charming the addition of special powers etc take away from the story instead of enhancing it
Sep 5 2020,positive,superb the action scenes were brilliant good story although very similar to the cartoon version which i guess makes sense as the cartoon was based on the legend will definitely be watching again
Sep 5 2020,neutral,the best part of the original was the songs comedic releases and animal sidekicks this live action version has none of the above
Sep 5 2020,negative,if i could give less stars i would the wigs are distracting the costumes and set are whimsical but it completely clashes with the the somber tone of the plot they took out the grandma for some reason  it feels very inauthentic overly stereotyped cheesy borderline offensive extremely anglo interpretation of asian culture highly disappointing im so disappointed  i cant even     i literally made an account to write about how bad it was
Sep 5 2020,positive,while it might not be up there with great disney liveaction remakes like cinderella its surely not anywhere near as bad as dumbo mulan falls comfortably in the middle as one of the better remakes that disappoints when compared with the original but entertains nonetheless the casting is spot on the cinematography is breathtaking and some changes are favorable while others were not like replacing the songs with a narration is clearly a misstep since the film already contained magic which drives it away from realism and into the endless possibility of disneyfication mulan is neither a true adaptation of its source materials legend nor a true remake of disneys 1998 classic so what does that make it a flashy hollywood take on an age old tale that offers more to see than to feel
Sep 5 2020,negative,ok movie but animated was way better with far interesting side characters did not see the charm
Sep 5 2020,negative,it was kinda dumb movie also a boring one
Sep 5 2020,negative,this was like most disney remakes a shell of its former self it in no way recaptured that story of the original cartoon nor did it do anything interestingly new with the movie that didnt have me rolling my eyes in disgust this is a poor way to show mulan as an actual relatable strong female character who proves she can do what men can do she is literally neo from the matrix after he believed in himself at like 8 years old so she already has an advantage instead of struggling like any reasonable protagonist should mushu and the cricket along with all of their charming character moments are completely erased and all of the other characters are again empty husks compare to the originals and those where cartoons the whole evil witch falcon thing could have been interesting but was poorly executed  how much more out of touch could this movie be
Sep 5 2020,positive,dont pay attention to some of these negative reviews as they are deeply flawed     make no mistake this film has stunning visuals beautiful cinematography excellent balance and transitions between action sequences moments of solitude and reflection simply gorgeous in and of themselves and a fantastic score that somehow enhances the emotion of it all this is easily disneys best live action remake and while the animated film was and is still great niki caros mulan improves upon it making it a must see for anyone who can still be moved by beautiful filmmaking
Sep 5 2020,positive,the right way to remake took source material and completely made it their own the movie stands on its own two feet and as long as you dont try to compare it to the animated film you will leave completely satisfied nothing like hearing strings of reflection play in the background in huge moments great performances across the board
Sep 5 2020,negative,has barely anything to do with the original it is not even original in its own seems to cater to some imaginary audience no surprise it didnt go to cinema
Sep 5 2020,negative,destroyed everything valuable about the original went for all the wrong tropes expected mulan got a mangled harry potter not what 2020 needed
Sep 5 2020,negative,i know disney just wants money and sure fire hits but they dont understand animation is not an inferior medium to tell stories  its the best medium not live action
Sep 5 2020,positive,i really like this movie
Sep 5 2020,positive,its an enjoyable film mulan has gorgeous visuals really nice action sequences and is well cast the story and character development isnt the strongest however and there are some scenes that are quite cheesy and campy dubious directorial choices    overall a beautiful film that deserved a true theater release
Sep 5 2020,positive,this live action remake of yet another disney classic is largely successful with sumptuous visuals and occasional moments of stirring emotions but it feels like an abridged version of a much longer and more powerful epic i was shocked by how quickly mulan donned her fathers armor and went out the door and then again how quickly she was ready to unveil her secret in many ways this was a movie that felt torn between entertaining kids and enthralling adults and as a result falls short of greatness in both departments  i would have happily watched a sixhour miniseries telling this story in a more drawn out deliberate fashion so maybe that can be the third iteration when disney has to go back to the well again after theyve run out of animated films to remake as live action
Sep 5 2020,negative,very boring movie way to many scene cuts movie was all over the place nothing exciting happened acting had its moments but the slow motion scenes made it awkward at times could have have done so much more with the storyline and stir up more emotion the whole time i was watching the movie i was thinking that this was a bollywood action movie but not in a good way
Sep 5 2020,positive,the advantage of hua mulan is of course the martial arts arrangement and the scene of the avalanche scene
Sep 5 2020,negative,soulless corporate cashgrab that captured none of the spirit of the original animated version feels like a bollywood film without any of the charm
Sep 5 2020,positive,very good adoption from the original mulan story yifei liu is very brave and beautiful as mulan
Sep 5 2020,negative,no mushu to make it more realistic but they added a hawk lady that takes weight to the original main villain  and she is defeated because reasons  take out everything that made the original animated version great and you are left with this
Sep 5 2020,positive,women dont need a man by their side to be a power house and the purpose of the journey was not to end up with a husband thats why this version of mulan is golden no matter what the haters say
Sep 5 2020,positive,disney i want to watch mulan 2
Sep 5 2020,positive,was really good a lot of action and very entertaining mulan is a bad a
Sep 5 2020,positive, this movie has the ending i wish the animated one would have had
Sep 5 2020,negative,trash live action there is no disney song inside
Sep 5 2020,negative,lackluster and a waste of money good sets good scenery ok action but a disappointing story and no real character arcs this movie bares little if any resemblance to the original film its missing multiple characters and lacks the heart and soul of a proper disney film not worth the 30 dollars and 2 hours
Sep 5 2020,positive,the acting visuals and story telling were all good i recommend this movie for people that know how to enjoy a well written movie without constantly comparing to the animated version
Sep 5 2020,positive,i hope that next years little mermaid will be as good as mulan will it be
Sep 5 2020,negative,it was a terrible remake no character building or any humor
Sep 5 2020,positive,i grew up with the original movie but i decided to give the live action a chance i actually really enjoyed the movie and come to realize that people dont like it because they are stubborn 
Sep 5 2020,positive,i enjoyed the story and thought it was appropriate for children and adults i enjoyed that her conflict was mostly with herself
Sep 5 2020,positive,they substituted mushu with an apparition of a phoenix which played well but was a little tacky at times the explanation and use of chi was a nice touch oh and dont forget to watch the end credits yifei sings a beautiful cover of reflection in mandarin
Sep 5 2020,positive,a great live adaptation of the original disney they did away with the musical portion but echoes of the classic songs are throughout the film the actress who plays mulan liu yifei is outstanding she has grace and martial art skills which make her a perfect fit for the role 
Sep 5 2020,negative,i smell a directors cut  although it did go with the original rather than the disney version some of the scenes werent stitched right it felt like there are so many scenes that were on the cutting room floor that couldve filled in the gaps and gave more depth to each character especially mulan bori khan and the sorceress it felt rushed also there were too many unnecessary moving shots it felt like style over substance and giving me an impression that its a cash cow kind of movie ex transformers franchise
Sep 5 2020,negative,where is eddie murphy at what about that diversity disney on a more serious note there are some beautiful set pieces and landscapes for the most part i would rather watch the animated interpretation from the past
Sep 5 2020,positive,after watching it on di disney did not disappoint me mulan is a perfect family movie liu yifei performed very well when she finally returned to her daughter she was beautiful and handsome i believe mulan will become a teenagers idol  the movie expresses the theme very well when mulan is truthful she becomes more powerful than any other men
Sep 5 2020,negative,they changed too much of the core of what made the original movie great instead of being a normal girl rising to greatness shes just a super hero with almost no growth or character development theres no humor no music and no fun to be found anywhere in this movie maybe worth watching for free but certainly not worth buying
Sep 5 2020,positive,unbelievable such a good movie disney let it be shown on disney plus this is the loss of the audience
Sep 5 2020,positive,great movie with epic pictures and cinematography 
Sep 5 2020,negative,if they had kept it closer to the original it would have went a long way the remake was pretty terrible
Sep 5 2020,positive,if you are unhappy come to our house to see mulan
Sep 5 2020,positive,i hope to see mulan again in the cinema the movie scene is really beautiful
Sep 5 2020,positive,spectacular scene outstanding action shocking soundtrack
Sep 5 2020,negative,as a standalone movie mulan was pretty good    as a live action remake of mulan the cartoon wow this sucked it didnt feel like a disney movie at all no comedic relief from mushu just some random phoenix that flew by at times it felt like a chinese movie lots of super unrealistic fighting and physics plot twist at the end that didnt make sense at all mulan and the bad witch had like a 2 minute convo about coming back to the good side and thats all it took for the witch to sacrifice herself none of the songs there were a few lame references to moments in the cartoon    also it was my fault for not looking at the ratings beforehand i watched this with my 5 year old and was shocked to see dead bodies soldiers getting shot with arrows sliced with swords and the trebuchet dropping flaming rocks on the shield wall the soldiers were holding all the other live action we watch and its nice and nostalgic but mulan wasbad wont watch it again and felt like that was 30 wasted    very disappointed in this i hope they make another live action in line with beauty and the beast cindarella aladdin    if you havent seen it dont not worth it just go watch some other random chinese martial arts film that has a female heroin
Sep 5 2020,positive,great movie with epic pictures and cinematography  very good remake of mulan that my daughters enjoyed  worth it to view with the family
Sep 5 2020,negative,it lack of something the final battle wasnt epic at all and the ending were so damn incomplete would it be hurt to show a bit more romantic scene for her and her supposed to be husband just like the animated version the female antagonist storyline were so confused at the she just like nevermind ill just die you could do better than that overall i wasted my money on this
Sep 5 2020,positive,i just watched it at d i am very satisfied with the film and suitable for the whole family to watch the larger the screen the better the viewing effect the scenery is beautiful and liu yifeis performance is meticulous the implied teachingloyalty and true filial piety
Sep 5 2020,positive,give five stars mulan dad emperor music and action
Sep 5 2020,positive,hi disney can we see mulan 2 in theaters in the future
Sep 5 2020,positive,finally got to see disneys mulan liveaction remake movie last night on disney plus with premier access after multiple cinema delays since march this mulan liveaction remake of their 1998 animated movie was amazing probably the best disney liveaction remake so far for me just edging out aladdin by a little bit disney managed to bring another one of my childhood disney animated movies to life spectacularly after beauty and the beast aladdin  the lion king it has the perfect combination and balance of something new pretty different from the animated one and enough nostalgic scenes from the animated movie being born in 1989 i was lucky to grow up during disneys renaissance so called golden era during 1990s with fantastic disney animated movies like the little mermaid beauty and the beast aladdin the lion king pocahontas hercules mulan and tarzan watching another one of them come to life in live action form was so special all the actors liu yifei gong li jet li and donnie yen and others all did amazing jobs the cinematography choreography and action sequences especially were spectacular what a gorgeous movie really really wish they will release this in cinema here one day after covid19 like it was intended to be i did not miss mushu here at all even though i love him in the animated one it just doesnt make sense to have him in this liveaction version which is closer to the original chinese tale than the cartoon one i cant wait for the other ones to be remade in liveaction form my grade a it was epic  
Sep 5 2020,positive,sublimated your beauty through the role of mulan flying over the wall with bare hands long and short weapons bamboo sticks hidden weapons street fighting close combat immediate combat group combat glacier duel scaffolding balance beam duel the difficulty gradually increases in the future it is simply disneys chinese kung fu encyclopedia by liu yifei the singlehanded girders are all completed support a pure martial arts action movie
Sep 5 2020,positive,liu yifei is shockingly beautiful she still has kung fu 
Sep 5 2020,positive,i must say that mulan is our familys favorite disney princess can we buy her clothes
Sep 5 2020,positive,its a 7point movie that can be watched very well because there is something i like very much it is 1 point higher favorite place liu yifei is suitable for the role of mulan goodlooking beautiful and handsome in acting and there is nothing wrong with acting the original sound is great i like it so much it has both new music and the music elements of cartoons the picture is beautiful with new zealand the art is excellent and the ending graphic is beautiful the script can be seen to try to keep the content of the cartoon but it is in line with the seriousness of the live version and the completion rate is 70
Sep 5 2020,negative,character development sucks no mushu seemed too rushed so upset i payed 30 dollars on top of a membership to watch this it wasnt even close to being worth it 
Sep 5 2020,negative,the animated mulan movie is a billion times better funnier and just amazing i get they wanted to make a realistic movie but this just plain and simple didnt work the animated movie had heart and a message the live action film had none of those the musical numbers in mulan were some of the best music out there they could have at least had many of the songs in this film in instrumental form but nope mulan in this film is rey like in star wars super powerful from the beginning theres no training no struggle a character you could care less about pass on this movie and dont waste your money on this wait til its free on the streaming site
Sep 5 2020,positive,the visuals and the acting of the cast are all pretty solid i know its not the most typical disney musical but its still a good version of the liveaction disney got a different approach this time and its pretty convincing
Sep 5 2020,positive,disney will never disappoint its audience
Sep 5 2020,positive,after watching this movie my daughters and i wept in tears this is probably the charm of movies
Sep 5 2020,negative,awful i wish the theaters were closed so i didnt have to go and waste my money

Sep 5 2020,positive,liu yifei is really incredible she and emma watson are mulan and belle in my heart
Sep 5 2020,positive,very good adoption from the original mulan story yifei liu is very brave and beautiful as mulan
Sep 5 2020,positive,the disney princess movies are not bad although the script is mediocre the wonderful performances of the protagonists fill this gap i am very happy to watch the live version  
Sep 5 2020,positive,liu yifeis performance is pretty good it deserves to be selected by disney i love this chinese girl she is hua mulan
Sep 5 2020,positive,when can i watch it in the cinema     i want to watch it again in the cinema  this is definitely more shocking
Sep 5 2020,negative,its just dull  disney needs to realize that the live action versions of their classic animated films dont work  if you want to see the story of mulan see the animated filmits far better than this mess of a movie
Sep 5 2020,positive,a great live adaptation of the original disney they did away with the musical portion but echoes of the classic songs are throughout the film the actress who plays mulan liu yifei is outstanding she has grace and martial art skills which make her a perfect fit for the role they substituted mushu with an apparition of a phoenix which played well but was a little tacky at times the explanation and use of chi was a nice touch oh and dont forget to watch the end credits yifei sings a beautiful cover of reflection in mandarin
Sep 5 2020,positive,ive been influenced by animation since i was a child and adapted the liveaction version i am very happy to see it
Sep 5 2020,positive,my son told me that he really wanted to join mulans team and fight the enemy
Sep 5 2020,positive,the dialogue and story feel unfinished but it is pretty
Sep 5 2020,positive,i watched this movie with my family i can only say that our family is in love with this woman liu yifei she is so charming she will be mulan in my heart
Sep 5 2020,positive,disney focuses on personal growth which i think is very clever

Sep 5 2020,positive,liu yifei is very suitable for the image of mulan the performance is very good the character is strong in heart
Sep 5 2020,positive,mulan is soooooooo great this is my favorite movie this year
Sep 5 2020,positive,there are some changes that are different from the animated version many of which i think are quite good in line with contemporary aesthetics and ji lao is really satisfied
Sep 5 2020,positive,it highlights womens independence and selfreliance women cannot be defined by beauty but should be defined by style
Sep 5 2020,positive,very neat and smooth commercial film with no regrets it is definitely the highquality existence in the disney princess movies liu yifeis performance is fine
Sep 5 2020,positive,who is liu yifei how is she so good her performance fascinated me one of this years favorite moviesmulan
Sep 5 2020,positive,mulan is definitely not the princess movie you imagined it is real warm inspiring and has an extremely rich spiritual core at this point it surprises me
Sep 5 2020,positive,its not close to the original mulan that you grew up watching and surprisingly it doesnt need to be as a big fan of the 1998 animated version i was a little reluctant to watch it as id heard of some of the changes but i ended up enjoying it its unrealistic to expect it to be a complete replica to the 98 version and im glad it wasnt this is a more serious take on mulan one i think we needed personally as a grown woman i appreciated seeing the elements from the animated version i watched as a kid but in a different take this version embodies the true legend of mulan and you have to respect the legend and culture on which it was based not its animated preprocessor
Sep 5 2020,positive,very neat and smooth commercial film with no regrets it is definitely the highquality existence in the disney princess movies liu yifeis performance is fine
Sep 5 2020,positive,chinas mountains and rivers are so beautiful and the details of the costumes are amazing disney made a correct choice this time
Sep 5 2020,positive,i grew up with the original movie but i decided to give the live action a chance i actually really enjoyed the movie and come to realize that people dont like it because they are stubborn the acting visuals and story telling were all good i recommend this movie for people that know how to enjoy a well written movie without constantly comparing to the animated version
Sep 5 2020,positive,this is so moving i am still immersed inmulan
Sep 5 2020,negative,wish i could give 0 star boring movie mulan was transformed from an ancient warrior to a magical caster worst of all the main actress openly expressed support to hong kong police brutality how could a person with such distorted personality protray mulan a symbol of justice
Sep 5 2020,positive,jet li and donnie yen and mulans martial arts scenes are really cool   i want to see crouching tiger hidden dragon again
Sep 5 2020,positive,i saw gong li again this is an incredible asian actress  and liu yifei is so fascinating im going to see mulan again
Sep 5 2020,positive,this version of mulan is completely in line with my preferences liu yifei is so beautiful and handsome
Sep 5 2020,positive,very neat and smooth commercial film with no regrets it is definitely the highquality existence in the disney princess movies liu yifeis performance is fine
Sep 5 2020,positive,i must say that lius performance completely injected the soul into mulan in my heart
Sep 5 2020,positive,i have been a fan of mulan for a long time even though this time there is no my favorite songs in the middle of movie it still passes the ideas that i value most a girl can find her value not only in kitchen and family but also as a soilder a leader and perhas a legend liu yifei did a very good  job hope the great stroy of mulan can motivate more and more little girls and boys
Sep 5 2020,negative,the cgi in this movie was terrible alot of the bug fight scenes didnt make sense mulan is in one part of the field and yet end up on the other side in 2 seconds  the good the action fight scenes was pretty good
Sep 5 2020,positive,this movie has the ending i wish the animated one would have had its got mad girl power vives all around but it really peeks right at the end women dont need a man by their side to be a power house and the purpose of the journey was not to end up with a husband thats why this version of mulan is golden no matter what the haters say
Sep 5 2020,neutral,terrifically beautiful and yet emotionally empty all the same disneys liveaction remake of mulan doesnt quite hold up when compared to its superior animated original theres plenty of plot and character changes that weigh down the film extracting or removing certain narrative elements that had worked previously and making certain choices and additions that bolster the film without bringing back its familiar flair fun or ferocity despite tzi mas stellar but small performance intense action and a realistic setting filled with spectacular vistas mulan is a serviceable reflection of its animated self that flounders with problems in pace tone and story while it may not be the worst liveaction remake from disneys treasured animated films fans of the original may still get a kick out of this tale even with all of its strengths and flaws
Sep 5 2020,negative,disappointing maybe the second remake will get it right
Sep 5 2020,positive,ignore the critics watch this film its not a remake of the animated musical but thats the point its not supposed to be a strong story beautiful cinematography and well worth watching
Sep 5 2020,positive,i watched this after away on netflix last night and so liked this a lot more it had heart to it and i really felt something strong before going to bed i missed the music it was hard to hear the songs in the background all the time and not wait to hear them sung at the credits it was so loud and over the top singing which i did not like atall
Sep 5 2020,positive, i like the action scenes so much and the visual is just incredible
Sep 5 2020,negative,it was meh  dont spend 30 dollars to watch it it does not have the charm of the original the first half is a snooze fest could have easily napped though it second half with the action is ok but predictable the ending of the cartoon is better somehow mulan has superpowers in this version   its just an ok movie nothing to write home to mom about
Sep 5 2020,negative,man way to screw up mulan disney such a disjointed and poorly written script when a perfect one was already there not a single character was likeable or built up properly the worst was the lack of any music originally it had some of the best of any disney movie way to tear the heart out of a classic please dont remake aristocats id like to hang onto some semblance of sanity
Sep 5 2020,negative,horrible movie would not recommend to anyone best to watch something else or maybe even watch the cartoon again if you want mulan material
Sep 5 2020,negative,not true to the original and not good on its own merits boring with deviations from the original that add nothing
Sep 5 2020,neutral,great movie if you never watched the original mulan its was a let down that they barely put anything that related to the animated movie i mean no mushu  no cricket no grandma  like wtf what i was most pissed about is the iconic scene wear she cuts her hair with the sword and suits up in her dads armour is no where to be found    even the iconic music was a letdown    its a good movie on it own but nothing like the original that they were suppose to convey 
Sep 5 2020,positive,very enjoyable movie great special effects  story is a little slow in the beginning  i cant wait to watch again great job disney 
Sep 5 2020,positive,finally a disney reboot that isnt a subpar carbon copy of the original watching frame for frame remakes like aladdin or the lion king just make me wish i was watching the original animated movie because theyre better period i loved that this remake honored the chinese film making style loved the awesome fight scenes and the more serious mood maybe the best part of all no cringy attempt at a cg mushu good on them for not trying to shoehorn elements of the original beloved as they are where they dont fit i hope all disney remakes moving forward are this fresh feeling
Sep 5 2020,negative,dull dragged out fight scenes were poorly captured
Sep 5 2020,negative,it was terrible no moo shoo and they added in the movie that shes a witch what the heck stick to the original story way better and had comic relief this movie was never meant to be this serious the cartoon version is better dont ruin your childhood by watching this disaster
Sep 5 2020,negative,this version of disneys mulan was poorly made it looked cheap horrible acting no music no comedy everything you love about the original was missing mulan looked miserable the whole time if i could get my money back i would disney needs to stick to the original script and if they dont like the original script then they need to write a new movie and have a new title i feel its false advertisement to an extent
Sep 5 2020,positive,this adaptation of mulan is fantastic it changed a bit from its predecessor animated film and it payed off this film is by far the best live action disney film and this is how you do a live action remake of a classic film gong li was a great addition to film and was my favourite character would highly recommend this film but if you dont feel like paying to see this film it will be released for free on disney  1010
Sep 5 2020,negative,disappointing  poorly written lacking depth
Sep 5 2020,positive,a cinematic marvel that tells the legend of mulan through a more authentic lens while staying loyal brave and true to the original disney classic
Sep 5 2020,negative,if you take the original mulan and remove everything that made it good you get this    i think its official disney has run out of ideas its clearer than ever that these disney remakes are now just constant cash grabs in no way is this movie worth 30maybe more like 3 it changes all the wrong things making it a much lesser version of the original at least it stays true to the message of mulans tale and includes some cool action scenes but with no music no charm and no heart this movie wasnt even close to capturing the magic of the original as a remake it sucked and as a standalone movie separate from its predecessors it still sucked if youre a fan of mulan i would stay far far away from this remake quite honestly just rewatch the original    score 3 out of 10  overall bad    recommended for fans of some cool action scenes maybe fans of chinese culture but definitely not recommended for any fans of the original mulan
Sep 5 2020,positive,very inspiring much better than the expectation yifei did a very good job she is a real warrior
Sep 5 2020,positive,very different from the original but definitely a great movie especially if you like stylized fighting and fantasy definitely enjoyed it
Sep 5 2020,neutral,the movie was ok the action seem too quick and too fast the storyline was too quick the only good part was the witch it was good but the only disappointment is its no music no mushu no good humor i was hoping that dragon luck thing was mushu but i guess not but ether way the movie was ok but it was not worth 30 dollars tho 35 star
Sep 5 2020,negative,no music no character depth no rewatch  on a positive note there were great visuals
Sep 5 2020,negative,a poorly acted wooden mulan is already insult enough but there isnt any joy heart character growth or depth to mulan and this remake i thought hey theyre not making this a musical and theyre toning down the magical aspects of the original cool theyre gonna add something different maybe take risks and make it grittier nope its disney instead they replaced it with nothing better adding poor villains cringe humor and action that has its cool visually interesting moments but looks too polished to the point of being fake and devoid of tension
Sep 5 2020,negative,dishonor  this movie was boring and tries too hard to be a ang lee or a zhang yimou movie but without the care and heart if this is what they wanted why didnt disney just give the film to someone of asian descent who does amazing movies like these i am disappointed and annoyed the 2009 jingle ma version of mulan was superior in every way watch that instead or the amazing original disney animated mulan
Sep 5 2020,positive,most of the complaints i have seen here i was unable to see in the movie the movie is great and it not being as the animated does not make it a bad movie even if the animated one is better that does not make this one a bad movie it was entertaining emotional inspiring and visually breathtaking i rarely give 5 stars to movies but i honestly cannot think of a single thing i either disliked or disagreed with
Sep 5 2020,negative,i didnt particularly like the casts  no one seemed to be playing their roles to its full potentials the story was quite uneventful straight forward with nothing new to offer  none of the fight scenes were memorable  and the final scenes ended abruptly  2999  monthly membership  save your moneyhonestly in hindsight i wouldnt have watched it even for free
Sep 5 2020,negative,poor story and even worse casting mulan could have been anyone you pick on the street effect would have been the same
Sep 5 2020,positive,its better than i expected but it could have been great with the songs disney never should do this again 
Sep 5 2020,negative,this movie had a terrible plot but the 1 star goes to all the cool action sequences
Sep 5 2020,positive,i thought no musical would be disappointing but i was actually intrigued by the newer version of mulan i was moved by mulan and her father so much the best acting is among these two together so touching i also like the action scenes so much and the visual is just incredible
Sep 5 2020,positive,cinematography 95 mulan is a sight to behold definitely one of the biggest strengths and pulls of the film its asian nostalgiaas i have mentioned in my previous post mulan gives you legit asian martial arts films vibes some of the camera works are so smooth they dont leave you with vertigo at least for me it would have been awesome tho if they actually put more soldiers because most of the time it looked like a 500 vs 600 war tbh its china theyve got hundreds of thousands of soldiers lol    edit ok its not actually a war in the strictest sense but still hahaha    lie yifei 90 perfectly cast no doubt she gave mulan the dignity of a true warrior again politics aside posted about her previously i guess i just wanted mulan to be a bit clumsier just like in the animated film shes overpowered here    soundtrack 10 christina aguilera enough said    choreography 95 the martial arts fights really were so asian and i mean that in a good way i just love watching mulan do the barrel roll ala captain america stylebut more elegantly refined  but i also just wanted to see a bit more blood and gore lol i know its a pg13 film    script 55 this is where i found it a bit lacking i feel like there werent enough powerful lines in the film and the dialogues could have used more depth i wanted to hear more the flower that blooms in adversity is the most rare and beautiful of all moments iykwim i wanted to gag when they used tranquil as a forest but on fire within as part of a monologue tho lol    characters 55 edit mulani wanted to know her more her character development i feel was rushed at times supporting charactersi feel like they were not fleshed out enough to make me really care about them i wanted to see mulan with her troops more to see her struggle with them also i got over mushu but it would have been wonderful to have mulans grandmother right which leads me to my next point    comedic reliefhumor 50 it wasnt lacking in the film but it was sparse i feel like the characters who were clearly meant to supply it sort of falls shortwhich is probably the result of the weak part of the script and also not giving other characters enough screen time i understand that they chose the epic route but most of the time it was just too serious  mulans tranformation 60 i wanted to see the epic hair cut i guess liu yifei didnt want to cut it     i know these two should be under characters but anywaaaay  the witch 50 idk shes supposed to be part of mulans catharsis but i feel like it did not really come across as well as they intended it    the adviser 40 would have supplied the humor in the film if he were in the barracks strutting with his arrogance and idiocy i think he could have also developed the relationship between mulan and her troops    edit i forgot to mention the all asian top notch casting chefs kiss  nonetheless the ending was still powerful enough to make me love this remake 
Sep 5 2020,negative,definitely didnt live up to the hype was boring for the most part
Sep 5 2020,neutral,mulan is visually affecting action drama hampered by a watereddown and choppy script
Sep 5 2020,positive,melhor live action a surra no mogli
Sep 5 2020,positive,it is not a recreation of the original it is more an adaptation of the original story
Sep 5 2020,negative,i like the message just not the delivery overall i found it empty and dare i sayboring a soulless interpretation of a classic
Sep 5 2020,neutral,definately was not like the animated mulan we knew and loved something else  overall it was okay just not what was expected from disney
Sep 5 2020,negative,i think this movie was rotten
Sep 5 2020,positive,really loved how they transformed mulan from animation to live action great performances and much much better than aladdin
Sep 5 2020,negative,the movie tries to bring new elements eg qi pheonix witch but they are extremely superficial none of them actually help the movie the plots make no sense and have no logic lius performance gives no life and depth to the legendary heroine
Sep 5 2020,positive,very impressed a well done movie and perfect for the entire family
Sep 5 2020,positive,legendary great movie
Sep 5 2020,negative,the movie is boring i guesstake note this is from the person that love disney and the 1998 version of mulanthere are a lot of things in the movie that just doesnt make sense and the movie didnt tell us what and why the settings are in the moviefor examplemulans sister is she important in the movienoif you pull the character out from the movie will it affect the movie hell nothere was a time when i thought that disney live action remake is not badbut after i watched lion king and mulan i highly doubt thatif you are a big fan of disney you can go watch itif you are a big fan of mulanyou can also go watch itif you are a liu yi fei fan you can also go watch itif not i highly recommend you to just stay at home and save the moneydisney im very dissapointed 
Sep 5 2020,negative,wow what a disgrace to call this a movie is a dishonesty to the craft my goodness the fact that these critics collectively gave this movie an 80 makes me think they were paid off did they watch the same movie by far the cheesiest poorly written horribly incorporated cgi disney film ive ever had the displeasure of watching music was decent so i give it a 2  also acting was mindblowingly numbing horrible
Sep 5 2020,positive,i thought milan was very good the photography was beautiful and very well done story did jump around a bit but didnt take away from the story
Sep 5 2020,positive,the original animated version is one of my favorite disney films so i was excited for the live action version while it is visually stunning it lacks the emotional depth of the original the lack of songs and a sense of humor leaves a gaping hole although i understand why they chose not to include them those of us who are fans of the original will also really dislike the penultimate fight scene that was so pivotal to the original it certainly left me underwhelmed while i did tear up at the end that could have been due to the alcohol i had been consuming and how much i miss my family during covid still worth a watch but maybe wait until december or see it in theaters if you can
Sep 5 2020,positive,enjoyable romp with some nice action set pieces family friendly action flick which carries a positive message  just as well the emperor was one of the nicer ones from the dynasties and looked to be building a meritocracy else things could of got dicey at the end
Sep 5 2020,negative,for an action martial arts movie the actions were cut to bits i enjoyed watching donnie yens 16s sword demonstration cut 16 times i rewound and counted not only that many cuts and edits have continuity issues it made some characters look like theyve teleported as well as ruined what shouldve been emotional scenes    overuse of slomo actors lines dont match their acting some very cringy dialogues many situationsscenes just dont make sense walking off during training sure it looks cool as heck would it work in the armymilitary training for war though i could only suspend my disbelief for so many minutes and got bored before the half way point    i thought the bad guys and gal were kinda cool they couldve been great villains but were never fleshed out i found the witchs character more sympathetic and relatable than mulans she emotes more for starters though her screen time and character decisions were too rusheddidnt make sense    and finally the elephant in the room what the heck is up with the chi crap we need an asian harrison ford in the movie to say thats not how chi works but seriously it sends a very specific message if you stay true to yourself you will achieve great things but only if you were born with lots of chi and you are surrounded by people who are beneath you    my one compliment for the movie its got great visuals the cinematography is amazing colourful set pieces nice costumes great wide shots there were a few interesting camera movements which made me go whoa ok thats kinda cool but those were immediately dashed by the many cuts and edits
Sep 5 2020,positive,niki caros mulan is one of the few live action adaptations that gives itself a reason to exist by not only doing something completely different with the source material but also honoring the legacy of the original film the film show cases good action sequences great cinematography and camera work breathtaking locations and production design that were definitely meant to be experienced on the big screen even if the editing and cgi might not be as good as they can be 84100
Sep 5 2020,negative,questionable direction and bad casting  another classic ruined by liveactions
Sep 5 2020,negative,the movie was excessive not faitful to original story the worst disney liveaction ever
Sep 5 2020,negative,storyline is weak fighting scene is so disappointed dont be stupid to spend 30 on this
Sep 5 2020,negative,a bad remake of a great disney film    originally a story about a smart young woman who runs away to join the millitary out of sheer love and desperation to save her fathers life    now a story of a magical warrior princess  who is capable of defeating scores of enemies on her own without armor in mind numbing martial arts scenes with the ultimate goal of defeating a chinese wizard who leads a hoarde of magic steppe nomads who can run up a 90 degree wall without breaking a sweat    no mushu  no songs  no emotional plotline  none of the clever humor in the original  the background music plays stings of the original songs rubbing salt in the wounds that we wont get to hear the original songs   the lead actress isnt great and some of her english dialogue feels clunky      and all of the professional critics give this movie an 810     shocking how that works
Sep 5 2020,negative,the worst disney movie i have ever seen the original plot is too modified the new antagonist makes no sense and the bsodialogues are extremely poor
Sep 5 2020,negative,its a big disappointing   as a fan everything ruined
Sep 5 2020,positive,great movie one of disneys best
Sep 5 2020,positive,amazingly produced the family loved it and will watch again   we would have gone to the cinema to have seen this film so paying the extra was fine for disney as it actually saved me money
Sep 5 2020,positive,a refreshing take without the slapstick comedy singing and the talking creatures one of the best live action remakes of disney
Sep 5 2020,negative,dont spend your money in this it was awful to watch
Sep 5 2020,positive,as an asian woman it is amazing to watch a movie like this great moral of the story amazing plot and well played super recommended
Sep 5 2020,positive,what s supermovie  makes me think of the clan of the flying daggers  top i enjoyed it al lot
Sep 5 2020,neutral,bland as hell definitely on the lower end of disneys remakes the qi phoenix feels off for some reason characters are as flat as cardboard definitely not worth spending extra money to watch this movie
Sep 5 2020,positive,great storytelling i have never seen the animation so no biases here i love the phoenix and how redemption and honor was portrayed
Sep 5 2020,positive,great ending good emotional plot 1010
Sep 5 2020,positive,a good movie but not that great
Sep 5 2020,positive,there are key differences in the movie from the 1998 animated movie regardless the movie does have the ability to stand on its own with great choreography and a good moral yet the film lacks in some parts of its action sequences by transition the scenes a little too much and possessed some unfinished cgi additionally in some scenes mulan didnt seem to express what she is feeling in scenes where it was needed    compared to the 1998 animation the liveaction didnt bring to life some of the core parts of the animated movie these would include the eyeopening scene when the imperial army reaches the battlefield with the transitioning music where you can feel for the soldiers and the heartbreaking part where mulan puts on her fathers armor also i feel that the film had left out the most important part of the story the moral the moral of the story in the animated film seemed miles greater the moral of the liveaction one of revealing to the world your true self in the original animation the moral of the movie was to work hard to prove yourself to the world who you truly are which i like better while in the liveaction the moral is to just reveal yourself and put in a sizable effort where it brings close to the maximum amount of your power in the animation you can feel the strenuous training that mulan goes through to achieve the level of power in the movie    although i do like the new aspect that liveaction brings to life from the animation and original tale i feel that the movie had lost some of its core essentials when transitioning from the original 1998 animation
Sep 5 2020,negative,they could have done our girl way better  it was like it just made terrible decisions with the pace  loved the animated version but like lion king star wars and now mulan they fumbled the ball on the goal line
Sep 5 2020,positive,amazing retelling of the story if you want a shot for shot remake of the cartoon classic this is not it the film has a serious tone and is action oriented with no musical numbers or major comedy if you can separate this film from the cartoon it is extremely well done and beautiful
Sep 5 2020,positive,its one of the best movies  thank you disney for giving us an amazing movie  it is beautifully presented and an amazing cinematography and fantastic  totally its epic  we want more movies like mulan and also mulan part 2  it was that amazing
Sep 5 2020,negative,it felt like the movie wasnt sure what it was trying to be it was strange misguided and just generally lacking it was brave for disney to turn a war legend into a family movie the first time around but without the ability to rely on animation and no comedic relief or musical breaks i dont know who the movie was intended for     i liked the subtle homage to the original soundtrack though thats what kept it going for me
Sep 5 2020,negative,for kids it is too serious boring  for adults it is too silly embarrassing
Sep 5 2020,negative,dull story with bad acting
Sep 5 2020,positive,mulan was an overall decent film it is definitely better than most of their other live action films some of the subplots werent forced which was nice to see as disney has a tendency of shoving some awkward subplot in the movie the only really thing that bothered me was the editing it was pretty bad in my opinion one more small think that bothered me was that liu yifeis acting at times was a bit lackluster with no emotion overall it was a decent movie and wont be a waste of your time
Sep 5 2020,positive,loved what they did with this movie they really made mulan an kickbutt action movie with lots of heart they still had some ties to the animation but it was its own movie
Sep 5 2020,neutral,while the effects set costumes and action choreography were visually appealing the movie was quite bland i finished the movie without ever really feeling for any of the characters except for the witch and i didnt feel like i had really witnessed a war movie at all for a pg13 movie the battle scenes were too mild
Sep 5 2020,positive,oh my god that was sooo good l love seeing her preparing for the whole wife thing with the combits so out of the movie wow i like watching her sword skills and the arrow in the airits so cool and im going to fall in love with her
Sep 5 2020,positive,the good the scene is beautiful and spectacular and the feminine part is good  the bad the rhythm and cohesion of each story scene is poor the war scenes are spectacular but the fighting is awkward and the acting of the leading actor is even more awkward
Sep 5 2020,positive,i love the cartoon mulan and i love this liveaction adaptation the adaptation is not completely the same as the previous but the core is the same they are both heartwarming and motivational i decided to share my review because of the negative reviews the movie is getting
Sep 5 2020,negative,as a big fan of the original mulan i was worried about this movie the disney live action remakes have been a mixed bag for me i loved cinderella the jungle book and aladdin i absolutely hated beauty and the beast dumbo and the lion king sadly this mulan goes in the hated group for whatever reason they decided to add a form of the force to this movie turning the once inspirational courageous and sympathetic mulan into a ray who has no need for training or learning or getting better because she was born to begin with with magical powers that us mere mortals can never hope to have theres no way to relate to this mulan who goes to battle armor free and hair loose as one doesthis movie served only to remind us how amazing the original is with its charm humor music and wonderful messages somehow the animated movie with a talking dragon manages to be way more heartfelt and emotional and even has a much scarier and more menacing villain we watched the original immediately afterwards to clean our minds from this ridiculous version we need more fa mulans not more rays 
Sep 5 2020,positive,my mulan review pros  cons minor spoilers film 710 pros 1 the cinematography of the film is really beautiful the scenes and colors are great and really feels true to the beauty of china for anyone who is familiar with the china pavilion at epcot in disneyworld you definitely get that vibe as well lots of reds and yellows in the film you can tell it was meant to be in theaters 2 the characters are likeable in this film especially some of the boys who she has to train and live with while shes an undercover soldier mulan herself isnt bad although she is on the quiet side she has a sweet relationship with her father and really values family much like the original villains are also interesting and different than the original but in a good way 3 different added element in the story about mulan in the original mulan goes to fight alongside the soldiers and does know much about sword fighting or training whatsoever which isnt realistic considering how fast she becomes an amazing fighter in the new mulan however her upbringing is similar but not really she isnt quite clueless she makes different decisions but in a good way you have to watch it its makes more sense for the story 4 without giving anything away there are also things they obviously added to the story and about mulan and her family that are really nice some things that would have been awesome if they were in the original they pay homepage to the original in cool creative and great ways too one point my family all went hey and pointed at the screen during the film but i wont give it away cons 1 yes its not a musical and theres no mushu some of the fantastic things you love about the original are not there unfortunately they tried to fill in those blanks by doing other things but it still would of been much better if they had at least added one of the two 2 mulan has a different personality while it may make more sense for the story and culture it felt weird that mulan was so quiet in the original she is extroverted argumentative and sometimes silly at times but in this one shes very much of a serious girl who loves her family and loves her culture and her kingdom while her personality change isnt bad it felt like the casting may not have been quite on point 3 not on the same scale as some of the other live action remakes the new beauty and the beast and the new maleficent were 810s for me but this one wasnt quite there close but not quite the plot of the film was different than the original although they kind of are all getting that way it didnt feel as strong 4 things from the original are not there without pointing out each thing there are several elements and scenes that the original had that this does not a big character shang is not in this one but is replaced with an older more age realistic general while a soldier that is mulans equal befriends her even though the difference in the male characters military title isnt bad shang is such a cool character in the film and its a real shame he wasnt there it still is a good movie could they have done better yes but it wasnt a fail i think the director was trying to make a wonder woman type character which i am all for but because it strayed from the original happier version it wasnt an 8 or above for me mulan is still awesome though and she is still my favorite disney princess or should i say warrior
Sep 5 2020,positive,such a great movie oh man im so pumped about iti really like how they castedi think this is the one live action disneylike animated transferthe capability of being not just as good as the original moviebut far more excellent than the original oneim very excited when mulan kills enemies with her sword  shes doing all the martial arts and cool stuff with the sword moving and that fight scene is pretty good
Sep 5 2020,negative,bad flat acting donnie yen and jet li werent enough to save this why is there a magical bird sorceress witch lady when they were trying to make it more real the costume design seemed way too colorful to be an accurate representation heartless and soulless pacing is awful stick to the original cartoon
Sep 5 2020,positive,best movie in times of corona
Sep 5 2020,negative,with poor pacing contrived dialogue and lack of meaningful character development this rendition of mulan is much like the disney version before she finds herself a fake facade with all the good bits hidden away this movie is neither loyal nor true to the disney adaptation but ill applaud its bravery for trying something different
Sep 5 2020,positive,wow loved it  what a beautiful movie  some disgruntled reviewers seem to be enamored with the original animated film but never having seen it i had nothing to compare to  this version however is a masterpiece  an instant classic  emotionally stirring  beautiful songs by christina aguilera also
Sep 5 2020,positive,its really full of inspiration im glad my little girl says she wants to be a mulan after watching the movie im also touched by their family love and girls power perhaps every family shall enjoy the movie for love for courage and hope
Sep 5 2020,neutral,definitely not as bad as you might have heard but also not as good as its source material mulan is good to look at but fails at execution 5510
Sep 5 2020,negative,direction script and casting all questionable director seemed to want to focus on creating epic scenes but why would anyone spend 30 to watch a mulan liveaction remake for action scene another classic ruined
Sep 5 2020,negative,its ok i guess the main selling point is the spectacle and thats about all it actually delivers its a third rate marvel movie at best all of the flash with no actual substance for all the talk of honor they never actually flesh that out very well and to call the characters two dimensional may actually be generous at least when a superhero movie has these flaws they dont try to pretend its actually a deep experience
Sep 5 2020,negative,the movie is totally forgetable i miss the good songs and voices in the original mulan lius performance was as stiff as the background which was a joke i thought i was watching a broadway show the plots pacing was also patchy there were some ok fighting scenes but simply lasted too long damn i want my money back
Sep 5 2020,negative,no kissing scene no mythical creaturesbut hell yea lets make mulan a marie sue with dragon ball z powers thank you disney disgrace to the animation disgrace to the fans disgrace to mulan
Sep 5 2020,positive,i must said the movie actually quite shock me when mulan was filmed into live action movie i found the storyline was quite interesting and moved me even though there some of the action not really fascinating however overall it was really an amazing story to be honest i look forward for next chapter of mulanmovie
Sep 5 2020,negative,it was fine for what it was but it wasnt memorable and it certainly wasnt worth the price i doubt ill watch it a second time theres no need i think its fair to compare remakes to originals and in this case it didnt do justice and it certainly was not better just a bland remake
Sep 5 2020,negative,wow a very boring movie with stilted acting it looks good i suppose
Sep 5 2020,negative,mild spoilers    this version of mulan makes her a mary sue she is born with a huge reservoir of chi which makes her more powerful than everyone else she didnt work for it she didnt do anything to deserve it she was just born with it in the animation she actually makes up for her lack of physical strength by outsmarting everyone else not here here shes just a child prodigy     just because she takes part in the training doesnt mean she needs it shes actually suppressing her power elsa style    apart from that the movie has glaring editing amateurish mistakes one moment shes holding the sword the next shes already armored up and striding out of her village any emotional charge or dramatic tension is gone from this scene compared to the original animation in another part mulan wants to find higher ground to fight the enemies she mounts her horse and the very next frame shes already behind a rock shooting arrows it feels like the movie was butchered in the editing room    they also stripped down any comic relief whatsoever no mushu no jokes even granny had to go the movie takes itself too seriously to the point where it becomes dull the actor playing mulan has the acting range of a wood plank the cgi is sometimes ok and sometimes hideous    theres nothing epic about the fights like it was promised weve seen wirefu done a lot better in crouching tiger hidden dragon and in house of flying daggers and even in the matrix there are no epic scale battle scenes    this movie is inferior to every other version of mulan out there including and especially to the animation of 1998    its not a terrible movie mind you but its definitely not worth the 30 bucks and i have no wish to watch it again one time was more than enough     this movie is in fact scaleddown in every sense theres magic or chi but its not magical the fights seem to be actually scaled down from the animation fewer people less epic huge empty fields even the imperial city has no citizens empty streets everywhere we never get to connect with the other characters and we do not care for them mulans village is smaller the war camp is smaller the pacing feels rushed its amazing that with all the songs taking up screen time and about 30 minutes less the original amination felt a lot more fleshed out and had better pacing    disney sacrificed everything that made this movie special in order to appeal to the chinese audience i hope it pays out to them this movie is just the latest disappointment in a series of unnecessary remakes it is certainly not worth 30 dollars to watch
Sep 5 2020,negative,maybe its not the worst thing ever but its close if you wanted to watch a retelling of the og mulan youre in for a wasted evening if you want some kungfu hustle mixed with some distorted nostalgia then this is for you
Sep 5 2020,positive,this movie was breathtaking from the choreography to the cinematography to the depth of the character development i feel like i have walked the journeys of the characters with them and those journeys were as individual as they were worthwhile this mulan grows into a strong independent woman with integrity and the courage to accept the responsibility for her actions she succeeds without the necessity of a love interest to validate her worth instead demonstrating the importance of love of family and loyalty to friends making her a wonderful example and role model for a new generation of children the movie is a celebration an homage and an inspiration even giving a tasteful nod to the original mulan animated feature through small details woven into the musical score and visual elements  i give this movie my highest recommendation
Sep 5 2020,negative,this movie was very auwful horrible and it isnt a good representation of chinese culture and disney mulan original movie was amazing
Sep 5 2020,positive,my review of disneys mulan a live action retelling that works thanks to being able to take out some elements of the cartoon and being more true to the folklore to form its own identity a great cast including jason scott lee donnie yen and jet li and great vfx on the phoenix final score  45  ps look out for a wellcrafted ming nawen cameo
Sep 5 2020,positive,this movie is far better than the original animation version of it   the story however falls in various places between the movie but the actors make up for it by their performances   overall a good movie to watch
Sep 5 2020,positive,my lover mulani love you so muchyou are my princess
Sep 5 2020,negative,it was good but a bit too boring
Sep 5 2020,positive,whether youre talking about the amazing job that disney did in remaking the jungle book in liveaction or how they made a very disappointing attempt at bringing dumbo back to life theres no denying that they arent slowing down anytime soon mulan was their latest to be released earlier this year but due to many complications it has now premiered on disney while i cant say it surpasses the animated original in any way its absolutely one of the better remakes theyve done i could see this reaching a wide audience over time but with this particular release strategy i cant see 2020s mulan making a big enough splash here are my thoughts on mulan as a whole     much like the original film this rendition of mulan follows the titular hero as she disguises herself as a man in order to join the war in place of her father going against traditional family and gender beliefs she rises to the occasion and bests everyone around her shes had training her whole life so it comes as no surprise at all when shes able to pull off incredible feats which i feel is the films greatest downfall even though its entertaining the emotional core is very much present but things do feel like theyre glossed over at times with that said though for every minor issue there was always a positive to balance it all out    as i said the greatest downfall is that theres not a single surprising thing to the character of mulan this time around on top of that the absence of music is very much felt here because they chose to include narration explaining certain characters choices instead this felt very pointless to me as it felt like it was dumbing everything down for the audience i truly feel that these choices did hurt the film as a whole still this is a very wellmade movie all around     from the score to the cinematography this film feels epic in every sense of the word sadly with it being sent to streaming the big screen experience just wont be possible for this movie anymore there are some massive sweeping shots that wouldve benefited from a giant screen but it is what it is for this reason i found myself attached to the more subtle character moments which ended up giving the movie a layer i may not have latched onto on the big screen maybe thats just me but i felt the movies weaknesses were given an accent with this watchathome tactic    in the end the 2020 liveaction remake of mulan probably isnt going to have diehard fans preferring it over the one the loved in the past but newcomers may get a nice story to follow along with yifei liu does a great job in the title role and felt like she was paying homage to the animated film while also making it her own the original story is still present but different which was nice and the epic scope is absolutely felt making this a great movie to look at i will say some of the creative choiceschanges didnt quite work for me but its still a very enjoyable movie overall id say give it a watch especially for families
Sep 5 2020,negative,absolutely horrible nothing like the original  seriously if disney is going to make live adaptations of their films they need to at least try to follow the story that was originally in place
Sep 5 2020,positive,omgits so unbelievableim crying twice
Sep 5 2020,negative,i was very disappointed about this movie there is no character development and music especially on mulan it seems like she has a special power from the start all the way to the end which is not how mulans character is and the costumes are too overstated and a lot of over acting there is not a single part touch me
Sep 5 2020,positive,beautiful scenery well acted and a fun journey from beginning to end
Sep 5 2020,neutral,falls squarely in the midtier of the liveaction disney remakes
Sep 5 2020,negative,stale lifeless with the saturation cranked to 100 terrible dialogue worse action scenes and zero emotion
Sep 5 2020,negative,soulless and joyless sunday afternoon movie at best
Sep 5 2020,positive,trust me dont trust all of the review from internet you know most of them just talking bad about mulan but personally i think its one of the best disney remake i dont really like disney princess that really imaginative but this one is amazing mulan is difference from other princess thats why i love it this film is worth to watch 
Sep 5 2020,positive,i love mulan she is my hero 
Sep 5 2020,negative,me 2019damn this lion king remake is awful those disney remakes  cant get any worse  mulan 2020 hold my beer
Sep 5 2020,positive,best disney live action adaptation yet this is disneys answer to warners wonder woman yeah they promised captain marvel as a film about female empowerment but that film never felt like what they promised but in mulan they did it         liu yifei shines in the titular roleher relationship with father is one of the best elements in this film there are some funny elements also there           niki caro did a great job in this film she really understands the core concept of the legend this is better than any other disney tales you have seen in live action disney did great job by not completely remake the film at the same time they honor the animation version i like they made it as a pg13 version director caro knows how to stage elaborate action sequences and she is equally adept at light comedy and the heavier dramatic moments         the biggest strength of mulan is its technical aspects the set pieces is nothing like you ever seen on disney remakes its a visual marvel in every frame the action scenes are well choreographed i really loved gong li as witchher character arc is really good as mulan donnie yen and jet li played as commander and king has very smaller role in this          i hate disney for releasing mulan not in theatresthis film deserves that its a win for disney live action remakes they did great job in cinderella but in mulan even superior the locations of the film were really great i saw this movie trailer in imax once it was really great i really miss the imax experience        mulan is perhaps the best example of how to marry the original with something fresh the ballad of mulan has always been an epicscale story about the power of being yourself in a world not ready to accept that a tale that will likely always have resonance
Sep 5 2020,positive,had a ton of potential  lots of things were just oddincluding mulan throwing off her armor going into battlesmh  no emotional connection to anything here  not terrible but not great disney really needed a home run here but they got a ground rule double  stop with the remakes  does no one have an original idea
Sep 5 2020,positive,i love the liveaction mulan i saw mulan crying on the sand dunes and i wanted to cry too the film is worthy of success 
Sep 5 2020,positive,i loved how they made it all about her accepting herself as she is and not hiding as a man i also loved that the supporting male characters were not intimidated by her but stood by a strong and capable woman the animated version will always have a special place in my heart but this new vision is what we need in the world right now
Sep 5 2020,positive,the film didnt disappoint me even much more than i expected perfect for the whole family to watch i love mulan i love yifei 
Sep 5 2020,positive,my most anticipated of the year did not disappoint the original version is my favourite disney animated film so this had a lot to live up to i should note that im not a fan of straight near shotforshot remakes ex  beauty and the beast and like these newer versions to do things a bit different this new mulan definitely did do things differently but i did not miss mushu or the songs because i still have them in the original and i loved the new characters and twists to the tale here this movie gave me a new take that was fun packed many emotional and physical punches and was gorgeously shot a definite winner
Sep 5 2020,positive,honestly its not really all that bad now if it went under a different name it would have done quite well by itself as its own thing but other than that polishing it up and giving it a new coat of paint and calling it mulan is kind of a stretch but other than that its not terrible as other movies i have watched before and i have seen some terrible movies
Sep 5 2020,negative,lost the magic of the original and replaced it with a weird chi concept  very disappointed  lion king was a bore with all the fantasy removed mulan was intense lacking any fun  aladdin now aladdin hit it on the head with a fun vibrant homage to the original while forging a new path and new themes   i hope they get little mermaid right i dont care about the cast is what it is but the story and the songs the fundamental components that make the movies fun is what i am looking for not an artistic interpretation of a cherished classic
Sep 5 2020,negative,the acting was stiff why donnie i love you the musical score lacked emotion and the story seem extremely disjointed either via editing or simple bad writing i wanted to love this so much and i admit it was visually stunning and i enjoyed the crouching tiger hidden dragonesque wirework but it was soulless
Sep 5 2020,positive,really really love mulan
Sep 5 2020,positive,absolutely loved this it felt like disney has learnt from the faults of previous live action remakes and bringing in the classic style of chinese martial art cinema
Sep 5 2020,negative,the cartoon was way better they dropped the ball on this one
Sep 5 2020,negative,it was bad i was very disappointed i was expecting something good because it was disney but it was below average
Sep 5 2020,negative,my eyes will never recover from this movie
Sep 5 2020,negative,rating c    in the end mulan is the most disappointing remake disney has made so far and by far even though niki caro delivers the realistic distinct take that was promised its execution feels inferior to the original animated film in every single way technically and visually its the first liveaction remake from the respective studio that loses in almost every aspect to the 2d animation from more than twenty years ago the 1998s movie is far more epic and cinematic than its remake the disjointed editing is overworked to the point of omitting and skipping through characterdefining moments the action scenes are packed with unnecessary cgi that takes away from the war set pieces which also look small in scale the musical score isnt able to replace the songs from the original overflowing the film with a weirdly empty feeling despite liu yifei delivering a good performance as the protagonist as well as a few of her colleagues the acting is pretty mediocre overall storywise its a mixed bag its an undoubtedly unique version the furthest that a disneys remake has ever been from its original which will instantly upset some and please others i praise the courage and bravery in producing such a different version there are dozens of new additions that i sincerely appreciate but their execution lacks emotional impact ultimately being decisions inferior to the ones of the original the message and essence of the original are still present through another perspective which is the best compliment i can give to an otherwise quite disappointing remake
Sep 5 2020,positive,mulan is so great 
Sep 5 2020,positive,i missed the songs and the comedy from the original version the first 45min went too fast i felt like they were in a hurry luckily i enjoyed the second half not so bad no so good i still go for the animated version
Sep 5 2020,positive,mulan is so cool i love her 
Sep 5 2020,negative,this has non of the magic the original animated film was all about apart from beautiful visuals this film isnt anywhere near its counterpart which makes it feel really unnecessary in fact i believe the animation told the story so much better and should of been kept that way also disney making you to pay for this on top of a membership is a bit too much netflix has never done that at all
Sep 5 2020,positive,i was shocked by the power of women in this film mulan is our hero
Sep 5 2020,negative,boring in general with a lack of any interesting kung fu fighting scene which is certainly unforgivable given that there are jet li and donnie yen more importantly the oriental style of scenery and costume does not make up for the lack of soul in the movie disney seems to have suffered a loss in translation and the mulan remake is a halfbaked failure while the original animation version might not appear authentically chinese at least it was a consistent and enjoyable artistic expression and there was mushu       disney is charging much more on the movie than what it is worth
Sep 5 2020,positive,missing the great songs and humor from the original
Sep 5 2020,positive,incredible remake we love it
Sep 5 2020,positive,the relationship between mulan and her father was the reason why i gave full marks 
Sep 5 2020,positive,the heroin is so great 
Sep 5 2020,positive,visually stunning but the characters and plot choices thoughthey were kind of bland just an ok movie 610
Sep 5 2020,positive,im surprised this movie is so great 
Sep 5 2020,positive,yifei is really wonderful i love her she is just mulan herself
Sep 5 2020,positive,i love the cast so much
Sep 5 2020,positive,the film didnt disappoint me even much more than i expected perfect for the whole family to watch 
Sep 5 2020,positive,the story is wonderful
Sep 5 2020,negative,mulan  c flawed but worthy    another cash grab from disney after the lion king stripped off any emotion fun or remotely entertaining about the original mulan the visuals are stunning but full of cgi you can even see green screen in some places the action is very mediocre you can feel its heavily rehearsed and they are hanging by ropes    disneys excuse for not adding cricket and mushu in the movie is to bring more realism to the story but have a woman turning into birds and other humans at the same time the game of thrones daenerys dragon wings moment with phoenix was really cringeworthy    people will remember aladdin because of will smith beauty and beast because of emma watson and cinderella because lily james and cat blanchett but sadly mulan has no rememberable quality
Sep 5 2020,positive,i love this movie too much
Sep 5 2020,positive,great adaptation of the original with new story points
Sep 5 2020,positive,i thought it was a pleasure to watch  the pacing was good and the action was great  its not exactly the same story line as the animated production and thats okay
Sep 5 2020,negative,had almost nothing in common with the original mulan aside from the name mulan  it was a total recreation and not at all for the better  the acting was poor and emotionless along  the plot was fill with holes time skips and developments that has no bearing on the story and were never revisited  i was never able to connect and care what was happening to any of the characters  really dropped my faith in disney
Sep 5 2020,positive,i really love the movie 
Sep 5 2020,positive,give full marks for action play this movie is so cooli love yifei 
Sep 5 2020,negative,worst disney remake movie of all time
Sep 5 2020,negative,everything about mulan was basically butchered
Sep 5 2020,positive,mulan is so beautiful 
Sep 5 2020,positive,mulan is so handsome 
Sep 5 2020,positive,the film deserves full marks 
Sep 5 2020,positive,an excellent live action version of this classic disney tale visually stunning a must see
Sep 5 2020,positive,mulan is a good movie i love mulan 
Sep 5 2020,positive,props for not just blatantly copying the animated version like the last disney live action adaptation the lion king  and some spectacle filled action set pieces but the themes are pretty heavy handed and the animated version still remains the superior one very much like every other disney live action adaptations
Sep 5 2020,positive,beautiful  great acting meaningful  a solid disney movie you get what you expect a great disney movie for the family
Sep 5 2020,positive,i love mulan yifei is so incredible 
Sep 5 2020,positive,the movie is so great 
Sep 5 2020,neutral,what a dogshit movie did the critics watch a different movie or what
Sep 5 2020,positive,i like the fight scene the scene is also very goodlooking the main actors are doing a great job but the plot is general
Sep 5 2020,negative,i actually fell asleep
Sep 5 2020,positive,i think those who are going to watch mulan 2020 should know that this is not really a remake of the disney cartoon this version is closer to the original chinese legend about hua mulan especially the themes such as filial piety and devotion to family     this movie isnt amazing but it is also not bad the biggest problem with this movie in my opinion is the editing and the film feels a bit choppy otherwise the cast did a great job the cinematography is beautiful and it is very entertaining is it worth paying 30 bux and seeing it on disney plus well i guess if you have a family then it is worth it because it is cheaper than going to the cinema but i think this is the type of movie that should be seen on a big screen in the cinema i definitely enjoyed mulan 2020 more than aladdin 2019 and lion king 2019 though
Sep 5 2020,negative,yes it is a 2 out of 10 1 point for playing 1 point forummm never mind its a 1 out of 10 ruined my favorite disney princesshas none of the amazing music or comedy somehow the managed to make mulan unlikeable and unrelatable by making her the chosen one with an insane among of force powers the story and actors even do poorly only good actor was donny this is by far the worst remakei could go on but just thinking about this drains my soul
Sep 5 2020,negative,mulan portrayed no emotions the villains are stupidly defeated just let the chinese do the fight scenes worst disney movie ever
Sep 5 2020,positive, liu yifei is awesome she is more than beautiful she is brilliant in this movie look her martial action greatttt 
Sep 5 2020,negative,visually spectacular but the lead actress has an exaggerated acting style with poor emotive skills she killed the film
Sep 5 2020,negative,woke up on release date layer in bed to purchase on my phone then put it on the tv once i heard narration i rolled my eyes and thought what have i done but i kept an open mind and wanted it to be good   then the freaking hawk lady has a character development that makes you sarcastically think oh no i wonder how this will pan out  there is no singing that has nothing to do with my negative thoughts but it would be nice if they would chill with the reflections song being played for every damn montage or moments they get   the dialog is ugggg the skip to scene to scene has no transition theyre here oh now theyre here   the action scenes were mehhh and the ending fight was eye rolling   dont waste 30 bucks just wait until its free
Sep 5 2020,negative,it sucked would not recommend watching it the original is way better
Sep 5 2020,negative,i can not say with a heavy heart that mulan was the asian representation i craved for as an asianamerican while mulan delivers in its incredible visuals stellar music and epic fight sequences the bulk of mulan felt drastically short of my expectations the screenplay is remarkably bad im not saying this because of the lack of mushu shang and the disney songs that we all sang along to in the animated version when disney said they were making an authentic chinese story with an allasian cast i was truly excited until i found out that the people behind the scenes were a majority caucasian even the end credits song was sang by a white woman dear hollywood asian screenwriters directors and even singers exist however that is not why i disliked the movie as a standalone its awful ill jump right into the negatives characters were not complex and uncompelling overall the main antagonists did not make me feel the same demise that a man who is trying to conquer the country should make me feel not to mention the addition of a new character whose role in the movie still remains unclear to me as well as reduce the realism that the writers wanted to portray by not adding songsprevious loved characters there is also the addition of chi which further reduces the realism of mulan it undermined the strength of the protagonist which is what drew me to her character in the first place i loved mulan for her willingness to fight any dangers despite society being against her simply because she is a woman however this movie did not do that properly and unjustly especially with the random implementation of chi characters alongside mulan are given very little screentime and the charm is just simply not there they are simply not compelling even the implied romantic aspect of this movie felt incredibly forced and i could not feel a hint of chemistry cinematography was laughable as weird camera zoom ins during fight sequences took away the impact and stress of the fight as well as shaky camera work during war scenes writing sucked cinematography was mediocre at best characters honestly sucked representation all around the board sucked in terms of the positives i can only say nice things about the beautiful instrumental music that accompanied the fight scenes the stunning colour pallette and creative fight sequences although i found the ending fight sequence to be anticlimactic overall i would not recommend this movie and i truly hope hollywooddisney will learn to take asian stories and representation more seriously
Sep 5 2020,positive,wowi have to say mulan is definitely the best movie this year perfect cast skillful action and mature performance 
Sep 5 2020,negative,this remake of the classical animated movie is lacking authenticity
Sep 5 2020,positive,lights camera action  in a flash i was greeted by the films phenomenal and breathtaking cinematography stunning location majestic scenery detailed and colorful work of art altogether captures the whole aura of historic china by then my expectation were met in every sense of the word quality oh its going to be a good one i thought     for the most part i noticed the traditional or rather historical role the film creator was taking on when they omitted all of the animated films musical and witty characters unfortunately but fortunately they kind of tweaked the story line just a tiny bit which i came to appreciate as you do not want to foresee every single detail from the classic animated film i learned this from watching the remake of lion king overall the actress did a great job with her actionpacked stunt sequence which was the highlight of the movie the film creator successfully directed more of a significant film leading up to mulans journey rather than input the use of comedy as seen in the animated mulan it made sense a mustsee i demand a part 2   ps mushu is in there but not in a way you thought he was
Sep 5 2020,positive,liu yifei is charming as a leading role 
Sep 5 2020,positive,mulan was incredible 
Sep 5 2020,negative,this movie is terrible the direction is terrible the acting is terrible nothing about this movie captures the audience yet it expected us to feel for the character without giving us reason it tried to distance itself from the animated mulan but relied upon the audience having seen the original to know whats going on this version lacks the heart and soul of its predecessor it is merely a shell of the animated mulan to quote mushu dishonour dishonour on your whole family dishonour on you dishonour on your cow dont waste your money rewatch the animated mulan
Sep 5 2020,positive,mulan is really a wonderful film 
Sep 5 2020,positive,i thought mulan is the best live action adaption disney has done to date with a sense of scale stunning s and impressive battles  liuyifei is so awesome she gave everything to mulan
Sep 5 2020,negative,pacing was off and characters make choices that dont seem to align with the character buildup from the entire movie its almost like they tried to figure out what cool things they could do first then try to fill in a plot in between while being pigeonholed by the animated version save your moneyand time for something else
Sep 5 2020,positive,mulan looks the first good disney live action remake 
Sep 5 2020,positive,cool movie must watch liu yifei is very suitable to be mulans role she is beautiful and attractive 
Sep 5 2020,positive,niki caros direction is just breathtaking 
Sep 5 2020,positive,the cast is excellent 
Sep 5 2020,positive,its beautifulabsorbing rich and empowering 
Sep 5 2020,negative,i grew up watching disney mulan and loved the movie  but this live action is pure garbage  let alone the lack of original characters theres no character development you feel nothing for the new characters  cliche editing mix with a plot that has no purpose plus the lack in research on chinese history  i am amazed how this movie got such high score
Sep 5 2020,negative,awful just awful its not even the 30 bucks its 2 hours of my precious time wasted
Sep 5 2020,neutral,way too sharply edited without giving room for the characters to grow couldve benefited a lot from a little more length never goes above the few flashes of the high potential it had
Sep 5 2020,positive,easily disneys best live action roboot 
Sep 5 2020,positive,i must say the film is grrrrrrreat 
Sep 5 2020,negative,the female lead acting is just sobad shes been an actress for years but her acting skill has no changes at all besides acting scenes seems slow and disjointed
Sep 5 2020,positive,visuals were good but soul was lost some very cheesy moments in an attempt to get the magic back but lost it for me too many stunts and not enough character development for the main cast
Sep 5 2020,positive,i really love the movie 
Sep 5 2020,positive,if you are a fan of the animated there are subtle nods to the songs 
Sep 5 2020,negative,the actresss acting was too bad its make the movie so amateur i suggested watching the 1998 mulan movie it was better at every point 
Sep 5 2020,positive,mulan is absolutely fantastic 
Sep 5 2020,negative,a sad sad sad and disappointing live action remake of a classic
Sep 5 2020,negative,way to change a good female character into a mary sue they completely missed the point of mulan she doesnt need to be liberated by being a woman she is liberated by proving that she can bring honor to her family in another way that she can train fight and overcome adversity regardless of her sex also i get taking away certain characters but replacing them with others that add nothing to the story is a no for me
Sep 5 2020,negative,white director producer costume etc four people wrote the script and all four were white  this is a movie about a chinese heroine thats basically made by white peopleand it shows i dont mind having mulan remade with no music thats fine however the costumes are odd weird qigong stuff going on and the storyline just feels flat also wtf is up with gong li being a witch seeking revenge for being punished for practicing this qiwitchcraft bs hatred of witches isnt a chinese thing its a christian thing from europeamericas     i dont know how you have a majority chinese cast and still make a movie about mulan feel like it was appropriated i feel like there just wasnt enough respect and cultural competence on behalf of the film producers and director
Sep 5 2020,negative,what a waste of money by disney and especially by me
Sep 5 2020,negative,who ever thought about letting liuyi fei be the clueless unemotional robotic mulan is kinda crazy the comedy part was a huge mistake when they erased the existence of my favorite mushu
Sep 5 2020,positive,cant wait to see this again 
Sep 5 2020,positive,i like when mulan get in the war its such an amazing scene but this version too fast to show the detail about mulan emotion such as the decisions scene  the movie should show more her emotion and yes a melody
Sep 5 2020,positive,the action is thrilling 
Sep 5 2020,positive,im very surprised at how much i liked the live action mulan movie 
Sep 5 2020,positive,the plot and special effects are great
Sep 5 2020,positive,i enjoyed the movie 
Sep 5 2020,positive,the film is brilliant 
Sep 5 2020,positive,liu yifei is a great actress shes amazing
Sep 5 2020,negative,no personality no entertainment terrible characters boring no depth no maturity bad effects and costume designs and definitely an insult to women lead characters go watch the original
Sep 5 2020,positive,i really wanted to like this movie im glad that they changed and added various elements however it feels like a massive wasted potential it felt like there needed to be more development behind the relationship between mulan and her father  especially because her familys dynamic is noticeably different than the original animated film there needs to be greater context around why she has the convictions that she has  it feels like her resolve to defend the emperor just came out of nowhere with no real driving force behind it  her devotion to her family that she displays at the end of the movie feels like a payoff that was never set up  it just feels like this was supposed to have at least 40 more minutes of content and character development but it didnt  still an ok adaptation that did several things well but what a waste of potential
Sep 5 2020,positive,better than the original
Sep 5 2020,positive,i have bought and watched it on disney  the story has a high degree of completion compared to the 1998 animated version of a lot of changes can be seen as a new disney princess film dont worry if you have animation complex many classic scenes and bgm will be reappeared  liu yifeis acting is very good from a young girl after a variety of experiences grow into a soldier the eyes are funny the scene is very atmospheric almost all live action gansu danxia geothermal snow mountain palace and bustling street scene all reflect disneys intentions but veteran actors like gong li donnie yen and jet li remain steady lets see a girl grow up
Sep 5 2020,positive,shout to all the actresses in this movie theyve all done an amazing job the actors are great as well but mulan is about girl power lets admit that a woman leading a mans army this is everything thanks disney amazing job
Sep 5 2020,negative,a little over the top with the chi stuff the plot is clearly not intended to be the same as the original animated movie but the key points of the original were forcibly introduced in this live action leaving the viewer with a weird sensation the romance with the hot army dude the three friendly soldiers the army destroying avalanche the rescue of the emperor of a castle even if it was the conveniently situated empty onconstruction palace  the forced stuff warps the plot to a point where it has no sense whatsoever   in the end we have a level one chinese drama lovely in the aesthetics over the top with the chi and kung fu but lousy on the story is ok to pass the afternoon but 200m can do better and sorry but the 22 premium pass for this movie not worth it
Sep 5 2020,positive,omgi love it so muchmy children also like it yifei is mulanshe is so cool
Sep 5 2020,positive,no mushu and no spirits of the ancestors but who cares 
Sep 5 2020,positive,even without the singing comedy and dragon i am proud to say mulan is still my favorite princess
Sep 5 2020,positive,performance of actors make the music more vivid and moving 
Sep 5 2020,positive,it is important to provide new version and meaningful aspects to us there is no point to remake with  copy and paste  from the original version
Sep 5 2020,positive,incredible visually stunning and courageous film 
Sep 5 2020,positive,my wife daughter and i absolutely loved this film best thing disney has ever put out in our opinion
Sep 5 2020,positive,a heartbreaking epic system with beautiful pictures and soundtracks
Sep 5 2020,negative,ridiculous and unbelievable
Sep 5 2020,negative,the storyline are quite different and too manny action and there is almost no comedy  this really dissapoint me
Sep 5 2020,positive,my daughter and i wanted mulan and we loved it 
Sep 5 2020,negative,hypocritical and disrespectful in so many ways the creators said themselves they want to put the aspect of realism and historical accuracy towards this liveaction hence cutting down the beloved dragon sidekick which is mushu from the original animated version was necessary for this and i completely understand their choice but why then add a shapeshifting witch as a villain for this a talking dragon is silly and not realistic they said but they decided to put a superpower witch as well here thats very nonsensical in so many ways    the ballad of mulan folktale does not mention anything about the occurrence of a female witch and im so baffled for why they add this specific new character in this movie is it just for the sake of a new twist at the ending later on if you already claim to be realistic from the start then dont even try to put anything superstition later on again its very hypocritical towards your own audiences     some other negative things were the wooden acting overused cgi lighting thats suppose to be in a realistic setting again plotholes on some specific characters and the fact that they kept marketing this based on the original animated version where the heart and soul exist there instead compared to this poor liveaction rendition that is completely heartless disney liveaction movies are now nothing but just nostalgic baits
Sep 5 2020,negative,this had a chance at being good but how they chose to tell the story just didnt work
Sep 5 2020,positive,its an epic blockbuster
Sep 5 2020,positive,i just want mulans sword i dont know where to buy iti love chinese kung fu 
Sep 5 2020,negative,talk about cringe while i can happily commend the costume design and scenery of the film the fight scenes and painfully stereotypical depictions of chinese actors makes this film a flop the martial arts were highly unrealistic as a heavy dependence on mystical chi drove the story forward what was beautiful in the original 1998 film was that mulan went into the imperial army with only strength and determination not some strange otherworldly super power that allowed unrealistic jumps and balance most characters were unfortunately forgettable and as with most disney live action remakes the once scary or intimidating villain is now laughable a surprise appearance at the end no spoilers here was one of the only points of excitement in an otherwise disappointing film
Sep 5 2020,negative,this movie really sucks waste of money should have donated it to whatever org instead
Sep 5 2020,positive,as a fan of the animated disney movie i knew coming into this that i had to leave my preconceived notions about this movie at the door you simply cannot let yourself compare this movie to its animated predecessor because remember that this is an ancient chinese tale reimagined and reinterpreted by disney in 1999 and now in 2020   overall this story was good on the surface there wasnt much depth in the places where there should be xian langs character arc commander tung and honghuis character development the entire chi plot there were even moments where liu yifeis mulan was deadpan for me and did emotional resonate with me but where this movie lacked it was made up in the incredible action sequences jason scott lees bori khan felt just as menacing as shan yu while xian langs skill and power exceeded my expectations of her character   i enjoyed the moments where they recalled the animated movie through the background music and even mingna wens cameo but certain dialogue being said was a little awkward and too on the nose for me mulan took on a more mature and darker tone that may upset fans of the animated movie but i appreciate the refreshing remake of a classic story
Sep 5 2020,positive,loved it acting amazing niki caro did a wonderful job just as good as animated version
Sep 5 2020,negative,characters were flat and boring  especially the side characters this movie wants to be an action movie but the fighting choreography was very basic with no wow its missing the great fighting scenes from movies such as hero or crouching tiger hidden dragon this movie is somber and serious but without the epic courageous scenes or sacrifices you would get from a war movie       the lines were clunky and didnt fit their characters in many cases they were delivered flatly without soul i teared up during the original mulan this one leaves me feeling empty      the sets costumes and backdrops were absolutely stunning some changes were made to mulan to make her more of an empowering female character   all in all probably better than the lion king remake but not by much
Sep 5 2020,positive,fantastic the witch the birds  hawk and phoenix  great i did not need this to be a carbon copy of the animated version and i appreciated that it was not i enjoyed the slight nods to the earlier version i like that the acting was subtle and not overdone the stunts and action scenes were terrific it didnt need to be pg13 though should have been pg
Sep 5 2020,positive,i really enjoyed this take on the disney classic it was different in very thoughtful ways from the original but still really captivating and true to the spirit of the animated version i recommend watching with an open mind and not expecting it to be exactly like the original its a great movie all on its own and pays homage to the original animation in a very touching way
Sep 5 2020,positive,seeing a powerful smart asian woman literally kicking ass as the lead of a major hollywood movie made me tear up multiple times 
Sep 5 2020,positive,the movie was great the actors were so good i thought it would be more exciting to watch it in the theater
Sep 5 2020,positive,mulan is the best of disney liveaction remake films so far
Sep 5 2020,positive,great remake love both the original and this one for different reasons one of the better disney remakes
Sep 5 2020,positive,i love that it isnt a scene on scene copy of the animated movie this retelling is much fresher and honors eastern values    just like alice in wonderland maleficent and cinderella a retelling of the storymovie in a different angle is great there are nods to the animated film and thats enough im excited how theyd incorporate this in future live action adaptation thats coming im hoping the little mermaid wouldnt be a scene on scene copy of the animated film
Sep 5 2020,positive,after watching the movie with my family i think she will become the childrens new hero
Sep 5 2020,positive,its not bad as far as live action remakes go but as much as the visuals impressed a lot more could have been done on casting acting and screenplay tzi ma as that chinese dad again jet li as emotionless emperor generously sprinkled with overly acted scenes unrealistic stunts excessive cgi and cliche dialogue but hey this is a movie for children after all those who watched the original disney film as kids and have since grown up should temper expectations
Sep 5 2020,positive,i honestly loved it i watched both this one and the original today and i felt this new version brings enough different to the table while still making comforting callbacks to the animated film i really appreciated that it wasnt a shot for shot remake and i think that leaves a lot of space for both movies to be enjoyed dare i say i think i might actually like this one more than the original i will need to sit on it and watch it a few more times for sure
Sep 5 2020,positive,awsome love it i enjoyed so much
Sep 5 2020,positive,beautiful message great acting battle scenes and cinematography on point
Sep 5 2020,positive,this is not an exact copy of the animated movie we all love but it does manage to make this live action worth your whilethe best part about this storyi think is the dynamic between liu yifei and tzi maacted gracefully and and touching
Sep 5 2020,negative,absolutely hated it so much of what was good about the original was intentionally omitted they cant have an awesome talking mushu but they can have a cheesy cgi phoenix and transforming witch lady cmon so much cheese
Sep 5 2020,negative,terrible live action remake of the original the cgi was cheesy as much as the fighting elements the story was vastly different from the original mulan no mushu no singing no cutting her hair offis this even mulan
Sep 5 2020,positive,mulan is pure epic a fresh retelling of the legend very different from the animated film great cinematography catchy score and topnotch action sequences the cast is phenomenal yifei liu gong li tzima are true standouts shoutout to jfwong   also thanks to niki caro
Sep 5 2020,positive,목란은 너무 예뻐서 좋아요i really love it such a cool action movie
Sep 5 2020,positive,awesome movie just a couple small criticisms slight spoilers  i couldnt tell if the phoenix was supposed to be real or just a metaphorfigment of mulans imagination none of the other characters interact with it so its a little hard to tell  they repeated the three pillars of virtue too often like i get theyre supposed to be important but you dont have to keep listing them for us
Sep 5 2020,negative,a sorry remake of an ancient folklore with too many flaws and contradictions it was a regrettable experience and an absolute waste of time
Sep 5 2020,neutral,felt like all of the characters except for mulan were very flat  mulan is also the only character to show any noticeable development through the story  this is all a stark contrast to the original animated movie wherein mulan was surrounded by a rich cast of characters that the viewer actually grew connected with
Sep 5 2020,negative,the film felt rushed the writing is all over the place going so fast through things it feels forced the cgi in some scnes looks really bad and cheap this is not worth the extra charge they forcing on public not worth it at all im so disappointed
Sep 5 2020,negative,this literally makes fucking early syfy movies seem like special effects gods
Sep 5 2020,positive,i loved mulan i cried to many messages and virtues to value through the movie beautiful landscapes specially loved the photography and i wouldnt change anything i adore the costume design poetic   i studied theater and for the last semester we were part of a play based in china we took kungfu for months i dont remember if it was 1 or 2 training our minds and bodies in order to understand the process to be in the play we also had a little bit of kung fu demonstration that we performed in the play and i honestly loved it i love what i learnt  it was very valuable and im so grateful to have experienced that so in the future can experience things like this i admire all the hard work of these actors   i could understand very well significant symbols during the movie thanks to our shifu rodrigo like the power of chi  very remarkable in the movie this powerful energy that we all possessed
Sep 5 2020,positive,very different feel than the animated film despite following similar story line it is however more mature and more epic and thoroughly enjoyable if one goes in open minded
Sep 5 2020,positive,it holds up and stands on its own lot of tugging on the heartstrings especially with the nods to family and virtues
Sep 5 2020,positive,i think shes going to be a new hero for the kids
Sep 5 2020,positive,not a bad movie tho i expected more
Sep 5 2020,negative,way overrated save your money
Sep 5 2020,positive,this film is a winner with epic action and tantalizing drama     a young chinese maiden disguises herself as a male warrior in order to save her father    the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous filming taking place in new zealand and china with a production budget of 200 million it is the most expensive film ever made by a female director    director niki caro writers rick jaffa screenplay by amanda silver stars yifei liu donnie yen li gong jet li    amazing set pieces every frame is like a work of art  stunning to look at  the film score is top notch  this film is not a musical and that decision to remake mulan 2020 as a historical action drama really pays off in the end bringing the audience a fresh and new cinematic experience differentiating this fresh story from the charming mulan 1998 american animated musical original    the action and martial arts fight sequences are very well done yifei liu as the live action mulan i read did 90 of her own stunt work  she rides horseback  wields a sword singlehanded jian and scabbard of the 18th19th century very convincingly these are the type of skills the casting director were looking for specifically when they interviewed over a thousand candidates for the role of mulan yifei liu is perfection in her role her acting is some what stoic which in my opinion represent the chinese culture perfectly yifei liu was tremendous bringing the legend of mulan to life     disneys liveaction adaptation of mulan has earned a pg13 rating this would make mulan the first of disneys liveaction films  based off of animated classics  to earn above a pg rating this brings in the needed drama and action ramping up the intensity and grit to really make this film shine i thoroughly enjoyed this epicscale story about the power of being yourself in a world not ready to accept that a tale that will likely always have resonance 810
Sep 5 2020,negative,very slow moving movie  absolutely zero original song moments the christina aguilera promotions were just promotions it only appears in the credits mediocre acting by the cast and some of the facial expressions are seriously leaving me and my family wanting definitely not worth paying the extra fee  if you want to watch it wait till the december release
Sep 5 2020,negative,despite knowing the original storyline ie cinderella beauty and the beast this live action was so bland no depth to the characters a glimpse of nice fighting sequences but was not worth the wait so disappointed i was really hoping that this movie would have been awesome
Sep 5 2020,positive,hands down one of the most beautiful and emotionally gripping films of the year graceful charming fierce empowering and of course epic those fight sequences had me at the edge of my seat what an adventure
Sep 5 2020,negative,oh i was so disappointed with this movie i grew up and fell in love with mulan 1998 i thought it was such a lovely story of a girl who can take on the world but disney thought this was a marvel movie and felt they needed to make her into a superhero it diminishes everything the action is so cheesy and cringe the acting was so wooden and i felt no emotion or connection it really didnt need to be this way dial down the cheese for starters what is wrong with amazing traditional martial arts anyway what is wrong with a girl taking on the world she didnt need super powers thats my biggest complaint
Sep 5 2020,positive,mulan is a liveaction remake from a beloved animated film which came out more than two decades ago and generally it is different from what we saw but watching this will still give us a nostalgic vibe and reminisce the legend of her story with few additions and changes i praise the stunning scenery of their visuals and locations i cannot deny that the actionbattle scenes were shot and coordinated very well though the editing was a bit here and there but the cinematography was decent it could have been a lot better with its phasing some of the writing and the dialogue felt flat some were just cringeworthy and stale most of the performances were good but wooden a bit twodimensional there were parts in the movie that lack substance for its drama and complexion that couldve gave more impact on it still  there were specific scenes that were actually inspiring and powerful they still gave those goosebumps apart from all the pros and cons they still managed to give justice to her character and her tale i only recommend you do not think much on comparing it to the original adaption and just watch it with an open mind i give it a solid 710
Sep 5 2020,negative,not as good as the cartoon
Sep 5 2020,positive,this is the best film i have seen this year
Sep 5 2020,positive,fantastic loved everything about the film great imagery considering the time they had and everything the movie was well made the cast was amazing as well
Sep 5 2020,negative,there were changes that i liked i like that the bird was a witch that was a fun twist but the no music no mushu no grandma no dog defying gravity and little humor really brought down down the quality of the movie in my opinion really disappointed in all of the changes waste of 30
Sep 5 2020,negative,mr illlll make a bad movie out of you one word for this hollow i suggest you watch the animated version   a girl who finds herself and learns the strength to save china vs the chosen one who saves china it took out the this could be anybody element could i get a refund    also i missed mushu and the songs ha    note only my opinion if you liked it that is great
Sep 5 2020,positive,i love mulan  shes amazing i like the actor
Sep 5 2020,neutral,so i watched mulan this morning at 130am and well after months of waiting i have to say am very disappointed i love asian martial arts films and mulan has everything i love in a movielive action   but i was expecting a great awesome battlefield scene and great martial arts scene i must say the story line was good but where was that awesome fight scene they had a great cast donnie yen  jet li  gong li  liu yifei  all are amazing actors but everyone struggled to act in english all lacked body movements facial expressions because the dialect it was freakin filmed in english not in mandarin  it lacked the amazing martial arts action that asian films are known for   like god of war warlords the legend  red cliff three kingdoms etc     ive seen other mulan movies   mulan rise of a warrior 2009 movie   with actress zhao wei and chen kun   directed by jingle ma   rating      matchless mulan 2020    actress hu xue er   directed by chen cheng  rating     both of these are way better this disney film        this movie need an asian director   gordon chan yuen wooping jingle ma tsui hark ronny yu etc  not niki caro 
Sep 5 2020,negative,a fake chinese story imagined by a hollywood director weird costumes and plot twists oh there was almost no plot cuz it was just a very typical starwarlike movie without surprise as a chinese person who can recite the original story in grade 11 i think the concept of chi or you can call it the force here was abused here while the real war and hardcore genre moves should be represented more other than the so called crouchingtigerhiddendragon style dark magic note  mulan was a great soldier not a swordswoman or chinese targaryen   the slogan loyal brave and true was made up and i have never heard such kind of core values from history books i would hope the director study the five kinds of moralities 仁benevolence 义righteousness 礼manners 智wisdom 信trustworthines  two stars for the nice colors jet lee li gong and yifei liu  anyway you may like it but this is not chinese mulan
Sep 5 2020,negative,what is this xmen i really did not like the chi spin  essentially instead of willpower and hardwork shes just strong bc of some random magic bits also the editing is awful the timing for jokes and just suspense is nonexistent
Sep 5 2020,positive,i recently saw mulan technically acceptable it brings  asian culture daily lifestyles family friendship visual effects custom design the production design was perfect unfurtently killed physics and logic like a final season of got also gives cheap twist to the witch
Sep 5 2020,negative,disappointednot one song and no mushu no magic here
Sep 5 2020,positive,im a fan of the animated mulan although the reallife version does not have mushu it brings another version of mulan that is very shocking at the same time it inherits the soul of the original animation version it is a very excellent film yifei really performs well i love her 
Sep 5 2020,positive,everyone must go to see this movie highly recommended
Sep 5 2020,negative,what are the villains doing  mulan is great as a fairytale but to the reality i hope hbos dirty hands can make the story alive   one star for the hilarious bed scene in dorm
Sep 5 2020,positive,i like mulans reallife version very much
Sep 5 2020,positive,the movie is very good especially suitable for the whole family to watch milans spirit of loyal brave true run through the whole film 
Sep 5 2020,positive,good casting and beautiful cinematography some of the supporting actors really shined all in all a feast for the eyes and soul
Sep 5 2020,positive,a legendary movie worth seeing
Sep 5 2020,positive,a visually breathtaking live action remake that holds true to the core values messages and integrity of the story while also presenting many new story elements that add fresh changes and exciting variations it struggles a little bit with pacing and missing a few key character beats but overall this is a successful live action remake that kept me engaged and entertained definitely worth the 30
Sep 5 2020,positive,it was a good action movie little kids will most likely will not sit through the entire movie sad they cut out the songs but liked how some where in the background more of an adult movie
Sep 5 2020,positive,show some grace this is a live adaptation of the animated film and im pleased they did not adapt everything from the original its a mature story telling of an old story theres a lot of heart and soul in the film
Sep 5 2020,positive,this live version is different from the animated one but it is totally a successful adaption while still show respect to animation one it is worth watching one more time
Sep 5 2020,positive,live versions need to bring more to the screen like this film did this is not another copy of the animated version if you miss the elements of the animated film rewatch the animated film
Sep 5 2020,negative,bc its lame how u have a girl on the enemy team that can turn into a eagle but u can put in the dragon

Sep 5 2020,positive,30 bucks to watch a wonderful action movie with my family is totally a good bargain come up i really recommend it mulan  
Sep 5 2020,positive,the originality film and a more realistic approach were fantastic showing something new from disney
Sep 5 2020,negative,the worst movie ever  dont pay for this  any other movie is better is not a musical is not a samurais movie even not a acción movie is a crime
Sep 5 2020,positive,niki caros direction of the liveaction remake of mulan is exceptionally done 
Sep 5 2020,negative,family was greatly looking forward to this but ended up shocked at how truly bad it was and started adding their own dialogue to the experience beautiful looking film but i dont think a movie should be better with the sound off the young ones in the family fell asleep and the adults ended up treating it like mystery science theatre
Sep 5 2020,positive,true to the origin source  the ballad of mulan with added features for entertainment 
Sep 5 2020,positive,wowi have to say mulan is definitely the best movie this year perfect cast skillful action and mature performance

Sep 5 2020,negative,told my wife to wait until it was free ya that worked out well for me however it was her 3000 bucks wasted  watched tonight and this movie sucked i just thought frozen 2 was bad
Sep 5 2020,positive,this movie is awesome today is the opening day we watched it twice already on disney and plan to watch it a couple more times this weekend
Sep 5 2020,negative,not that mulan character in my mind
Sep 5 2020,positive,doesnt have to be the same exact movie is the original in order to be good
Sep 5 2020,positive,i loved it so much so powerful and wonderful
Sep 5 2020,positive,best disney animated remake
Sep 5 2020,negative,total waste of money my children got bored and it was switched off mid film
Sep 5 2020,positive,great movie i would definitely pay to watch this in imax but sadly it is not released in theatre
Sep 5 2020,positive,my whole family loves it so much very empowering and inspiring for kids its about being brave and hardworking for adults its about respecting your true self and to shoulder your responsibility
Sep 5 2020,positive,after watching it i cried because i couldnt see it in the cinema it was worth the big screen
Sep 5 2020,negative,god the only thing that they are doing is ruining the legacy of great animation which made our childhood great
Sep 5 2020,negative,please save your money and dont watch this far too serious and violent for a kids movie lost all the charm of the original since there is no mushu and songs the lead actress is very wooden
Sep 5 2020,positive,good for its role as a disney family film
Sep 5 2020,positive,retells a familiar story with some unique freshness could use a little more humor but overall enjoyable
Sep 5 2020,positive,ummm wow beautiful cinematography and some new additions to the story line
Sep 5 2020,neutral,it had some pretty set pieces and interesting updates but all in all it was a paint by numbers action film at times the dialogue was clunky the action pieces lackluster and the themes were heavy handed
Sep 5 2020,negative,this movie was garbage literally just feels like another asian movie its not a mulan movie that we all grew to love and cherish and relate with seriously this movie feels like that rushed it and just did it just to do it everything is different i definitely do not recommend paying the 30 on disney plus for something so over played out 
Sep 5 2020,positive,we just finished it and thoroughly enjoyed it it was definitely one if the better disney reimagining and the cast did a great job beautiful visuals and lovely translation of a legendary poem
Sep 5 2020,positive,excellent work it is a great family movie and nice for a weekend night disney never let me down thanks for having the right mulan she is so gorgeous and talented hahaha i know i am a big fan of disney but i have to say that i like the idea of girls can be whatever they want and princess is beautiful enough without a prince by side recommended
Sep 5 2020,positive,like the movie enjoyed it with family  nice journey of mulan from girl to a legend
Sep 5 2020,negative,im not very fond of it
Sep 5 2020,neutral,so cheesy really played on the witchs meh were different and the magic part of it rather than the brains and braun that mulan always had in my mind also flow was weird they explained stuff that didnt need explaining and gave no explanation for other things was super weird
Sep 5 2020,positive,one of the best live action disney movies the actress who played mulan is extremely talented my favorite scene is when her father said he was blessed with two daughters and when mulan left her home to go to war it was super uplifting it is such an amazing movie no one should miss it yifei is an intelligent individual with passions and love stay true
Sep 5 2020,positive,simply put this movie far exceeded my expectations mulan is a cut above all of the other remakes that disney has released it takes the story of the ballad of mulan and integrates it into an enjoyable two hour film while also incorporating elements from the animated movie the cinematography is lush and the costuming is breathtaking and niki caro should be commended for the tremendous film she directed she and countless other created a tremendous interpretation of a beloved disney classic yes it may not have the songs or humor from the animated film but that does not impede or hinder the plot or character development in fact by simply incorporating a few musical cues and lines of dialogue from the animated film the filmmakers were able to take what was already established from the previous film and build a fantastic movie on top of it
Sep 5 2020,positive,i think the movie was pretty awesome
Sep 5 2020,positive,i love the film its a different take from the original but still have the essence of the original  and all of the changes contributes to the story and it all make sense and of course it respects the culture which is beautiful
Sep 5 2020,negative,disney  needs to know they are making live action movies for the 39 year olds that grew up with the originals  changing every scene is pointless just make a new movie
Sep 5 2020,positive,mulan is really great her action scene is so handsome
Sep 5 2020,positive,i throughly enjoyed the movie for what it is i understand that most people see this as a live adaptation of the 1998 film however this movie is not just that the movie pays tribute to many aspects of the original film but also adds a more historical compared to the animated film and a modern retelling of the fa mulan legend but it is also a disney movie which includes mystical aspects but not too outrageous where there are talking animals this film really highlights the themes of a person finding their identity and being true to themselves even if theyre viewed as different in their society i could go on about the different aspects of the film and argue them but as an audience member you cant deny that the scenery and cinematography was enjoyable and beautiful to look at a good
Sep 5 2020,negative,this movie has nothing to do with the real mulan movie  and the actors do not look like the characters from mulan
Sep 5 2020,negative,what a boring movie
Sep 5 2020,negative,as a fan of the original i did not like this version mushu is gone the music is gone and the villain in this movie is a massive letdown i recommend the original
Sep 5 2020,negative,not worth the money or two hours of your time took mushu out but add a magical witch as a bad guy no songs no emotion  no substance no heart no real characters bad editing no great wall one good fight scene much chi tho stick with the original animation if you think im biased go ahead and watch and then realize im right
Sep 5 2020,positive,visually stunning but the special effects department must have taken a day off the special effects were not bad but they were choppy and lacked realism the movie itself well if you saw the original you have seen this one but the story is a bit more woke but not over the top it was not very violent considering the context at least my girls were ok with it age 7  10 i personally did not like the crouching tiger hidden dragon feel but the movie is worth watching
Sep 5 2020,positive,story is not very clear i think the 1998 version is better than this core chinese value is not really presented mulan join the army for her father not that she is strong the movie is kind of slow at the beginning as well over all not a really good princess movie to watch
Sep 5 2020,positive,im happy that disney decided to make this live action movie with this particular cast but i still wish they kept all the songs and more of the humor and character development from their 1998 animated movie what they lost in heart they gained in spectacle though i just missed some of the magic of the original animated version they really should have kept it a musical
Sep 5 2020,positive,im a huge mulan fan so i was nervous but kept an open mind disney did not disappoint it was the perfect adaptation of a classic the live action added to her character depth and overall strength etc its inspiring and beautiful cinematically and still keeps the beloved moments and meaning of the original alive go watch it
Sep 5 2020,positive,this is a beautiful movie this is not an american movie but a chinese movie so enjoy it as such
Sep 5 2020,positive,wow i really loved this film so powerful and absolutely one of the best disney remakes so far sooo good and luckily i watched it in the theater as they are open now in qatar
Sep 5 2020,negative,if someone told me that this is an adaptation of another company i would believe it  but this is a disney movie and unfortunately i didnt feel the disney magic of that animated masterpiece there was not even a shadow of what it was  and you also have to pay 30 dollars
Sep 5 2020,negative,unfortunately the soul of what made the original mulan special was completely missed over in this adaptation the characters feel distant moments of heightened emotion were not dramatized the only thing to carry me through to the end was nostalgia the only explanation must be laziness on the part of the director and producers
Sep 5 2020,positive,i have been waiting for the movie for a long time so i read many reviews before i watch it personally i was so surprised that the reviews are polarized and now after watched it i feel myself do not have a definite appraisal of it the movie is not flawless you can feel it disney stove to balance the movie to fit both kids and adults and as a adult the plot is not fluent enough and sometimes clumsy to me but it also has virtues i am so pleased with the background music and those beautiful scenes     i saw many reviews with one or two stars complaining about no dragon and cricket in the movie i have to say sth about this 2020 mulan is retelling of the mulan story not a cosplay of the 1998 animation  i would recommend everyone watch the movie with an open mind that would give you better experience    4 stars comes from the pros and cons mentioned above and my personal love for the casting 
Sep 5 2020,positive,the movie was really good and the actors did a good job
Sep 5 2020,positive,mulan pros  beautiful cinematography gorgeous images    mulan cons  pacing is terrible editing is a joke lack of character development random and unexplained character motives ridiculous amount of cuts in action sequencesfeels like the longest single shot in this move is 10 seconds at mostits maddening its not only the action scenes that are cut to an absurd degree    why hire amazing martial artists if youre going to handicap their ability to deliver amazing uncut action sequenceslike wtf are you doing
Sep 5 2020,positive,the best disney princess movie ever
Sep 5 2020,positive,i really like chinese martial arts too much especially when such a beautiful heroine knows martial arts so well
Sep 5 2020,positive,as an animation powder i have to say that i am very satisfied with this adaptation especially the choice of actors
Sep 5 2020,negative,the movie took itself too seriously and didnt feel like i was watching mulan more like crouching tiger hidden dragon 
Sep 5 2020,positive,mulan mulan a great story the fighting scene is wonderful
Sep 5 2020,positive,by far disneys best live action remake and its exactly because of the reasons some hate it it does such an amazing job of paying homage to the animated movie without being a sceneforscene reenactment i may be wrong but it also seems to pay homage to the oldie chinese films with the action scenes too i love it
Sep 5 2020,negative,definitely not worth the 30 disney is charging for the premier access wouldnt be worth the time if it was free they took a classic and ruined it 
Sep 5 2020,positive,yet here i stand proof that there is a place for people like usi cried
Sep 5 2020,negative,practically zero dialogue which wouldnt have been a deal breaker but there was no character build the movie relied solely on the legacy the last film built this film had so much potential to be amazing but it was unfortunately ruined by weird cgi poor storytelling zero character development and it was just a mess the original version had so much more to it it had wit and humor and love and compassion and honesty this felt like a very subdued and confusing version of crouching tiger hidden dragon it felt like this movie was one note for the entire duration not a fan which sucks because i was so looking forward to it not worth the extra fee we spent to stream it
Sep 5 2020,positive,its entertaining intense and powerful even without containing some of the the best characters and songs one of the best live action disney remakes so far
Sep 5 2020,negative,b class movie  effects were bad  too cheesy  poor script and direction
Sep 5 2020,positive,the plot of the film is fascinating and wonderful the protagonists play is very good
Sep 5 2020,negative,i cant believe i paid 30 to watch this movie it was not good in fact i found it to be terrible i felt like i was in a mystery science theatre episode sans the comedic relief it had no tempo the acting was awful and he dialogue was cheesy and the characters were one dimensional ill give it one star instead of a 12 star because the visual effects were well produced
Sep 5 2020,positive,very good movies are worth watching
Sep 5 2020,positive,best disney movie i seen so far love it  must see it
Sep 5 2020,positive,i love the animated milan so i had very high expectations for the live action movie and this movie did not disappoint 
Sep 5 2020,negative,what did i just watch 30 bucks to watch something that had almost no depth and less then 400 words of dialog feels like this movie had lots of potential with such a great previous score and comedic timing but its wasted on poor execution 
Sep 5 2020,negative,every thing you loved from the the cartoon was not there replace with just bad crop disney
Sep 5 2020,negative,a failure morally and practically in every way imaginable great unintentional comedy though
Sep 5 2020,positive,the best movie disney has done
Sep 5 2020,positive,disney did such a better job with this life action remake than any of the other remakes they have done recently i am really pleased with it 
Sep 5 2020,positive,as an asian i am very excited to see such a movie released globally

Sep 5 2020,positive,i know my place this movie is so wonderful
Sep 5 2020,negative,trite poor character development compared to the animated film and white washed interpretation of asian culture
Sep 5 2020,positive,the person who plays mulan is great the song is beautiful and the little actor is so cute
Sep 5 2020,positive,i have never reviewed a movie but felt compelled due to the reviews i read i know nothing of this actress and her political views it has nothing to do with her acting i have seen every single disney movie put out due to the fact that i have 2 daughters 9 and 16 this movie was awesome all of us were mesmerized note the majority of professional reviews were male well guess what mulan was a bad ass the actress did an amazing job as did the rest of the cast it stayed true to the story as far as i know for once a princess movie didnt ever with some man becoming her prize oh no a sword did i loved my daughter seeing that a woman can be a strong and courageous for honor not because they wanted a happily ever after with some prince finally good for you disney
Sep 5 2020,positive,mulan was incredibleniki caros direction is just breathtaking and every scene looks stunning
Sep 5 2020,positive,brilliantly written  i was amazed how they took out all the singing and cartoonish characters but still managed to use the music in the background in a way that would bring the lyrics to my mind and tie in perfectly  i also am astonished in a good way that disney added the positive message about families to the movie i personally  felt disney had been taking the opposite stance in recent years
Sep 5 2020,positive,it is a masterpiece in disneys reallife adaptation
Sep 5 2020,positive,great movie made my 10 year old feel empowered and proud to be female
Sep 5 2020,positive,it is a great disney movie my friends and i like it very much we agree that mulan is the strongest disney princess
Sep 5 2020,positive,i am so touched by the affection of mulan and her family it reminds me of my parents and i hope i can be their pride too liu is so beautiful even without any makeup her role as mulan is very smart and brave i wish there was a second film mulans story doesnt end she deserves to lead more soldiers hopefully the witch will come back and make up for her mistakes and be recognized again mulan is definitely a good movie and should be treated fairly
Sep 5 2020,negative,what started out with such a strong beginning quickly became a disaster when battle scenes emerge women can be warriors and leadersbut only if they have special chi powers otherwise no this is the opposite of a girlpower movie complete with bad kungfu movie vibes and tilting camera angles for every jump  oh and a witch that has no effect on the plot whatsoever overdramatized overmystified under developed sad to see such a strong franchise go to waste 
Sep 5 2020,positive,the film has a magnificent scene and the leading actors acting skills are excellent
Sep 5 2020,positive,as an audiencei was impressed by the actors performanceespecially liu yifei
Sep 5 2020,positive,not as good as aladdin but still one of the better live action remakes missed having the musical numbers in it action scenes were done well and remained true to the original story worth the 30 to watchand rewatch
Sep 5 2020,positive,actions are great in this movie but couple changes made form the animation does not really serve a good purpose for the film still enjoyable
Sep 5 2020,positive,the film is ravishing to look at and boasts a sensuous musical score
Sep 5 2020,positive,my whole family enjoyed the movie this is not a scene for scene remake of the animated movie which makes it better eg lion king and alladin remakes we liked the orchestral versions of the music from the animated movie the character development was good and the cinematography and writing were excellent i recommend this movie
Sep 5 2020,positive,i like this movie so much mulan is so handsome as a warrior i love mulan
Sep 5 2020,negative,garbage disney needs to stop remaking classics in live action save your money and see it for free on disney in the near future
Sep 5 2020,positive,best disney movie ever  great acting script directing and the moral themes plus loyalty to family  we loved it  sure wish the chinese government would rise to these good moral levels  we give this movie a 10 rating
Sep 5 2020,positive,i think mulan is one of the best live action adaptations disney has done to date with a sense of scale stunning landscapes and impressive battles 
Sep 5 2020,negative,such an insult to the original movie and the fans of the movie dishonor on this movie dishonor on its cow
Sep 5 2020,positive,i was completely amazed by the heroine she is so beautiful
Sep 5 2020,positive,great combination of disney and of chinese action movies best remake of disney animated classic movies because it moves beyond the original
Sep 5 2020,positive,by far the best live action disney movie yet
Sep 5 2020,positive,like mulans father i have two daughters and they say they like mulan very much
Sep 5 2020,positive,disney please do a recut of this film i love mulan and i feel this could have been an incredible film if you cut out the awful cgi twisting camera angles the constant use of shallow depth of field and unnecessary slow motion shots you would have a great film there is something to be said about the heavy unnecessary use of cg practical effects would have made a huge difference  example the the cg dehaze avalanche or the fire burnt village its sad that films 15 years ago looked better then films made today due to the lack of practical effects dont use crappy digital zooms to hide poor camera work  also it was very clear what was shot by the second unit and what was shot by the primary unit the first camera unit did a fantastic job of lighting shots  directing the actors also the fact that there isnt an option for mandarin in the audio options is very very disheartening
Sep 5 2020,positive,mulan is so cool she is my ideal candidate
Sep 5 2020,positive,i thought mulan is one of the best live action adaptations disney i genuinely adore mulan
Sep 5 2020,positive,what i didnt expect was that the film was surprisingly wonderful
Sep 5 2020,positive,this movie is so incredible i cant help to cry when i saw mulan hug her father yifei is a talented actress she is mulan 
Sep 5 2020,negative,how do you measure a remake of a timeless classic you cant really hence the 1 star instead of half first where is mooshu that alone is too much for me but ill set that aside the plot is weak and rushed its a remake with all the impactful humorous and important moments removed  and not surgically but with a large clumsily handled blade the fx were underwhelming and the weak movie drive couldnt make up for it i think this actually undercut the strong woman message i think the most disappointed part of it all was the terrible character development let me be more specific there was none by the end of the movie you dont know anyones name you have no idea who she befriends or why they support her for such an important turning point you think they would have developed this more they added another unnecessary female villain that just complicates the plot with witchcraft and magic this brings me to my last point mulan  the previous form  was amazing because she served as a woman for duty and honor as just that a woman in this rendition they bless her with magical chi that is badly explained and essentially turns her into a plot armor ladened version of wonder woman i wont spend anymore time on this disappointment but i will say that this 3rd rate movie was allowed to hide behind the great title of mulan purely for profits sake sad onto the mandalorian hopefully they wont mess that up as bad as this
Sep 5 2020,negative,the most anticipated but worse disney remake so disappointing
Sep 5 2020,negative,pretty but boring i would say disappointing but ive come to expect this kind of thing from disney dont watch this if you love the animated movie from the 90s devoid of everything that made it a great story
Sep 5 2020,negative,maybe its because i kept comparing it to the original but i was so bored how is it the animated movie was longer but somehow this one felt like it took forever the villains were shallow and the witchs switch to good made no sense
Sep 5 2020,positive,i love nikis whale rider and her mulan is also wonderful
Sep 5 2020,negative,just a bad movie in general bad acting mediocre action scenes that makes power rangers look like pi man the music was meh and the plotholes were continuos i was lost in the movie more than i can remember just dont waste your money
Sep 5 2020,negative,it was choppy long and drawn out the movie did some things that just left me scratching my head for every one cool shot they would do three stupid editing mistakes also for 30 on top of what we already pay is a joke not worth the time or the money
Sep 5 2020,negative,an absolute travesty so many wasted opportunities the whole film focuses on the magic of chi an element they completely fail to elaborate on and just expect you to understand its so rushed the pacing is poor character development is non existent would not recommended
Sep 5 2020,positive,the story was fine different enough from the original to make it standalone however it felt short like it didnt feel as epic as it deserves to be everything sort of happened and was resolved quickly  we needed more time for the weight and importance of things to sink and be felt the climax was extremely anticlimactic but the performances in the film overall were pretty good   jet li was wasted donnie yen barely fought   tonally especially at the beginning it felt off like it was a little too cartoonygoofy which made it clash with the more grandiose tone it was going for later main villain was forgettable but gong li turned in a nice performance and character arc surprisingly i wish the action scenes had been choreographed and filmed better   its epic enough for the kids and i know that it was mainly made for them but as a pg13 film with martial arts and a kickass female protagonist it was a missed opportunity to really make it stand out and have even adults enjoy it further it was just too corporate disneyfied
Sep 5 2020,negative,this did not feel like a disney movie at all and that is a bad thing the cgi looked incomplete the pacing was totally off the acting subpar overall this is a lousy product that appeared unfinished the original was lightyears better the lack of music was something i also knew going in but the movie did suffer additionally beyond that
Sep 5 2020,positive,i love martial arts action movies give me a lot of visual enjoyment
Sep 5 2020,negative,the visual marvels could not make up for the poor storytelling and character building unlike the original animated film this remake falls remarkably short of building a connection with the audience
Sep 5 2020,positive,this film is wonderful liu yifei is a great actress 
Sep 5 2020,positive,both the chi and the rise of a female in ancient china are significant   the filming is superb
Sep 5 2020,negative,not to come off too harshly but it feels like someone surgically removed all the joy and energy out of the original and this was the result  oh and she is kind of jedi now
Sep 5 2020,positive,my own favorite shot is when mulan walks toward the camera from out of a whiteout of snow revealed for the first time as a woman and for the first time in her full power it might be the single best moment of the film 
Sep 5 2020,positive,mulan in animation has always been my childhood idol now mulan in live action movie has become my new idol
Sep 5 2020,negative,this movie was a samurai film in mulan clothing utter disappointment none of the charm and humor or plot coherence that made the original movie a triumph plus a weirdly homoerotic subplot with a witch wouldnt have been so bad if they had followed through with it since that at least wouldve been a twist that mattered instead of the rest of the useless mangling
Sep 5 2020,negative,the bad reviews are more entertaining and accurate than the movie itself nothing in this movie made sense and they dangled the fact that it was different from the animation film with no music but then would play the instrumental of the songs in the background very disappointed in this production even if it were the first version ive ever seen it had a weak plot no character dimension and honestly just a weak performance all around
Sep 5 2020,positive,i wanted so badly to like this but disney stripped out all the best lines music and characters all they left was the emperors silly hat    it was a movie but there was no magic
Sep 5 2020,negative,all this wire fu makes me miss the old bruce lee and jackie chan movies
Sep 5 2020,negative,save your money  it is not a good movie  the lines are terrible
Sep 5 2020,positive,after watching the movie i cant calm down mulan is soooo cool
Sep 5 2020,positive,liu surprised me with her acting ability
Sep 5 2020,negative,the storyline was bland when i think of disney i think of movies that are entertaining with a wide range  this movie was probably the most serious disney movie ive ever seen  characters did not have a wide range as well especially mulan  i mean disney was able to make serious superhero movies to be funny  this was definitely not the case for mulan  the storyline is also completely different from the original cartoon and in fact was a fabrication of director niki caros take  very unfortunate  as an asian american i was honestly looking forward to a better movie than this
Sep 5 2020,positive,visually spectacular mulan is ground breaking in its portrayal of women in animation helped by a instant classic of a soundtrack
Sep 5 2020,positive,grand story i support mulan unconditionally
Sep 5 2020,negative,this movie made my eyes bleed it was so bad
Sep 5 2020,positive,mulan is a wellanimated tale that can still inspire
Sep 5 2020,positive,there are so many surprises in this movie good work
Sep 5 2020,positive,whats terrific about mulan is its reaching for emotions that other movies run from family love and duty personal honor and group commitment obedience and ingenuity 
Sep 5 2020,positive,my whole family loves mulan so much and my daughter is going to make yifei her idol
Sep 5 2020,positive,overall this is a lovely film ranking with the best of disneys animated features while taking on rather serious issues of war honor gender roles and family pride
Sep 5 2020,negative,tldr save yourself 30 do not buy    costumes are nice but within the first 5 minutes of this movie you know itll be bad it reminds me of old time kingfu movies people kicking arrows straight into others using curtains as extensions of their arms running on walls etc its so hilariously bad and the cgi makes you stop to question if this even takes place on earth with physics and the acting is even worse they are either over acting or under acting always the only good acting came from the gang po yao cricket etc but they only showed up to be comic relief in between the cringe action scenes    the animated movie made sure to highlight that mulan was able to get through training and the fighting by being clever and using her wits this movie just gives her chi which makes her extra strong and able to have years of fighting knowledge this horribly detracts from her turning her disadvantages into advantages and in my opinion detracts from one of the major arcs    all in all it felt like it was written by those who wrote the last airbender movie they decided to level the playing field instead of making the protagonists out think their opponents
Sep 5 2020,positive,mulan is definitely worth watching
Sep 5 2020,positive,i loved it so much and highly recommend i dont remember the original so im not sure what i missed but overall this movie was worth the price to watch it im sooooo in love with the witch even though i shouldnt be
Sep 5 2020,negative,watching this movie and all i can think is someone saw kung pow enter the fist from years ago and said yeah lets remake mulan in that image its so bad maybe would be better if in chinese and subtitles but damn the verbiage is so broken like they wrote the script in chinese and then used google translate for the english version
Sep 5 2020,positive,believe me watching mulan is an absolute pleasure
Sep 5 2020,positive,this movie was totally worth the money and it was fantastic 
Sep 5 2020,positive,its a wonderful movie i cant wait to see children worshiping mulan as a hero
Sep 5 2020,positive,this film had a lot to live up to and i believe it delivered 100
Sep 5 2020,positive,yifei liu performed a very successful mulanshe is very good at playing
Sep 5 2020,negative,very soullesslifeless movie the cast interaction with each other had very little chemistry the original disney 2d mulan was superior in every way in their attempt to make the film more realistic they ended up making it boring cliche and took away characteristics that made disney mulan so special not worth the 30 at all
Sep 5 2020,positive,strong portrayal of the female character from many sides great acting and visuals wish it were longer love it overall will watch again and again
Sep 5 2020,positive,people be crazy i think it was a great movie hands off the best disney remake
Sep 5 2020,positive,i am a big fan of gong li this time she feels a bit like cp with mulan
Sep 5 2020,negative,omg how can you butcher movie this bad i loved the original mulan but this mulan is total garbage soulless garbage its like the sucked the soul of mulan and mixed it up with some bad cg and then presented it as a movie and where is mushu whos dumb idea was it to remove mushu can you picture a shrek movie without donkey thats what this is  oh and the main actress was pretty lame also not sure what but feels disconnected with the audience like watching a robot not convincing  cant believe i paid money for this
Sep 5 2020,positive,its a excellent film which is well worth watching
Sep 5 2020,neutral,not a shot for shot remake which i appreciate but still feels a little stiff in its execution
Sep 5 2020,negative,honestly the plot just wasnt there key components of what made the mulan cartoon great are just absent at no point am i given a reason to actually care or understand the struggles mulan is going through
Sep 5 2020,negative,totally overpriced  mulan becomes a football player who kicks all kinds of weapon  my son fell asleep in the midway  anime is much better than this one
Sep 5 2020,positive,timely instant classic epic dramatic adventure story with a super charged and gifted heroine that will undoubtedly inspire young women and those slighted to rise to greater heights and push through their fears
Sep 5 2020,positive,more violent than the original not for little kids 
Sep 5 2020,negative,this movie is awful in every conceivable fashion an absolute trash heap of film making terrible dialogue terrible acting horrible pacing unmemorable and sad never watch this film
Sep 5 2020,positive,its a excellent film which is well worth watching
Sep 5 2020,positive,this movie make me cryi love hua mulan
Sep 5 2020,positive,the messages are there it is even kind of subversive for the chinese audience because it elevates being true to self and non conformity with expected social behaviour  having said that the actingpacing just feels a little wooden and the sanitized violence really hurts the movie this is pg13 all the way through i dont know why but it feels terribly average and i cant put my finger on it
Sep 5 2020,positive,as good as the original or maybe even better
Sep 5 2020,positive,this movie photography is really beautiful mulan is really handsome
Sep 5 2020,negative,i guess its the best of the liveaction disney remakes yeah i know thats not saying much my favorite part of the movie was that i finally got to see a film in cinema during the pandemic do yourself a favor and dont bother dumping thirty bucks on this yawner
Sep 5 2020,positive,i love mulan so much
Sep 5 2020,positive,omg such a masterpiece absolutely stunning
Sep 5 2020,positive,i have fallen in love with liu yifei completely
Sep 5 2020,negative,just downright awful the acting cinematography direction and action choreography are all b movie quality its honestly such a bastardization of the story and falls flat at every moment meant to be impactful it comes across as so corny 
Sep 5 2020,negative,if you want to relive your disappoint of avatar the last airbender but cant erase your mind then youre in luck just watch this movie its equally as disappointing
Sep 5 2020,negative,pros feminist good lesson of values and beautiful images  cons leaves you wishing to sing the songs there is none and feeling the magic of the ancestors mushu is a kite that just flies around her through all the movie barely no major special effects and the ones left seem super cheap photoshop     there is no disney magic in this movie they really tried to play it save i recommend to watch the original or an asian drama you will invest your time so much better     mulan almost poses like obi wan 
Sep 5 2020,positive,it was amazing  they put more emphasis on mulan herself and the change she was going through  they stayed true to the essence of the original movie and the staples of the culture it wasnt a let down
Sep 5 2020,positive,i was great i honestly dont know what the bad reviews were about were they expecting a cartoon dragon to pop out i feel like whoever wrote those reviews had their own agenda liu yifei was absolute perfection no one else on the planet could have played mulan she captured all the nuances of mulan perfectly vulnerable strong graceful fierce i could have just watched her on a blank screen the whole time it was beautifully shot the scenes were rich and gorgeous i honestly like the relationship in this movie than the cartoon he is supportive and her perfect match you can better see the development of their friendship and relationship there were a few weaknesses that brought it down from 5 stars 1 authentically chinese i think a chinese director would have been better it felt like it kept switching from americanized to chinese like some actors having chinese accents and other sounding super american just threw you the child mulan especially just seemed off 2 cgi real fighting was awesome all cgi fighting was the opposite it looked so fake and didnt seem necessary like child mulans flips off the roof the weird fake bunnies running just weird 3 magic i wish they made the female villain just a warrior instead of a witch all the magic just didnt seem to fit in this world and pulled you out of the story 4 the dad voiceover voiceovers are just a pet peeve of mine if you need one to tell the audience whats happening then you are no doing your job so annoying overall an awesome movie i am glad i bought it and will definitely be watching it again and again 
Sep 5 2020,positive,just watched on disney 53 positive audience ratings is a joke its very enjoyable
Sep 5 2020,positive,its super awesome and a must watch its not like the 98 movie its similar to modern chinese cinema i think its very good
Sep 5 2020,positive,thought this was a great story the message and themes of family honor courage standing for what you believe in is what we need right now 
Sep 5 2020,positive,mulan is really cool i like that phoenix very much
Sep 5 2020,positive,i really like the woman who plays mulan
Sep 5 2020,negative,it had no humor the rating of the movie prevented any blood during battles with the exception of the few drops from the witch the entire movie was void of emotion very disappointed in disney low budget effects bland boring
Sep 5 2020,positive,i love the movie it was great story without the silly singing and the goofy character that the cartoon had
Sep 5 2020,positive,watching it brought me to tears multiple times and i couldnt help but feel the deep respect that was given to honoring many facets of china this is by far the best live action adaption that has been done so far by disney
Sep 5 2020,positive,its an amazing movie
Sep 5 2020,positive,the songs were missing besides that the film lost the essence of comedy
Sep 5 2020,positive,i thought it was pretty amazing as far as reinterpretation goes i was a little upset and there was no mushu but all in all i was one over by mulan in general
Sep 5 2020,positive,what a beautiful movie this is enjoyed every minute of this wonderful film unlike the animated version this movie does a phenomenal job of telling the legend of mulan to an adult audience while illustrating and highlighting the depth of chinese culture and virtues
Sep 5 2020,positive,everything looks so perfect
Sep 5 2020,negative,this is not a disney movie at all even without mushu and other characters they could have adapted to a better version hate it
Sep 5 2020,positive,disney did such a better job with this life action remake than any of the other remakes they have done recently 
Sep 5 2020,negative,not worth the 30 i cant get back also way too serious  how can they afford to build a small village but cant give me a darn animated cricket
Sep 5 2020,negative,terrible in every way had little to no connection with the original the story line was beyond weak with many plot and scene holes
Sep 5 2020,positive, it had enough of the quotes and characters from the original animated film to feel fun and nostalgic while still being a cool new take
Sep 5 2020,positive,i believe that very poor reviews are not based on the cinematic experience or the storytelling of this major tale but on factors unrelated to the content at all it was historically told with new mystical elements a nice ode to the animation as well as the epic poem of the woman warrior it was colorful passionate and just like the four virtues disney did well but the true kudos goes to the cast where you see their strength and passion and months of hard work
Sep 5 2020,positive,the grand spectacle and fantastic stunts are definitely worth watching it again
Sep 5 2020,negative,it is laughably bad i cant believe the critics not mentioning the horrible graphics voice overs the story just all over the place 
Sep 5 2020,positive,cinematography breathtaking fighting scenes well choreographed overall it felt balanced between aspects that stayed true to the original on the one hand and new plot new characters and new overall aesthetic on the other disney remakes tend to stick too closely to the original and not for the better this remake successfully stands out
Sep 5 2020,positive,i am very impressed great message for the young girls out there 
Sep 5 2020,positive,the visuals are amazing
Sep 5 2020,negative,i was very disappointed the characters lacked emotional depth the action scenes were typical over the top dramatic kung fu style and they added in a witch to the story for some reason  why they insisted on adding in the witch i have no idea it made it cringy and weird i think one reason it just felt so disconnected was that the plot itself was hurried and choppy i would maybe watch it again but is not on par with the other disney movies these action movies are all lacking that special connection the audience should have with the on screen characters     there is no singing fyi which is fine but in case anyone was wondering and there was no comedic relief at all any attempt at humor was dry
Sep 5 2020,positive,100 worth watchingloved iti highly recommend it to everyone
Sep 5 2020,negative,if disney was going to translate almost every other princess animated movie frame for frame then why cant we have that for mulan this was made enjoyable only through group chats and commentaries    oh and our new ship mulan and xian lang forever
Sep 5 2020,positive,she is my princessi love mulani love her brave
Sep 5 2020,positive,amazing visuals and great storyline
Sep 5 2020,positive,the heroine has infinite charm and i think the villain is pitiful
Sep 5 2020,positive,a great cinematic adventure   my family and i enjoyed it
Sep 5 2020,negative,bad movie nothing like the original
Sep 5 2020,positive,its definitely a very successful disney remake the actress is so gorgeous riding the horse while waving the loyal brave true sword long curly luscious black hair exploding from the helmet tremendous and heartwarming
Sep 5 2020,positive,mulan is so cooli love her so much
Sep 5 2020,positive,every scene was stunningthe best disney live action movie
Sep 5 2020,positive,the plot of the film is fascinating and wonderful the protagonists play is very good
Sep 5 2020,positive,it is different enough from the original to stand on its own but similar enough fans of the animated version will be pleased large action sequences and heart felt story
Sep 5 2020,negative,its boring just boring the original 2d is way better
Sep 5 2020,positive,i love this the best disney ever it might be a little different from the original but i still love it it has its own style i hope it will have part two will wait for you mulan 2
Sep 5 2020,positive,it was awesomemy whole family loves it
Sep 5 2020,neutral,disney terrible choice to leave out one of the past part about the animated film the songs  actors were superb but the director or producer allowed this to turn into a b martial art movie  you left mushu out but put a silly phoenix in mushus place which added little to the plot  movie was lacking in humor and in romance  the way the certain characters were killed off was terrible  the plot twist was terrible and abrupt and not believable even for a disney movie  i think they need a remake of the remake  this does not do justice to the first animated film  
Sep 5 2020,negative,bad effects horrible fight scenes boring and long lame characters with a pathetic final fight and if i go into details about character development the thing is so lame that i would have an aneurysm or something and who the hell is going crazy about that stupid phoenix the credits time are longer than the screen time of that stupid bird
Sep 5 2020,positive,although it was different from the original classic mulan gives us a new look on the great story while still keeping the core of the first its entertaining intense and powerful even without containing some of the the best characters and songs
Sep 5 2020,negative,man alive that was dull dull dull even my children couldnt stand it they got bored and went and played   id avoid it
Sep 5 2020,positive,the reimagination of the classic and legendary story mulan is so so so powerful with its spectacular cinematography and costumes and actions that it even outshines the original animated version in some levels yes there are no songs and mushu yes theres not as much humor and yes theres less originality but it definitely takes the onceedged asian representation in hollywood to the next level its so different from the movies that youll usually see in the us in a good way what a relief from the covid
Sep 5 2020,positive,amazing cinematography i missed the musical style like the animated definite differences but i loved the power of mulan and focus on chi as a force beautiful combat scenes and i liked that they kept the avalanche scene though i actually liked the animated avalanche better for the disney fan youll love it
Sep 5 2020,positive,ive just finished watching it its not disappointing its sooooo excellent
Sep 5 2020,positive,very good movies are worth watching
Sep 5 2020,positive,the committed belief that liu yifei invests into mulan gives weight to honesty as a core theme of the film right alongside equality and empowerment
Sep 5 2020,positive,stay up until 3 am to see mulan it is so wonderful did not let me down
Sep 5 2020,positive,disney brings honor to all of us mulan is everything i expected and more it is undoubtedly the most courageous liveaction but it still maintains the essence of animation and enhances the original material 
Sep 5 2020,positive,mulan is incredible the best disney princess movie ive ever seen
Sep 5 2020,positive,i like this moviei think it is the best one in the live princess movies
Sep 5 2020,positive,i dont understand why some people rate one star this movie is really excellent and worth watching
Sep 5 2020,positive,the movie is a masterpiece mulan is definitely one of disneys best live action movies
Sep 5 2020,positive,a great story independent of the animated classic this film stands on its own and is a modern classic
Sep 5 2020,negative,the script is beyond horrendous all conflict characters and actions feel extremely manufactured nothing feels natural at all     the dialog and characters are by far the worst part of this movie completely irredeemable 010
Sep 5 2020,positive,mulan is so cool and beautifulyifei definitely amazed me i have fallen in love with her
Sep 5 2020,positive,i wasnt sure what to expect with bad audience reviews  but it was excellent  my two early teen daughters loved it and there was enough for my wife and i to really enjoy it too     the movie is beautifully stunning and had a good story  its not a remake and stands perfectly on its own
Sep 5 2020,positive,worth it loved the update and the new villain
Sep 5 2020,positive,good action and take on the movie editing could have been better but overall entertaining
Sep 5 2020,positive,love it cinematography was great love the allasian cast
Sep 5 2020,negative,terrible movie plot did not flow unneeded cgi used fight scenes were inconsistent ruined a great childhood movie name
Sep 5 2020,positive,such a beautiful film i dont want to spoil it but definitely give it a watch
Sep 5 2020,negative,i watched the full movie tonight and was not impressed if you are expecting disney mulan you will be sorely disappointed  there isnt any music and its too violent for children  my eight year old granddaughter only got about 14 way through it before she decided that she didnt like it and didnt want to watch it  too slow and too much fighting for her  i wouldnt recommend this movie for children at all
Sep 5 2020,negative,mulan cant seen to decide whether its a new thing or a live action remake of the animated feature it would have been better without trying to tug on our nostalgia strings and just be its own thing
Sep 5 2020,positive,if you go in expecting the original you will be disappointed but if youre open to a new  fresh retelling of the chinese legend then youre in for a treat you can see the directors love for manga in this movie
Sep 5 2020,neutral,terrible screenplay dull characters everything great from first movie thrown out the window
Sep 5 2020,negative,beautiful visuals but the story lacked personality and character development none of the characters were very likable or entertaining like the original script was lacking zero personality and no songs
Sep 5 2020,negative,good for ruining your childhood or exposing you to an all new garbage movie the effects are average for an early 2000s movie not nearly living up to what they should be at this age
Sep 5 2020,positive,this movie was incredible they turned a childs movie based on a legend into a legendary movie congrats disney on finally getting one of these live action adaptations perfect
Sep 5 2020,positive,so good all the drama aside this movie was an amazing shows a lot about chinese culture and traditions watched it twice already
Sep 5 2020,positive,i love the style the action the performance i was completely won over
Sep 5 2020,negative,this remake is a hot mess and utter crap
Sep 5 2020,negative,way too predictable and short no character development for supporting characters it just seemed rushed
Sep 5 2020,positive,what it does well is expand on the story so its not simply a retread unfortunately without the musical and comedic elements of the original it feels flat and the dialogue is cheesy the pacing like aladdin before it is all over the place if it had tried to just be its own film without paying homage to the original it would probably be a better film 
Sep 5 2020,positive,picturesque and well produced hits each of the marks still rooting for mulan throughout introduction of the witch character is a bit weird but occasionally works not a musical not a comedy no mushu
Sep 5 2020,negative,i dont understand why niki caro directed this and no one stopped her  they shouldnt have even called this movie mulan  loosely follows the original and did not even include any of the classic songs so disappointed even aladdin follow the original script more closely 
Sep 5 2020,negative,she was expressionless the different camera angles were pointless  hard for me to keep up with the fighting and gave me a headache my favorite movie and live action had potential but i think missed the mark she had a huge decision to make to step in for her father and in the movie she changes her clothes into her fathers armor in the next scene it was hard for me to connect with the character and i kinda felt alienated
Sep 5 2020,positive,this was a wonderful take on mulan  a power female lead finding her own path i loved and so did my daughters  i think has same level of violence as star wars for those wondering about the pg13 rating
Sep 5 2020,positive,it was a nice moment with the family gorgeous visuals i cant wait to see it in wcg hdr 4k atmos
Sep 5 2020,positive,anyone who shits on this movie has no idea what theyre talking about no its not the original its a more evolved retelling of a legend the colors the settings the themes made this a beautiful film and a fun time its not boring its awesome
Sep 5 2020,positive,mulan is a wonderful symphony ive had a lot of emotions while watching mulans journey i will definitely watch it again many times in my spare time    the visual part of the movie is very impressive liu yifeis performance is excellent although the plot has many changes but i do not mind that a fresh and exciting experience compared to the animated version    the combination of mulan and a witch surprised me mulan dares to pursue what a witch though very powerful would not dare do the witch finds herself in mulan and that is my favorite detail    covid changed the habit of watching movies in my country experience cinema in a crowded place is really dangerous so staying at home with her family and watching mulan is a great choice
Sep 5 2020,positive,letter grade award b not perfect yet beautiful heartsoul and visually
Sep 5 2020,negative,another bad disney live action remake in fact its one of their worst
Sep 5 2020,neutral,no singing the movie is very different from the original
Sep 5 2020,positive,great moivetotally recommend to watch
Sep 5 2020,negative,its just bad mulan the character was casted perfectly but everyone else was not the phoenix looked more like a following kite than a guardian
Sep 5 2020,negative,lol 2 stars because 200 million was enough to make it visually appealing but thats about it like so many other movies messaging is of utmost importance at the expense of all else unless you have nothing else to do and are watching it for free skip this one especially if you were hoping that it bore some sort of resemblance to the animated version its like the animated version in that her name is mulan thats where the similarities end
Sep 5 2020,positive,i recently rewatch the animated film which i have loved since its release and asked myself why did i love the original so much  now having just watched mulan 2020 i think disney did better than expected this is a different movie but same story line as the original new characters added and some removed it is beautifully filmed and the score harkens back to the songs i missed for the original version  i felt the liveaction version suffered a bit by how rapidly the story moves  i guess is just takes more film time to tell the same story in liveaction than it does in animation  allinall i am very pleased with this film its new its different yet still moving and empowering  worth the bucks in my book
Sep 5 2020,negative,how do you ruin mulan if you had the blue print
Sep 5 2020,negative,100 not worth the 30  the movie should have been a lot longer than what it was it seemed quick and lacked character building very watered down could have been a great movie
Sep 5 2020,negative,it was so awful i actually made a rt account to warn others the cinematography is gorgeous but thats about it dialogues are terrible and lack emotional connection
Sep 5 2020,positive,the plot of the film is fascinating and wonderful the protagonists play is very good
Sep 5 2020,positive,flawless  impeccable directing phenomenal performances and a script that does the true legend of mulan justice  1010 best movie ive seen in a long time
Sep 5 2020,positive,i enjoyed it and its made amazingly
Sep 5 2020,negative,this movie falls soooo short of the original cartoon versioneven in its own story terrible
Sep 5 2020,positive,i loved this live action version of mulan i was not at all bothered by not having mushu or the songs the film works very well without them  the action scenes are spectacular really incredible my favorite character for sure is xianniang she is spectacular and liu yifei does very well in the role of mulan best live action for me
Sep 5 2020,negative,bad very bad dont watch it
Sep 5 2020,positive,liuyifei is a good actressshe is mulan
Sep 5 2020,positive,this movie was one of the best movies ive ever seen it kept the same morals and lessons from the original but perfected them and made them stronger it has less comedy and romance to the point where it looks and feels like a different movie giving mulan a more serious vibe but i think that was one of the things that made it more effective and moving i was enraptured the whole time 1010 recommend
Sep 5 2020,negative,no character development cgi is bad no music not loyal to the original and plot rushes and does not build up characters absolutely terrible
Sep 5 2020,positive,it was a nice depiction of the original movie  a wonderful story of honor and being true to yourself  my daughters loved it although they missed cricket but loved the phoenix
Sep 5 2020,negative,im a huge disney fan and i mean huge this movie was not like the cartoon the family name is completely wrong where did the evil witch come from where is the music where is mushu this movie couldve been better
Sep 5 2020,positive,dont expect the cartoon appreciate the story and legend
Sep 5 2020,positive,it was a really great super actionpacked and very entertaining disney liveaction movie remake it had really aweinspiring cinematography really awesome action really cool visual effects really impressive cast really well done costumes really wonderful drama really exciting adventure really excellent humor really fantastic music and a really great story in my opinion its going to be one of my favorite disney liveaction movies ive ever watched in my whole life i highly recommend this movie to disney fans of all ages
Sep 5 2020,negative,the storyline had nothing to do with the original cartoon many elements that were eliminated like mushu awful and unrealistic special effects like if they were made from the lowest budget bollywood movie and a female empowerment narrative that was throw at your face and too forced not inspiring and fluid like in the cartoon    worst 30 dollars ever spent
Sep 5 2020,positive,mulan is a decent enough remake of the amazing original yifei liu was a solid mulan she played her role well the rest of the cast was solid as well the action scenes were well helmed by director niki caro there are plenty of interesting shots that i admired i also liked what they did with the villain however there are some flaws removing the musical numbers made the film feel a tad too serious for its own good the couple of moments of humor felt off putting also some moments just worked better in the original overall i liked this well enough it didnt wow me but its better than the past couple of disney remakes it isnt nearly as close to the quality as the original but its watchable enough 
Sep 5 2020,negative,what a mess loved the original expected to love this and was even prepared for it to be a fresh take but it was just poorly executed really odd stylistic choices mediocre acting with some exceptions and poor directing gorgeous visuals arent enough to make this worth it very disappointed
Sep 5 2020,negative,painful acting lackluster writing poor cinematography and an almost complete lack of music made this movie a painfully droll and charmless experience hands down the worst disney liveaction remake to date and thats saying something
Sep 5 2020,negative,very far from the animated movie this is not mulan movie bad special effectsgood portraits horrible action scenes good history but its not mulan i dont recommend it
Sep 5 2020,neutral,visually stunning but lacked the important moments of emotion that made this movie fall flat her big reveal was lame no one really witnessed her cleverness in saving the army and her no i promise im telling the truth ok well take away your death sentence and instead make you leader of the army since you tell me you are telling the truth without any proof lame
Sep 5 2020,positive,it definitely wasnt the original but i appreciated what they did in their adaptation loved some of the action scenes mulan was fun to watch
Sep 5 2020,neutral,this movie was bad not awful or good the characters werent filled out and the witch had no reason to exist for the plot the first half with the training was amazing but then when mulan carried the buckets to the top and didnt lose breath thats where it started to suck the acting was ok not good but ok i feel like they tried to make this movie exciting with the over the top movement and physically impossible movements but it just felt silly if youre going to make a move more accurate to the real mulan do it dont half ass it and slap in goofy acting and inhuman stunts becauseits for the kids i wouldve given this 3 stars but my dad fell asleep watching it
Sep 5 2020,positive,sooo this movie definitely is not great its also not as bad as these idiots with the one stars the movie definitely leaves things to be desired the director some how made battle scenes boring this movie had a lot of potential but it in no way lived up to it
Sep 5 2020,positive,mulani prefer this version to animation version
Sep 5 2020,negative,a downgrade from the original in every possible way the only positive thing i have to say is that it was generally well shot from a technical level aside from that the characters writing story humor action and score are all vastly superior in the original 1998 animated version probably the worst in the recent trend of remakes of disney animated classics 410
Sep 5 2020,positive,mostly straight forward retelling of the same story  cutting out the goofy dragon cricket familiar synth masterpiece and musical training montage they thematically lean towards a kung fu epic and with the talented cast could have been very close but disney opted to focus into the feminism rather than the cultural distinctiveness and hired a white woman to direct she fails to capture the artistry of kung fu instead falling into cliche cutaways that leaves you dizzy like michael bay an instrumental of reflection from the 1998 soundtrack is utilized repeatedly throughout the film but lacks identity as a theme for anything but overall it still works as a simple family movie a solid meh thats not a complete waste of your time but not worth writing home about either
Sep 5 2020,positive,not one for reviews but this movie was great i have six daughters and the message is empowering and touching its also a beautiful movie with majestic scenes and colors
Sep 5 2020,positive,excellent film with emotion and character development loved the hints of the original sons in the new score will definitely be watching again
Sep 5 2020,positive,the film brought a whole new experiencei will go to the cinema for a second time
Sep 5 2020,positive,amazing movieaction humor special effects great storyline  dont expect the old animated version its better actually im glad it was available for purchase on   disney  since covid has ruined movies in theaters for months
Sep 5 2020,positive,i actually didnt remember the original animated film very well but i enjoyed this one it had some good action scenes was beautifully shot had a good story and the actress was pretty good in the role
Sep 5 2020,positive,after watching the movie i was deeply impressed by liu yifeiher performance was very moving and excellent
Sep 5 2020,positive,incrediblejust so beautiful to watchevery scene was stunningi highlyt recommended to everyone loved it
Sep 5 2020,negative,what a disappointing retelling of the classic tale
Sep 5 2020,positive,worth every penny the storyline i felt held true to my expectations liu delivered and all her hard work i believe paid off i totally enjoyed itthank you to the cast producer and director wow
Sep 5 2020,positive,it is quite different from the animated mulani prefer this version to animation version
Sep 5 2020,positive,it has some visually beautiful scenes but overall the movie dragged a bit  i am disappointed because i was really looking forward to this movie
Sep 5 2020,positive, i cried twice in the cinemai was moved when mulan decided to face her true self 
Sep 5 2020,positive,every actor did a great job
Sep 5 2020,positive,movie was excellent  i was already expecting it to not be like the animated version because this was disneys first live action that was an original story  great action sequences landscapes wide angle scenesthis was made for a movie theater and the big screen  a 65inch flat screen does not do it justice  i hope it is rereleased in the theaters once all this craziness subsides
Sep 5 2020,negative,it was better than the sequel but this isnt as good as the original mostly because no mushu shang is replaced by two different people and the songs are unfortunately only played in the credits
Sep 5 2020,negative,i knew going into this movie that it was going to be different from the animated version personally i didnt really care that they removed mushy and all the singing i get the direction they were trying to go with this film and i applaud them for attempting a different take instead of just remaking the original scene by scene however attempt is the key word here while the battle scenes and general cinematography were beautiful everything else was a miss there was very little character development and honestly the first half of the movie felt just felt rushed as if theyre just trying to get it over with to get to the main battle the actors did the best they could with the poor plot line and awkward dialogs but they couldnt save this movie from fall flat disney movies are typically tear jerkers for me yes im that person thatll cry at pretty much every movie but this one just left me feeling empty and disappointed my favorite part was actually the credit scent with christina aguilera singing loyal brave true now that was epic
Sep 5 2020,negative,purely terrible watch the original complete trash dishonor on your family
Sep 5 2020,positive,it was very good but it wouldve been a lot better if the villain characters were more flushed out along with the relationship between hua mulan and honghui
Sep 5 2020,positive,every actor did a great job
Sep 5 2020,negative,i thought it was alright my kids were not entertained by it whatsoever theyre in junior high  it was missing something not only did mushu didnt appear but it was missing something honestly its a waste of money just wait until december to watch it amazing actors but the storyline wasnt there
Sep 5 2020,negative,cant believe this movie was made by disney seems like it should have been directed and produced by walmart or burger king
Sep 5 2020,positive,my roommate and i stayed up late to see the mulanwhat a wonderful movie it is
Sep 5 2020,negative,a nondescript movie the leading ladys acting is awkward
Sep 5 2020,negative,there was absolutely no character depth you lose the charm and purpose of each character the story became even harder to follow with its gravity defying action moves and its confusing introduction of 2 villains this is not a remake or adaption its a completely new movie not worth 30 to rent one of the worst live action movies ive seen from disney
Sep 5 2020,positive,wonderful movie visually stunning to the max 
Sep 5 2020,positive,my family eat popcorn and watch the movie although it was a pity that we couldnt go to the cinema we are safe at home
Sep 5 2020,negative,wow that was boring
Sep 5 2020,positive,hands down my favorite live action disney animation movie throughout the whole movie you feel the weight mulan is caring on her shoulders her emotional journey trying to fitin in a world where the view towards women is narrow mind it beautifully choreographed and astonishing cinematography is gorgeous also fun and lots of action i love this movie
Sep 5 2020,positive,yifei liu performed a very successful mulanshe is very good at playing
Sep 5 2020,negative,i wouldnt be shocked if youd told me that michael bay directed this 15 sassy dragons which is one more than the film had
Sep 5 2020,positive,we ate popcorn drank soda and watched the mulanits a pleasure isnt itwhats more the film is so wonderful
Sep 5 2020,negative,basically this is disney star wars with mulan as rey chi as the force and set in china  not worth 29 when the animated mulan is still available and more enjoyable
Sep 5 2020,positive,this movie was totally worth the money and it was fantastic everything about it was amazing
Sep 5 2020,negative,i think this the worst recreation possible of mulan the director producers couldve a couple years before the cgi was created to have mushu make an appearance this isnt even mulan at this point hang li the love interest also doesnt make an appearance i mean the songs couldnt even cheer because there werent any the person who made this is a disgrace is the world why would you this is a good idea to make a movie you werent prepared to even make this suck so bad and i was so disappointed to not be able to see one of my favorite princess come to life i mean cmon be honest mushu was the best part of the whole movie and he wasnt even there no songs no general at this point i wouldve just been if they added the song ill make a man out of you they picked the best actress for mulan but didnt even make a role for shang li or mushu cmon they didnt add the stupid cricket and she didnt cut her this overall the worst thing i couldve watched in 2020 i had hope its ruined now
Sep 5 2020,positive,this movie is really wonderfuli decided to give it full marks its my dish
Sep 5 2020,positive,best disney live action
Sep 5 2020,positive,the least i can say its entertaining enough though the scale could be bigger
Sep 5 2020,positive,very different from the cartoon and very good the songs are present in the score if you listen close enough definitely a recommend if nothing else for the visuals acting and action sequences that are beautifully shot
Sep 5 2020,negative,the movie sucked all the soul out of the original liu yifei main actress cannot act the plot has tons of holes and i was bored throughout it pales in comparison to any other disney live actions super disappointed as i was looking forward to asian representation on screen where black panther was a testament to the strength uniqueness and power of black culture this movie made asian culture look backwards simple and like it had nothing to offer which isnt true     gong li was a star as were tzi ma donnie yen and ming nawen brief cameo but biggest problem is the leading actress literally cannot move her face is she hungry tired confused sad i have no idea
Sep 5 2020,positive,i cried at the cinemamulan and her father are so movingi really like that plotit reminds me of my dadi miss him
Sep 5 2020,positive,the screenplay could be better with a longer runtime but it delivers everything the trailers promise with its filmmaking techniques and performances to make it serve as a noble companion piece to the disney version and a spectacular adaption of the source legend plus its much better in mandarin
Sep 5 2020,positive,great movie my favorite princess i think it totally better than animated i really love the ending gorgeous
Sep 5 2020,positive,despite the controversies doubts and comparisons disney reincarnates the liveaction mulan into a spectacular grownup action movie that we tend temporarily forget our memories from the musical and comical animated version leaving us wellfounded message
Sep 5 2020,positive,the movie did a great job in keeping me entertained the traditional chinese culture shines through the story line action visuals and  character development is outstanding unfortunately the remake differs drastically from the original movie remaking a disney classic and taking out the most important parts that made the original movie what it was should be a crime overall this movie is a good time
Sep 5 2020,positive,the witch lady was annoying but still a pretty solid movie all hail the warrior whos brave loyal honest and bear the immense pressure of asian family expectations
Sep 5 2020,positive,the film is magnificent beyond imaginationalthough i had expected that mulan would give me a great surprise
Sep 5 2020,positive,visually stunning and emotional love the nods to the original movie 
Sep 5 2020,positive,i highly recommend this film i loved it great action wonderful score beautiful scenery the cast is wonderful great messages for men and women honestly it is one of the better live actions from disney in my opinion 
Sep 5 2020,positive,loved it love the story of staying true to yourself so needed today 
Sep 5 2020,positive,one of my favorite films this film deserver sso much love
Sep 5 2020,negative,the plot is pure rubbish
Sep 5 2020,positive,disney knows how to create a beautiful movie the visuals were absolutely stunning the cinematography is what made this movie the plot wasnt horrible it just wasnt as exceptional as i had anticipated
Sep 5 2020,neutral,it was very lame and extremely exaggerated i cringed more times that i can count
Sep 5 2020,positive,it was visually pleasing and the action scenes were objectively good however a lot of the story felt glossed over and hollow also although considered a remake only the basic storyline is similar im glad i saw it but wouldnt rush to see it again anytime soon
Sep 5 2020,negative,this was a terrible movie there was no character building nothing close to a good flow and you couldnt even tell that it was connected to the original they should have named it something else and made it into its own thing i know that its not suppose to be like the original movie but it was so far away it was unrecognizable     what a pointless remake movie   embarrassingmoviedisney
Sep 5 2020,positive,this movie is amazing of course it may not be like the animated film but this film is stunning great casting great visual effects and much more i recommend seeing this film
Sep 5 2020,negative,wouldve given it one star but cricket ended up winning my heart
Sep 5 2020,positive,nothing new just good movie and thats all
Sep 5 2020,positive,very different from the cartoon and very good
Sep 5 2020,positive,every actor did a great jobespecially liu yifei shes really goodwhen i saw mulan hugging her father i cried
Sep 5 2020,negative,i just couldnt get into the movie  it should have just stayed as animated movie
Sep 5 2020,positive,wonderful movie  visually stunning to the max   the girl became a soldier the soldier became a leader the leader became a legend
Sep 5 2020,positive,great cast great action and visuals  i love that it is a more mature take on the chinese legend  the lack of mushu is frankly a welcome change  the songs are present in the score if you listen close enough  definitely a recommend if nothing else for the visuals acting and action sequences that are beautifully shot
Sep 5 2020,positive,i like this actor named liu yifei now
Sep 5 2020,negative,okay first off let me say that this is most definitely not worth the 30 dollars on top of the original cost of getting disney plus now thats out of the way where do i begin with this film well lets start with the good i do like the idea of a more grounded version of the story which is why i decided to rent it that being said everything else is a disaster such as matching the orignal animated film beat for beat only worse there is little to no comedic relief without the songs of the scenes that had energy feel lifeless and what characters of the supporting cast are shadows of themselves what happened to the mongols now we have orons why is lei shang two different characters the choreography in the final act is something i wish i could forget along with the bad cgi thats another thing they took out mushu to be more realistic and less offensive but they give us a witch who transforms into a hawk along with a phoenix that just shows up which is it supposed to be this movie was a mess made to appease two audiences but ended up failing on both accounts
Sep 5 2020,positive,a great story independent of the animated classic this film stands on its own and is a modern classic niki caro directs a powerful human story that is engaging and entertaining pay attention to the fact that her focus never moves from mulan mulan is front and center of this movie liu yifei does a masterful portrayal of this historically renown warrior
Sep 5 2020,positive,this is a masterpiece
Sep 5 2020,positive,disney brings honor to all of us  mulan is everything i expected and more  it is undoubtedly the most courageous liveaction but it still maintains the essence of animation and enhances the original material  my expectations were exceeded with dignity  about the lack of mushu or songs  the animation will not cease to exist
Sep 5 2020,negative,absolutely terrible 2020 strikes again and ruined a movie given so much potential
Sep 5 2020,positive,i like this moviei think it is the best one in the live princess moviesliu yifei is lumiousi cant help recommending the film to my friends because it is so good
Sep 5 2020,positive,i am very impressed great message for the young girls out there absolutely thrilled with the way it turned out
Sep 5 2020,positive,amazing visuals and great storyline it had enough of the quotes and characters from the original animated film to feel fun and nostalgic while still being a cool new take
Sep 5 2020,positive,what i saw in the thai cinema is one of my favorite movies
Sep 5 2020,negative,please stop making liveaction recreations of your animated films disney this was atrocious no character development of any kind special effects cannot compare to movies like crouching tiger or hero that were filmed 15 years ago costumes and cinematography tried very hard but too many inconsistencies in fight scenes and plot it felt rushed cobbled together and very much not worth the talent in the film dont waste your 30 on this film it will only encourage them
Sep 5 2020,positive,looks like eddie murphy did sit this one out  mulan 2020  at just under 2 hours the story does take some time to get going but things do pick up at the half way point  the final act flew to a pretty satisfying payoff   the cast did come off as a bit stiff at times but overall decent the actress playing mulan had a kindve stoic emotional maturity the two villains a more energetic  entertaining version of the original bad guy  a witch who presented as a dark mirror of mulan were multi layered in their own ways  more entertaining than the other guy the rest of the cast including characters who nodded to multiple ones from the original films were more human than their animated counterparts but were still fun to watch  the effects were mostly practical with only two birds being obvious cgi the fight scenes were stylized in the same manner as many other chinese fantasy films but it didnt go over the top there were fantastical elements but it was still fairly grounded in reality the visuals were a feast for the eyes it was like seeing classical asian artwork leap off the canvas a real high point  the music was a mix of classical asian melodies  a few choice songs from the original film in instrumental form plus christina aguilera returning for her big number at the end  dang can she still sing it added atmosphere without killing the mood  i never saw crouching tiger hidden dragon but im betting it influenced this film in many decent ways mulan 2020 may be a disney remake but imho its the least unnecessary of them all in that it was almost as entertaining as the original even though it was more of a slow burn 35 outta 5 stars a phoenix might not be as cool as a dragon but it wasnt bad
Sep 5 2020,positive,i like this moviei think it is the best one in the live princess moviesliu yifei is lumiousi cant help recommending the film to my friends because it is so good
Sep 5 2020,positive,the movie is brilliant 
Sep 5 2020,negative,empty and soulless remake
Sep 5 2020,positive,as funny as cartoons familiar music makes people burst into tears
Sep 5 2020,positive,wow this movie is just so good it shows that female lead action movies can really be made well please support this film it deserves i know 2999 is expensive but trust my it is worth every penny 
Sep 5 2020,positive,the heroine has infinite charm and i think the villain is pitiful
Sep 5 2020,positive,the plot of the film is fascinating and wonderful the protagonists play is very good
Sep 5 2020,positive,very good movies are worth watching
Sep 5 2020,positive,although it was different from the original classic mulan gives us a new look on the great story while still keeping the core of the first its entertaining intense and powerful even without containing some of the the best characters and songs score b
Sep 5 2020,positive,i love this movie very much 
Sep 5 2020,positive,disney did such a better job with this life action remake than any of the other remakes they have done recently i am really pleased with it
Sep 5 2020,positive,as an asian i am very excited to see such a movie released globally she has lived up to my expectations
Sep 5 2020,neutral,not epic not bad as far as disney live action goes this one is rather ok
Sep 5 2020,positive,i really enjoyed the movie there were a few scenes i thought could be more tonally fine tuned but really enjoyed the movie overall
Sep 5 2020,positive,best disney live action remake to date the changes made a great story even better in this iteration mulan doesnt have to change herself she just has to be herself some nice easter eggs to look for as well no dishonored cows however
Sep 5 2020,positive,amazing movie good fights scenes and a perfect adaptation to the poem the ballad of mulan liu yifei is the perfect mulan fits so well on the movie nice version
Sep 5 2020,positive,i love this movie very much 
Sep 5 2020,positive,everyone must watch this work in the cinema my girlfriend and i really like it very much
Sep 5 2020,positive,what a beautiful movie this is enjoyed every minute of this wonderful film unlike the animated version this movie does a phenomenal job of telling the legend of mulan to an adult audience while illustrating and highlighting the depth of chinese culture and virtues watching it brought me to tears multiple times and i couldnt help but feel the deep respect that was given to honoring many facets of china this is by far the best live action adaption that has been done so far by disney 
Sep 5 2020,negative,horrible movie destroys the animated mulan
Sep 5 2020,positive,i love the movie it was great story without the silly singing and the goofy character that the cartoon had
Sep 5 2020,positive,it should be the unique charm of a female director she makes a beautiful picture of the heroine
Sep 5 2020,negative,this is so bad we rewatched the original mulan immediately afterward to contrast the type of absurdity this movie displayed do not watch this movie it is boring it is unfaithful it is ridiculous 
Sep 5 2020,positive,stop hating guys it was great visually amazing
Sep 5 2020,positive,i will always be a fan of disney he really knows how to win my favor
Sep 5 2020,positive,i enjoyed it very much well done
Sep 5 2020,negative,i spent 45 just to watch this trash movie so disappointed such a shame
Sep 5 2020,negative,boring with little to no character development
Sep 5 2020,positive,although there is no dragon the beauty of this movie shocked me
Sep 5 2020,negative,if your looking for the great animated movie that you loved as a kid this is not it disney is just rehashing awesome animated movies  that dont translate into good live action movies if you want to see milan just watch the original movie and skip this one
Sep 5 2020,negative,horrible movie its just a realistic version of the original animated movie  do not watch this movie just watch the original movie instead of this garbage
Sep 5 2020,positive,the film critics have a point this is really an epic work
Sep 5 2020,positive,the movie is actually great to watch i knew this wasnt going to live up to the animated movie but if you dont try to compare the two movies you can actually enjoy this movie as well
Sep 5 2020,negative,garbage of all time
Sep 5 2020,positive,by far disneys best live action remake and its exactly because of the reasons some hate it  it does such an amazing job of paying homage to the animated movie without being a sceneforscene reenactment  i may be wrong but it also seems to pay homage to the oldie chinese films with the action scenes too  i love it
Sep 5 2020,negative,the pacing is very slow and the ads made it seem more like an actionfung fu movie but ended up more as a slow developing drama definitely disappointing
Sep 5 2020,positive,a very pleasant viewing experience
Sep 5 2020,negative,the movie is enjoyable enough and takes the animated version into a more mature perspective despite this the movie feels rushed at times characters arent developed enough and their motives for doing what they do or dont  do certain things and why they change isnt  explained feels unjustified and random leaving a confused feeling in the viewer as if the movie has been cut or not finished
Sep 5 2020,positive,something that bothers me on most of the recent audienceyoutubewhathaveyou reviews of this movie and even regarding disneys liveaction adaptations is the inconsistency    theyll bash certain adaptations with reason because they were poorly executed or cashgrabbing takefortake remakes of the original animated movies that pale in comparison to the originals and add nothing to new audiences    but then with mulan while not a perfect movie theyll say it missed key scenes and moments from the original 1998 movie and im not even talking about mushu or the musical numberssongs had they been added to this 2020 liveaction adaptation im 100 sure the movie would have suffered for it especially regarding to the tone and mood it was aiming for  truer to the source more serious and still familyfriendly because this is disney were talking about    i watched it and enjoyed it sure i did miss the disney trademark we all know of characters bursting into song and fun musical numbers  but then again i dont think those would add much to this adaptation if anything musical numbers would break the immersion and yes i understand some new characters were additions that could make the argument for mushu and the songs being included i could have gone without these new characters but them being there didnt exactly take me away from the world the movie presented not as a cgi dragon voiced by an eddie murphy replacement would    and the thing is if you want an actual as truetolife as possible adaptation of the original hua mulan legend look no further than the chinese produced 2009 title mulan rise of a warrior yeah vitas guest stars in it dont ask me why    the point being that the 2009 chinese adaptation of the ballad of mulan poem has no hollywood shine or western lenses in it  it is a far more true adaptation of the source material than disneys 2020 movie  which pulls a lot more from the source now then it did in 1998    but the thing is we see and we know from several press releases and media coverage that disney tried to stay as true as possible to the source of mulans legend while also appealing to the biggest audience any movie studio in the us wants to appeal to  china some key scenes in the 1998 animated movie like the emperor bowing to her at the end of the movie with all of the people present following suit or mulan cutting her hair were things that apparently clashed with chinese culture and values or even the message of the original poem and we know disney  its all about money more than appeasing sensibilities    hua mulan at the end on the original legend only wants to go back home to her family  something this disney adaptation tried to stay true to i think    i also appreciated how 1998s li shang was replaced by chen honghui played by yoson an and the animated movies flirtation between maninapositionofpower and a subordinate was changed to a rivalry between rookies turning to friendship and comradery    i know disneys a multibillion dollar company thats doing all these liveaction adaptations as a way to renew the copyright of the animated movies while grabbing easy money from nostalgic people and the last thing it needs is people defending it    but the movie in my opinion and by itself was enjoyable    were all the right choices made not at all    mulan being a chosen one type of character as opposed to a character pushing through her own limits and becoming stronger  like she did in the animated movie  took away from the empowering message of the original movie    does this movie add anything to the original well it differentiates from it just enough to seem new while also appealing to the nostalgia we had for the animated tale but in the end it ends up not doing much of either and seems a bit bland at times    were any of the writers of chinese background i think this adaptation would have benefited from an actual chinese point of view    jet lis lines were dubbed over
Sep 5 2020,positive,its an amazing story that serve to produce a spectacular movie watching experience for me and my family the movie has sparked a passionate discussion between me and my daughter thank you disney live action team for producing an excellent movie experience
Sep 5 2020,positive,this movie was missing the heart that made the original 1998 version so amazing it did not buildup any of the relationships and it did not know how to create a fluid relation between the different characters   the action scenes were lacking to say the least the action scenes were choppy and rushed   i understand the direction they were trying to take but sometimes these directors are so focused on a message they miss the point of the movie to connect with the audience they need to stand back and see the entire affect that a scene creates this will be  similar to aladdin or the new lion king it will lose its appeal in a few months and audiences will forget it in a week
Sep 5 2020,positive,mulan is really cool i like that phoenix very much
Sep 5 2020,positive,thought this was a great story the message and themes of family honor courage standing for what you believe in is what we need right now the cinematography and visual experience is amazing i will watch again 
Sep 5 2020,negative,this movie is all flare and no delivery while the stunning visual effects are pleasing to watch mulan fails to provide little to any consistency with its editing as well as filling the story with an abundance of cgi making the film feel unrealistic and lazy this movie is held back by disney
Sep 5 2020,positive,i really like chinese martial arts too much especially when such a beautiful heroine knows martial arts so well
Sep 5 2020,negative,another disney movie that you will not remember
Sep 5 2020,positive,as an animation powder i have to say that i am very satisfied with this adaptation especially the choice of actors
Sep 5 2020,negative,i was so looking forward to this but the lack of real character development pacing story all lead this movie to fall utterly flat so much potential 
Sep 5 2020,negative,a new low for disney liveaction films zero of the charm and whimsy that made the original animated classic what is was can be found here  a hollow cash cow that really stings considering expectations
Sep 5 2020,positive,this movie photography is really beautiful mulan is really handsome
Sep 5 2020,positive,beautiful scenery great acting heartfelt i loved the twist at the end 
Sep 5 2020,neutral,it is not worth the money disney is askingand im a disney lover watch the animated version instead  the sets and figurines were beautiful there was really bad cgi and some good the soundtrack was forgettable although there were references  to the songs from the animated classic that i appreciated i liked the fact that its a different story from the animated unlike other disney movies that copied the original and gave it a national geographic twistlion kingbut i would like to see a better growth on the main character  mulans already  a incredible acrobat from the beginning of the movie i would have like to see her slowly  discover how amazing  of a fighter she is  there were some but very few funny jokes and moments the stunts and fight scenes were good i really did enjoy them   in conclusion its far from being a great movie but i did enjoy it not worth the price that disney is asking 30 something dollars is too much  for the quality of this movie i wont be watching the movie again  maybe if the main actress didnt support the violence that the hong kong police provided to its people i would enjoy the movie more    sorry for my basic english
Sep 5 2020,positive,i have fallen in love with liu yifei completely
Sep 5 2020,negative,u think this is the 2nd time in my life i fell asleep during the movie my god this movie lacks humanity feelings anything who created this an ia algorithm wow dont want to spoil it too much but no music rushed the characters were forgetful where are the mongols the beloved songs and dragon guys avoid this like cancer and watch the original animated masterpiece instead
Sep 5 2020,negative,i am still waiting for that all asian cast american movie that will be the black panther for the asian community so far the only proper all asian cast american movie is crazy rich asian and that was a romcom about rich people which isnt what i am looking for the disney liveaction remake of mulan 1998 is a proper bigbudget all asian cast movie that aligns with what i am looking for however disney liveaction remakes have been mostly a miss apart from the jungle book and cinderella mulan 2020 is directed by niki caro who won lots of awards for her movie whale rider2002 but it does make me wonder if they couldnt have just hired an asian director but whatever  the trailers though seem to suggest that this remake was actually attempting to do things differently from the original which intrigued my interest unfortunately due to coronavirus this movie got delayed and then shoved to streaming with a hefty price instead of going to cinemas i actually avoided watching the original mulan recently just to make myself go into this movie with a more open mind and to have a sort of first time watching experience again therefore i am going to avoid comparison with the original in this review so after watching this did the movie live up to the expectations   note unlike my previous reviews there is going to be a fair amount of minor spoilers here so be warned    firstly visually the movie is quite beautiful there are some gorgeous shots in this movie such as the martial art practice by the lake mulan running on the rooftops and even the war itself was quite visually pleasing the cinematography isnt roger deakins level of stunning but it is definitely really good looking this is also elevated by the really good set design and costumes the set design allows for great scenery and the costumes feel authentic these really help pull the audience into the movie and the era that mulan is set in    secondly the score by harry gregsonwilliams who has done the score for movies like shrek and the martian does a pretty good job here as well with mulan they use a lot of wind instruments that are heard from a lot of chinese movies and pretty much use them here the score generally works and it really helps create the atmosphere for each scene really well also the orchestral cover of reflection from the original mulan is used in this movie and is just really awesome    now my gripes with this movie firstly is the lack of emphasis on emotional moments it feels like the movie brushes over a lot of what i would consider quite important the scene where mulan makes the decision to go to war is one of the important decision she makes however the movie just has her pick up a sword and then the next scene she is in armor and off to war we dont get any emphasis on how important this decision was and the sacrifices she had to make until halfway through the movie for some reason this happens a couple of times as well such as when there is a destroyed town which shows the horror of war but they only spend a couple of seconds here with minimal reaction from the characters and its then just off to the next scene another being a character dying and its just whatever the movie feels really lacking in a lot of humanity but there are a couple of banter moments between mulan and friends that have some fun in it    on that note of characters the supporting characters are rather bland honghui yoson an acts as a love interest rival and ally for mulan which is all there is about him  commander tung donnie yen sort of mentors mulan and knew mulans dad but thats really it the emperor jetli is a badass and wise emperor who barely appears in the movie bori khan jason scott lee who is the main villain also barely appears in the movie despite being the bad guy who started the war the witch gong li who is probably the worst character in this entire movie is like mulan but bad these are all the relevant supporting characters but there are others who are so forgettable i dont remember if they even had names     the character arc which is part of the story is not great either mulans decision to finally be true to herself and not hide that she is a woman just sort of happens because she got beaten up instead of it happening in a dramatic way it just feels rather random also mulan is special because she got lots of chi which ruins the message of the movie instead of feeling like she earned her place in the army and gaining the recognition of her comrades through her efforts it instead feels like she only got it because she is the chosen one so the message is now be true to yourself only if youre the special one the witch also goes through a character arc as well but it is extremely rushed and dumb she makes choices that dont even make any sense such as divulging the main villain plans or sparing mulan constantly or the really dumb choice at the end of the movie her addition to mulan is pointless and if anything took away all the screentime from the main villain instead     the action scenes are also mediocre which is such a shame asian movies have always nail action scenes with their amazing choreography but in mulan it is boring the trailers made it seem like it might be in the veins of crouching tiger hidden dragon withs it floaty yet elegant style of fighting however it instead really plain and overly edited with many cuts     on that note of edits there are some weird edits in this movie that make it feel like there were important scenes that were cut minor spoilers but there is a scene where mulan is riding a horse towards the enemies army in an open field but then the next scene suddenly has her behind the enemy hiding behind a rock with no explanation whatsoever there is also a scene where after mulan has decided to be true to herself in which she saves an ally but makes a choice to disappear into the fog the next scene is then showing her dramatically coming back to her allies seconds later it is so weird and took me out of the movie for sure    i also have to talk about our main lead actress liu yifei who plays mulan she sucks she plays mulan with no charm or charisma or even a personality the tone in her voice is always the same and the only real change in her voice is when she is pretending to be a male with a deep voice she also makes no expression whatsoever it always feels like she has the same neutral expression in every moment even when someone died its the same expression at least donnie yen and jet li are good in their roles though    overall the movie is not the all asian cast american movie i am waiting for it is just another inferior remake from disney it has none of the fun that was in the original so the movie just ends up being boring there are some things you can enjoy in the movie with some pretty good moments sprinkled in there additionally it is still pretty much a retelling of the original mulan so the overall story is still there it just isnt as good it could have been such a shame
Sep 5 2020,positive,i was expecting a movie driven by the cartoon and was pleasantly surprised with a chinese martial arts blockbuster hit loved the message at the end of the movie a must watch and watch again movie great action scenes to top it off
Sep 5 2020,positive,ohmygosh boohoo theres no mushu or singing get over it this movie is great and im glad it got to portray the chinese culture we needed some more asian representation and the outfits and everything was great the fighting i believe was really good but some of the effects i think were choppy other than that yeah this is overall a great movie
Sep 5 2020,positive,the movie was really good and the actors did a good job
Sep 5 2020,neutral,technically brilliant beautiful scenery cinematography and colours lacks the nuances and subtle cultural touches of the original despite the team supposedly aiming for a more progressive movie dont look to this movie for one that culturally resounds with the overseas born chinese like how the original did youll struggle to relate to the characters and concepts this one is much more superficial and shallow in its interpretation of the ballad and confuciantaoist values but brings in wuxia style visuals honestly it would have been interesting to see if this movie would have been written differently by a team of writers of chinese representation
Sep 5 2020,negative,the movie was no fun they have ruined the magic
Sep 5 2020,negative,a surprisingly badly done take on the mulan legend theres something lacking within this remake that stands out against its original animated film or even other adaptations of mulans story liu yifeis wooden acting the overly predictable plot and the heavy handed story all serve to distract from something that could have been a far better remake or take on mulan
Sep 5 2020,positive,i adored this movie the costuming soundtrack casting and setting were all exquisite its a slightly more modern version of the story but i think it was a fantastic choice to update it looking forward to watching again
Sep 5 2020,negative,awfultotally unnecessary no character developmentall the fantastic music is gone too
Sep 5 2020,positive,6510  spoilerssssss    like i had fun watching it and it tickled my inner kung fu movie fan side but the direction they took it felt kinda dumb like mulan uses chi to focus and fight which makes her more skilled and tough then everyone else and i feel like her just naturally having that ruined the whole segment of the movie that exists to show her training her skills in the cartoon that part is beautiful because she is plain and useless but she works her ass off and becomes the best in this she was just already there    the casting was done well so i really think it was an issue with the director too many moments are just ruined by them shoehorning in something to remind you of the original and then slamming some junk in to remind you it isnt that movie anymore bummmmeeeer
Sep 5 2020,negative,animation story was so much better than this had a stronger mulan there as an ordinary girl here is she has extra powers battle scenes are soso compared to older chinese epic movies
Sep 5 2020,positive,people be crazy i think it was a great movie hands off the best disney remake it has a lot of call backs to the original but is obvious different i dont like these remakes that literally take the original movie line for line ie lion king and i am glad they made the movie like this the only criticism i would give is they should of made it a bit light hearted and funny like the original 
Sep 5 2020,positive,i am now a big fan of the movie mulan and the heroine is really super beautiful
Sep 5 2020,positive,i started movie with an open mind since i heard the biggest controversy was how the movie was represented in the animated version but then once it came out i soon realized this is how most kung fu movies are represented it had great visuals the mention of chi and just representation of the asian culture many of my friends who are asian were looking forward to this movie and they deserved to because i got the chance to experience something like black panther and that was very magical to me     now my only complaint is it was short but thats only because the westernized version has a lot signing but not enough kung fu or storyline and goes to show what happens when you give movies what they suppose to have originally from beginning to the very ending where you see the signature disney castle and listening to the amazing christina aguilera sing like she did in the 90s just gave me goosebumps i see a lot of people complain about the dragon not being in the movie but thats not how the story is told in hong kong or even 900 years ago everything just felt right with the movie and gave me a nostalgic feeling for a movie i never seen before and as i type this i feel the goosebumps pop out of my skin because thats just how amazing this movie is     so i conclude my review with something minor  go watch the movie buy it or wait until december 7th but its worth it and understand that everything doesnt need to be dancing in the rain like we use to with most disney movies and that what makes me love this movie even more thank you for this live action and looking forward to future movies becoming live action
Sep 5 2020,positive,every actor did a great jobespecially liu yifei shes really goodwhen i saw mulan hugging her father i cried
Sep 5 2020,neutral,i really really really wanted to like it unfortunately it just wasnt that good it seemed a bit flat theres so much more they could have done with it 
Sep 5 2020,positive,its a excellent film which is well worth watchingthe little girl can get strength from itmy sister said she liked it very much
Sep 5 2020,positive,more violent than the original not for little kids but enjoyable remake
Sep 5 2020,positive,unfortunatelly the movie cant decide if its a disney adaptation or a epic period movie it stands in the middle and dont achieve the full potential of either mulan is not only of the best disney animated films but also one of the best characters i was hoping to see her full potential shown on a live action movie with that cinematography and production design which actually are amazing
Sep 5 2020,negative,i wish i had more hands to give this movie more thumbs down
Sep 5 2020,positive,best princess movie ever
Sep 5 2020,positive,mulan is one of my favorite movies i have been deeply attracted by the beautiful scenes and the appearance level of mulan
Sep 5 2020,negative,another epicsized film of equally epicsized failure from the many consider now defunct king of entertainment companies hear that sound  its walt d spinning in his grave  d
Sep 5 2020,positive,i like it but it couldve been better i love the nods to the cheesy old style hong kong movie fighting the accents couldve been more consistent some of the superhuman attributes displayed couldve been given a better introductionexplanation as well on the guardian spirit also the camaraderie between mulanjun needed to be fleshed out a little more than 1 scene
Sep 5 2020,positive,this movie was very well done the acting costume and set design were top notch this is definitely a feelgood film with new material not seen in the animated version highly recommend watching
Sep 5 2020,positive,yifei liu is genuinely strong and fits the role perfectly i love mulan
Sep 5 2020,positive,fantastic must see well worth it 
Sep 5 2020,negative,they tried ill give them that  but they failed  sadly was excited for it
Sep 5 2020,negative,its just one of those movies that you only enjoy in theaters not worth the 30 you have to pay on disney photography is beautiful but the poor script and acting falls flat and makes the picture incredibly boring i basically spend two hours thinking how different it would have been if they had released it on cinemas
Sep 5 2020,neutral,loved the original movie trailer had me excited not super happy with the editing seemed to have a lot of jumpy shots to minimize cost of cgi which was just ok some genuine good moments dad was cast well boy crush scenes were ok too milans character arc though was not developed enough to fall in love with the relationship between the witch and mulan was flat even though the idea was fine the hate on missing musicality was unwarranted the song clips got the job done scenes with landscape almost made film disconnect landscapes were fantastic theme of movie honestly felt like a direct to dvd overall kind of bummed that it wasnt a classic i expected more character development for such a classic story
Sep 5 2020,positive,after being delayed for several months disneys liveaction mulan is skipping the theaters and headed straight to video on demand via disney premier access for those that dont want to shell out you can wait until december for this film to be available for free to all subscribers    isually beautiful this liveaction adaption strays away from what made disneys 1998 animated feature such a big hit with no songs and no mushu younger kids and those that have a strong connection to mulan will face disappointment    outside of the lead played by liu yifei this movie has an allstar cast that consists of tzi ma donnie chen jason scott lee and jet li unfortunately that was not enough to make this movie a success i believe poor storytelling pacing and direction made this 200 million version of mulan a flop for disney standards this could be disneys worst liveaction adaptation which is unfortunate since it is such a great story and younger children may get bored watching    there is not much heart and emotion to pull you into this movie until you get towards the end and the last act is where all the big action and excitement occur there is though a surprising cameo that did put a big smile on my face and hopefully all the disney fans catch it    i give mulan a 710 and i hope that all the families that decide to shell out the 30 to watch mulan get their moneys worth from this lackluster blockbuster
Sep 5 2020,positive,this film does not deserve the hate its getting its an enjoyable film and you guys should take a chance on it
Sep 5 2020,positive,some scenes are very touching and it is suitable for my families to watch together
Sep 4 2020,positive,enjoyable film kids loved it a new take on the ninja princess as my daughter calls her     being able to watch at home for a small fee is perfect too
Sep 4 2020,negative,it lacked so much and instead of showing mulan as a strong character she was portrayed as instantly strong no build up of her own strength and this version of her was in no way accurate like they wanted it to be and so many things were left open like who is the witch why was mulan born with so much power and why did this feel like a bollywood knock off rather then a disney movie
Sep 4 2020,positive,this movie is amazing with incredible acting and fighting the cinematography is also excellent and worthy of an oscar
Sep 4 2020,negative,a film with good visuals however the plot and the performances are very empty they do not have that originality that the cartoon had it looks like its cartoons in the rain sad and unmotivated
Sep 4 2020,positive,excellent retake on the disney animated version a phoenix instead of mushu her determination to save her fathers life in military service by sacrificing her own life fighting the huns and from death of discovery by her own countrymen anyone familiar with crouching tiger hidden dragon can see similarities in the chinese directing style or chinese fantasy martial art films while keeping it a little more grounded and not so much wire flying i truly enjoyed this film a perfect 5 no but a definite 45 from me
Sep 4 2020,negative,this movie certainly wont make a man out of me ip man was amazing as always though im 100 sure he died in ip man 4 as for mulan shes ok    but my biggest issue is wheres timon and pumbaa like hakuna im outta here
Sep 4 2020,positive,if you are going into it thinking of the 1998 animated version then you wont like it its a visually gorgeous film the acting is great and i really didnt even miss the music 
Sep 4 2020,positive,mulan is very different from what has already been seen at disney it is a film of its own that leaves behind several elements of its lively identity but that offers much more in its absence
Sep 4 2020,negative,just stick with the animated version no more remakes
Sep 4 2020,negative,straight garbage left out so much stuff from the original disney animated version pivotal scenes just disappointed
Sep 4 2020,positive,its just fine its better than the majority of disneys live action remakes but it still lacks heart and it has barely nothing new to offer in terms of cinematic achievements   like i said its just a fun summer popcorn movie 710
Sep 4 2020,negative,good action movie but it should have been called different i understand they wanted to give a new storyline but at this point dont call it mulan   the movie photography soundtrack and actors are top notch   its missing key elements of mulan such as the comedy 
Sep 4 2020,negative,worst live action yet it looks like a low budget film
Sep 4 2020,positive,noticed most of the bad or so so reviews came from men well as a man myself i found this movie adaptation a fresh of breath air from the animated one and kudos to disney in going ahead to make this movie as realistic as possible to those who dont know chinese culture the phoenix is the representation of the female spirit and that is why its being used in the movie thank god there is no talking dragon and songs as that will certainly spoil the whole realistic take and also in asian culture we too have witch craft that is represented by gong li as a shapeshifter so to those who wish to see talking dragon and comedy and songs this is not a movie for you as an asian man myself i proud that disney recognised the change in society where women are now considered as equal
Sep 4 2020,positive,liu did a perfect jobthe film is fantastic
Sep 4 2020,positive,one of the best films from disney in recent years gorgeous and emotional
Sep 4 2020,negative,boring and blend movie bad cgi not worth the money
Sep 4 2020,positive,its really good in my opinion mulan changes everything for the live actions it showed to us that makin a live action its not obly copy and paste and watch
Sep 4 2020,positive,i mean the director is so good the leading actress is so good mulan is so great i wanna cry wish there was a sequel
Sep 4 2020,positive,i think the movie was pretty awesome
Sep 4 2020,neutral,when i watch the live action mulan 2020 i think that it wasnt that bad that they make a few changes of the live action that people wanted that they didnt like but when it release it on disney people say that is missing a lot of things that are in the part of the story that people love from the animated mulan 1998 and also the characters like mushu the cricket grandmother fa and also captain li shang who wasnt in the live action and they change the captains name
Sep 4 2020,positive,ummm wow beautiful cinematography and some new additions to the story line the best live action remake from disney to date
Sep 4 2020,negative,i want to be up front im probably one of the few people who has never seen the animated version my kids preferred nickelodeon over disney so i dont have anything to compare it to i saw the reviews both glowing and skewering so i thought id give it a shot with as clean a slate as possible i didnt hate it but it wasnt a good movie it was just kind of there some of the scenes were done well but some were not up to disney quality as far as cgi the ateam style fight scenes lots of violence but no blood was odd i know it had to be that way to get past the chinese censors but it was weird it did however get me curious about the animated original so i guess ill watch that this weekend 30 is basically two tickets to a theater and my family of 4 watched so i guess that is a win overall just wait for the price to drop or it hits blue ray and own a physical copy for 30
Sep 4 2020,negative,brings disgrace and dishonor to the original film disney why just why my inner child is heartbroken
Sep 4 2020,positive,i like this moviei think it is the best one in the live princess moviesliu yifei is lumiousi cant help recommending the film to my friends because it is so good
Sep 4 2020,negative,just makes you hungry for the real version  what did you expect  nice to see all the familiar asian actors though
Sep 4 2020,positive,i loved it so much so powerful and wonderful
Sep 4 2020,positive,good for its role as a disney family film
Sep 4 2020,positive,best disney animated remake
Sep 4 2020,negative,i though this is an epic movie with some great action packed i wrong
Sep 4 2020,positive,one of the best movie of all time  love it     10 out of 10
Sep 4 2020,negative,they shouldnt have billed this as a liveaction remake  unlike the other live action cash grabs that disney has made in recent years this movie was actually reimagined  it should be relief because the lack of imagination was one of my biggest issued with the live action remakes but instead they managed to reimagine all the fun out of this story  the comparison to the animation version does real damage to this movie  dont waste your time with this one
Sep 4 2020,negative,what in the world were they thinking with this movie it was not just boring to watch it was also a waste of money skip and watch the classic instead
Sep 4 2020,negative,awful directing choppy timing bland choreography and the musical score was an atrocious mess of the animated films score without any context or use    the worst part was that its no longer a film about being yourself and believing in your own worth mulan is now a godgifted super ninja and the patriarchy is keeping her down
Sep 4 2020,positive,better than wonder woman
Sep 4 2020,negative,i am embarrassed that there was such an inaccurate depiction of chinese culture within the movie its like elements that were interesting were picked out and mashed all together into one big mess
Sep 4 2020,negative,what a waste of time and money   absolutely woeful lacking soul sooooo expensive
Sep 4 2020,positive,a beautiful looking film it was inspiring and made me emotional i enjoyed it thoroughly see it but dont expect the animated story  let the movie stand alone
Sep 4 2020,negative,disney said this would be more realistic than the original animated version it was not  in the original the only unrealistic this was mushu in this one they had a shape shifting witch  mulan in the animated version had to train hard to defeat the huns vs she has good chi  the music is the this one was just the songs from the original without the singing   do not spend money on this film
Sep 4 2020,positive,this movie is awesome today is the opening day we watched it twice already on disney and plan to watch it a couple more times this weekend we cannot wait to see it on imax whenever it plays there movie of the year
Sep 4 2020,positive,it is an incredible movie in action war drama seriousness and with an empowered and strong protagonist but it lacks soul
Sep 4 2020,negative,you will not get a nostalgic feeling  they dont do a good job at showing how disgraceful it was for a female to serve in the military at that time and in turn you dont feel the significance of the emperor accepting her    two key phrases that hit you in the original but left out    key phrase from the emperor when he give her the sword so that the world knows what you have done for china     key phrase from her father at the end when she brings the sword  the greatest gift and honor is having you for a daughter    not worth the money i wasted mine dont waste yours the cartoon had more feeling than the live action
Sep 4 2020,negative,i died of boredom so bad and obvious in your face cgi
Sep 4 2020,positive,i loved this movie       i think people are being really nasty comparing it with the animation which was amazing dont get me wrong you can clearly see the crisp clear shots are pieces of art the acting is flawless although i miss mushu obviously  everyone does     if you dont like live action then just watch the animation but just give it a chance before you go hell no        she was completely stunning and a total badass     its really hard to create things of this excellence and before people start being very judgemental just think how crappy your attempt at remaking a live action movie would be lol     i loved mulan pls give it a go before you judge
Sep 4 2020,negative,as  a fan of mulan story i found this version to be disappointing
Sep 4 2020,negative,one my familys movies destroyed  the story changes poor cgi and loss of heart made it hard to watch to the end
Sep 4 2020,neutral,super heavy handed even though it is meant for children some subtly and less repeated dialogue wouldnt hurt it almost feels cartoonish but not in the fun way there were moments where i was glued to my seat only to roll my eyes when a character repeats word for word something someone else said a while ago to make their point and i have to roll my eyes other times the character just wallop you with a super cheesy message and youre just left reeling with a did did they just say that out loud and nobody thought that was weird    the chii and wuxialike feel to the movie were fun and interesting changes however the worldbuilding surrounding the changes were lacking and it really broke immersion when only the major players mulan the witch etc could seem to access it in meaningful ways just for micdrop moments it really only served to reinforce mulans specialness this took away from the significance of the original mulans choice to take her fathers place in the original mulan had no combat ability or chii she left for war knowing this but worked up to surpass her peers in the 2020 film mulan goes in special and she comes out special but it doesnt really add to the story aside from an acrobatic edge to the fight scenes     im glad that they were so light on the romance though mulan didnt need a romantic partner at all additionally the landscapes and architecture were stunning     i really want to love the movie it had all the elements that i wanted in a movie and i was hyped for months since the trailer came out unfortunately while it isnt a terrible movie it is pretty forgettable and not worth a rewatch
Sep 4 2020,positive,whilst many of the directing choices are understandable mulan lacks any of the charms which are the hall marks of a disney film its visually stunning but has no heart
Sep 4 2020,negative,worst movie ive watched in years incoherent horribly written mess
Sep 4 2020,positive,with great fight choreography and some real visual flair this is the disney live action remake that most feels like its own thing not beholden to the animation
Sep 4 2020,neutral,being a huge fan of the original i was really exited for this movie i unlocked it the minute it was available after watching it was okay and didnt mind the direction they went but i wouldnt have gone back to see it multiple times this new thing that disney is doing its a good deal for families but a single person its a gamble 
Sep 4 2020,negative,the plot makes no sense with all the mystical powers that arent even in the original movie it makes the storyline very confusing and antidramatic it feels like they are just trying to insert as many prominent china stars into the remake as possible and it doesnt work well    conclusion the original is much better you can wait until its free on disney to watch it there is absolutely no rush to pay 30 to watch it right now
Sep 4 2020,positive,i like this film very much the plot is easy to understand but deep in peoples hearts it is an excellent and tasteful masterpiece everyone should have it it makes me want to know more about chinese culture
Sep 4 2020,positive,i went in expecting to hate it especially with the controversies surrounding the film but i loved it everything about it felt magical and different from what the animated film portrayed im glad it wasnt a copy paste remake like other disney remakes
Sep 4 2020,negative,why get rid of the songs though literally what made the animated movie so good was the soundtrack and mushu and they got rid of both dumb
Sep 4 2020,positive,an excellent remake that will appeal to a wide range of audience
Sep 4 2020,negative,no mushu no music lets cut out the best parts 
Sep 4 2020,positive,best reboot compared to other disney liveaction films    compared to origianl mulan her femail identity is been found in the middle of the movie but that is what i think the most excited moment for this whole movie a femail so brave to show who she is face her fear and save her friends
Sep 4 2020,positive,i really enjoyed this movie i was a bit suspicious of whether i would like it but i really enjoyed it it had heart it had action and the score was amazing its not as good as the original animated one but its definitely a recommended and a rewatch
Sep 4 2020,negative,watched the movie and i must say that the remake does not have the character as the original mulan the main character is bland and does not have the character development that makes us care as the original side characters are rushed and there is very little development new characters that replaced the original are simply not good and took away from the experience the movie is bland with very little humor and bored me    pros scenery   cons story
Sep 4 2020,positive,it was a good time an empowering tale with heart but nowhere near the heart and charm of the original film i appreciate it on its own but i felt like it was lacking something great performances minus a few moments and some great action my biggest gripe would be that the some of the effects were great and then sometimes the green screen visuals were very noticeable
Sep 4 2020,negative,im sorry the animated version was much better  looks like it was rushed through post  and no mushu 
Sep 4 2020,positive,love it first time paying 30 to watch anything money will spend
Sep 4 2020,positive,i love this movie the part of the movie shes come home and reunited i cry if the part but the ending i love the song
Sep 4 2020,negative,boring shit cg this movie had a lot of potential but thats it
Sep 4 2020,negative,nothing but a lot of cgi and action scenes completely lacking in storytelling charm and character not a patch on the animated version
Sep 4 2020,negative,it was good disney made a live action version of this with great fighting scenes but mostly the movie sucked with boring scenes  no mushu and the real name of the villians were huns not boring we do see the villians are from kublai khanatez 
Sep 4 2020,positive,its visually stunning action packed and all around just amazing
Sep 4 2020,negative,this movies is so boooring and the cgi is atrocious for high budget film do not pay 30 for this if you must watch it at least wait till its available in december as part of d subscription
Sep 4 2020,positive,i was worried because of the reviews but this movie was absolutely amazing i watched it with my family and we were all glued to the tv i cried like a baby felt like a warrior and cheered for her like family i will watch it again and again and again phenomenal movie
Sep 4 2020,positive,its a good movie visually speaking but the story is not as good as the photograph of the film that should accompany it but it was fun
Sep 4 2020,positive,the remarkable disney princess
Sep 4 2020,positive,i was afraid that the film would deviate too much from the original and also that the wellknown dragon was not part of the film but this movie was so beautiful and a talking dragon would have soiled this movie they chose a much better option    loved it
Sep 4 2020,neutral,spoiler free rating  no ill make a man out of you 010    spoiler rating ahead    so over all id say decent i guess i like it more than any of the other disney remakes however it still does have a lot of glaring issues for one like all the other disney remakes it has a pacing issue it was very noticeable to me at the beginning there wasnt a real build up that showed her deciding to leave you didnt get that just bam ok i guess girl be going to war even though in the previous scene she seemed resigned to stay home i felt a lot of the effects just seemed slow if that makes sense there was even a really bad cut of mulan getting knocked off her horse that just looked bad no other way to describe it you got that corny half second frame of her face then cut to her rolling on the ground it just looked like a horrible cut id expect out of movies in early 80s or older yes we had reflection in this movie in the form of instrumentals but i really was saddened that they didnt do any of the other songs as instrumentals at certain points even there really is no comedic relief in this movie at all its pretty serious all the way through which is fine but it honestly made it super hard to fully pay attention my brain was craving some sort of break from the constant serious tone  there were a few moments of me getting those hair raising tingles but over all i attribute that to the music and that beautiful crescendo we got in the reflection instrumental version which id say is arguably the thing this film got down perfect again i just wish the other songs from the animated movie got that same treatment to some degree  as for my feel of the whole magic aspect of it meh it seemed off like it wasnt really quite right honestly and maybe it was the effects or editing but again parts of the fight scenes where effects were used really just seemed slow thats the only way i can describe it  that and all the wall running in the start too was just bad nothing but bad i really was getting a whole crouching tiger hidden dragon feel to the effects of how it just didnt seem like the characters would have weight suddenly when preforming these stunts i swear some of the huns were tiptoeing up the wall at the start i laughed more from the corny effects than any jokes they did try tbh  ok so as hard as im sounding on the movie again i liked this one more than all other remakes so far for that my serious score is 610 decent enough to watch but do not waste your money to see it and its nothing to buy    tldr effects were pretty bad imo besides reflection all other songs were completely dropped which was sad i would have loved some instrumental versions of the other songs worth a watch eventually but do not buy it either now or when it comes to blue ray
Sep 4 2020,negative,i loved the orginal mulan but the changes made to the live action are stripping everything that made the orginal lovable     the characters in the movie are flat and without resolution towards each other everything feels disconnected  a missed opportunity especially if compared to the adaptation of aladdin which was excellent
Sep 4 2020,negative,sorry this live action was trash the new aladdin was a million times better
Sep 4 2020,negative,this movie was the reason i cancelled my disney plus subscription charging me 35 to see this pile of a movie i was expecting crouching tiger vibes but i got 1998 video games why do they keep crapping on my childhood i really love this story this just comes off as a low budget movie
Sep 4 2020,negative,stupid american film industry trying to collect some money during covid by ruining chinese ancient stories the cartoon was much better since i was just a kid while i was watching it
Sep 4 2020,positive,true to the origin source  the ballad of mulan with added features for entertainment live versions need to bring more to the screen like this film did this is not another copy of the animated version if you miss the elements of the animated film rewatch the animated film
Sep 4 2020,positive,niki caros direction of the liveaction remake of mulan is exceptionally done the originality film and a more realistic approach were fantastic showing something new from disney liu yifei is phenomenal as the female warrior and is the rest of the cast the movie is funny emotional and adventurous with biggest and best action sequences in a disney liveaction   mulan   45 stars
Sep 4 2020,negative,there are going to be spoilers in this so if you care about that dont read italright everyone knows this is the liveaction version of mulan that came out i 1998 its pretty much the same story just with added in the scene for character development we all know the story she is in this family with no sons so her father is called off to war when the war comes but she knows her father will die so she goes instead knowing full well she could die thats pretty much everything that happens so lets start with what i liked first off the scenery is excellent i love how they depict ancient china it looks incredible the set designs are great and the costume design as well even the score is well done and thats it there is a lot that doesnt work for this movie that genuinely bothers me the biggest thing is that movie is just plain and boring there is no soul no heart no mph thats where this movie suffers nothing exciting or worthwhile happens until the last actfinal battle for example the whole training scene is boring and dull without the inspiration and drive from the music or mushu thats another thing this movie suffers without mushu or the music  mushu is replaced with a very ugly looking phoenix that shows up i think three times in the movie and is used as a video game wayfinderpointing mulan where she needs to go mushu the character while he was comic relief he brought heart to the animated movie he was the one who was always giving mulan the push to work harder without him the character of mulan is dry without music there is no feeling for anything it feels like everything is out happening one scene after another the music in the animation was there to tell a story of what was happening with the characters and how they have gone through their own experiences but with no music it isnt exciting next is the acting for mulan the name is stiff and dry she is monotone boring and vanilla she was rarely showing any emotion when delivering her lineswatching her story play out and seeing how blunt she is being it made me not care what happens to her that goes for almost all the other characterseven the villains yes there are two and both are very forgettable lets start with the dude who is a recreation of shawn yu who in my opinion while he was a very bland character he was still menacing and had no problem just straightup murdering a dude this ripoff is someone who is more talk than action  has his soldiers do all the fighting now the witch is supposed to be this evil creature with all the powers and kicks ass no she is used as a pawn to shapeshift into birds whenever and gives the other villain a chance to attack even then towards the end of the movie she charges sides cause she feels terrible for mulan and is like girl power she even sacrifices her life for mulan like what even the cgi isnt the best like there are parts where you can tell its green screen and i get movies to use it all the time but you would think with a fivemonth hiatus this movie has had and they wouldve fixed that my final gripe with this movie is that it takes away a lot of character development we see with mulan at the beginning of the original she doesnt stand up for her father against the emperors men there doesnt seem to be a sense of independence for her character also they introduce this chi aspect that somehow gives mulan superpowers when it comes to fighting and it looks awful and makes no sense in the end this is just another soulless joyless cash grab that sucks all the fun out of the original 410
Sep 4 2020,negative,the mary sue pandering was just too high  ruined a classic  sad faces for everyone                                  
Sep 4 2020,positive,i really enjoyed this adaptation of mulan it kept me on the edge i would watch again and again
Sep 4 2020,negative,not the best  disney could have done a whole lot better
Sep 4 2020,negative,terrible in every possible aspect the charm and humour from the animated movie has been removed and replaced with wooden acting forced dialogue and cheap cgi    the story is strung together poorly and makes giant leaps of logic which make little to no sense and the characters are at best forgettable     disney should not be rewarded for churning out such poor content vote with your wallets and give this one a miss
Sep 4 2020,positive,this movie is just absolutely amazing a must see although it did suck that disney took out some of the elements from the animated feature but it was for the better it takes the story of mulan to a more serious tale with some humor that made the story flow better mulan is a feminist film and what i mean by that is that its for everyone little girls can look up to her and say hey i want to be like her a strong independent women that has her fair share of struggles this movie is absolutely stunning from the   cinematography set design costuming script directing performances and the music its a perfect film also with a lot of action absolutely loved it
Sep 4 2020,positive,this film is very suitable for the whole family to watch and arouses the feelings of those who have seen the 1998 version of mulan at the same time they have different experiences the famous words of the film brave loyal and true make me think that responsibility is a very important quality for everyone
Sep 4 2020,positive,show some grace this is a live adaptation of the animated film and im pleased they did not adapt everything from the original its a mature story telling of an old story theres a lot of heart and soul in the film good casting and beautiful cinematography some of the supporting actors really shined all in all a feast for the eyes and soul
Sep 4 2020,positive,i thought this was a well made live action version i appreciated that it wasnt made as a musical as it would have made the movie way more unrealistic the fighting style was just like to you expect to see not quite realistic but just enough to enjoy it all in all it was a great watch i didnt score 5 stars because lack of a movie theater experience is what failed to make it perfect for me
Sep 4 2020,negative,the movie is visually stunning but the story has no soul  it really did not feel like there was any character growth with mulan the individual as well as everyone in the movie  the supporting characters really did not add anything to the story  i dont know if it was the acting or the plotdirection but the characters felt more like puppets going through the motions rather than something with real emotion  overall it was a very tedious film that meandered through a weak plot with very stiff delivery  for a film with a solid story and characters that actually feel real stick with the original animated movie
Sep 4 2020,positive,to be honest i didnt expect much from this movie and i thought it would be a bad movie fortunately the film proved me wrong and i consider it a pleasant surprise i loved that the tone of the film was a little more serious than the original film as it helped me get into the plot and understand the characters a little more the phoenix looks amazing its presence feels mystical and plays an important role in the film i loved the nods to the songs in the movie and i was grateful they werent there so they wouldnt damage the tone of the film  the only thing i didnt like so much was the action scenes in the film where frankly they look unbelievable and a little ridiculous i would have liked them to have retained the serious and realistic tone where i feel that the film would have worked better this way the witchs absurd transformations didnt help much in this regard either  in general as a film mulan has his good and bad things where luckily the good ones are not overshadowed by the mistakes the film makes its one of the best live action movies disney has ever produced its an entertaining film that makes the viewer have a good time despite the changes made to the comparison of the animated film smart changes from my point of view the story does not lose its magic at any time
Sep 4 2020,negative,i was just bored too much green screen and not enough plot
Sep 4 2020,positive,characters were stale but the score and battle scenes were awesome
Sep 4 2020,positive,one of the best disney remakes i am hopeful for a sequel people are giving this a bad review because its not like the animated version news flash this version is closer to the actually story of mulan enjoy this version separate from the animated version
Sep 4 2020,positive,ive been craving for a kungfu wushu movie made by disney qi is a real thing and if you say that its a random word that made it into the movie you should do more research and actually talk to an older generation of chinese     a lot of quirky details too one of them being mulan coming home asking for her fathers forgiveness and when he hugged her she was surprised and felt awkward about it     there are many theories of mulan some said that she had always been skillful in martial art ever since she was a kid and it makes sense you wont survive being in an army if you have no clue of it     the word honor wasnt overused no one knows shame honor more than east asian google seppuku and youll understand     im not sure what western folks think but as an eastern audience i loved it sooo much
Sep 4 2020,positive,its important to come in to this mulan as if its completely separate from the animated movie it was a refreshing and modernized update with lots of action and somewhat subtle emotions
Sep 4 2020,positive,the subtlety of mulan and chens romance was almost perfect liu yifei is an amazing actress and she fit the bill for this the sorceress turning on boris was an oddity  i dont think this needed the singalong this is a coming of age story of a young woman finding her place in the mans world at times some seemed fast paced but honestly it doesnt matter   disney or not this was perfect a reimagining of an old tale mixed with hints of what the cartoon movie brought to the table
Sep 4 2020,positive,i think the heroines action play is very spectacular the plot is very smooth i and the children like it very much
Sep 4 2020,positive,action movies unlike other disney princesses she didnt have the princes salvation she was her own prince
Sep 4 2020,positive,very good film must watch
Sep 4 2020,positive,i love the original mulan but my biggest issues with that movie are the jarring tonal shifts and the onedimensional villain this version fixes those things and adds a great deal of depth to the villains and to mulans emotional journey the script gives her character more autonomy and thus a more compelling arc    the action is very impressively shot and beautifully choreographed even if some of the visual effects are a bit lacklustre considering its massive budget    the ending of this film is not as spectacular as that of the original and this film does not have as emotional of performances as the original but the story adds enough to make it well worth a watch and it will add to your appreciation of this classic eastern tale
Sep 4 2020,positive,the first 30 minutes was spent complaining about a lack of singing then a missing dragon and a love interest i questioned why the first minority disney princess film that heavily relied on musical elements like its many other counterparts was stripped of such sure there is a real fa mulan and she did these amazing things  but this is disney not a documentary right after the first 30 minutes the next hour and a half was spent in tear filled awe at how commanding the presence of mulans love for her father for her family and for her country translated from screen to my own heart this movie is a testament to owning your traits as a woman and the power of familial love that creates a foundation for greatness it reminds us things we have long forgotten in this era of self
Sep 4 2020,negative,disney effectively wrecked the message of mulan if you are used to chinese style movies you might get the style it was trying to achieve journey to the west crouching tiger hidden dragon but when they say we are taking mushu and the magic out of it you kind of expect not to see any magic what makes the figure of mulan so unique is that she was able to see who she truly is and utilized her humanly strength to meet those goals this movie blows that concept out of the water they made mulans strength chi out to be some kind of special magical energy totally destroying the positive message that you can do anything and rise up to the occasion to do what is right and protect the people you care about regardless of what is expected of you that message that makes mulan so special especially the original disney film is just gone yes it is visually appealing there are some good moments love the various actors involved but some of the changes just did not make sense and left me feeling not only did this not do the animated film justice but also not the legend of mulan  this movie felt like a flashy extra buck in disneys wallet and that is all
Sep 4 2020,positive,she is the best and the leading actor is also very attractive and cant accept villains although there is no singing and dancing the genius and wisdom of the director makes this film look sincere
Sep 4 2020,negative,disney sell it like a adaptation of the great classic  but its total garbage  go see the 1999 movie
Sep 4 2020,negative,so alway interesting when you have hade to watch another movie to know the plot of the other fealt like the chemistry between the characters where really poorly writen to bad i payed 30 dollar for this
Sep 4 2020,positive,the film of mulan was not what everyone expected but i loved the film because it is not a copy and paste but it shows you more of mulan as a character and is a delight as a spectator i laughed i cried and i was moved i love this movie uwuw
Sep 4 2020,negative,great film if you have someone to talk to for the entire film
Sep 4 2020,negative,personally thought it was kinda anticlimactic if you have small children they wont know what makes good or bad movies though lol
Sep 4 2020,negative,this movie was very boring and dull if your excited in hoping to see the animated movie that you love from your childhood your going to be very dissapointed
Sep 4 2020,positive,i am a chinese who study and live in usa ma i have been long time wait for this mulans film because that is our culture our ancient chinese hero    i spent 30 dollars and 6999 dollars to mulan and this reboot is very very good thank you disney thank you    really hope we can see this movie in theater in the future asian lives matter
Sep 4 2020,positive,have a nice mulan friday first of all happy labor day    it is a nice liveaction movie i always believe that it is the best princess moive in disney and even it is the best liveaction movie in disney    the senses are beautiful and the kungfu is perfect i can feel what they said chi in mulans spirits and words     i am an asian who live in ma for a long time i never have such chance to see our asian culture and see a asian woman in 200m movie to represent us if i have a daughter in the future mulan will be her hero if she see this movie from disney plus    hope in the future hollywood can give more chance to asian then we can enjoy our kinds in theatre
Sep 4 2020,positive,stunning visuals and action scenes a little lacking in character development and the emotional punches department but overall it more than does justice to the stunning original film loved it
Sep 4 2020,positive,it was a delight seeing this movie in my opinion it was one of the best live action remakes to date it is emotional empowering beautiful and visually stunning everything you would hope for in a disney movie
Sep 4 2020,positive,as an asian i am very proud disney can bring mulan to my real life i think rotten tomatoes gave it a 81 score is very reasonable it is worth 30 dollars of course    the senses are very beautiful i now understand why it costs 200m dollars and the action are so cool i think it is chinese kungfu very interested to see everyones reaction when they see the movie at home or theatre although the whole story changed a lot from disney mulan 1998 but i still can see the same mulan in every sense the actor is very beautiful when she fights with the enemy even it is a action movie but children can still see very happy    any way i think it is the best liveaction disney princess movie i ever seen it is worth when you arrange a movie day with your familiy or enjoy with your friend thank you disney thanks
Sep 4 2020,negative,the main lead is so bad at acting no facial expression at all as for this movie the phoenix character has no logic at all and she just turned her side  there is no musical scene which is disney movie is really good at no mushu and no grandma for the reason to respect chinese history but then why there is phoenix in the movie
Sep 4 2020,neutral,the good a strong cast  it was filmed nicely with excellent stunts  the bad it contained no songs from the animated version i got a bit bored at certain points  the villain was weak
Sep 4 2020,positive,just finished it very good reboot i think rotten tomatoes gave it a 81 score is very reasonable     the most excited things when i watched it is the beautiful scene and actions the whole story changed a lot from disney mulan 1998 but still maintain the main spirit of it and the actor is very beautiful when she fights with the enemy even it is a action movie but children can still see very happy    any way i think it is a good liveaction disney princess movie it is worth when you arrange a movie day with your familiy or enjoy with your friend
Sep 4 2020,positive,this is such a gorgeous movie its brilliant i recommend it to everyone
Sep 4 2020,positive,actress acts naturally she is mulan in my heart
Sep 4 2020,neutral,i love the visuals and  the fight scenes  i had a small problem with some of the comic relief scenes
Sep 4 2020,positive,yes i loved it the hype is real
Sep 4 2020,positive,this was a beautiful dramatic inspired version of the chinese legend the visuals martial arts choreography and pacing were all amazing this movie has to be watched without comparing it to the animated version and it really is a spectacle honoring chinese culture beauty and courage
Sep 4 2020,positive,a beautiful and attractive film
Sep 4 2020,positive,beautifully shot emotional and with an uplifting message of empowerment for women and girls watched it with my family and we all loved it
Sep 4 2020,positive,great the visual effects of the film are breathtaking and the action is even more stunning the whole film is different from the overentertainment and fantasy animated version it is very realistic logical and reasonable there are so many themes such as the awakening of female power fatherdaughter affection loyalty to country and self that enrich this liveaction film liu yifeis performance was good she truly was mulan donnie yen also fantastic
Sep 4 2020,positive,loved it one of the better if not best of the disney remakes
Sep 4 2020,positive,i loved this movie it wasnt a copy and paste of the original release the cinematography was beautiful and reminiscent of chinese action films i also like the fact her love interest is much more age appropriate and there isnt such a large gap between their ages like the original
Sep 4 2020,negative,real snoozer disney removed everything good about the original
Sep 4 2020,positive,hands down the best liveaction remake since beauty and the beast and the jungle book its a must see for everyone its funny a lot of people liked the lion king that showed no emotion youll cry in mulan this film has beautiful cinematography its eye popping
Sep 4 2020,positive,really great show during the pandemic good story and nice acting recommend to everyone
Sep 4 2020,negative,a boring slow movie with zero creativity
Sep 4 2020,positive,an epic movie i love the avalanche and the emperor rescue scene  i believe hua mulan  liu yifei did a great job
Sep 4 2020,positive,i found it to flow very well and action scenes were well  recommend highly
Sep 4 2020,positive,i liked some of the changes they made to the storyline and exceptional action sequences but i couldnt help feel like the movie was missing that extra bit of heart you expect from disney
Sep 4 2020,positive,the combination of the liveaction mulan contemporary the height of thought is far beyond the animation version
Sep 4 2020,negative,bad movie that tries too hard to appease to markets and demographics instead of being a movie better to stay with the 90s animation
Sep 4 2020,negative,i think its mehvery average when compared with its original animation counterparteverything that had made the animation beautiful is either lost or poorly adapted to the liveaction screen    also disney suffers from mary sue syndrome  just make a relatable female character instead of this overpowered bscmon man youre disneyi thought you were better than this but turns out its not    the cultural representation is good  the action choreography is nice but nothing extraordinary to note here    disney movies are supposed to be magical but this movie just feels mundanelike it was made to be a quick cash grab    overall this movie is subpar without anything original  totally not worth the 30 dollars  would give it 410  my advise just watch the original animation instead
Sep 4 2020,negative,the movie is boring with zero humor i had to turn it off halfway through i dont know what happened to disney lately zero original ideas just bland remakes and sequels the original mulan is so much better than this rewatch that and save yourself 30 disney is charging
Sep 4 2020,positive,certainly fresh live action the movie speaks for itself loyal brave true
Sep 4 2020,negative,it is not good  being a fan of the original the changes did not work for me  its shot well and i enjoyed a few actorsjason scott lee and tzi ma  the biggest mistake was no songs  also still missed mushu
Sep 4 2020,positive,i love this movie so much  the mulan character liuyifei  did a great job her performance just amazing  and  this movie is too beatiful
Sep 4 2020,negative,plot armored protagonist characters cut songs cut plot holes little motivation and topped off with an expensive price tag
Sep 4 2020,positive,it is no exaggeration to see mulan girls want to put liu yifei as an idol arm a good sword flower also beautiful know a girl to read after a straight call to marry her it is no exaggeration to see mulan girls want to put liu yifei as an idol arm a good sword flower also beautiful know a girl to read after a straight call to marry her it is no exaggeration to see mulan girls want to put liu yifei as an idol arm a good sword flower also beautiful know a girl to read after a straight call to marry her 
Sep 4 2020,negative,feeling like nothing more than another cash grab for disney mulan at times feels like whole sequences of scenes were never finished relying on the audiences past knowledge of the animated film to understand what is happening    the film leaves much to be desired for both action sequences seen better in classics such as crouching tiger hidden dragon and house of flying daggers and character development   unlike the animation the titular character has these abilities inside her all along instead of having to train and master anything     a nonsurprising disappointment
Sep 4 2020,positive,theres no singing dragons or epic songs which was disappointing but not at all a deal breaker in this epic adventure i laughed cried and held my breath the entire way as we follow mulans heartpounding journey and watch her rise to become chinas savior definately more of an adult action packed adventure though but worthy of at least 3 or 4 replays
Sep 4 2020,positive,on my period and started crying watching the mulan the best disney princess and best representation of a strong woman 
Sep 4 2020,positive,she is my heroshe can fly and ride on the horseunbelievable
Sep 4 2020,positive,so despite the price i paid for the premier access for mulan so was it worth its nothing special but a very nicely told story with meaning that were familiar with from the animation movie but with a few alterations brilliant cast especially with the main actress and donnie yen hes a ridiculously fast fighter it does stand out as a different movie to the animation because i do believe if they had added characters that we loved and added songs we remember so well than this movie would of been near perfect to the original animation movie instead it fell kinda flat however its still a very fun movie that should of made its way to cinema
Sep 4 2020,positive,this is a terrific movie to watch and enjoy  so many want this to be a recreation of the animated version but it is a new way to tell the same story  great clean heroic fun  beautiful backdrops and a female hero that everyone will cheer on
Sep 4 2020,positive,beautiful and emotional
Sep 4 2020,positive,awesome  these rats trying to boycott this beautiful movie hahahaha its already succesful guys
Sep 4 2020,positive,for those like allison willmore from the nytvulture who dont understand what honour means because shes not asian or didnt grow up in an asian family they wont know why its repeated many times mulan isnt supposed to be a comedy i think disney did an excellent job at portraying the grittiness of the story while still making it acceptable for kids this isnt a musical the story of mulan isnt mean to be sung by donny osmond or patronized by eddie murphy  those reviewing the movie and trying to compare it to the cartoon have missed the point and the cultural importance of the story
Sep 4 2020,positive,aw the movie made me cry
Sep 4 2020,positive,mulan is a story about a girl becoming a warrior she is a girl with a talent for martial arts but because of the feudal societys way of thinking she has to hide her true self and her talents later she got rid of the shadow of social prejudice making her own decisions mulan represents a new generation who is a girl and a mother in the future she will teach her children in a new way of thinking opening an era that leads girls to confidence and energy dynamic intelligent but no less charming
Sep 4 2020,positive,the girls mulan is so beautiful moved by the feelings of mulan and her family i think she is the most handsome in the battlefield
Sep 4 2020,positive,this one is my favorite movie this year its so amazing to watch it in the cinema and the leading actress liuyifei is fucking beautiful she is a real badass

Sep 4 2020,negative,how can the animated drawings from the original film have so much more heart than the actual human beings in the remake mulan 2020 is absolutely soulless
Sep 4 2020,positive,mulan is the favorite princess filmits very good
Sep 4 2020,positive,the best disney remake so far
Sep 4 2020,positive,it tells a story about a splendid journey about a girl to a warrior about a person who finds true herself
Sep 4 2020,positive,mulan is a hero she brought honor to her family liu yifei is a great actress she brought mulan to life
Sep 4 2020,positive,its a good solid movie from disney mulans fellow soldiers thoughseemed like they cast a bunch of amateur actors as in let me go out into the street and find some guys its beautifully shot and im glad they went into a more serious direction with the film following the original story from the poem i dont think i could have stomached a jokey dopey live action musical it does have fantastical elements though so its not some kind of historical drama one other little thing that kind of bothered memulans parents seemed really old like grandpa and grandma old
Sep 4 2020,positive,new and original story that was based off the animated classic and turned it to its own interpretation for adults who grew who with it to enjoy and staying true to the morals of the message for the younger audiences
Sep 4 2020,positive,great film absolutely will see it again
Sep 4 2020,positive,love yifei as mulan yosan as honghui is also pretty cute her martial arts skills and also the way she conveyed emotions really grabbed my attention the moment of transferring from hua jun to hua mulan is so stunning girl power i wish the movie could be longer because i feel like therere so many stories to be continued mulan and honghui for example
Sep 4 2020,positive,it is a stunning and spectacular film of course in my opinion it could still be better if there were some things from the original that i expected in this film but overall the film is  good and yifei liu as a mulan is perfect 
Sep 4 2020,positive,this movie is so epic the ancient legend of mulan was very different from disneys animated version liu yifei  absolutely amazing on their roles
Sep 4 2020,positive,i really love action scenes it is so beautiful of course the plot also very good when mulan flight with the witch make me screaming by excited i want to watch it in movie form
Sep 4 2020,positive,i especially like this movie although there are many differences between it and cartoons it has different features
Sep 4 2020,positive,an extremely beautiful film

Sep 4 2020,positive,i love this movie very much 
Sep 4 2020,positive,any critic who doesnt like this version is assumed to be paid off by the scorned movie theater industry dont listen to that poison this movie was an instant classic
Sep 4 2020,negative,i dont know what movie the other reviews were watching because it wasnt this one they must have watched the animated version and gotten confused this movie is baaaaaaad and not worth a single dime of your money the story is splotchy and boring the cgi in places is terrible and the lead actress is at best wooden in her performance     if you are going to remove mushu and song you better cast an actress with so much charisma its overflowing if the goal was a more realistic tone by removing mushu cricket and the songs then why all the magic and supernatural fighting    if i were to judge this movie on its own and completely ignore the original it would still fall short just from the lackluster pacing of the story and bad acting     disney just stop with this nonsense if you are going to make a live action from a movie do it from one that failed and you can make better
Sep 4 2020,positive,mulan live action was such an incredible movie experience i was blown away by niki caro new telling of the story of mulan it pays homage to the original animated movie while putting its own take on the legend of mulan the visuals and action scenes all had such beautiful work the script for the movie had some powerful messages that many people will be able to relate to in life stand out performances for me are yifei liu asmulan li gonng as the witch and yoson an as honghui the chemistry between mulan  honghui was so natural and i look forward to see more of it in the sequel if it moves forward mulan is out now on disneyplus with premier access i can not recommend this movie enough the entire cast did an amazing performance and keep an eye out for a special cameo 
Sep 4 2020,positive,it was ok to be honest sure the songs are gone  mushus out but at least it tried to stay more true to the story
Sep 4 2020,positive,this is a very good film and the three qualities of loyalty and honesty are the core of the film throughout liu yifei who plays mulan gives a very nuanced performance and is particularly good at portraying mulans transformation from girl to hero
Sep 4 2020,positive,i loved this film everything was awesome action emotion epic scope
Sep 4 2020,positive,such a wonderful experience watching this movie little sad that didnt get the chance at the moment to see it on big screens  but equally beautiful took me some time to realize the emperors played by jet li lol i love the scenes of matchmakers and the army scenes with all the boys the whole cast has done an amazing job
Sep 4 2020,positive,an amazing movie its different from the original but it works definitely worth watching
Sep 4 2020,positive,better than the original version and the performance really touched me
Sep 4 2020,positive,wonderful piece or art very touching movie showcasing the real value of the family
Sep 4 2020,positive,i cant even tell you how much tears ive shed watching this movie  i think this is the best disney live action adaptation im glad disney isnt making the same mistake with their other live action remakes in trying to make the same movie twice  may mulan be a reflection of todays womenloyal brave and true
Sep 4 2020,positive,liu yifei is the perfect mulan that no one can replace after the credits came out i cried two hours is too short a time for me

Sep 4 2020,positive,mulan live action remake is surely a successful brilliant and most importantly epic movie in this film liu yifei a very stunning actress that beguiles my heart interprets mulan in a perfect way she has her maturity of being a warrior to lead the army protect her family and fight for the kingdom and at the same time remains her inner innocence to love her family and friends many thanks to director niki caro who has bring the most beautiful part of liu and mulan to the audience and thanks to the whole crew to present a superb adaption that not only honors the animation but also digs its own depth of female power liu yifei and mulan shall be every girls role model i love this film truly
Sep 4 2020,positive,i am a huge fan of the original and believe this stands on its own the lead actress is a breath of fresh air completely embodying this largerthanlife role there are fun cameos and great throwbacks to the original and i cant wait to see it again
Sep 4 2020,negative,quite boring to be honest story didnt make much sense either after they changed some of the storyline with the chi and martial arts good actors but story is lame and boring the original cartoon mulan is definitely better
Sep 4 2020,positive,i was outraged when mulan  was moved to disney and im even more outraged now ive seen this stunning cinematic epic film mulan is very beautiful
Sep 4 2020,positive,great movie mulan will be every girls icon loyalty brave and true and devotion to family
Sep 4 2020,positive,i have bought and watched it on disney  the story has a high degree of completion compared to the 1998 animated version of a lot of changes can be seen as a new disney princess film dont worry if you have animation complex many classic scenes and bgm will be reappeared  liu yifeis acting is very good from a young girl after a variety of experiences grow into a soldier the eyes are funny the scene is very atmospheric almost all live action gansu danxia geothermal snow mountain palace and bustling street scene all reflect disneys intentions but veteran actors like gong li donnie yen and jet li remain steady lets see a girl grow up
Sep 4 2020,positive,its amazingyifei liu is good at material artbesides her performance touched me a lotgirls can do anything they wantthey has female power as mulangirls go
Sep 4 2020,positive,mulan is amazing i cried 6 times all the cinemas seats are fully booked today you can imagine how big occasion it is for the weekends liuyifei is a legend she is worthy of love of her audiences i believe girls will follow her
Sep 4 2020,positive,liu yifeis mulan is really amazingi hope to see it again in the cinema later
Sep 4 2020,positive,mulan from a girl to a soldier was originally a girl in an ordinary family and grew into a general the father daughter relationship line inserted in the middle reminds me of the way i get along with my father with empathy naturally there are tears play what dont say handsome fried color is really beautiful
Sep 4 2020,positive,mulan is a hero
Sep 4 2020,positive,it is so good  liu yifei is a brilliant actress  the film is perfect 
Sep 4 2020,positive,a girl became a soldier a soldier became a leader and a leader became a legendyoure gonna love mulan cant wait to see it again
Sep 4 2020,positive,disney used epic as a gimmick and sneered at it only to be slapped in the face and the movie was a shock the fight scenes were so spectacular that for a few moments i felt my kidney hormones surge i took themdisney used epic as a gimmick and sneered at it only to be slapped in the face and the movie was a shock the fight scenes were so spectacular that for a few moments i felt my kidney hormones surge i took themdisney used epic as a gimmick and sneered at it only to be slapped in the face and the movie was a shock the fight scenes were so spectacular that for a few moments i felt my kidney hormones surge i took them
Sep 4 2020,positive,no prince no magic no pretty dress yet she stands for every girl of us
Sep 4 2020,positive,a well made film with complex characters and stunning visuals
Sep 4 2020,positive,visually stunning and not a frame by frame retelling awesome
Sep 4 2020,positive,the visual effects are superb the acting is excellent and its well worth watchingi like this story very muchmulan is very bravei think the little girl will like her very much
Sep 4 2020,positive,my favorite disney liveaction remake so far i like other liveaction remakes as well but this one is particularly special the epic version is without doubt grand and enchanting the martial arts and the tenderness of asian familyfriends really resonate with me
Sep 4 2020,positive,i love the movie very much it is amazing  girls can do anything they want  every girl every woman can achieve their dreams  i am in tears now  i really love it
Sep 4 2020,positive,i love the mulan storyshe really inspires me both 1998 2020thanks disney bring mulan to me  andthe actress is really really really beautiful and done well  liu yifeiim your big fan now
Sep 4 2020,negative,i guess you could say i went in deliberately sabotaging my odds of liking this movie since i had very low expectations coming in but id have loved to have been proven wrong which sadly i wasnt
Sep 4 2020,positive,i am crying    a girl became a soldier  a soldier became a leader  leader became a legend
Sep 4 2020,positive,it is so amazingliu yifei is so damn handsome a girl became a solidera solider became a leader a leader became a legand
Sep 4 2020,positive,the following remarks will not reveal any plot      a little bit beyond my expectation liu yifeis performance was unexpectedly outstanding impressive  this time the action show fully revealed liu yifeis martial arts skills equestrian skills are also very strong the acrobatics are almost always performed in person and the literary and opera are also very delicate in the movie there is no powder or even makeup as she used to appear in front of the public  xianqi has nothing to do with it but it is more real and textured in some shots she seems to be only sixteen or seventeen years old and her state is really great        with a mobile phone you can feel the exquisite picture the color is warm rich and retro the film soundtrack is very beautiful you can hear many elements such as desolation tragic and awakening in addition the erhu adds a lot to this movie and the play is smooth  dazzling  it is neither bloody nor violent and preserves the beauty more the director deletes the singing passage is a very correct choice       in terms of special effects its disney so dont worry at all the avalanche scene is much more shocking than the animated version the scene of mulan riding a black wind in the snow is scary another thing is that the phoenix created by disney is really beautiful  the picture of the phoenix flying over danxia in the wind is very shocking the ancient mythical beasts are presented in front of you so real and the younger brothers and sisters shouted its phoenix  instead of what kind of bird is this this role has a certain degree of freshness and recognition        gong lis fairy lady is my favorite character besides hua mulan the special effects are exquisite and it dazzles from the beginning to the end this is also a character with the most surprise  apart from mulan dad the character who has the deepest connection with him        at present there are a lot of materials that have been exposed the worries of after watching the trailer is the same as watching the movie can be completely dispelled what i have seen so far is only the tip of the iceberg and there are still many highlights and details that have not been released  i like the remake to be exactly the same as the original this time the core has changed from being a soldier for the father to a female power awakening many fresh elements have been added to make the film more adultoriented and worthy of discussion it has jumped out of the ranks of princess films but  some sections still retain disneys characteristics and the remake should be like this not copy so please keep your expectations for this movie        there are imperfections in the movie but considering that the audience has children some fighting scenes are not ruthless enough for me but the problem is not big but the overall rhythm of the movie is still relatively tight and there is no major flaw
Sep 4 2020,negative,cartoon is far better
Sep 4 2020,positive,one of the best live action remakes and the action scenes were on point the director made a great empowering movie loved it
Sep 4 2020,positive,this mulan is instead full of color sights action drama emotion and spectacle all revolving around a young heroine with the bona fides to become a rousing role model for little girls ready to move beyond sleeping beauties little mermaids talking teapots and pumpkins that turn into coaches
Sep 4 2020,positive,this was a truly enjoyable experience its much different from the animated movie as its closer to the legend of mulan but as a mom of two daughters this movie was powerful in the fact that they saw a female warrior defying the odds and without a love interest in the end the cinematography was beautiful i loved hearing the original songs in the background i would have loved to see this in theaters i feel like this movie truly stands on its own love love loved it
Sep 4 2020,positive,the emotion between mulan and her father is really movingi am touched to cry
Sep 4 2020,negative,they tried and they failed waste of time
Sep 4 2020,positive,fantastic cinematography great action and performances the battle and training sequences are visually dazzling the three virtues of loyal brave true is also touching and inspiring
Sep 4 2020,negative,idealistic and unrealistic plotlines hard to relate as an audience will not recommend watching id rather netflix
Sep 4 2020,positive,a good movie with beautiful sceneries and epic actions
Sep 4 2020,negative,the cg was really bad and the whole premise doesnt make sense at all like none of the characters are memorable or even likeable there are scenes that does not make sense at all like the avalanche scene to the ending boss scene nothing make sense and the pacing was weird
Sep 4 2020,positive,i just watched mulan on disney its stunningly beautiful and epic movie my nephew loves the girl mulan and she gives us a blockbuster night
Sep 4 2020,positive,a visually stunning powerful movie based on the legend of mulan the action scenes are exhilarating
Sep 4 2020,negative,horrible film i wont pay a dime
Sep 4 2020,negative,looked interesting enough to watch but my kids got bored and i started to fall asleep seemed like rise of the skywalker mixed with old mulan in they tried to hard to show shades of the old to mix with the new but falls very short plus no songs or mushu save yourself the time and 30
Sep 4 2020,positive,my favorite animated disney movie to date mainly due to the story line which this liveaction stayed true tohad great fighting scenes and i enjoyed all the actors portrayal of each character however it did lack the funnyfeel good emotion
Sep 4 2020,positive,absolutely beautiful disneys best remake by far this is a must see again and again
Sep 4 2020,positive,an epic movie about the growth of a girl very inspiring
Sep 4 2020,negative,honestly not good no character development choppy dialogue i feel like it was written by a bunch of white people who thought that oh this is how chinese people behave and interact based on old stereotypes and generalized out of date cultural references and that the chinese speak in choppy phrases   very unrealistic and not in the shock and awe cinematic way im just so disappointed after all the hype
Sep 4 2020,positive,so beautiful and authentic
Sep 4 2020,positive,quite different from the animated mulan with a few fun nods to some of my favorite scenes from it the addition of the witch character is wonderful and adds a mysterious dimension even a lucky cricket 
Sep 4 2020,negative,damn this movie was so boring and the cgi disney you had 5 months to get at least the cgi right and you didnt even do that do not watch
Sep 4 2020,positive,it was so good and emotional i cried twice in the movie definitely a spectacular masterpiece
Sep 4 2020,positive,a must see empowering and inspirational indeed to young women who have been constrained  to societys expectations of women in general the animated and live version has indeed live up to to showing the virtue of what being true loyal brave and devotion to family really is on two different approaches it is worth the money indeed after all its the same amount of money you pay in theaters watching it on the comforts of home with the perks of watching it over and over again  watch it and see for yourself definitely watched it twice already
Sep 4 2020,positive,i have to say the leading actress who plays mulan did a really great job which makes this movie a remarkable one and forget about mushu and li xiang this is new age guys
Sep 4 2020,positive,a fantastic retelling of the animated classic this film takes on a warranted more serious tone while still capturing the heart and essence of the story we know and love its a visual feast that i could watch over and over again
Sep 4 2020,negative,tedious film a remake of a fantasy that today has become something to watch minutes before bed
Sep 4 2020,negative,the movie is beautifully made many of the performances are solid particularly donnie yen  jason scott lee but ultimately the movie falls a little flat    some people might think its a little unfair to compare this movie to the animated version but since disney is relying on the fans affection for the animated movie to get them to buy this i think its fair to compare and in this comparison this remake falls short    the main issue is with the character mulan in the character in these 2 movies are not the same person in the cartoon mulan was essentially an average girl in the beginning of the movie as the story progresses she trains develops skills  grows and then she uses her newfound skills and ingenuity to defeat the huns in this remake she is special the chosen one at the beginning of the movie but is made to hide her abilities  then as the story progresses chooses to reveal her true self by the end these are 2 completely different character arcs  i find the cartoon mulans more relatable  satisfying    this is just one of the reasons this remake is inferior to the original which still holds up if it were free on disney id say it was worth a watch for the things it does well but its not if being sucked in by nostalgia  are hoping to see a movie as good as the original then youre going disappointed for having laid down 30 to watch this
Sep 4 2020,positive,the movie brought a new version about the legend and the animation of course i missed mushu but the story was fascinating and had amazing action scenes the movie actually surprised me i wasnt expecting to feel goosebumps in the movie but i felt it anyway i must say this is my opinion and i think the movie was amazing if it was to be exactly alike the animation i would have preferred to watch the animation so i think the movie brought a original and different version that made the movie be that great of course i missed so many things that had in the animation but when i was watching it i forgot about it and enjoined it is not just a movie about a woman that decides to be a warrior is much more thats my opinion
Sep 4 2020,negative,completely lacking in chartacter depth and design they are closer to caricatures than characters complete lack of consistency as well they were incredibly lazy with making pivotal scenes make sense both with foresight and in hindsight so sadly the most impactful scenes were the least justified    if you go into it looking for a laugh at the absurdity of the characters and their actions though you might have a good time
Sep 4 2020,positive,it is absolutely stunning with all the fighting scenes and esthetic moving framing the leading actress literally brought the mulan alive again which is also a whole new special character definitely the best blockbuster in 2020
Sep 4 2020,positive,love love loved it mulan is my favourite disney animation and liu yifei is my favourite chinese actress so i was so hyped to watch this and not only did it not disappoint it even exceeded what i hoped for liu yiei smashed it as mulan i knew she would 3 i fell in love with her when i watched her in 2006 with return of the condor heores 2006 series oh i love that story  so i knew she would totally kill any sword fighting scenes and she really did in this  this cast is top notch when you have guys like donnie yen jet li and jason scott lee you know they are gonna smash any action martial arts scenes u ask of them  i love that this movie kept the spirit and heart of the original but was brave enough to be its own thing  so fitting for this story thank you niki caro amazing directing and i love that christina aguilera is back to sing reflection in the credits ahhhhhh and liu yifei sand in the credits too ahhhh  one of my top 10 fav films 
Sep 4 2020,positive,i love seeing mulan and xianniang together haha i think theyre reflecting each other both as women of their choices and beliefs and that really touched me both actresses did good job  the scene design is also fascinating
Sep 4 2020,negative,lack of creativity  nearly irrelevant to the ballad of mulan
Sep 4 2020,positive,it was not a mulan that i hope for but i must said this one surprise me its unique in its own way howeverthere some part that make this movie seems goofy a good remakecould be better but really satisfying
Sep 4 2020,positive,i havent seen the original animated version so this is a brand new one to me yes its beautiful stunning and it does have humor in it it made me laugh and cry several times and its lucky if you could see it on the big screen ill definitely see it again in theater
Sep 4 2020,negative,the original was better in every way
Sep 4 2020,positive,epic and beautiful scene i feel related to the characters and im so moved at the end
Sep 4 2020,negative,just got done watching it andyeah it is pretty obvious that many critics are paid off by disney or simply do not want to look bad towards them becausethisthis is frankly insulting when you watch the original you feel joy thrill fun curiosity you laugh and youre even proud of being witness to such a great story with such great dedication behind it and then you try to compare it to thissoulless blend and downright embarrasing attempt to retell the same story    where to start first of all one of the great joy of the original was the idea that mulan was a normal girl who took it upon herself to honor her family here she always some sort of chi power inside of her that makes her some kind of messiah right off the bat the heart of the original is thrown away for a simple she can do it all kind of protagonist i mean not to spoil anything but the ending is a big fight and she isnt wearing any armor or anythingits ridiculous    if i were to try and give some positives to this obviously the production values are there and all despite the cgi being very hitandmiss butat this point in the game we know disneys productions always have tons of money behind it theyre just always lacking the originality of those originals that made them forever special in everyones heart    another failure by disney
Sep 4 2020,positive,epic version of mulan i got goosebumps when i heard the background music of reflection and how mulan decided to face her true self enjoyed it so much
Sep 4 2020,positive,disneys remake of mulan based on an ancient chinese real story is a refreshing take and direction which for the the most part executes it well while it does has its flaws with some parts a bit predictable i applaud disney for taking a more mature approach to this movie rather than rehashing the animated movie
Sep 4 2020,negative,this movie has nothing to do with the animated movie its not funny interessting characters and the humor is missing it gets one star for the visuals
Sep 4 2020,positive,a great disney movies an awesome standalone from the original cartoon breaking away from the nostalgia routine of creating a shot for shot remake eg lion king
Sep 4 2020,positive,i must admit that i wasnt expecting this to be as good as it was it was quite enjoyable with subtle references to the original however being able it stand its own ground the hardest thing for me and i think any viewer when it comes to remakes is trying to disassociate with the original movie definitely a must see
Sep 4 2020,negative,once again theyve taken what was once a lively musically oriented wonder and turned it into another generic uninspired shlock of a movie added a bunch of side plots that were as dull and predictable as the paper thin writers could make it and to top it all ofi was bored that is the biggest sin you can do to a disney classic that i can imagine as a wise woman once said shame
Sep 4 2020,positive,very epic and beautifully produced love the cast and the production
Sep 4 2020,positive,well mulan is great loved every minute and was totally not expecting to great surprise
Sep 4 2020,positive,very beautiful movie love how the director presents the beauty of ancient china though its quite different from the animated version i like how the liveaction is taking on a different tone but also connects to many core meanings of the story the emotion between mulan and her father was really touching i cried a lot of times i love yifei liu gong li tzi mas performance a lot yoson an and donnie yen are also pretty good
Sep 4 2020,positive,i watched mulan from the cinema i saw myself in this story i cried several times the movie is brilliant im a chinese woman my father also have two daughters when i was young i must do everything they said be like a girl   mulan is so brave to told them the truth the most of time i cant even tell my mom the truth when mulan try to told the general she is a woman that part made me remember when i was try to come out  liu yifei is gorgeous and handsome  i feel so close to her  im in love with mulan  witch  they are my favourite couple  mulan will always be my favourite it is not a typical funny disney movie   to be honest i would like to marry hua jun hua mulan be true to yourself thats the way i want to live
Sep 4 2020,positive,approach taken is very different from the original movie and yet i am falling in love with mulan all over again from a different perspective this movie is excellent at portraying the realities of what women face in the past which still exists till this day selfreflection and selfdiscovery is strongly shown here and has very deep meanings love it
Sep 4 2020,negative,the plot is laughably bad and the director seem unable to grasp the ideologies portraited in the  cartoon  wouldnt be exagerrating to say that this live action version ruined the disney classic
Sep 4 2020,negative,very disappointed the acting of liu is far below standard
Sep 4 2020,negative,worst movie ever in disney history
Sep 4 2020,negative,totally waste my time
Sep 4 2020,positive,i was looking forward to this movie and was bitterly disappointed the acting was good but it lacked that disney heart there were many plot holes weak dialogue and mixed corny cliche moments i love disney but this movie doesnt live up to its predecessor
Sep 4 2020,negative,slow film to get into acting wasnt natural or fluid missing a lot of that disney magic it is afterall a disney film i didnt mind that they left out the music but they didnt add in anything extra that gave it natural flow i feel sorry for niki caro a visionary director but this didnt exceed or meet expectations very disappointing overall unfortunately
Sep 4 2020,negative,thats not the real mulan
Sep 4 2020,negative,this movie felt like it was trying to follow the original 2d animated version while also adding new elements into the overall story but it didnt come together very well in the end it all felt very chaotic the logic didnt make any sense and it was hard to feel anything at all for the characters because of all the ridiculousness happening on screen
Sep 4 2020,negative,has not much to do with disney mulan too much fantasy to be historically realistic like mulan which was released in 2009 too little magic for disney    neither meat nor fish only gci slaughter
Sep 4 2020,positive,just finished watching this movie and absolutely loved it such a shame not to have had the opportunity to see on the big screen but definitely worth watching
Sep 4 2020,negative,not worth watching at all
Sep 4 2020,positive,i loved that they made it true to the old legend story and it was action packed 
Sep 4 2020,positive,one of the best princess movies in history
Sep 4 2020,negative,dont waste money to watch
Sep 4 2020,positive,niki caro brings honour to her pg13 remake of mulan with massively improved characters and fast paced action but sporadic moments of bland storytelling occasionally undermine this adaptation
Sep 4 2020,positive,just finish streaming on disney and i love it so much as a chinese whos also been exposed a lot to western and disney culture i love both how the original animated version and how the liveaction 2020 take in a different way the liveaction 2020 is epic and more feminized in my opinion the action scenes are without doubt spectacular the emotions are also well elaborated mulan and her father mulan and honghui mualn and xianniangi love the way they interact and the meanings behind it all the cast did an amazing job especially the leading actress yifei liu and also gong li i wish disney would also consider rerelease it in theaters and it surely deserves
Sep 4 2020,positive,i feel like there was so much potential but disney didnt really expand on the story the introduction was quite jarring and the transitions between one thing to the next was quite abrupt i also felt that it was quite cheesy as well the action scenes are okay but dont watch it if you like realism its closer to a chinese kung fu movie there are some very unrealistic action sequences which are cool to look at i also feel like there isnt enough characterisation in this film  little background details are given on mulans family mulan herself and especially xian lang since theres little emotional connection between the audience and xian lang it was quite hard to feel much sorrow near the end of this film also it really didnt make sense that she was defeated so easily  she seemed almost invincible before but such a simple thing took her down really and that happened with little fanfare  overall the action is good but the film just doesnt build on its story as much as i wouldve liked it to it had great potential i think the runtime shouldve been longer and more focus shouldve been given to characterisation
Sep 4 2020,positive,this movie paid tribute to the original animated version and the original chinese mulan story i loved how traditional sayings from folk song of the northen dynamics songs of mulan木兰辞 are portrayed in the details of the story line i went to the cinemas with great expectations and they did a tremendous job mulan is just so fearlessly beautiful in the movie
Sep 4 2020,positive,the spectacle was great and the performance of acrobatic fighting was really amazing the downside of the movie was storytelling the acting skill of liu yifei wasnt good enough either it was shown on her facial expression basically its worth checking out disney plus and pay 30
Sep 4 2020,negative,this iteration of mulan was so hamfisted my blood pressure would have recieved less of a spike if id been beaten over the head with an entire honey smoked ham   the actors were brilliant with what they were given which evidently wasnt much
Sep 4 2020,negative,im sorry this movie so boringanimation better than this movie
Sep 4 2020,negative,i dont espect this movieso many cgi in everywhere but story not bad
Sep 4 2020,negative,this movie so awful boredand make a man so weakbut visual its ok
Sep 4 2020,positive,as a young asian american girl mulan gave me hope hope that who i was was enough i have been waiting for a liveaction adaptation for so long it was different from the original but i think this is ok when watching the familiarity of the narrative was enough to give a sense of nostalgia however the story had changed enough so that it felt as if i was watching it again for the first time     i understand there are many political and cultural things to consider and though especially now it is irresponsible to ignore i only suggest that we try our best to take what is good from this     for the first time i saw someone on the screen who looked like my mother my sister despite my issues with the main actress she portrayed mulan the way i had always imagined for me mulan was stern and resolute devoid of unnecessary emotion some would call this stiff but i didnt see it that way for me she was strong and too often women are expected no matter the role to be emotional and soft     i believe in spite of the many issues regarding how it was released the debates concerning cultural and theatrical interpretations and other moralistic and political concerns i believe it is a story that should be shared
Sep 4 2020,negative,worst movie ever wasnt even close at all to the original anime poor casting waste of time
Sep 4 2020,positive,this movie is beautiful i may just be your typical asian millennial who loved mulan as a kid but this adaptation is the right direction for disney liveaction remakes to take the pg13 rating makes the film more grim and realistic and shows you how badass women are and should be portrayed bravo
Sep 4 2020,positive,it was actually much better than i expected the visuals and the storytelling were excellently done this is perhaps the best disney live action theyve ever created it is a must see
Sep 4 2020,positive,some bland reviews  some too critical  but after watching it before my kids right when it released at midnight  im moved and i enjoyed this remake of the disney classic  its meant for a disney audience  so for those nitpicking the performances or story or even judging it as a cultural contortion  ha  and no  its a good movie  its entertainment  its not meant to change the world  it speaks of family  and empowering women  yes there are certain hoops it may not have jumped through or brush strokes painted  but shame on those who put down a genuinely good movie with great performances
Sep 4 2020,negative,acting wasnt that good and it was so lame compared to the original i remember having goosebumps all over when i watched the og one and even tearing up when milan was recognized at the end but this adaptation of the movie felt rushed and lacked a lot of the scenes that made the original so amazing
Sep 4 2020,negative,so many missed opportunities  i liked gong li and the adaptation of that character but where was mulans grandmother fir the comic relief
Sep 4 2020,positive,this movie so wonderful beautiful and it everything i loved it so much
Sep 4 2020,negative,beside the name everything is different from the original one the dragon and so many characters missing
Sep 4 2020,positive,a movie about honor bravery and loyalty very well made
Sep 4 2020,negative,no mushu bad main actress failed
Sep 4 2020,negative,where is cri lee where is mushu without them this is not a disney movie
Sep 4 2020,negative,the actress is bad it does not perform the action nicely she has no expression on face you cannot just show a face without any emotion and pretend it is the soldier character    the color is a bit weird music cannot match some of the scene most importantly there is no mushu how can a mulan movie without mushu call itself mulan
Sep 4 2020,negative,mulan is a visual feast and nothing more its a bland lifeless mess of a film with watered down stakes poor characters no humour and no heart if anything its shown just how masterful the 1998 animation is mulan was just an ordinary girl who went on to do extraordinary things and although disney has proclaimed this to be an empowering film for women  applying the chosen one archetype to the female lead is a funny way of promoting female empowerment if anything its disparaging and disheartening
Sep 4 2020,positive,mulan is one of the best disneys live action films ever the movie is a masterpiece and yifei definitely amazed me she is such a beautiful  talented actress must see
Sep 4 2020,positive,a real female warrior
Sep 4 2020,positive,i actually really enjoyed the movie aside from the beggining the graphics were quite good and the set designers did a great job i found the side characters quite lovable and overall it was a decent movie the beggining part was abit less enjoyable but i found the middle to the end fun  there was an implied love interest which i found abit irrelevant but otherwise a good movie
Sep 4 2020,positive,mulan is so cool and  i have fallen in love with her hopelessly
Sep 4 2020,negative,forced screenplay cliches everywhere if you like mulan then stick to the original animated movie
Sep 4 2020,positive,the newest disney animated classic to get the live action treatment is mulan it has taken me a while to decide if i like this new version of mulan or if i hate it after a few months i have decided that i like this mulan as its own separate story and i dont compare it to the genius animated 1998 film this new version lacks the humour and music that made the animated mulan so memorable but it does have some really great action scenes the performance from liu yifei as mulan was very interesting because she seems like a warrior herself and her stunt work was amazing there is no way that the 2020 mulan can be compared to the 1998 version but if you lower your expectations you might just enjoy this retelling of the disney classic
Sep 4 2020,negative,the original animated movie is much better it also missed the plot art  costume is pretty mulan great feature was her mindbrain with quick adaptations to the situations to cunning plans and ideas all coming together so that she can defeat her enemies but in this movie mulan has always been special since as a little girl she doesnt need the time to earn her strength since shes always had it thus when the scene comes where she starts kicking butts it doesnt feel earned
Sep 4 2020,neutral,just watch the original animated movie
Sep 4 2020,neutral,the movie is an awful representation of its former self feels shallow
Sep 4 2020,positive,great filmamazing action scenes  special effects
Sep 4 2020,negative,no doubt the critic reviews above are either bought by disney or trying to appeal to what they think children and their parents would want to see this movies is bad bad writing bad directing bad acting bad humor bad action bad drama it would be easier to list what was good about it it was sometimes pretty wait till its free then wait till you watched everything else there is to watch on disney plus hulu and netflix then watch this
Sep 4 2020,positive,this is a good movieone of the best remakes  the landscapes are stunning and fighting scenes are terrificthe music is also so beautiful you will enjoy it if you dont compare to the original its not as good as aladdin though
Sep 4 2020,negative,booorrriiinnnggg this movie was utter garbage couldnt think of a better movie to boycott which is what i should have done
Sep 4 2020,positive,its the best disney movie i have ever seen great performance high degree of reduction to the original disney animation and extraordinary visual enjoy you guys dont want to miss this
Sep 4 2020,positive,a very good liveaction remake
Sep 4 2020,positive,its a epic and one of the best live action from disney cant wait to see it soon
Sep 3 2020,positive,i think mulan is the best live action remake i have ever seen
