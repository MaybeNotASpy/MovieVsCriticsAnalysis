"Apr 12, 2024",neutral," As if Godzilla and Kong weren’t enough, director Adam Wingard unleashes a host of others in “Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire” and lets the skyscrapers fall where they may. Kong, you may remember, is dwelling in Hollow Earth; Godzilla is napping at the Colosseum. As long as they’re in separate corners, everything is OK. Godzilla, however, gets up from his nap, stomps around Europe (making even more ruins in Italy and France) and senses there’s a Kong-frontation just waiting to happen. Kong, meanwhile, has an infected tooth and needs help. We know this because Dr. Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall) has a daughter (Kaylee Hottle) who can communicate with him via sign language. To set things straight, Andrews assembles a crew (including a conspiracy theorist and a gonzo veterinarian) and zips to Hollow Earth. Sure enough, Kong has a bad bite and another set of monster adversaries. When a battle hurts his arm, the vet (played by Dan Stevens) cooks up a Kong-sized Infinity Gauntlet glove (trademark pending) and gets the big ape moving. All sorts of creatures (prehistoric and otherwise) start checking in. The goal is to settle them and get to Godzilla. But who first? And when? All of the creatures (including one you’ve heard plenty about but didn’t realize was so literal) cause trouble, sending all parts of the world into turmoil. After they do their urgent care bit, the humans are fairly expendable. Still, they stick around to see what happens and give the girl plenty to translate. While Godzilla makes his way to Kong we start calculating the insurance loss. In addition to ruining ruins in Europe, he levels pyramids in Egypt. Kong isn’t as destructive (he just hangs from buildings) but he does have some nasty adversaries. If it’s Wingard’s goal to spin them off into other features, we’re in trouble. There are so many villains in “Godzilla x Kong” it’s impossible for anyone to divide and conquer. Interestingly, the effects in this film aren’t as good as the ones in the low-budget “Godzilla Minus One.” The monsters look a bit halting. When in doubt, Wingard and company turn up the light. Movie critic Bruce Miller says ""Snack Shack"" is Profane, constantly in motion and very retro. It’s the vacation you didn’t think you needed but sure were glad you took."
"Apr 12, 2024",negative," I can’t say I’ve ever had to review a film and I didn’t know how to pronounce its title. I’m of course talking about the sequel to 2021’s Godzilla Vs Kong, which is confusingly titled Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire.  Are we saying Godzilla EX Kong? Godzilla TIMES Kong? Godzilla AND Kong? Just Godzilla Kong? Or are we just awkwardly trying to avoid saying the name of the film, vaguely speaking of the new Godzilla film and waiting for someone else to make a mistake with the title?  Thankfully, the film itself is much more straightforward than its title. Adam Wingard has returned to helm the sequel to his box office success Godzilla Vs Kong, which saw the titular monsters make peace with each other and team up against an unlikely threat at the end.  We return to Hollow Earth – that’s the subterranean ecosystem that’s underneath our surface – where Kong rules. However, a new threat rises from an even deeper level of the Earth’s core and this time, Kong isn’t strong enough to defeat it on his own.  Enter Godzilla, who’s been peacefully snoozing in the ruins of the Colosseum and who only awakens to fight more Titans as they threaten humanity. Can Kong and Godzilla put their differences aside once more to defeat this new threat?  Without giving anything away, Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire would make a strangely good double-bill with Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire, both being about empires and icy threats.  Mileage will inevitably vary when it comes to Godzilla X Kong. Your opinion on the film probably depends on what you’re expecting from a film about two ginormous CGI creatures wreaking havoc while puny humans run around like headless chickens, delivering exposition where needed.  Once again, the humans are the weakest part of the film. There’s admirable effort from writers Terry Rossio, Simon Barrett and Jeremy Slater to improve the mandatory human subplots by having Jia, the last member of the Iwi tribe and Irene Andrews’ adopted daughter question her place in the world. But let’s be real, we’re not paying to watch the humans grapple with their identities or family ties. We pay to watch Kong and Godzilla wreak havoc.  There is some mayhem in Godzilla X Kong, but not nearly enough. The very beginning, in which Kong is established as an unstoppable force and the true king of Hollow Earth, suggests that we may be in for a satisfyingly gloopy, gooey film in which many a monster is ripped in half. This promise is never fulfilled; Godzilla X Kong disappointingly proves to be a one-trick pony (albeit a very big pony).  If the film was released a year ago, I may have enjoyed it a whole lot more. The final nail in Godzilla X Kong’s coffin is the fact that we’ve had an incredible Godzilla film just a few months ago. Godzilla Minus One proved that you can make a great kaiju movie with a balanced human element and great (not to mention Oscar-winning) visual effects. If anything, Godzilla X Kong seems to lean more heavily towards the emotive Kong, and perhaps it would have worked better as a sequel to Kong: Skull Island.  It’s not all bad, though. The CGI is surprisingly good, and Dan Stevens, playing the world’s weirdest vet and occasional ape dentist, is having the time of his life. Brian Tyree Henry, reprising his role as conspiracy theorist Bernie Hayes, also adds a lot of levity in a film that seems to think it’s funnier than it really is. With Godzilla X Kong, Wingard is aiming for a lighter, more entertaining film than its predecessor, but the film is ultimately brought down by cringey dialogue and unnecessary human baggage.  Warner Bros is said to be examining its 2024 slate - which includes Beetlejuice 2 - and considering delays as the actors' strike continues.

"Apr 12, 2024",positive,"This is a massive Saturday morning cartoon, featuring big monster battles, exciting team-ups, and plenty of epic moments. That being said, the plot lacks cohesion, and most of the main human subplot is messy. "
"Apr 11, 2024",positive," On this episode, Kevin Lee from AwardsWatch joins JD and Brendan to discuss the latest in the MonsterVerse franchise with Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire! All of these films are varying forms of diverting thrill while being narratively very messy, and this one doesn’t do much to sway away from that formula. However, we do have a lot of fun talking about what makes it different, even if much of it is the same."
"Apr 11, 2024",positive,"While the story hides the crux of the plot for more than half the story, there’s still enough carnage to maintain excitement even if we don’t know the point."
"Apr 10, 2024",negative," Last time we encountered King Kong and Godzilla (or Hollywood's lesser version of him, anyway), in the self-explanatory Godzilla vs Kong, they ended up putting aside their differences to defeat Mechagodzilla in a brawl that laid waste to half of Hong Kong. In Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire — which somehow skips over ""Godzilla 4 Kong: The Honeymoon Years"" — their relationship has evolved into a precarious détente. The great ape has made a home for himself monkeying around in Hollow Earth, the mythical fantasy world beneath the planet's crust, while the radioactive reptile remains on the surface, helping ward off beastly threats to an otherwise ungrateful humanity. (To be fair, he is accidentally stomping their major tourist destinations.) As always, poor Godzilla is just misunderstood. When he curls up like a kitten for a nap in the Colosseum after a hard day's fight, he has our hearts in his clammy little claws. The same can't be said for the movie's returning human characters, who are once again tasked with delivering thankless exposition and feeble stabs at comedy. Rebecca Hall is back, sporting a chic new 'do and grim new expression as Kong expert Dr Ilene Andrews, as is Kaylee Hottle as the doctor's adopted daughter Jia, a hearing-impaired Skull Island native with a psychic connection to the big gorilla. Also collecting another pay cheque is Brian Tyree Henry, who's saddled with the movie's most impossible task: making a podcaster funny. Responding to a distress signal from deep within Hollow Earth, the team are joined by Dan Stevens's Trapper, a monster vet in a douchey Hawaiian shirt who the movie introduces like he's the second coming of Snake Plissken. Back beneath the earth's crust, Kong clashes with a hostile army of apes led by the villainous Skar King, an aggrieved simian with questionable grooming habits, a whip made of dinosaur bones, and an ancient vendetta against Godzilla. He also keeps a pet radioactive kaiju — that'd be Shimu, if you're playing titan bingo — chained up and ready to rumble. Kong won't be alone for long. Godzilla has soon picked up the scent of a skirmish, and the intrepid humans discover an ancient civilisation of old-timey tribal tropes — led by Fala Chen's Iwi Queen — who worship the series' most iconic diva, Mothra. (Alas, nobody shouts ""Mothra is mothering!"", which seems like a missed opportunity.) Godzilla vs Kong was something of a surprise smash during a respite from lockdown in 2021, when the prospect of seeing epic monsters square off on the big screen seemed like the perfect balm after months of house arrest. But the sequel arrives after years of the usual mirthless Hollywood spectacles, which promise mindless fun but lack the imagination to fire up the senses. (It doesn't help that the great, Oscar-winning Godzilla Minus One, while obviously very different in tone, is so fresh in our memories.) Directed, like its predecessor, by American genre filmmaker Adam Wingard (You're Next; The Guest), Godzilla x Kong is a blur of noise and colour that does have its moments of charm. Kong's grunting and growling smackdown with the Skar King, set against a smouldering subterranean landscape, feels like a wrestling match waged between ancient gods. And his table manners, or lack thereof — snacking on a serpent's neck as though it were a sushi roll — continue to be a nice running gag. As in the previous movie, the netherworld of Hollow Earth casts a shimmering, multi-coloured spell, giving the impression of being trapped inside a magic crystal or a stoner's panel van, circa 1977. Less impressive is Wingard's reliance on an aesthetic schtick that felt played out five years ago: oodles of lazy neon, a synth score, and the sort of FM radio needle drops that even the Guardians of the Galaxy or Thor might think twice about using (nobody needs to be exposed to KISS in 2024). Godzilla x Kong shouts fun — splashes it across the screen with every tool in its digital paintbox. Still, for a movie that features Kong and Godzilla going up against a super-ape riding a radioactive dinosaur, it's surprisingly dull; devoid of much in the way of wonder, soul, or the genuinely strange. By the time the monster tag teams are soaring toward each other in embarrassing slow motion, even two giants of the cinema have been reduced to something as common — as lacking in invention — as Marvel superhero spectacle. With all respect to the talented visual effects team, who are only operating according to their brief, I spent most of the movie wondering how easy it may soon be to re-create all this generic commotion in Open AI generative video, with a few text prompts and a general knowledge of monster lore. At what point will it merely be easier, and cheaper, for studios to farm out this kind of product to anonymous AI servers — or even let audiences create their own versions? When big-screen spectacle becomes lacklustre, can viewers be blamed for not knowing the difference between AI and the real deal? Godzilla x Kong isn't exactly the death knell of the blockbuster — and it's unfair to ask that a simple story of friendship between a nuclear lizard and a 50-foot ape bear the brunt of cinema's woes. But it might be a sign that Hollywood needs to watch out, lest it become the next extinct species.

"Apr 10, 2024",negative," Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire is the fifth film in Warner Bros’ MonsterVerse, the inexplicably popular franchise involving cinema’s two biggest beasts. This latest episode has already been a hit, but like it’s predecessors it’s mostly forgettable.  Returning to Hollow Earth, the underground dimension from the last film, Kong and Godzilla must team up to stop a new tribe of giant apes and a titan from wreaking havoc on the surface world.  That’s about as much plot as the script allows, spending the first act shovelling exposition until they are allowed to give the screen over to a colourful monster mash. The action is entertaining, and the effects are impressive, but that’s all the film has to offer. The beleaguered human cast are wasted looking up at their CGI castmates, with Rebecca Hall’s titan expert explaining every step, while a returning Brian Tyree Henry cracks jokes along with newbie Dan Stevens.  In some ways, would be ridiculous to expect anything more. The American takes on Godzilla have always traded on action over subtext, and previous film Godzilla Vs Kong was a crowd pleaser that overcame a shallow plot with huge beasts tearing it up in a neon city. There’s nothing wrong with mindless spectacle, but after five movies it’s beginning to repeat itself. Director Adam Wingard, who broke through with 2014 thriller The Guest, delivers a trailer friendly product that makes a lot of noise but leaves no impression.  It doesn’t help that Godzilla X Kong arrives just a few months after Godzilla Minus One, the latest Japanese Godzilla that reminded audiences of just how powerful these movies can be. By comparison, these low IQ American cousins offer little more than Hollywood spectacle. "
"Apr 10, 2024",negative," There will be many comparisons in the next day or three between Godzilla Minus One, Takashi Yamazaki’s shockingly beautiful and elegiac epic about a giant lizard triggering nationwide trauma for a country in ruins, and Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, the newest monster smash up between the Big G and the Ape from Skull Island. But right at the top, every reader should recognize this is a fruitless exercise; a contrast as meaningful as pondering the differences between a genuine Oscar winner and a Saturday morning cartoon. For make no mistake, Godzilla x Kong is a cartoon. I’m told the film technically qualifies as live action, too, because Rebecca Hall, Brian Tyree Henry, and Dan Stevens appear in front of some blue screens (and presumably to pick up hefty paychecks for their troubles). But I still don’t entirely believe it. Flesh and blood actors might float by to spout exposition, but the space they occupy is as real as Bob Hoskins’ foray into Toontown, and a fraction as interesting. Of course the cartoon label could apply to almost every MonsterVerse film we’ve had to date, yet The New Empire holds the unenviable distinction of being the first where for large swaths of the running time, the monsters are as dull as the humans they step over. Chief among those time-filling ants is Rebecca Hall’s Dr. Irene Andrews, who returns from 2021’s equally dumb but much more kinetic Godzilla vs. Kong. If you don’t recall, she is the Kong expert who has also become the adoptive mother of Jia (Kaylee Hottle), the tween girl who is the lone survivor of the Iwi Tribe from the now desolated Skull Island. And because Jia is starting to have nightmarish visions, our double-credentialed and world renowned Monarch scientist is turning for help to… a conspiracy theory podcaster? Yeah, even the movie doesn’t really know how to explain it, but it at least gets Brian Tyree Henry back for another go-round, which is never a bad thing. Together, Irene and Henry’s Bernie convince Monarch to send a team of scientists down into the Hollow Earth where Kong lives as king. Alas, though, it’s a lonely rule since his only friends wear lab coats. The heroes also take along a veterinarian (Dan Stevens) so the proper banter quota can be met. Yet as they look down there for answers to Jia’s visions—and around the same time that Kong discovers a new race of giant apes living beneath the surface of the Earth—Godzilla is forced to shoehorn his sizable frame into the movie by causing a ruckus topside. First he inexplicably starts curling up like a kitten inside the Roman Colosseum, and then he wakes up cranky and in need of a nuclear power plant pick-me-up. It seems the Big G also senses something bad is coming and wants to get juiced for the rumble. The MonsterVerse movies have always been a mixed bag. While the aforementioned Saturday morning cartoon aesthetic has frequently tickled this reviewer’s nostalgia buttons, it is impossible to ignore the intentional simplicity (to use a diplomatic term) in movies like Kong: Skull Island or Godzilla: King of the Monsters. When director Adam Wingard took over the reins in 2021’s Godzilla vs. Kong, he removed all pretense. The human characters’ scenes were cut to the bone and relied on stereotypes of stereotypes. But the monsters? They rarely appeared giddier, with Wingard replicating the crash-your-action-figures-together glee of late Shōwa era Kaiju movies from the Toho Studios of the 1970s—only with a 21st century Hollywood budget. Watching Godzilla and King Kong throw fisticuffs at each other about every 30 minutes was a 12-year-old’s dream, but now with the flair of a visual stylist who bathed the spectacle in chic neon pinks or yellows, and clean shots that took advantage of zero gravity environments in the Hollow Earth. Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire attempts to replicate all those flourishes and tricks, right down to Godzilla even providing the hot neon pink in rustic settings like the Pyramids of Giza (his fins get a Barbieland glow up). The problem, however, is that we have to wait a long time for that Godzilla and Kong action. Despite the film being a fleet 115 minutes, Godzilla x Kong drags where Godzilla vs. Kong skipped into its happy haymakers. The earlier film was a glorified fight night spectacle which saw the title characters get into a donnybrook at least once per act. By contrast, Godzilla x Kong keeps them apart and instead focuses far too much on limp comedy beats delivered by actors working from the worst script in the MonsterVerse saga (which is saying something), and Kong also befriending a proverbial Son of Kong as he battles another giant ape called “the Scar King.” While we appreciate the allusions to both the mostly forgotten Merian C. Cooper 1933 quickie sequel to King Kong, as well as Toho’s own Son of Godzilla (1967), the tsunami’s worth of CGI in Godzilla x Kong lacks the charm of Willis O’Brien’s 1930s stop-motion or the goofiness of a kid in a rubber suit. When used right, digital effects can awe and overwhelm, but they rarely ever endear or beguile. And all the money spent on Godzilla x Kong’s Hollow Earth giant apes sequences prove as inert and lifeless as the drama between Hall and Stevens doing their damndest with nothing. One of the only thrilling sequences in Godzilla x Kong is the Row by the Nile where Godzilla, Kong, and a mysterious third party we cannot spoil get in a tussle with the Great Pyramid of Khufu as their squared circle. It’s daffy, devastating to world history, and a return to the jejune appeal of Godzilla vs. Kong and many Toho classics. It is also literally Godzilla vs. Kong Redux. Similarly, there is then an immediate follow-up final Battle Royale at the Center of the Earth with more creatures duking it out than a Super Smash Bros. online free for all. After 90 minutes of being lulled into a stupor, the climax makes for an extremely expensive alarm buzzer. For those looking purely for that monster mash high, this over-caffeinated climax might scratch an itch, but when you need just as much caffeine to stay awake up until that point, it feels like the fight is already lost. Whether it’s Godzilla, Kong, the Scar King, or Mystery Monster X, there are no winners here—and certainly not in the audience."
"Apr 9, 2024",negative,"The script, there is a plot but it's preposterous tosh and it makes no sense, and it doesn't even try to make sense... Stuff. Stuff. Stuff. ROAR. "
"Apr 9, 2024",positive," In honor of Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, the two titans of RIOTUS are teaming together like the big fellas at the center of the movie for a joint-review of the new MonsterVerse entry. Julian Lytle: After a banner 70th anniversary year for the King of Monsters Godzilla, with the Apple TV+ series Monarch and then the Academy award-winning Godzilla: Minus One, it’s a great time to be into Godzilla. We’re also at the ten-year mark for the Legendary MonsterVerse films. With Adam Wingard returning after the successful Godzilla vs. Kong, we now have them in a team-up movie. I guess the most surprising thing about going to see Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is, did you really expect the MonsterVerse to make it this far and do you feel like this is a good entry into this franchise? William Goodman: It’s kind of funny to me that the DCEU and the MonsterVerse launched within a year of one another, yet the latter is a far more successful and coherent extended universe. Sometimes, it pays to keep it simple. This new installment is a good entry into the kaiju genre, mostly because Wingard has a good sense of what people want to see: giant monsters fighting one another. That’s not to say there aren’t things to quibble about in terms of pacing or structure, but Godzilla Minus One and these MonsterVerse films are not. I think it’s wonderful that this film can exist alongside that one and that you can have a bit of a choice of your own adventure when it comes to tales of the King of the Monsters. Should we explain the plot of this one a little bit? JL: So after the events of Godzilla vs. Kong, we have a split in how the territory of the world is split up by the two. Godzilla runs the surface (OR ELSE!), and Kong is now exploring the Hollow Earth set up in the last film as he tries to look for other Giant Apes. Something is causing trouble, leading to more Titan attacks that Godzilla must deal with, as well as some weird readings Monarch is noticing along with Jia (Kaylee Hottle), the Iwe tribe girl who was introduced in the last movie as Kong’s friend. Her adopted mother, Dr. Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall), and Monarch Scientist in charge of Kong decided to go down to Hollow Earth, bringing back Titan conspiracy theorist podcaster Bernie Hayes (Brian Tyree Henry) from the last movie as well. This leads to three different journeys to dealing with a new secret threat from the past of the planet, the Titans, and Godzilla’s place in all of it. For me, all of this was pretty easy to follow, but I do know that for many, the plot lines about the human characters are a drag. Do you feel that the plot of Jia and Ilene (and, in turn, all of Monarch) hurts or helps the film? WG: I do think the weakest portion of the MonsterVerse movies are the human characters. Wingard hit on something in the last film, though: Rebecca Hall. I think Hall is one of our most underappreciated performers, and she always brings believability to reach role she takes while also elevating the material accordingly. She’s saddled with whole scenes that are nothing but expository dialogue and makes them feel effortless, while also selling the paternal relationship with Jia.  The human element gets a boost this time around, though, thanks to Trapper (Dan Stevens, reuniting with Wingard from The Guest, a wall-to-wall banger). Stevens is having an absolute blast here playing — and I shit you not — Kong’s veterinarian. He’s introduced by flying in on a giant orbital platform to yank a rotten tooth from the ape.  While I still think the human characters often feel like set dressing or a secondary thought, Wingard is doing his best to provide them with as much engaging material as possible. It also helps that Stevens, Hall, Henry, and Hottle are the only human leads; streamlining the cast down from the last film does give these plots a bit more weight that other MonsterVerse films haven’t quite had.  While it is all easy to follow, it is all a little nonsensical at times. I did feel the setup to get Kong and Godzilla was a little more forced this time around. What about you? How do you feel the big guns fare this time? JL: While I’m a big supporter of the human parts of these movies because of my lifelong fandom of Godzilla films and seeing them all multiple times, it’s how they handle the Titans, which, while I enjoy, is showing cracks in the MonsterVerse overall narrative. These folks want to make another Kong movie, but Kong, or as he continues in this film from the last – Kong McClane will never be as big of a draw as Godzilla. Kong has the heroic journey and arc, and for most of it, you can see the influence of the modern Planet of the Apes film on this version of Kong. His life in the Hollow Earth is explored from his making of traps to deal with threats, his daily life of taking showers and even having to go to the dentist.  Kong’s journey with Jia’s story as a companion piece to push along the story is a lot of fun to watch. Yet then we get to Godzilla, who’s used like how Batman and Wolverine were in the 90s crossover superhero comics. He’s seasoning at best. Godzilla knows everything, and he knows what’s going on even as others don’t, and it doesn’t change how he operates in the world. His little segments are more or less getting his power up to destroy the final threat that actually to Godzilla isn’t a threat at all. It’s Tuesday, a late-day meeting at work; it’s just an annoyance. Yet Godzilla looked amazing in this movie. After the film, we chatted briefly about the effects and animation of this movie and just how consistent they are with this franchise. What stood out to you on how it looks cinematically? WG: Wingard’s style is pretty dynamic by nature, so the camera is fluid with its movements. Our screening was in IMAX, and the film definitely takes advantage of the format in a satisfying way. I think some of the visual effects lose their luster when rendered against the human characters but Kong and Godzilla look the best they ever have. Shoutout to the motion capture performers behind them, especially Kong, who do such an incredible job of making each monster feel life-like. Your point about Kong McClane is so fitting; he’s a grizzled old vet at this point, and the performance conveys that accordingly.  The film is also awash in plenty of vibrant hues, from Hollow Earth’s interiors to Godzilla’s magenta glow once he goes Super Syain Rose. We rightfully knock some modern-day blockbusters for looking bland or boring, but that’s hardly the case here.  Any other closing thoughts here? I think we’re big fans of how fun this feels, even with some issues with the plot. I’m a big fan of the genre for its simplicity; what you want is what you get, and New Empire absolutely delivers in this regard.  JL: Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is a movie made for me. It was enjoyable and worked well as a big-scale movie theater experience. It works on cartoon-style levels of power-ups and mech armor and tag team battles all over the world. Yet I feel it’s great that we have these different choices and styles for tokusatsu filmmaking. You can have a deeply emotional real-world event-responding film like Minus One, and you can have the Showa and Millennium eras influenced Godzilla movie that also does right by the history of King Kong. I hope others just give themselves a chance to enjoy themselves and accept it for what it’s trying to be. We have cool air vehicles and a giant orangutan doing ape capoeira while using a whip made from a spine. It feels like Godzilla fights something new every 20 minutes. We are living in good toku times William, and I’m just basking in it."
"Apr 8, 2024",positive,"If you saw Godzilla vs. Kong, you probably have a good idea of what to expect from this one: a silly, over-the-top kaiju with one hell of a battle at the end."
"Apr 8, 2024",negative," The latest blockbuster of 2024 is this disappointing fifth entry in the so-called MonsterVerse franchise, owned by Legendary Pictures. About half of the film contain actors, while half of it is computer-generated – the likely brief future of cinema before AI takes over completely. In the battle for credibility between monsters and actors, the actors here come off decidedly worse."
"Apr 8, 2024",positive," I for one have thoroughly enjoyed Legendary’s MonsterVerse movie franchise. “Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire” makes for the fifth film in the shared universe which dates all the way back to 2014 and Gareth Edwards’ terrific “Godzilla”. It’s considered the 38th film of the entire Godzilla franchise and the 13th King Kong feature. It sees the return of director Adam Wingard who helmed the previous installment, 2021’s “Godzilla vs. Kong”. Initial reactions to this newest entry have been interesting. While early box office numbers have been impressive, the critics responses have been mixed. One reason is because some have unfortunately and unfairly pitted it against last year’s exceptional and more serious-minded “Godzilla: Minus One”. If anything the long-running Godzilla franchise has proven that you can do a lot of different things with the titular characters. Wingard understands that and sticks with his wild ‘Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em Kaiju’ formula. I’m glad he did. After defeating Mechagodzilla in the last movie, Kong has descended back down to Hollow Earth – the vast world below our planet’s surface where he carries on his search for his ancestors. Meanwhile on the surface, Godzilla continues his fight against the Titans who frequently spring up and cause trouble. As the last film established, Godzilla and Kong don’t like each other. But as long as they stay out of each other’s territory there should be nothing to worry about…right? Back at Monarch, the well-funded secret organization that specializes in the monitoring Titan activity, Dr. Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall) has been elevated to Head of Kong Research. She and her team keep an eye on Kong while others within the vast Monarch follow Godzilla around the globe trying to predict his next moves. At home, Irene’s young adopted daughter Jia (Kaylee Hottle) remains the last surviving member of Skull Island’s Iwi tribe who has a special connection to Kong. She’s suddenly stricken with traumatic visions triggered by an unidentified signal emanating from Hollow Earth. Irene seeks the help of Titan enthusiast and podcaster Bernie Hayes (a returning Brian Tyree Henry) and Titan veterinarian Trapper (Dan Stevens) who accompany her to Hollow Earth where Kong has discovered an uncharted region full of secrets. Meanwhile the mysterious signal stirs up Godzilla who begins preparing for a potential new and terrifying threat. As you can probably guess, it’s all working toward a Titan-sized clash which Wingard and his digital effects team have a blast setting up and executing. The CGI-heavy visuals are pretty spectacular and often help to energize the movie. This proves to be important, especially as the heavy doses of mythology begin to wear a little thin. Admittedly, it’s impossible to deny the silliness of it all. At the same time, that very same silliness is a big part of what makes the movie fun. And Wingard’s snappy pacing makes sure you’re not dwelling on too much for too long. Of course the bread and butter of “The New Empire” is the Titan throwdowns and we get some really good ones. Fans will relish the massive, destruction-driven battles, the film’s playful self-awareness, and the classic monster movie feel. Wingard and his trio of writers (Terry Rossio, Simon Barrett, and Jeremy Slater) make no bones about the movie they’re making. It’s pure popcorn entertainment and throwback escapism. If you didn’t like the previous MonsterVerse entry I’m not sure you’ll go for this one. Me? I’m already excited for the next installment. “Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire” is in theaters now. I do think it possible the release of Godzilla Minus One has reset some hopes and expectations a bit for what a Godzilla movie could and should be going forward, even if it is a standalone film and not part of the MonsterVerse series. Minus One may very well have been the best movie I saw from last year, but my wife and I were careful not to let that color our thoughts on this film. That being said, we did not enjoy this one at all – I think it was that silliness you alluded to which we could not push past. Glad you enjoyed it. We’ll be interested to see where this series takes us next. That’s actually what I like most about the Godzilla franchise…it’s ability to go into all directions – from super-serious (“Minus One”) to more lighthearted (this one). I rewatched the previous film before going in so it put me back into its sphere which made a difference.  My expectations were low because frankly I haven’t enjoyed these movies since the 2014 Godzilla. That said, I had loads of fun. Kong using baby kong as nunchucks, Godzilla doing a suplex. Pure popcorn entertainment, as you say, and nails the Saturday morning cartoon vibe. Also, there’s a sizable “silent movie” stretch where it’s just the monsters, non-verbal, fighting and roaring at each other. It kinda took my breath away. I’m glad to see someone finally praising this movie and having the ability to explain why. I’ve not cared for the Monarch story in the movies or the Apple TV show, but I’ve enjoyed them because I enjoy the monsters and fights. I still haven’t seen minus one so I’ll have to make that happen since it sounds more like what I enjoy these beasts being.  I (as you can tell) had a really good time with this one. It is exactly what it sets to be. Looking forward to seeing it one more time before it leaves the big screen."
"Apr 7, 2024",positive," Some films are just “critic-proof.” We critics have to sit down and try to come up with an in-depth review looking at the film’s cinematic excellence. Certain films make this a challenge. In reality, most people don’t care.  These movies have other priorities.  They are simply meant to be enjoyed. As an audience, we know what we expect from Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire. The question is, does it deliver? Does the new monster picture bring the “rock ’em, sock ’em” goodness we all deserve? Or do the monsters play second fiddle to the humans? Read on!  Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire follows the continuing story of Monarch and the mysterious monsters of yore. More specifically, Godzilla and King Kong. The world is finally in a good place… ish. Kong lives on Hollow Earth. Meanwhile, Godzilla is up on the surface world. As long as these two never meet, things should be dandy. However, life is thrown into chaos when Godzilla picks up on a mysterious SOS signal. Who’s trying to invade the surface world? Will either Titan be able to handle the threat on their own? Rebecca Hall, Brian Tyree Henry, Dan Stevens, and Kaylee Hottle co-star in the movie. Adam Wingard directs Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire from a script by Terry Rossio, Simon Barrett, and Jeremy Slater.  There’s one question on the tip of everyone’s tongue when a movie like this comes out. We don’t go see these for the humans. It’s the monster battles we’re there to revel in, we know this. This has been somewhat of a struggle in certain franchise entries. When this one really steps up to the plate to let Kong and Godzilla do their thing, it is an awful lot of fun. This is perhaps most true in the film’s second half. Landmarks are destroyed, cities are flattened and there’s no grounding in reality. While it never feels like enough, this installment takes another step toward embracing what this action should feel like. This is Transformers for the monster scene. We need pummeling action. We deserve pummeling action. In the grand scheme of things, the film probably takes a bit too long to get to the true good stuff. While the fight scenes are big, loud, and radioactive, sometimes there’s an awful lot of time between them. As mentioned, this is particularly true in the first act and a half. As soon as the story reaches its mid-point, there’s plenty of Godzilla x Kong action to go around. They just take a bit of time to meet up.  That leads to the next most important question… the visuals. Obviously, Godzilla won’t come trotting out of his trailer at this juncture. Large portions of this film are being created deep inside a computer. Unfortunately, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is not visually ground-breaking. An Imax screening yielded some grainy moments during some of the most intricate shots as well as some clumsy attempts to integrate humans into the monstrous action. While nothing is offensively bad, the moments did sometimes stand out.  It has been often said that humans really aren’t needed in these films. Oftentimes, they are merely a distraction from the action. However, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire gifts us with something we really didn’t know we needed in 2024: Dan Stevens and Brian Tyree Henry. Get these two actors into a buddy comedy… stat. Stevens and Tyree Henry find an easy and entertaining chemistry that lights up the screen when we’re forced to watch the humans. Both look to be having a blast and it’s worthy of a call-out. Dan Stevens has entered his Matthew McConaughey era, and this critic is here for it. Meanwhile, Tyree Henry keeps going with the goodness he started in the last film. Lots more of these two, please.  Outside of Stevens and Henry, Rebecca Hall is her usual fabulous self. While she’s always a delight to watch, she’s saddled with some of the film’s most awkward script moments. Many of these revolve around that age-old cinematic conundrum, the exposition dump. Two moments stand out… one of which stops the movie cold (albeit, briefly) while the other is so convenient it’s almost silly. No spoilers! At the same time though, she’s also the film’s heart, its emotional center, and we love that for her. She’s Rebecca Hall. She can do it all.  When all is said and done, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire comes into theaters this week with one purpose, giving audiences fabulous, monster-fueled battles. While there probably aren’t as many as there could be (and they do take some time to get there!), what the movie does give us is big, loud, and fun. Watch it on the biggest screen you can get and make sure to buy some popcorn. This critic-proof film was exactly what it needed to be, a heck of a lot of fun.  A film nerd from my earliest years watching Abbott and Costello, that eventually translated to a Master’s Degree in Film History. I spend my time working on my fiction projects in all their forms, as well as covering film and television."

"Apr 6, 2024",neutral,Okay special effects but the actors are wasted in a run of the mill plot. Still for the die hards this is a feast.
"Apr 5, 2024",neutral," Recently, he won his first Academy Award for a career-high performance (as a visual effect) in the single best motion picture of his long, radioactively hot career, “Godzilla Minus One.” In Adam Wingard’s “Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,” the beast with fiery halitosis reverts to the quasi-heroic, less fearsome persona of the visually engaging, yet problematic “Godzilla vs. King Kong” (2021), also directed by Wingard. “X” also suffers from continuity challenges, such as Godzilla waking up from a nap inside the Roman Colosseum, knocking it down as he exits. Later, the Colosseum has been magically restored to its earlier state of natural deterioration. (Wingard’s cat curled up in a cat bed inspired him and production designer Tom Hammock to put this in the movie.) Concentrating on sheer action, “X” stages more than a simple rematch of Godzilla with his hair-ied co-star, originally paired in the cheesy “King Kong vs. Godzilla” (a 1963 USA release). The two towering titans reluctantly join forces to save the surface Earth from a powerful enemy, a brutal Hollow Earth ape boss called the Skar King. (Wingard states in the production notes: “He’s the quintessential evil dictator, and civilizations around the world and throughout history have their version of an evil dictator.” Should we read anything into Skar King’s fur being bright orange?) Dr. Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall), working for a monster research group called Monarch, returns here with her adopted daughter Jia (reprised by an adorable Kaylee Hottle), a deaf orphan found on Kong’s home turf, Skull Island. Also returning, Bernie Hayes, a comedy relief know-it-all conspiracy theory buff reprised by a game Brian Tyree Henry. Inexplicably, Andrews chooses him to be her main adviser and sidekick, but three screenwriters carefully sidestep a prime opportunity to comment on the role conspiracy theorists play in current politics. British actor Dan Stevens joins the cast as Trapper, an amiable, all-purpose, cocky good guy who likes to go into action while playing pop songs. He knows more than an omniscient voice-over narrator. He can fly helicopters, pull and replace a large, infected ape tooth and serve as a human Google search on any topic necessary to propel the plot. An older, wiser and lonelier Kong sports a graying beard and sad eyes as a middle-aged monster whose new cyborg-like metal hand can deflect Godzilla fire like Wonder Woman’s bracelets. A cute, bratty Hollow Earth kid gorilla called Suko comes into Kong’s lonely life. Suko resembles a cheap, less-detailed animated character from a 1990s video game stuck in the “uncanny valley” between cartoons and his more photorealistic co-stars. If some of the gargantuan gladiator battles look suspiciously like professional wrestlers at work, that would be a nod to RKO’s original 1933 “King Kong.” Directors Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack both worked as professional wrestlers and used their experiences to stage the classic stop-motion battle between a giant gorilla and a Tyrannosaurus rex. The 13th King Kong movie, “X” is also the 38th Godzilla feature, an odd mix of fantasy, action and nonsense, capped by a head-scratching choice of songs, Badfinger’s “Day After Day.”"
"Apr 5, 2024",positive," There are sequences in the latest Monsterverse adventure Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire during which I felt like returning director Adam Wingard (Godzilla vs. Kong) was let loose to do whatever the heck he and his cadre of writers (including frequent collaborator Simon Barrett) wanted, free of any studio shackles. There are long stretches in this installment when heroic ape Kong wanders around the wilds of Hollow Earth fending off a variety of creatures (or trapping for a midafternoon snack) while also searching for other giant apes similar to himself. These bits are sublime. Kong uses his intellect to set inventive snares to sucker predators into becoming his prey, nurses a nasty toothache, and still makes time to check in on his favorite human, the last surviving member of Skull Island’s Iwi community, Jia (Kaylee Hottle). Later on, when he goes to investigate the subterranean regions of Hollow Earth, the Titan finally runs across an entire civilization of emaciated and angry apes who have been trapped near the Earth’s molten core for unimaginable eons. This all builds to an extended sequence in which Kong befriends a young primate by showing him kindness instead of cruelty. It also leads him into the middle of a conflict he cannot hope to end on his own and that also unwittingly puts the fate of the planet in serious jeopardy. Kong faces off against the vindictive and conniving Skar King, an elder simian who has subjugated Hollow Earth’s surviving apes to his will and who wants to destroy humanity. All of these moments are aces. While the overabundance of CGI during these sequences is undeniably noticeable, Wingard still manages to make things feel real even if, as a viewer, I always knew everything up on the screen was made on a computer and not on a sound stage. The visual flow is kinetically impressive, while the sound design is equally excellent. These scenes are also strikingly edited by Monsterverse veteran Josh Schaeffer, and there is a wonderful clarity to the set pieces that in lesser hands could have easily become nothing more than 20-minute bursts of colorfully nonsensical chaos. Granted, as great as all of this may be, there’s no way the producers would let Wingard make a two-hour faux nature documentary chronicling massive Titans in their natural habitats both above and below the surface of the earth. A human element must be introduced, at the very least to explain what the heck is going on and why anyone watching should care. While this facet of a Godzilla-centered motion picture has typically been serviceably silly over the past 70 years (you can count all of the exceptions on one hand), for fans — and I am a big one — it’s equally not that much of a problem either. There are exceptions, of course, and no matter which era of Godzilla you want to look at (Showa, Heisei, Millennium), you’re going to find a few notable misfires. So far, as goofy as they’ve gotten, the Monsterverse has managed to avoid this trap, but dang does The New Empire test that theory. Every new plot element comes with a gigantic helping of expository word vomit, and this becomes increasingly annoying as the plot steamrolls toward its forgone pugilistic conclusion. Brian Tyree Henry, returning as Titan conspiracy theory podcaster Bernie Hayes, is called upon to deliver the majority of it. While his comic timing and dramatic commitment to the material is unsurprisingly laudable (he did just receive a well-deserved Academy Award nomination for his superlative performance in 2022’s Causeway, after all), it still feels like the only reason his character is around is to explain what the heck is going on, and that’s unfortunate. It also does not help that Rebecca Hall, back as Monarch’s Kong expert and Jia’s adoptive mother Ilene Andrews, has practically nothing to do other than to look wide-eyed at all the mystifying peculiarities Hollow Earth has to offer or somberly sulk at the possibility she may lose her beloved daughter to this strange new world. The actor makes the most of what she has to work with, but as monumentally talented as Hall is, the lemonade she squeezes from these particular lemons still leaves a bitter aftertaste. The one human character who does make a continually positive impression is Trapper, Kong’s “dentist” whose loopy enthusiasm for his work (even in the face of almost certain death) is gloriously infectious. Portrayed with euphoric self-confidence by Dan Stevens, this is one of the best performances in the entire Monsterverse. Trapper is a continuous jolt of anarchic energy, and if Wingard ever decided to make an entire film following this guy around in his day-to-day kaiju veterinary responsibilities, I’d be first in line to watch it. Events climax with the requisite giant-creature slugfest, this time in Rio de Janeiro. While the Skar King shouldn’t be much of a match for the combined might of Godzilla and Kong, there’s a secret reason the cantankerous alpha Titans must once again join forces to bring down a common enemy, and I’m not about to spoil what that is. I’m also not going to go into why Jia is an integral player in the carnage, but anyone familiar with Showa- or Heisei-era Godzilla films will be able to quickly figure out why a potentially telepathic young girl with the ability to communicate with monsters may be important. Much like with Godzilla vs. Kong, Wingard shows he’s up to the challenge of staging these battles. The crashes are substantive, the booms make an impression, and the whizbang amazes. But I do miss the sense of overwhelming awe that was present in all three of the first Monsterverse entries (Godzilla, Kong: Skull Island, Godzilla: King of the Monsters), and at a certain point, watching buildings get smashed by these all-powerful creatures does get tiresome. But only slightly. Thanks to a handful of creatively unexpected flourishes coupled with Wingard’s confident handling of the material, I still found plenty to enjoy. While Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire did on occasion test my patience, the overall ride does remain a fun one, and because of that, I’m still willing to remain seated on the Monsterverse’s bandwagon — for now.

"Apr 5, 2024",neutral," La baja calidad resulta inherente a este tipo de narrativas, con raíces en las historias de exploradores de la primera mitad del siglo XX, icónicas producciones vistas en el período mudo hasta en las divertidas propuestas de “sábados de súper acción”. Pero sucede que Godzilla y Kong: El nuevo imperio (Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, 2024), abusa de sus artificiosos efectos visuales para encadenar secuencias de ""monstruos"" que se enfrentan entre sí. Todo está diseñado con CGI (imágenes generadas por computadora), tecnología que ha permitido la creación de criaturas de todas las formas y tamaños. Sin embargo, este desarrollo requiere de un refinamiento que aquí se ve eclipsado por la prisa típica de un videojuego, priorizando la espectacularidad visual sobre la coherencia narrativa. El resultado carece de interés por construir un universo convincente y parece más interesado en la destrucción de esos escenarios que simulan rings de combate. No solo los diseños de Godzilla y Kong carecen de profundidad, sino que incluso los actores parecen ser de segunda categoría. El elenco humano está conformado por una suerte de segundas marcas de Bradley Cooper (Alexander Skarsgård), Scarlett Johansson (Rebecca Hall) y Martin Lawrence (Brian Tyree Henry), acompañados por una niña sordomuda (Kaylee Hottle). Cada uno interpreta su arquetipo: el héroe carismático, la mujer guerrera y el alivio cómico y asustadizo. La trama, en tanto, parece meramente un pretexto para encadenar escenas de combates entre monstruos, en una suerte de Monster Trucks a escala colosal. La historia arranca con King Kong con problemas dentales y Godzilla dormido en el Coliseo Romano. Nada mejora cuando deben unir fuerzas en el ingreso a la “Tierra hueca”, un universo subterráneo e inexplorado en el que se toparán, junto al equipo de humanos, con peligrosas bestias ancestrales. Sin el humor suficiente para asimilar semejante pavada, Godzilla y Kong: El nuevo imperio es una película fea en su forma que hace honor a la tierra hueca en la que transcurre la acción y que, al fin y al cabo, resulta insoportable de ver."
"Apr 5, 2024",positive," Marking the fifth installment in the Legendary/Warner Bros. “Monsterverse” franchise, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire digs deep into the mythology of these so-called Titans, while also attempting to clear a path for what might come next. Without getting too deep into the plot, the film attempts to give us more details about the history of the Hollow Earth, Skull Island, and why these Titans keep popping back up on the surface of the planet to destroy things like entire cities or the pyramids. Naturally, there is a lot of exposition and speechifying by the human characters, but no one is paying much attention to that; we want monsters fighting and we want that frequently. And on that front, The New Empire delivers solidly. It not only tickles me greatly that Adam Wingard returns as director (following 2021’s Godzilla vs. Kong), but that he brings along with him his regular writing partner Simon Barrett (Terry Rossio and Jeremy Slater also get a writing credit), as well as actor Dan Stevens, who last paired with Wingard and Barrett in The Guest 10 years ago. Stevens plays an adventurer and some manner of animal expert named Trapper, one of the few new characters in the film. He’s old friends with Ilene Andrews (a returning Rebecca Hall), who is basically in charge of the Titan-monitoring project, which has been very active of late. Her young adopted deaf daughter and native Skull Islander, Jia (Kaylee Hottle), is also still around, trying to adapt to conventional schooling and not taking to it well. Titan podcaster Bernie Hayes (Brian Tyree Henry) is also back, tagging along and requiring everyone to explain things to him “in English,” so that the audience can attempt to figure out what the hell is going on. But eventually everyone finds themselves going back into the Hollow Earth, where Kong has discovered that he isn’t the last of his kind after all—something that was hinted at in the last film—and that not all of the others like him are as protective and nurturing as he is. The best part about The New Empire is that, rather than have the film build up to a massive creature fight, Wingard and company keep up the action pace pretty consistently, but the film’s final battle sequence is truly one of the best in this franchise. We already know that this time around Kong and Godzilla team up to fight a great opponent, and watching them run side by side into battle is truly a sight to behold and one I never thought I’d see. Even though we’ve seen some of these characters before, I’m not sure we learn much more about them. We actually also discover in the course of the movie that Jia’s tribe has been hiding in Hollow Earth for quite a long time, and her reunion with them is moving, especially thanks to a terrific performance by Fala Chen as the Iwi Queen. And Stevens knows exactly the tone to take for these movies, which isn’t necessarily the ultra-serious one that so many others are working in. He’s having fun learning new things about these creatures, and his joy is contagious. Although I’m sure there will be more of these films, there isn’t much of a teaser for upcoming storylines at the end of The New Empire, which is both surprising and refreshing. But knowing where something comes from doesn’t always make the characters or situations better, and I think it’s time this franchise looked to the future, into all-new adventures, without as many history lessons. I’m excited to see where things go from here, and I hope most of this team is in place to move it forward. Did you enjoy this post and our coverage of Chicago’s  arts scene?

"Apr 5, 2024",neutral," The Monsterverse is back with “Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire,” the fifth film in the franchise and followup to the 2021 smash “Godzilla vs. Kong,” which proved to be the blockbuster that kickstarted the box office following COVID. While there is nothing inherently bad in the latest film, “Godzilla” still feels like it is stuck on a hamster wheel just going through the motions. It’s a cookie-cutter big budget blockbuster that checks all the boxes, without having any real imagination. “Godzilla” finds things sort of back to normal after the titans battled in the previous film. Kong is adjusting to life in the Hollow Earth, while Godzilla is on the surface protecting humans from any potential danger. When a mysterious signal is detected on Hollow Earth it threatens the balance of this new normal. Dr. Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall), along with her adopted daughter Jia (Kaylee Hottle), the last remaining survivor of Iwi tribe from Skull Island, set out on a quest to find the signal in Hollow Earth. While their adventure is happening, Godzilla is being monitored as he appears to be gearing up for a yet to be revealed new enemy. To the film’s credit, “Godzilla” zips by in just under two hours with director Adam Wingard keeping things moving at a brisk pace. There is some really imaginative attention to details to flesh out Hollow Earth and the addition of some new creatures (and an appearance by an OG monster) that are fun in the moment – especially a young primate named Suko who becomes Kong’s ally. The cast is OK too, even if they are just there to take a backseat to the creatures. Hall brings some instant credibility to her role, while Bryan Tyree Henry is clearly having fun as the conspiracy theory blogger who joins the team on the journey to Hollow Earth. It all comes together in an acceptable fashion, with every piece working as best as it can. The biggest problem with this installment is an unknown factor it probably never saw coming, the release of “Godzilla Minus One” less than six months ago. “Minus One” was such a breath of fresh air for the franchise that it is a hard act to follow – a film that set the bar so high it would be nearly impossible to try to match it. By comparison, this “Godzilla” just feels like a run of the mill CGI extravaganza that, to its credit, delivers what it promises but doesn’t really have the same imagination and creativity of “Minus One.” The result is a franchise that feels stuck in the mud, in need of a bit of a jolt. The final act hints at future films and the opening weekend at the box office certainly suggests more installments are on the way. Here is hoping they can be a little more creative than this one, which isn’t really that bad or that good – it’s just there in the middle of the road, doing as little as possible to build off the franchise’s previous, and better, installments."
"Apr 5, 2024",positive," The letter ‘x’ in Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is silent, apparently. It is just about the only silent thing about the latest entry in the MonsterVerse, which sees the two titular titans put aside their differences to join forces against an existential threat. The follow-up to the immensely fun Godzilla vs. Kong (2021), Godzilla x Kong delivers on its tantalising, action-packed promise even if the other elements mostly let the side down.  All seems well in Titan Town, with Godzilla patrolling the surface world and Kong establishing his dominion over the Hollow Earth. This harmony is disrupted when Kong discovers a secret underground society of giant apes, led by the tyrannical and spindly-limbed Skar King. The Skar King wants to lead a conquest of the planet and possesses a terrifyingly powerful prisoner to help him do it. Kong, realising he cannot defeat this evil alone, must convince Godzilla – now looking pretty in pink and taking cat naps inside the Colosseum – to team up with him in a script taken straight out of WWE (there’s even a suplex). Godzilla vs. Kong proved to be one of the pandemic-afflicted cinema season’s biggest hits, and Adam Wingard is the MonsterVerse’s first returning director (with Gareth Edwards, Jordan Vogt-Roberts, and Michael Dougherty previously taking the reins of different films). Suitably then, this is a director willing to showcase some swagger. Wingard finds some absurd, silly moments of humour almost guaranteed to bring a smile to your face –Kong knocking out one mouthy ape with a single blow and Godzilla high-diving off the Rock of Gibraltar are particular highlights. Wingard has the confidence to colourfully bring out the personality of his monsters, building on the groundwork of Godzilla vs. Kong and having some serious fun while doing so.  The visual style goes harder on the detail, colour, and imagination. Crystallised, shimmering pillars tower over lush green habitats, while cities come crashing down in an even more dramatic fashion than before. Visually these films have rarely looked better, bringing the above and below-ground worlds to life with a vividness and creativity that really works overtime. The effects work on Kong in particular is outstanding; he looks more expressive and detailed than ever before. The visual effects team deserve massive credit for making a CGI gorilla outact every human being in the cast. The film looks great but sadly shares similar issues to many of its predecessors, particularly Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019). The human element is lacking. It was a wise decision to cut down and concentrate the number of human characters this time around, but the flip side of that is that they now have more to do. And, when the script lumps them with little more than exposition and mild comic relief, they feel like a burden with little to offer other than obvious observations and one-liners. Dan Stevens happily hams it up as a titan veterinarian, seemingly the only character at ease with just how crazy the whole thing is, but his apparent history with Dr. Ilene Andrews (a returning Rebecca Hall) is mentioned once and never brought up again. Even Hall’s relationship with Kia (Kaylee Hottle), while touching, is handled in a sedate, predictable manner. The MonsterVerse has proved with Monarch: Legacy of Monsters (2023) that it can do detailed human characters, so there is little excuse for anything else anymore.  The story is also very lop-sided, more so than Godzilla vs. Kong which blended the necessary explanations and theorisations with bone-crunching kaiju action far more fluidly. The Skar King is introduced at a very late stage, with the promised brawl only coming towards the film’s dying moments. The entire first half of the film, minus a few brief scuffles, is mostly spent moving all of the pieces into place in a frustratingly reserved manner. Godzilla x Kong is just not balanced as it should be, and the pace really suffers for it. Happily, when the final showdown comes, it hits the mark, the only let-down perhaps being that it isn’t slightly longer. A recurring point about Kong’s dental issues has a gleeful callback, and the battle is just as over-the-top as you could hope for. A brief rematch between Godzilla and Kong is also very satisfying, taken up a notch by Kong’s shiny new mechanised gauntlet. Wingard and the MonsterVerse have nailed how to do the headline-catching, goliath fights. It’s everything else that still needs some work. "
"Apr 5, 2024",positive," If you sat a MonsterVerse novice down and played Gareth Edwards' 2014 Godzilla against Adam Wingard's Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, the departure of the quality would be so staggering it would give that person whiplash. Or anyone, for that matter. How did we go from a large-scoped and painstakingly crafted blockbuster to a CG-monster fight fest franchise where Kong and Godzilla co-exist as frenemies? The previous MonsterVerse installment, Godzilla vs. Kong, centered on the big boys duking it out – something we all wanted to see. Now Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures are squeezing their Titan juices because The New Empire has the boys fighting side by side. It’s the worst timing, at least for Godzilla fans.  In his new home of Hollow Earth, Kong longs for fellowship. The same goes for Kong's human companion, Jia (​​Kaylee Hottle), the last of her Iwi tribe, who has become Dr. Ilene Andrews' (Rebecca Hall) of the Kong-specialized Monarch division's adopted daughter. Both parties have a difficult time adjusting to their new homes. Lord knows Kong can't return to the surface, for Godzilla takes it as his domain. When Jia experiences visions of a voice calling out for her, a chain of events ripples across both the surface and Hollow Earth – seismic activity screwing up Monarch's feed, Godzilla awakening and absorbing radiation from various sources across the world, and a rift opening in Hollow Earth. Dr. Andrews enlists Titan podcaster geek Bernie Hayes (Brian Tyree Henry), a Titan veterinarian named Trapper (Dan Stevens), and Jia into Hollow Earth to investigate the source of the signal. What they find is a crystalized world protected by an Iwi tribe. Meanwhile, Kong discovers other ape-like creatures and goes on a quest with a rambunctious ape-child, Suko, and leads him to a new threat named Scar King, a tyrannical ape who plans to take over the surface world. Kong must trek to the surface world to find Godzilla and team up with him to take Scar King down.  First, the title may be Godzilla x Kong, but this installment is a Kong flick (feat. Godzilla). The giant dumb lizard makes cameo appearances until the meandering plot from Terry Rossio, Simon Barrett, and Jeremy Slater requires him to show up. The only representation from the latter's movies is Brian Tyree Henry's Bernie, introduced in GvK but now switches sides since the writers catapult him into the Kong Monarch team's adventure. As someone who swings more toward the big ape than the giant lizard, I'm not complaining that I got more of a Kong flick. I love that giant monkey.  Godzilla x Kong is at its finest when no humans are in sight, and the focus is solely on Kong and his budding parental relationship with Suko, trekking across the new crystallized terrain within Hollow Earth. The visuals tell a much more precise and entertaining story than all the human exploration and exposition mumbo jumbo. The Kong and Suko sections are so God of War (2018) coded, with Kong wielding his big-ass battle axe, embarking on a dangerous quest with this juvenile kid ape. Whenever Kong made a ""let's go"" nodding expression to Suko, I assumed he was going to speak and say, ""BOY!"" They form a genuine bond and it’s the most engaging emotional aspect of the film. If Warner Bros. and Legendary were daring and thought highly of their audience, that dynamic would be enough to carry a whole movie without humans.  While the VFX is a mixed bag throughout, it’s during the Kong portions that the art direction and CG artistry are at their best, pulling off stunning shots. Wingard's direction retains the same energetic and exuberant style as his predecessor within these portions.  MonsterVerse screenwriters seem incapable of writing an enticing or coherent human tale to hold the picture together. However, Dan Stevens is the MVP as Trapper. He arrives on screen riding off the side of an aircraft donning a Magnum P.I. outfit to investigate Kong's infected tooth. He gives the whole feature a jolt of liveliness that was desperately needed in the past few MonsterVerse installments and rightfully matches the stupid energy these movies operate on. He’s the functioning comedic relief that shares good chemistry with his co-stars, CG or not. The human plots in MonsterVerse movies tend to be forgettable. Yet, Takashi Yamazaki mopped the floor with Terry Rossio, Simon Barrett, and Jeremy Slater, who can't come up with anything outside of the tired “exploration in CG-terrain” plotline with more convoluted story threads and stupid exposition. A monster who was inexplicably murdered several movies ago is magically revived with no rhyme or reason, and the film expects you to just go along with it.  To be this lazy on the heels of Godzilla Minus One is embarrassing. Don't say, ""Oh, you can't compare the two because one was set during WWII, and this Godzilla x Kong is contemporary."" Listen, Toho has made many Godzilla movies, and most are leaps and bounds better than this one. I watched Minus One on a whim after dropping my friend off at a Saltburn award screening that I didn't want to be at. One of those two titles ended up not getting any Oscar nominations. The other got a nom and won.  Toho raised the bar. Meanwhile, WB is just commissioning products and needs to give its visual effects team more time to cook on a staggering $135 million budget. To paraphrase Jeff Bridges in Iron Man, ""Takashi Yamazaki built this on a $12 million budget… with 35 VFX artists!"" What's your excuse, Warner Bros?! Man, I hope that Minus One's win was a wake-up call for Hollywood and what studios should strive for in storytelling and VFX to give a blockbuster an epic grandiose coat. We deserve that over the flat, weightless PS4-era quality, unrendered shots, and shoddy designs that made me physically wince.  We have another take-it-or-leave MonsterVerse movie for fans who just want to see Kong and Godzilla duke it out. The New Empire is a fan-service installment of unimpressive visual quality, but there’s potential to give the audience more than CG-schlock in the future. "

"Apr 5, 2024",positive,Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire can't hold a candle to last year's Godzilla: Minus One – and it's nothing like as smart as Gareth Edwards’ 2014 Godzilla relaunch. But it is a likeable enough way to waste a couple of hours.

"Apr 5, 2024",negative," The story: Somewhere in India, the impoverished Kid (Dev Patel) makes a living fighting in underground matches. His meagre earnings go towards a single goal – to find the men responsible for his wretched and lonely condition.  Co-written and helmed by and starring British actor Dev Patel, it combines hard-hitting martial arts with a dash of the exploitation crime thriller – the bloodletting and bare skin on display are enough to warrant an R21 classification, for sexual scenes and violence.  Patel’s lone wolf character might fight like a 1970s throwback, but modern touches abound. For example, he fights like a demon because he has demons on the inside.  His sleep is troubled by post-trauma flashbacks that give Kid his obsession with retribution, while the pummellings he dishes out are set to modern electronic dance music.  On a separate note, Patel’s athleticism in fight scenes is breathtaking. He makes Keanu Reeves’ title character from the John Wick film series (2014 to present) look like he moves in slow motion.  It feels as if Patel, in his feature film directorial debut, is showing a middle finger to an entertainment industry reluctant to cast a South Asian male as the lead in a superhero movie, because Kid’s story is an origin tale of a mysterious masked vigilante right out of a Marvel comic book.  The monkey man persona Kid adopts is a nod to the Hindu deity Hanuman, while the villains he faces down represent an aspect of the region. With every beatdown Kid delivers, he strikes a blow against systemic corruption, social inequality and religious hypocrisy.  Think of Lee’s character in Fist Of Fury (1972), set in Shanghai in the early 1900s, looking at a sign at the front of the foreign-run park that says “No Dogs And Chinese Allowed”. Patel taps the same vein of righteous anger, while delivering on the promise of a satisfying payback.  The story: Some years after the events of Godzilla Vs Kong (2021), the two Titans, Kong and Godzilla, now live in separate zones and so are in no danger of attacking each other. The giant primate resides in Hollow Earth, monitored by the Monarch research organisation, while the scaly one lives above ground. A Monarch outpost on Hollow Earth picks up a mysterious signal, one that will bring the antagonistic creatures into contact. Characters such as Dr Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall) and conspiracy theorist and podcaster Bernie Hayes (Brian Tyree Henry) make a return from the previous film, as does director Adam Wingard.  The Oscar-winning film has been held back from cinemas around the world because of legal obligations that forbid the American and Japanese Godzilla movies from being released in the same area at the same time. The films have so far struggled to reconcile two contradictory elements – the need to put the fighting monsters on screen as much as possible, while keeping the story focused on human affairs.  The MonsterVerse franchise kicked off in 2014 with Godzilla, with the following films introducing Kong (Kong: Skull Island, 2017), a wider bestiary in Godzilla: King Of The Monsters (2019), before bringing the two starring creatures together in 2021’s Godzilla Vs Kong. The films and Apple TV+ series Monarch: Legacy Of Monsters (2023) have yet to match the quality of Shin Godzilla (2016), a Japanese production that mocked clueless, grandstanding politicians caught flat-footed by a disaster.  So, this is the overblown, vapid result – a rambling series of plot contrivances aimed at maximising monster brawls. For the second time, Kong and Godzilla, two supposedly deadly enemies, become frenemies to defeat an even more menacing creature.  Dr Andrews is the film’s moral centre, while Hayes is its comic relief, and the entire affair tries to come off as a breezy lost world adventure, especially when the devil-may-care character of Trapper, a veterinarian played by Dan Stevens, enters the picture.  The story: Jacqueline (Cynthia Erivo) is a refugee from war-torn Liberia struggling to survive on the streets of a touristy Greek coastal city. She meets Callie (Alia Shawkat), a tour guide. Despite their differences, they form a friendship. The film is based on Alexander Maksik’s 2013 novel A Marker To Measure Drift, and adapted for the screen by Maksik and Susanne Farrell. There will be a post-screening question-and-answer session with Singaporean director Anthony Chen at the 7.30pm show on April 6.  Drift marks a couple of firsts for Chen. It is his first feature with dialogue that is not mostly in Mandarin, as well as the first feature he has directed in which he is not listed in the writing credits.  However, it contains ideas that have become attached to his work – the way outsiders find kinship; the need for solitude struggling against the hunger for connection; and the female protagonist with secrets, yearning to be seen for who she is, but who sets protections around herself.  Erivo’s Jacqueline is vulnerable, so she is always on high alert. Much of the drama’s first half is spent seeing the city through the eyes of this wary, intelligent woman as she lives day to day.  Despite having precious few possessions, she strives to keep herself clean and presentable. She lives rough, but self-care is still a priority. Erivo delivers a magnetic performance as the woman holding on to the shreds of her former identity while learning to adapt to a new one in which she is either invisible, or, when noticed, considered a pest.  Chen’s camera watches at a distance as she engages with beach tourists in a low-key manner to make a few euros by giving foot massages. She never tries to elicit pity, nor does she make a nuisance of herself.  The entrance of Shawkat’s ebullient American tour guide Callie gives the film a much-needed shot of optimism – one roots for them to get closer, so that the American, with her first-world resources, can rescue the protagonist.  This is not that sort of story. The story here, as far as Chen is concerned, is the ebb and flow of emotions as the women negotiate boundaries and find ways to communicate. The damage caused by war runs deep in Jacqueline. She bears the sort of damage that makes rehabilitation, or even asking for help, difficult. Flashbacks show life in Liberia for the woman from a comfortable middle-class family before she finds herself adrift in Greece.  There are no easy triumphs for either woman, but by the film’s end, it becomes clear that all one needs is hope, and that, thankfully, is provided. "
"Apr 4, 2024",neutral," You have to feel bad for Godzilla. Not only does he have to follow-up the absolute masterclass of monster cinema that was Godzilla Minus One, but in Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, the poor guy can’t even get a few winks in the Colosseum before the world once again demands he and Kong’s assistance to thwart yet another world-ending threat.  But hey, at least this time he gets to radiate with an effervescent Barbie-esque pink hue (you will have to see the film to know exactly why). For this direct sequel to 2021’s, Godzilla vs. Kong, director Adam Wingard returns to craft a CGI-loaded, ridiculously plotted, excessively edited, monster-smashing sequel revolving around a dangerous foe in Hollow Earth’s Skar King and his aims to toss monkey morality to the wind and do some real damage back on the mainland. Rebecca Hall and Kaylee Hottle return as Ilene Andrews and her now adopted daughter, Jia. After being rescued from Skull Island, Jia feels isolated from Kong and many of the treasures of her homeland, so when things with Kong go sideways, of course Ilene allows her to tag along. We are better for it though, as their relationship is the dose of heart this film sorely needs as it continues the Monsterverse’s largest sin: forgetting human characters need to make some iota of sense. Returning from the previous film is Brian Tyree Henry’s Bernie, who gets very little of interest to do here. Thankfully, director Wingard called in his leading man from 2014’s fantastic The Guest, Dan Stevens, to liven things up as the unpredictably hilarious Trapper. Please bring Trapper back, we need more of this insanity if we are to keep taking these plots seriously. Kong is again the primary focus, and that continues to work due to the expertly utilized facial tics in the King Kong designs. Kong cannot speak, but we understand his every motive and movement, which is a true testament to this effects team. Kong eventually encounters his own version of Jia in Suko, an abandoned and borderline abused baby ape who Kong takes under his wing for a bit of that tough monkey love. For example, winding Suko up and twirling him around as a weapon like the world’s stretchiest baseball bat. Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is a monster movie, through and through. If you’re interested in an emotional narrative with human characters that connect on a deeper level of empathy, go watch Godzilla Minus One again. Because THIS is a freaking monster movie. It has no time for character development. While the story is admittedly weak and the humans are mostly wasted screen time, the wham-bam thrills equal a reasonably good time in a theater. "

In the fifth instalment in Legendary's MonsterVerse, Godzilla and many other Titans walk the earth's surface (and its depths), with humanity having learnt to adapt to their presence. Meanwhile, in the Hollow Earth, an ageing Kong lives a solitary existence, with no other giant apes for company. When Jia (Kaylee Hottle) telepathically picks up a distress signal from the Hollow Earth, she and her adoptive mother, Ilene (Rebecca Hall), recruit Bernie (Bryan Tyree Henry) and Trapper (Dan Stevens) to head back to Kong's domain where major surprises await them.

"Apr 4, 2024",neutral," Godzilla and King Kong use to have a beef. Now that they’ve kissed and made up, there’s no real meat in this generic big creature smackdown.  Also, any production involving Godzilla or Kong now stands in the shadow of the Oscar-winning Godzilla Minus One. There’s no excuses anymore. If writer/director Takashi Yamazaki can craft a heart-felt script with three-dimensional characters. If Yamazaki, Kiyoko Shibuya, Masaki Takashi and Tatsuji Nojima can conjure eyeball-entrancing visual effects so stunning they garner the ultimate achievement in artistry, an Academy Award. Then any filmmakers who come after them can step up. If they really want to.  Jia’s adoptive mom, Dr. Ilene Andrews (Rebeca Hall, Resurrection and director of Passing), is the head of the Kong research division for the secret organization Monarch. She takes her daughter’s inklings so seriously she enlists the help of Bernie Hayes (Brian Tyree Henry, Causeway), a weirdo conspiracy theorist podcaster whose show Titan Truths is obsessed with the mega monsters. Something is up. That’s the buzz. As the film progresses and an enigmatic signal attracts action to the Hollow Earth, a hidden realm in the planet’s core, more beasts are unearthed. None look any more vivid than the two on the surface. The verdant underworld landscape is interesting (production designer Tom Hammock, Godzilla vs. Kong), but the music (Tom Holkenborg and Antonio Di Iorio), interior sets, flying capsules, costumes (Emily Seresin) and cinematography (Ben Seresin) don’t enhance those scenes. If there is a saving grace, it’s that the fights, battles and combat, which lead up to a do-or-die climax with Godzilla and Kong teaming up to for the big brawl, are well paced and measured throughout which should delight action/adventure/sci-fi fans. Being original, innovative or deep is not part of the scope of the script by director/writer Adam Wingard (Godzilla vs Kong) and screenwriter Terry Rossio. E.g., the chit-chat on the space craft that flies Jia, Bernie, Tanner and Dr. Andrews to the center of the world and the Monarch outpost, is banal. The shuttle is flown by the gruff pilot Mikael (Alex Ferns), a mean taskmaster: “Try not to swallow your tongue.” Bernie, the scared passenger: “What?!!”. Tanner is blasé. Jia hopeful. And Andrews in charge. Words and character development don’t get much deeper than that. Wingard’s direction settles on the spectacle of the over-sized fights, but none are truly astonishing. The only reason anyone’s heart will beat fast is because the loud soundtrack (Erik Aadahl) tends to make up for what is not visually impressive. Also, some of the fights take place on dazzling international locations, from the Pyramids to the beaches of Rio de Janeiro. Pour on the fanciful geographical locations, action, pummeling, bites, body slams and a little deep freeze wizardly and hope for the best.  Fala Chen as Iwi Queen has a majesty about her that gives the film some moments of dignity. Hottle displays an innocence that is beguiling. When Mikael meets an abrupt ending viewers will giggle.  That’s a sign that Ferns did his job as the aggressive bully. Steven’s interpretation of Tanner remains steadfast throughout.  Cool, collected and high on life. While Henry’s interpretation of Bernie seems too buffoonish.  Maybe the bromance between the reptile Godzilla and primate King Kong was a mistake. Maybe audiences will leave theaters invigorated but wondering, “Where’s the beef!”"
"Apr 3, 2024",negative," The most extraordinary feat in a film like Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is its ability to convey a plethora of emotion from CGI-derived, non-verbal creatures. It's something director Adam Wingard and VFX supervisor Alessandro Ongaro accomplish, particularly through Kong and his primate cohorts. But, as with Wingard's first instalment in this iteration of the Monsterverse, the humans only get in the way. Wingard's follow up to 2021's truly excellent Godzilla vs. Kong explores the origins of the various creatures and wades deeper into Hollow Earth. After the events of the first film, the two monsters have reached a détente — Godzilla hangs about in the surface world thrashing monsters that humans can't deal with, while Kong rules Hollow Earth. The film briefly examines the loneliness of Kong in his futile search for others of his kind; that is, until his senses lead him to find a whole new layer to Hollow Earth where more large primates live. By introducing so many new creatures, characters and locations while also trying to continue developing the already established world, New Empire ultimately succumbs to putting a hat on a hat... on a hat. Wingard jumps around and rushes through an incredible amount of lore and unnecessary cinematic science to the point that only confusion remains. And yet, there's a nagging feeling that within all this hot-potato storytelling lies a pretty cool story involving Kong and his brethren. Unlike Godzilla vs. Kong, the former doesn't get much screen time this time around (although he's gotten enough shine of late with Godzilla Minus One) and I personally will not complain. Wingard and Ongaro's imagining of the King of the Beasts and his kind is awe-inspiring and incredibly impressive. Through facial expressions and demonstrative body language alone, the film connects audiences to Kong's story in a way reminiscent of silent era films — but with more bellowing growls, of course. Every second Kong, little Kong and Skar King are on screen, it's quietly engaging in a way that transcends the film as a whole. If the computer-generated creatures of the film are the players in a silent film that compels audiences, then the actual humans acting in the film are the intertitles. Save for the brief moments of comedy from the Brian Tyree Henry–Dan Stevens combo, the humans simply exist to read out the Wikipedia plot summary — expository monkeys, if I may. Look, all we want from our creature features is Kong and Godzilla decimating cities, throwing Donkey Kong punches and MMA-ing the shit out of each other — just good wholesome entertainment is all. New Empire proves this to be the bread and butter of a modern day creature feature that can use the best technology to deliver on an entertaining slugfest. It also proves that either the budget can be saved by removing actors from this genre altogether, or the budget needs to be expanded to create scripts where actors are actually necessary."
"Apr 3, 2024",negative,It starts out with a lot of promise but it takes itself too seriously and becomes tedious. Also not much Godzilla for a Godzilla x Kong movie
"Apr 3, 2024",neutral,"I like this movie strictly as a cartoonish action comedy. There are few surprises, but there is lots of action, most of it of the animated variety. I also liked it because I am a 3D fan, and this 3D conversion is very good."

"Apr 2, 2024",positive," While the clunkily-titled Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire might not initially seem it, it would be a great double-bill with Oppenheimer, as the two films bookend 80 years of storytelling that have helped us comprehend and process the terror man has inflicted upon himself with that nuclear power.  Godzilla, or Gojira, emerged as a monster-movie staple in post-war and post-Hiroshima Japan, a parable about the destructive power of nuclear energy. The creature has starred in nearly 40 films in the years since, produced by Japanese company Toho and a handful of Hollywood studios.  There's a whole bunch of world-building that has been going on with the Godzilla franchise. The last dozen films, both Japanese and American, have been feeding an almost Marvel Cinematic Universe approach to long-term storytelling. For those who want to jump into this film without seeing those 38 other features, there is a terrific series called Monarch: Legacy of Monsters that recently launched on the AppleTV platform. It ties all of those films together with the King Kong movies. In this film, which carries on from the 2021 film Godzilla vs Kong, the world powers-that-be seem have accepted that the giant skyscraper-sized lightning-breathing lizard monster Godzilla, while causing urban destruction everywhere he goes, seems to do so only in the cause of protecting the world from less well-intentioned monsters, called Titans.  He's not a fan of the giant gorilla King Kong, but Monarch scientist Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall) solved that problem by, just as with feeding puppies or three-year-olds, separating them.  In earlier films, Monarch discovered another subterranean world within the core of our planet, a Journey to the Centre of the Earth situation, and Kong has been housed there. But strange seismic activity takes Dr Andrews to this subterranean world, with a team including vet Trapper (Dan Stevens), former scientist turned Monarch truther Bernie Hayes (Brian Tyree Henry) and Dr Andrews's adoptive daughter Jia (Kaylee Hottle).  If you love these silly monster flicks, this did sound like it was going to be a ton of fun but it doesn't entirely live up to its potential.  The performances are fine, with Rebecca Hall as strong as she always is, and Brian Tyree Henry and Dan Stevens delivering the goofy comic relief roles. The writing isn't terrific and the setup, dialogue and obnoxious music choices that accompany Stevens' every appearance try to set him up as some kind of epic Michael Bay character. That might have worked in a full cinema, but mine was not.  It's so terrific to see Kiwi actress Rachel House in quite a decent-sized minor role as a Monarch executive. She's a great comedic actress so I was preparing to laugh every time she spoke, but she was purely the straight man, with Kong and Godzilla getting most of the film's slapstick routines.  The CGI work is really good, or at least noticeably actually finished unlike the sloppy work that ruined the last half dozen Marvel and DCU films. Much of that CGI is really self-indulgent widespread destruction of a number of cities, including Rome and Rio De Janeiro. This might be considered fun escapism if we weren't witnessing some epic real-life urban destruction on our front pages a bit too much this past week. "
"Apr 2, 2024",neutral," The epic battle continues! Legendary Pictures’ cinematic Monsterverse follows up the explosive showdown of ”Godzilla vs. Kong” with an all-new adventure that pits the almighty Kong and the fearsome Godzilla against a colossal undiscovered threat hidden within our world, challenging their very existence—and our own. “Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire” delves further into the histories of these Titans and their origins, as well as the mysteries of Skull Island and beyond. Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire refreshingly showcases Kong’s maturity and development over time. I enjoyed witnessing his fights, where the situations reflected his character more than his brute strength or cunning. His interactions with other monsters were captivating, particularly the interactions with Mini Kong. I thought those were kind of funny and enjoyable to watch. It was fascinating to see the development of their relationship. Godzilla, despite not appearing as frequently in the film, still presented a significant threat for everyone to face. I appreciated how Godzilla’s portrayal remained consistent, depicting him as a force of nature with a clear objective. His interactions with Kong were also entertaining, as both titans showcased their respective strengths. Another positive for Godzilla X Kong was the handling of the human characters. This time around, they didn’t feel as annoying. Their stories remained mostly focused on the monsters more so than their personal drama. They certainly could have benefited from a lesser, supportive role, but they did serve the story well enough. Lastly, the worldbuilding for Godzilla X Kong was stunning. The visual effects included some vivid imagery and colors that were captivating to see. They also really sold the notion that the hollow earth was a completely new world. The VFX used for the monsters was also pretty impressive. The titans seemed believable enough to be real and I never thought twice about it while watching. While some of the fights in the movie were entertaining to watch, some moments were simply too cringy to bear. I was not a fan of the scenes where certain monsters would fight and appear to be too humanistic in their battle tactics. For example, there’s one monster fight where a creature does a full-on wrestling move to another monster. While already in a state of suspended belief, this really pushed the envelope too far. The film did better in relying on the more primal fighting techniques of the creatures, rather than adopting silly wrestling moves. The technology in Godzilla X Kong becomes a bit too high-brow. It’s understood that some technological advancements were necessary, such as travel to and from the hollow Earth. However, later in the film, it introduces more scientific concepts that seem to be more of a distraction. I understood why it made sense for the sake of the story, but it felt overly complicated given the explanations provided. Plus, once you witness the scientific phenomena occur, it feels like a visual, chaotic mess until things settle down for the final showdown. Speaking of which, the villain in Godzilla X Kong proved rather underwhelming. There wasn’t enough buildup about the monster individually to make it feel like a genuine threat. The gimmick used by the villain did raise some stakes, but without that gimmick, the villain was a complete disappointment. This, of course, made the final battle a letdown even though it had so much potential. Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire is a fun, albeit flawed, addition to the Monsterverse. Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire delivers on its promise of epic monster battles but falls short in some key areas. While the quantity of monsters is impressive, the quality of their interactions and the complexity of the plot leave something to be desired. Having over-the-top scientific jargon reminded me of the film Tenet. Couple that with the ridiculous corny wrestling moves and scripted drama, and one could easily think Christopher Nolan and WWE made a monster movie together. More specifically, the same way Tenet felt unnecessarily over-explanatory and high-concept, this film did the same. So much so that it kind of robbed me from just sitting back and enjoying titans fighting it out on the big screen. Nevertheless, Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire was an OK entry into the monsterverse. For those wondering, the answer is “No, this did not even compare to the masterpiece that is Godzilla Minus One”.  There is no post-credit scene, so please do not feel the need to wait for more.

"Apr 2, 2024",positive," It's Easter weekend, and for South Florida cinephiles, it's the calm before the storm. This resting place is the perfect time to catch up with big-scale studio offerings before plunging into festival frenzy. That's right: the Miami Film Festival sprang forward from its traditional March berth to its current dates of April 5-14, meaning it will be unspooling back to back with the Miami edition of OUTshine (April 18-28). The ripple effects of the date change remain to be seen. Will it benefit both events, or will one festival rise to the surface while the other sinks? The “different audiences” line of defense holds little weight to those of us who would like to keep attending both events and may now have to make some difficult choices. Dan Stevens as Trapper, Rebecca Hall as Dr. Ilene Andrews and Kaylee Hottle as Jia in a scene from ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire."" (Photo credit: Dan McFadden. Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures.) But let's cross that bridge when we get to it. Before us we have two big-budget tentpoles that sell nostalgia while trying to rope in a younger generation. One is a supernatural blend of laughs and chills that returns its franchise to its original urban setting. The other throws together its jumbo-sized walking allegories to see if they can work together instead of surrendering to their alpha-male instincts to beat each other to a pulp. “Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire”: King Kong has a toothache, and his pain doesn't stop there. This muscular chapter in the Universal MonsterVerse saga begins with a wordless sequence that follows the big ape's daily routine on Hollow Earth, the hidden realm beneath our planet's surface where we last saw him three years ago. He can hold his own in these harsh, Darwinian surroundings, but fending off other predators underlines the sense that he doesn't belong there. Even more so, it drives home the engulfing loneliness for someone who's under the impression that he's the last of his kind. But “New Empire” doesn't dwell too much on existential angst. Director Adam Wingard, who also helmed its predecessor, “Godzilla vs. Kong,” wants to show you a good time, and he has crafted an eye-popping thrill ride that not only delivers the slam-bang goods but restores a sense of awe and wonder to these monster mashes.  Rebecca Hall as Dr. Ilene Andrews and Brian Tyree Henry as Bernie Hayes in a scene from ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire."" (Photo credit: Dan McFadden. Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures.) I was initially miffed when humans entered the picture since the prospect of a Godzilla/King Kong crossover told entirely from the creatures' point of view felt like a very enticing proposition. But even with the homo sapiens characters, “New Empire” shows a marked improvement over the 2021 film, itself a serviceable genre entry that didn't reinvent the wheel but didn't require viewers to have an encyclopedic knowledge of the lore to enjoy themselves. Dr. Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall), now sporting a new shorter-haired look, is struggling to connect with Jia (Kaylee Hottle), the last surviving member of the Iwi tribe who called Skull Island (Kong's old abode) home before it was destroyed. Ilene has since adopted the girl, who is beset by nightmarish visions that prevent her from getting through a day at school without freaking out her classmates. Ilene is concerned about her adoptive daughter's well-being. As the head of Kong research at Monarch, the covert organization monitoring these giant creatures, called Titans, she is also concerned about an unidentified signal that may point to trouble down below, which likely means it will spill over to the planet's surface. She seeks out conspiracy theory podcaster Bernie Hayes (Brian Tyree Henry, back for more) to help decipher the meaning behind the signal. To deal with Kong's infected chomper, Ilene brings in Trapper (Dan Stevens), a veterinarian who knows his giant monsters. With his red Hawaiian shirt, laid-back demeanor and holistic approach to adversity, Trapper ends up being the shot in the arm the movie needs, turning what could have been a listless globetrotting adventure into a freewheeling spectacle. Stevens, who previously worked with Wingard as the titular ticking time bomb in the violent thriller/slasher film “The Guest,” is clearly having a ball playing the groovy doc. You'll want what he's having. No bad vibes allowed. But Trapper, and Stevens' irresistible star turn, are only the tip of the iceberg. Wingard, working from a screenplay credited to Terry Rossio, Simon Barrett and Jeremy Slater, has a couple of secrets up his sleeve, and a big part of what makes “New Empire” such a treat is the way it keeps expanding on its mythology. Each revelation made this movie nerd beam. The most satisfying new additions to the MonsterVerse's cast of big critters are two big primates. Suko, a reddish-furred juvenile who crosses paths with Kong, perhaps has the most satisfying arc, though he's initially such a backstabbing jerk, part of me didn't want him to change his wicked ways. Then there's the Skar King, an older ape who is so deliciously cunning and evil, he is literally a slave driver. (It's clear Wingard knows his Indiana Jones movies.) This is the villain I was looking for. Carrie Coon as Callie Spengler, Finn Wolfhard as Trevor Spengler, Paul Rudd as Gary Grooberson, Annie Potts as Janine, Mckenna Grace as Phoebe Spengler, Logan Kim as Podcast, Dan Aykroyd as Ray Stantz, James Acaster as Lars and Celeste O'Connor as Lucky in a scene from ""Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire."" (Photo by Jaap Buitendijk./Courtesy of Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc.) This is not to diminish the growth that Kong shows here. The iconic simian, often depicted as a destructive force of nature, shows newfound resolve, even leadership skills, in “New Empire.” The same cannot be said of his scaly adversary-turned-reluctant-collaborator, and if there's something that this film skimps on, it's Godzilla. Wingard and his creative team are juggling so many elements that the giant lizard is too often reduced to a plot device. Coming months after Japan's Oscar-winning “Godzilla Minus One,” the relative short shrift that the apex predator is given here is all the more glaring, even though the city-leveling butt-kicking remains a thrill to experience under Wingard's assured stewardship. He is capably backed up by the retro sounds of Antonio Di Iorio and Tom Holkenborg's score, which alternates between '80s-throwback synthesizers and rousing orchestral swells. There are nits to be picked with “New Empire.” In addition to the reduced Godzilla presence, the movie tries to cover too many bases, with arguably enough content for two jam-packed extravaganzas. But when the results are this exhilarating, the vastness of its scope so richly rendered, that's hardly a dealbreaker. Wingard, whose past horror work often had a mean streak, has crafted a nifty demolition derby with a big, pulsating heart. Much like the touchy-feely Trapper, it's a hugger. Also, an absolute blast. “Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire”: There's a chill in the air in this latest installment of the paranormal problem solvers, and it's coming from the ghosts of better supernatural action comedies. Unremarkable but not unwatchable, the fifth entry in the franchise started forty years ago by director Ivan Reitman and stars/co-screenwriters Dan Aykroyd and the late Harold Ramis attempts to integrate more horror elements than usual in its mix of forced self-referential laughs and deep dive into the Occult.

Its prologue, chronicling New York society's brush with a demonic spirit circa 1904, suggests a more ambitious undertaking that will treat its otherwordly threat seriously. But before there's a discernible payoff to the period-piece trappings, the movie jumps forward to present day, with the kind of chase scene that an old studio hand like Richard Donner could have brought vividly to life. It's safe to say British filmmaker Gil Kenan (“Monster House”) is no Richard Donner. “Frozen Empire” is set two years after the events in “Ghostbusters: Afterlife,” and like the 2021 legacy sequel, it favors its new characters over the old guard, even if the latter's involvement has been punched up. Callie Spengler (Carrie Coon), the daughter of OG Ghostbuster Dr. Egon Spengler (Ramis), has moved to New York City with her children, Phoebe (Mckenna Grace) and Trevor (“Stranger Things'” Finn Wolfhard), and her boyfriend, seismologist Gary Grooberson (the eternally youthful Paul Rudd). The quartet's rather messy and destructive apparition-trapping efforts have caught the attention of New York Mayor Walter Peck (William Atherton, picking up a paycheck), the slimy civil servant first seen in the 1984 film. Phoebe, who is 15, is still a minor, so Callie reluctantly benches her from busting ghosts before Peck can make his move and put them out of business.

(Photo by Jaap Buitendijk. Courtesy of Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc.) But there's a wintry menace that's keen to wreak havoc in the world, an ancient entity with the power to turn the planet into an icicle. If it sounds like Kenan and co-screenwriter Jason Reitman (son of Ivan) have assembled the ingredients for a competent popcorn movie, that's because they have. This is the part where I confess to have thoroughly hated “Afterlife,” which was directed by Reitman. “Frozen Empire” may be aggressively by the numbers, but it is also a decisive step up from the insufferable fan service and poor writing that ruined its predecessor. It also repeatedly lets down Phoebe, its strongest, most interesting character, at every turn. Grace conveys the character's drive and fierce intelligence, but the filmmakers do not follow suit, forcing the rebellious, frustrated teen to make stupid decisions in order to move the creaky plot forward. Most disappointing of all is the way it introduces Melody (Emily Alyn Lind), the ghost of a teen who perished in a fire, as a new friend for Phoebe, then not-so-subtly hints the friendship has the potential to become something more, before chickening out in the most spineless way possible. There is something strange in this neighborhood: queerbaiting. Dan Aykroyd as Ray Stantz and Kumail Nanjiani as Nadeem Razmaadi in a scene from ""Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire.""

"Apr 2, 2024",neutral,"From a radioactive roar in 2014 to atomically terrible breath in 2024, The MonsterVerse is getting long in the decaying tooth."
"Apr 2, 2024",negative," Godzilla x Kong is an entertaining way to pass two hours, yet its poor script and lack of character development stop it from being truly great. Since Godzilla hit theaters in 2014, each installment has promised to be ‘bigger and better’ than the last. With more carnage, more monsters and more uncharted territory, Godzilla x Kong sees the two titular beasts put their past battles behind them, joining forces to defeat a colossal undiscovered threat hidden within our world. With action aplenty and visually pleasing world-building, Godzilla x Kong is an entertaining way to pass two hours, yet its poor script and lack of character development stop it from being truly great. Seeing these monsters battle it out is an undeniably fun shlock fest; Godzilla x Kong’s issue is that it takes too long to get there. With new characters to meet, new territory to discover and new threats to understand the danger of, there’s a lot of exposition, a very small amount of which is entertaining – it unfortunately reduces itself to hand-holding. The first two acts of this movie are a mixture of drab dialogue, cringe-worthy jokes and underdevelopment of its characters. The performances behind our human characters are good, especially from leading lady Rebecca Hall and her on-screen daughter Kaylee Hottle, but we still don’t get a deep enough dive into their characters as we should. There is an interesting arc for Hottle’s character Jia, as she struggles to find her place in the world and goes on a journey of self-discovery, but it’s unfortunately rushed over. Talented actors Brian Tyree Henry and Dan Stevens are reduced to corny, unfunny jokes. This franchise has always failed to do its human characters justice, and unfortunately, Godzilla x Kong is not exempt from this. The majority of the run-time is spent in Hollow Earth, which is both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, the visuals are utterly stunning from start to finish, with terrific world-building and plenty of exciting new territory to explore. Each frame is packed with color and life, with luscious green landscapes, enticing waterfalls and electric pinks and blues that pop off the screen. The filmmakers paid attention to the visuals, and it pays off – it’s astonishing to look at. There is an awful lot of CGI, but it’s hard to balk when it looks this good. There are also plenty of beasts outside of our titular two, both on land and in the sky, helping to bring Hollow Earth to life. It’s a fantasy world that’s fun to enter, allowing you to make discoveries along the way alongside our characters. Fans of the franchise will enjoy meeting the monsters Godzilla x Kong has on offer. The one issue with the Hollow Earth setting is that our monsters fit tidily into it; it’s a large world, fit for our large characters. The most entertaining thing about Godzilla, Kong and the rest of these beasts is that they’re absolutely huge – this is what provides the shock factor and makes it stand out. We can gauge their scope when they’re in our world, stepping over buildings, crushing cars and headbutting bridges. However, this element gets lost within Hollow Earth – they almost become regular animals. Judging the character development and depth of the script seems futile when audiences are here for one thing only: the action. When our beasts are battling it out, Godzilla x Kong is an entertaining, crowd-pleasing ride. Never taking itself too seriously, it understands the dumb fun that can be had within this world, and it certainly delivers on the shlock and carnage. Kong is front and center here, and there are plenty of unearthly villains for him to take down even before the climax begins. Making friends with a young Kong along the way, the pair make for an entertaining and sweet dynamic duo. Godzilla might be more underutilized than we’d expect, but once he’s back up and running, he’s as menacing as ever. The radiation running through him makes him look very cool, it’s hard not to grin when he’s in action, atomic breath and all. It was incredibly entertaining to see Godzilla and Kong battle it out in 2021’s addition to the franchise, and it’s equally as fun to see them join forces here to fight others. There’s some humor injected into the final battle sequence as the two become an unstoppable tag team, using WWE moves whilst helping each other to defeat their nemesis. Godzilla x Kong is the epitome of a popcorn flick; whilst not providing much in the way of characters, depth or storyline, it makes up for it with entertaining action and dumb yet fun fight sequences. The script is bad, with too many jokes that fall flat and plenty of missed opportunities in the way of theme exploration. Talent is wasted, the try-hard needle drops don’t fit, the exposition-heavy scenes are uninteresting and unnecessary and the story is more convoluted than it needs to be. Once our monsters are in fight mode, it’s incredibly entertaining and becomes worth the viewing – it’s just a shame it takes too long to get there. The only consistently good trait is the visuals – it always looks the part. Becca is a Rotten Tomato-approved freelance critic from Essex, UK, with a penchant for horror and coming-of-age.

"Apr 2, 2024",negative,Director Adam Wingard tries but can't make the action mayhem hold our attention: it's never more than pointless carnage. And the filmmaking blithely ignores the millions of humans who perish in all of this full-on destruction.
"Apr 2, 2024",positive," In this new installment of the Godzilla and King Kong cinematic universe, humans and mighty titans coexist — mostly — harmoniously. But when an unidentified signal causes the creatures to experience hallucinations, the fragility of this relationship is pushed to the forefront, erupting in a series of wild battles true to the franchise. Film critic Reggie “The Reel Critic” Ponder noted Godzilla and Kong movies need to look good to keep viewers engaged, and the exceptional use of CGI throughout this film made it easy to suspend his disbelief.  The film is the 38th to emerge from the Godzilla franchise, and the 13th from King Kong. Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire follows Godzilla x Kong (2021), resuming after Kong defeats Mechagodzilla and establishes dominance over Hollow Earth. It stars Rebecca Hall, Kaylee Hottle and Brian Tyree Henry."
"Apr 2, 2024",positive," Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire takes place a few years after the events that unfolded in its prequel, Godzilla vs. Kong, as Kong adapts to the strange and overall upside-downness of Hollow Earth while Godzilla battles the Titans above ground. But how does the whole film adapt, you’re possibly wondering? The sole surviving member of the Iwi tribe, Jia (Kaylee Hottle) is a deaf teenager struggling to adapt to everyday life. She can communicate with Kong through sign language and is starting to get strange visions and distress signals from Hollow Earth. Her adopted mother, Dr. Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall), feels like she doesn’t understand her daughter. Meanwhile, Kong finds a new ape civilization but also a new threat in the form of the Skar King – a Titan lankier than Kong and with an appearance similar to that of an orangutan or chimpanzee. He carries a whip made of a spinal column with a crystal at the end of it that he uses to control an ice-based Titan called Shimo. As Godzilla begins absorbing radiation from all possible sources, humanity’s only hope of survival is another team-up of the two giant enemies turned infrequent allies. In giant monster films like this, the storyline involving the humans always feels secondary, and the acting and the dialogue are also usually on the unbearable side. Unfortunately, Godzilla x Kong religiously follows this formula.  For instance, Jia (Kaylee Hottle) always has this furrowed brow to accompany a half-hearted scowl. She has the facial expression of someone who stepped in a pile of dog crap barefoot but didn’t have time to wash her feet before putting on socks and shoes. Her mother rubs off on her a little. Being a scientist, you’d think Dr. Andrews was at least somewhat intelligent, but she’s a borderline idiot. She ignores blatant story points because she’s too busy wondering if her daughter will return home with her after Godzilla and Kong put the kibosh on Skar King.  This is somewhat of a spoiler, but Dr. Andrews sees Jia with some of the Iwi running through the forest doing the laziest form of ribbon dancing you’ve ever seen and thinks, “Wow, she really belongs here.” Other human characters are just as bad. Brian Tyree Henry returns as the rambling podcaster Bernie Hayes. Bernie is helpful for one central story point, but his unbearable demeanor is passed off as the main comedic relief for the rest of the movie. Dan Stevens is the closest thing to entertaining amongst the human characters. Stevens plays Trapper, a veterinarian specializing in gigantic monsters and Hollow Earth creatures. His charisma and on-screen presence are amusing, but his dialogue (and everyone else’s, for that matter) is atrocious. Godzilla x Kong is a Kong movie. His Hollow Earth adventure is much more interesting than Godzilla’s absorbed radiation and wait-to-be-needed approach. However, Godzilla sleeping like a cat in an abandoned coliseum in Italy is fantastic. There’s been a rumor that a Son of Kong film could be in the works, and that could certainly be a possibility after the introduction of the juvenile ape Titan Suko.  Suko is an obnoxious brat who eventually realizes that Kong is awesome and starts helping him out. Suko’s highlight is when Kong starts swinging him around as a weapon during a fight – because who hasn’t dreamt of using a misbehaving toddler as a pair of nunchucks? The film’s best part isn’t as epic as it should be. All of the Titan action is the highlight, but the special effects are often pretty wonky. The CGI struggles between having decent detail and looking blobby, rushed, and not $135 million budget-worthy. If and when another Monsterverse movie gets greenlit, you can visualize opportunities for Kong. Hollow Earth is this surreal and vast new world that audiences have barely seen. The Monsterverse version of Kong is also awesome.  Godzilla doesn’t have anything to do in future installments, so I suggest that he goes to space to fight SpaceGodzilla while Kong battles new enemies in Hollow Earth. It feels like Godzilla gets the short end of the stick more and more since King of the Monsters. Godzilla x Kong is like eating too much of your favorite candy and almost throwing up because of the stomach ache it gives you. Kong and Godzilla have never been more fabulous. Kong’s power glove and pink Godzilla are spectacular, and that anti-gravity sequence where Kong rides Godzilla all too briefly is incredible. Sadly, with its horrid dialogue, all-too-simplistic story, human characters who deserve to be mercilessly stomped or chewed on, and rough CGI, Godzilla x Kong is the definition of a lousy movie turned guilty pleasure that despite its flaws, possesses some epic moments smashing and bashing their way into kaiju royalty."
"Apr 2, 2024",neutral," Reviewed by Dennis SchwartzAdam Wingard (“Death Note”/”The Guest”) directs this overloaded special effects sequel to the 2020’s Godzilla vs. Kong, which is not better or worse than the others in the MonsterVerse franchise (this being the fifth entry, while Kong and Godzilla must have made at least 50 films).The nonsensical script is written by three writers-Terry Rossio, Simon Barrett, and Jeremy Slater, who provide set pieces, nonstop fighting among the giant creatures, and gives us a brainless but fun conclusion of the featured giant foes teaming up to fight a threatening giant monster.It opens with a lonely King Kong residing beneath the earth’s surface at Hollow Earth (the center of the planet), while Kong’s foe Godzilla, after smashing-up Rome, takes a snooze in the Roman Colosseum.The job of tracking Godzilla around the world and Kong at Hollow Earth, goes to the scientist Dr. Andrews (Rebecca Hall). Things are going well in the world when Kong and Godzilla are kept apart. But there’s no such luck that the peace between them will last. Trouble arises when the brutish giant ape, Skar King, is discovered in Hollow Earth as the leader of Kong’s missing family of apes. The evil ape threatens the world and neither Kong or Godzilla can fight him alone.Sensing trouble brewing in Hollow Earth, Dr. Andrews assembles her peace-keeper team to look in on Kong at his residence. The team includes Kong’s kaiju-handling veteran dentist Trapper (Dan Stevens) and the conspiracy theory podcaster Bernie Hayes (Brian Tyree Henry). The team uncover that Kong and Godzilla are to join forces against their common enemy Skar King.The science team’s purpose seems to be to clear up details for the viewer in the lightweight story by spewing pseudo-science nonsense and giving us comic relief when they verbally spar with each other.The subplot tells of Andrews’ adopted deaf daughter Jia (Kaylee Hottle), the sole Iwi tribe survivor on Skull Island, use her telepathic ability to connect to the lost tribe at Hollow Earth. She also uses sign language to communicate with Kong. Wingard, in his second MonsterVerse pic, is ok at using his big budget for the set designs, visuals and the CGIs needed for the many Titan fight scenes.The escapist film, however, makes no sense, and it failed to get me to care for any of the giant monsters or human characters. It’s a forgettable B-film with a giant budget and a small story, but if you’re into seeing giant monsters fight or destroy cities around the world, this film has the spectacle to deliver the goods."
"Apr 1, 2024",negative," There is rarely a good time for Godzilla to show up, but the MonsterVerse version of him could not have picked a worse moment to rampage again. Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, the fifth entry in Legendary Pictures’s slate of movies featuring lumbering kaiju and dubious continuity, arrives just weeks after Japan’s Godzilla Minus One concluded its impressive box-office run in the States. That film, made using a paltry-for-a-blockbuster budget of $15 million, took home an Oscar for Best Visual Effects and proved that audiences had a taste for a fresh spin on the Godzilla story. Maybe creatures like him could do more than merely stomp around and roar a bunch. Too bad the MonsterVerse movies prefer the stomping and roaring to actual storytelling. The films, after 2014’s Godzilla and 2017’s Kong: Skull Island established the franchise’s stars, have morphed into exercises in CGI monster-mashing. The truth is that pure spectacle has kept me on board, even as the sequels have become awfully hard to defend as actual movies. I’ve been genuinely impressed by the expressive creature design and layered sound work; the monsters’ screams often make me feel like my bones are rattling. These films may be empty—there’s no message or meaning to think about—but they can be strangely stimulating. Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, however, is the MonsterVerse at its weakest: Its spectacle is even duller than its story, which is already nonsensical. The film promises that the two titular monsters will team up—though by using x instead of an ampersand, it hints at an enemies-to-lovers beastly romance. Alas, the plot does not go there, nor do Godzilla and Kong spend much time on-screen together at all. They are meant to unite to defeat a Kong-size ape named the “Skar King.” But for most of the movie, Godzilla is on the surface of Earth, gathering more energy because he senses a threat, while Kong remains in Hollow Earth, the mysterious realm at the planet’s core in which he investigates the origins of this new simian foe. The film becomes only more frustrating to watch as the creatures get sidetracked facing off against lesser adversaries. Many of these set pieces pale in comparison to previous ones in the franchise. When Godzilla faces off against a swarm of drones, the brawl doesn’t feel suspenseful, the way the similarly staged helicopter scene in Kong: Skull Island did. When Kong fights the Skar King’s henchmen (hench-apes?), he lacks the feral energy he had tearing apart Hollow Earth’s winged predators in Godzilla vs. Kong. The film also repeatedly avoids portraying encounters it spends ample time teasing. In one scene, Godzilla heads to the Arctic Ocean and threatens a sea serpent with bioluminescent fins that emit a neon-pink glow (hell yeah!). But just as the two start snapping at each other, the movie cuts away to the ocean surface, where the serpent’s severed body emerges. The battle’s over before it’s begun, leaving the audience with none of the dizzying fun that comes from watching giant monsters clash. These movies, at their best, evoke the juvenile energy of chucking action figures at each other, making them fight. New Empire plays like an annoyingly strict babysitter, cleaning up the toys before anything wild happens. Five movies in, the franchise has clearly begun to run out of ideas for new antagonists and combat arenas. Hollow Earth, for all its iridescent landscapes, has become less breathtaking the more it’s been seen. One character calls it “a nightmare monster hellscape,” but the animated nature of the place only makes its denizens seem more fake. When Godzilla and Kong tore through Hong Kong in Godzilla vs. Kong, they were somewhat scary, the scale of the buildings emphasizing their gargantuan size. Hollow Earth serves as the setting for the bulk of New Empire, including its climax, but inside it, both monsters appear to be average beasts. No amount of wide-eyed looks on the part of actors too talented for these films—including Rebecca Hall, Brian Tyree Henry, and a lively Dan Stevens as a titan veterinarian—makes what happens exciting. Still, the film does offer a glimmer of something different from the silliness it’s been peddling. Its dialogue-free opening sequence features an afternoon in the life of Kong and rather delightfully captures why the character has been a movie star for so long: His personality is as dramatic and compelling as his size. Threatened by a pack of predators, Kong scares them off by ripping one of them apart over his head and seems disgusted when he gets drenched in the corpse’s green blood. He goes for a rinse under a waterfall, then sits in his cave, looking out with a solemn, slightly indignant expression as he tends to a toothache. Later, on Earth’s surface, Godzilla, too, takes a break. After destroying much of Rome, he curls up for a nap in the middle of the Colosseum, ignoring the helicopters spying on his every move. The MonsterVerse has turned them into vessels for delivering head-spinning visual effects and ear-splitting sound, but New Empire suggests these two do have rich interior lives—we just don’t really get to see them. In 2014, the humans insisted on having titans fight. Perhaps it’s time to let them rest."
"Apr 1, 2024",negative," Both mothers to a beloved son, they drink and smoke and moan about their husbands together. All in the most beautiful, skin tight designer dresses and high heels, worn while vacuuming the house and attending to the garden. And it is while pruning the roses Alice witnesses the horrifying death of her bestie’s young son falling from the balcony of her dear neighbour’s house. Alice quickly makes it all about her, claiming her former best mate won’t hang out with her any more. Something I had very little sympathy for, as she parades her living son around in front of her neighbour. So the set up is two women, both who have, well, issues. And only one son living between the two. And you don’t know who the baddie is — or even if there is one at all. While the dresses are to die for, neither character seems capable of breaking more than a nail without taking to their bed. They’re not believable psychopaths. FANCY feeling as though your brain has been put in a washing machine for nearly two hours? Then this new instalment from the Monsterverse might be the film for you. They have the brute force and power to do it. But not before Kong comes back to normal Earth from Hollow Earth where he now lives. Dr Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall), needs to find Kong, so along with scaredy-cat Bernie (Brian Tyree Henry), hyperactive Trapper (Dan Stevens) and her adopted daughter Jia (Kaylee Hottle) she’s off on a search in the dangerous Hollow Earth.  They need to reunite Kong with Godzilla so they can save humanity – while crushing most of it under their humongous feet in the over-long CGI fight sequences. The script is so nonsensical with the cast delivering the lines with less care than they would a pizza. Based on 2013 novel, A Marker To Measure Drift, Jacqueline’s horrific trauma of the violence to her family is played out in flashbacks and told to American tour guide Callie (Alia Shawkat). She sees more than most would in Jacqueline making their friendship instantly valuable. Erivo’s presence is commanding, her face and manner changing beyond recognition between her time in London to the homeless woman in Greece. But it is mostly the gentle lapping of the sea that you hear more than dialogue in this deeply sensitive film, where a little too much is left unsaid."
"Apr 1, 2024",negative,"By the time we get to the climatic desert battle smashing the Pyramids there’s no impact left. This is a repetitive series of chest thumping monsters, shrieking CGI, familiar characters, a thin plot, using impressive sound design with lots of campy music."

Nobody cares about the plot. That’s the arguably depressing but also self-aware lesson the King Kong/Godzilla franchise seems to have learned. After a number of entries that half-tried to create humans you cared about or allegories for whatever, 2021’s Godzilla Vs. Kong was primarily just a showcase for big things hitting each other and was far more entertaining than any of its predecessors. Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire has a greater number of big things and a smaller number of humans. Its brainless brawn is again pretty entertaining, until the credits roll and you can instantly forget the whole thing. Its set-up is that Kong is now living in the Hollow Earth, a parallel world full of giant monsters. He is lonely, continually hunting for others like him. When he eventually finds kin it’s no great family reunion. They’re led by an evil ape, who looks kind of like an orangutan going through an awkward teenage growth phase and is plotting to make his way to the world above. Thwarting this requires Kong to team up with Godzilla, who is gallumphing around the world looking for fights, and a few humans who fill in the bits between the CGI. That’s about as complex as it gets. There’s no human antagonist. There’s no significant development in the existing characters (Rebecca Hall as a scientist, Kaylee Hottle as her adopted daughter, and Brian Tyree Henry as the requisite comedy screamer). There’s a pleasing addition to the cast in Dan Stevens’ kaiju-handling veteran, introduced via a silly dental sequence, but by no stretch is he essential to the plot. It’s just an excuse for monster spectacle, as it probably should be.  The fights are slick, frequent and noisy. Godzilla destroys most of Rome and a good swathe of Egypt. Kong does battle with an ice creature in a volcanic underground lair. It’s not pushing the envelope of giant monster movies, but it’s fun. The Kong scenes are by far the best parts of the film. As he meets others of his own kind there’s an attempt to tell a story through ape grunts and CG eyes. It works. We can tell what he’s feeling. It makes you wonder whether an inevitable future film might be more interesting without any human element.  By entering your email address you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy and consent to receive emails from Time Out about news, events, offers and partner promotions.

"Apr 1, 2024",negative," The easiest reviews to write are for films that are either really good or really bad. Adam Wingard’s epic action feature, Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire, is going to be a tough one. Starting, significantly, long after Wingard’s Godzilla vs. Kong, the world is at relative peace. Kong has been exiled to Hollow Earth in search of anyone or anything who is like him. His only connections to the surface world are Dr. Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall) and little Jia (Kaylee Hottle), the last surviving member of the Iwi tribe and someone with a psychic connection with Kong. Ilene and Jia are adoptive mother and daughter, but Jia feels out of place in this world with only Ilene and Kong as her family. Meanwhile, Godzilla has established his nest at the Roman Coliseum and heads out to dispatch any Kaiju threatening to cause trouble. But something sinister is lurking of gigantic proportions. Seismic tremors vibrate across the Earth, and somehow, Jia is the only person who can figure it out. The mystery lies somewhere in Hollow Earth, and Ilene, Jia, Kaiju dentist Trapper (Dan Stevens), pilot Mikael (Alex Ferns), and YouTuber/hero of the previous film Bernie (Brian Tyree Henry) are sent to follow Kong to solve the mystery. Their search uncovers a land of Kongs, a Godzilla-like threat, and a mysticism that controls gravity on Earth. Can Godzilla and Kong put their differences aside to save the world…with minimal casualties? Yes and no. The best thing I can say about Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is that the film only lasts 110 minutes, and it feels like you get more story than one can squeeze into this runtime. With that, bland is the best word to describe this movie. As the brave, intelligent Dr. Ilene Andrews, Rebecca Hall brings almost nothing to the role other than being a single mother who’s really smart. Kaylee Hottle is Jia, who doesn’t speak and looks lovingly at Kong, which sums up her character. At least Trapper and Bernie each have an ounce of personality. Suffice it to say, the human stuff is boring. Here’s a tip for screenwriters: It’s best not to spoil your movie halfway through. There is a scene where our heroes lay out the plan for defeating the main lousy Kaiju: Do this, this, and this. Well, they do this, this, and this, and the world is saved! Classic Pixar would do the same thing, but nothing would ever go to plan, which is why Classic Pixar is considered classic. The most significant crime of Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is that it suffers the same fate as Fast and the Furious. It’s a photo-realistic computer-animated movie. The animation of Kong, Godzilla, and the other Kongs is mediocre at best. The backgrounds should look photo-realistic, but they don’t. I’d rather watch dudes in suits duke it out over a cardboard city than watch this cartoon mess again. What a regression of the story compared to Godzilla Minus One. I feel like Hollywood doesn’t want to try anymore. If you want to see a good Kong movie, go see The Primevals. Hell, try to see Godzilla Minus One again when you can. Now, we wait for Planet of the Apes. Oh, joy! Returning to our series on the cinematic history of Kaiju Monsters, Toho Studios brings us the giant monster battle King Kong vs. Godzilla.

"Apr 1, 2024",positive," Cada una de las recientes epopeyas kaiju en inglés de Legendary Pictures ha recorrido un camino diferente, y Godzilla x Kong: El nuevo imperio continúa la tradición. Se trata de una secuela directa de Godzilla contra Kong de 2021, una película sencilla inspirada en la película de Toho Studios de 1962 King Kong contra Godzilla, que enfrentaba al gran lagarto y al gran simio antes de unirlos contra un enemigo robot. Pero en lugar de limitarse a repetir la plantilla en ""El nuevo imperio"", el director Adam Wingard y sus dos guionistas ofrecen una narrativa más fragmentada y, en ocasiones, conscientemente tonta, que se entrecruzan entre líneas de acción en múltiples localizaciones que conducen a un gran enfrentamiento con un montón de criaturas. Han pasado algunos años desde que el gorila gigante Kong derrotó a Mechagodzilla y la paz ha vuelto. ¿O, no? Un puesto avanzado de Monarch ha recibido una señal que nadie puede clasificar. Y no son los únicos: Jia (Kaylee Hottle), la última superviviente de una tribu de la Isla Calavera, también la ha percibido, lo que le provoca unas extrañas visiones. Poco después, parte hacia el puesto de avanzada con su madre adoptiva, la doctora Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall), el especialista en animales Trapper (Dan Stevens) y el podcaster Bernie Hayes (Brian Tyree Henry) para echar un vistazo más de cerca. Al mismo tiempo, Godzilla también se activa y se dirige al Ártico, mientras Kong hace otro descubrimiento inesperado. Cuando se estrenó Godzilla en 2014, la gente se mostró más que escéptica de antemano. No era solo que los recuerdos de la adaptación de 1998 fueran demasiado feos, cuando Hollywood ya probó suerte una vez con el icono del cine japonés y fracasó estrepitosamente. El anuncio de que querían convertirlo de nuevo en un Universo Cinematográfico nos hizo poner los ojos en blanco. El resultado no estuvo nada mal, y llegó a recaudar más de 500 millones de dólares en todo el mundo. Y así, en contra de lo esperado, se convirtió en una respetable franquicia compuesta por varias películas y series, la más reciente Monarch: Legacy of Monsters. Godzilla x Kong: El nuevo imperio es ahora la quinta película cinematográfica de la franquicia MonsterVerse. El que el título se haya convertido en una ""x"" indica que la relación entre los dos titanes ha cambiado. Al menos en teoría. En la práctica, los dos monstruos cinematográficos apenas aparecen juntos. En general, el título también es un poco tramposo, ya que da a entender que ambos monstruos protagonistas reciben el mismo trato. Pero eso no es cierto, Godzilla x Kong: El nuevo imperio se centra claramente en el simio. Además, es él quien tendrá contacto con los humanos, mientras Godzilla hace de las suyas en otros lugares. Para los fans del simio, que debutó en 1933 con King Kong y la Dama Blanca, es una buena noticia, sobre todo porque - pequeño spoiler - no es el único simio gigante. También aparecen otras bestias gigantes, incluida otra leyenda de la pantalla y favorita de los fans. En realidad, toda la película necesitaba más contenido simiesco. Es lo que realmente impacta. La película no parece reconocer lo poderoso que es. Una película más inteligente se habría centrado en los simios y en los humanos que los siguen, tal vez excluyendo a Godzilla, que aquí es tratado principalmente como una fuerza productora de caos a la que se recurre con frecuencia porque la película lleva ""Godzilla"" en el título. (Aunque tiene sus momentos, como cuando utiliza un suplex de lucha libre profesional para golpear a un adversario y duerme acurrucado en el Coliseo Romano como si fuera la cama para perros más grande del mundo). Lo que llama la atención es que, a cambio, se presta menos atención a las personas. Mientras que algunas de las últimas películas se caracterizaban por intentar forzar algún tipo de drama interpersonal, esta vez son más comedidas. Sólo Jia es un poco más reflexiva. Por lo demás, el director Adam Wingard, especializado originalmente en el cine de terror, y su equipo de guionistas han puesto más énfasis en el entretenimiento. Dan Stevens, en particular, que ya ha demostrado su talento cómico en películas como Eurovisión: La saga de la historia del fuego, se pone las pilas como experto en monstruos en Godzilla x Kong: El nuevo imperio. Es un poco tonta a veces, pero muy entretenida. Esto también se aplica a la película en su conjunto. Quien espere algo comparable a Godzilla Minus One se equivoca, y por eso muchas críticas han sido bastante decepcionantes hasta ahora. A pesar de compartir el mismo lagarto gigante, las dos películas son difícilmente comparables. El pariente estadounidense se centra en un espectáculo llamativo. Godzilla x Kong: El nuevo imperio es una mezcla de dibujo animado de sábado por la mañana y Transformers, especialmente hacia el final, cuando tiene lugar una operación a gran escala y las casas son arrasadas como daños colaterales. El resultado es una aventura de buen humor que se ve para entretenerse durante dos horas de la forma menos exigente posible. No hay que esperar más. No hay profundidad ni mucha tensión.

"Apr 1, 2024",positive," This prologue is going to take a bit, so stay with me. The one attribute that Japanese Godzilla fans will always have over American ones is that they’re significantly more loosey-goosey with the often highly variable portrayals of the King of the Monsters on-screen. Is he an expression of Japan’s fears and the memory of cultural traumas (the atomic bombings, Fukushima, etc)? Yeah. Is he a goofy planet-protector with many silly friends and a weird little troll-son fighting against creatures from Planet X? Yeah. Is he cuddly enough that a Japanese TV show literally did an entire segment in which they granted a teenage girl her wish – to go on a date with Godzilla? Oh, you bet. He’s a cultural figure with many thematic applications and tonal variability, which is why Western audiences struggle so much with him – deprived of the original message of Ishiro Honda’s work thanks to self-imposed censorship by the importing studios, and we learned only after we headed into the campy joy of the Showa era, free from Raymond Burr interference, at American drive-ins of the original fable’s profundity. Now, there will always be purists, but one would think this would have led Western audiences to a similar acceptance of the character’s pliability. Yet we seem only able to tolerate different perspectives if they’re not the dominant ones at the multiplex: Cornball (re: fun) shit struggles to co-exist with the serious. Perhaps it’s because of our self-identification with our media – Godzilla is a part of Japanese culture, but he’s not the totality of it – or that he’s primarily limited to one medium rather than having to compete with different ideations of himself in the pages of Shonen Jump (Joel Schumacher made campy, fun, gay Batman movies, and comic book nerds hated him so much for it that they spent the better part of a decade infecting all of culture with “grittiness” in an effort for people to try and take their shit seriously). Or it’s because we’re still ashamed about how badly we fucked up our first attempt back in ’98, or that Cloverfield beat Legendary to the punch when it came to making the franchise relevant again when the conditions were pretty much primed for it a decade later. When Gareth Edwards’ Godzilla arrived in 2014, it marked the first real Western project to use the character as originally intended – cultural fears metastasized into a giant lizard creature whose wanton destruction is infinitely more preferable to the focused destruction of the other monsters out there – and single-handedly fucked everything up for whoever had to follow that up with a real sequel. King of the Monsters assumed that famous faces, heaps of melodrama, and a sprinkling of First Reformed apocalyptic ennui would be able to sustain the movie while the four monsters at its core weren’t duking it out, and it was about as wrong as one could get. The legwork hadn’t been done to build up any of these characters or any of the monsters not named “Godzilla” or “Ghidorah” – in essence, it was a sacrifice bunt meant to advance another runner to second. That runner was Kong, who got a highly-silly Monsterverse debut in 2017 when half the MCU headed to Skull Island, and whose presence set up the inevitable West vs. East showdown in 2021. We all knew Godzilla would win that fight in a heartbeat, but what people didn’t expect was that it would be one of the true-blue hits of the pandemic era, raking in dough hand-over-fist at the meager COVID box office (making $30 million opening weekend with half of the damn theaters in the country closed and the film being simultaneously dropped for free on a streaming service is an accomplishment). So, when Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire was announced, there was plenty of unearned skepticism about its prospects. And now we’re in the present. Thank you for your patience; here’s the out-and-out hot-take that you’ve been waiting for: Adam Wingard is the strongest franchise-minded filmmaker that has ever worked within these parameters, and the bleating of people like me (but not as attractive) online doesn’t change the fact that audiences are responding to his work with the character. Sure, we may be in a strike drought when it comes to new releases, but this thing – a fourth sequel with a quarter of the stars of the second in the cast, a no-name villain, essentially retreading the premise of the last movie, and it’s an Easter-Weekend release – is outperforming Gareth Edwards’ juggernaut at Thursday night previews. You can only handwave away the differences so much (and God help you if you bring up fucking inflation) – the proof will come in the receipts, and regardless of its quality, Wingard is doing something to make Western audiences interested in a domestic blend of a cultural import. My explanation for this is that Wingard, who trained in horror and genre and who has made masterpieces (You’re Next, The Guest) and flailing failures (Blair Witch, Death Note), fundamentally understands how to reach a plurality of his audience in a way not seen since the early days of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The average person who likes seeing a big lizard and a big gorilla hit each other real hard will be entertained. The child who is astonished by city-wide carnage will be… entertained. The nerd motherfucker saying the word “Kaiju” in the Year of Our Lord Two Thousand and Twenty-Four will not cop to it, but he will be entertained, at least in some part of his soul, even if he’ll find some way to screech about Godzilla Minus One’s Oscar win to everyone in shouting distance in the lobby afterward. The question is, ultimately, why has Wingard succeeded where others have failed? There are several possible answers, but chief among them is that he has a proper non-human protagonist, one that exists as a counter to the sheer-force-of-mysterious nature that is Godzilla while preserving the King’s ambiguities. Kong’s value to these movies is absurdly underrated – he’s the lone monster (excuse me, Titan) who can emote, which makes him an emotionally resonant asset, but he’s also, in this interpretation, full of enough wit and guile to make up for what he lacks in strength. I remember people dunking on Wingard’s approach when he compared Kong to John McClane, but it’s true – when you’re a big-ass ape trying to land a TKO punch on a nuclear lizard’s jaw, it’s going to take every bit of the range of motion that those opposable thumbs give you to overcome that massive disadvantage. But he’s also just more openly relatable – Wingard’s perspective on Godzilla is that he’s essentially a gigantic cat, rousing from his bed (the Coliseum in Rome) to take care of mice (giant spider creatures and such) when they get too close to his nest – so watching him suffer through a toothache or scratch his ass or whatever is just close enough to our perspective that we feel close enough to him. Besides, all the guy wants is to find a family, and that’s where the emotional fulcrum of New Empire’s story. The only problem is that that lost family, hidden in yet another Hollow Earth within the Hollow Earth itself, is under the rule of a tyrannical despot who has managed to find himself a means to control one of the most powerful monsters glimpsed on screen yet. So, Kong, Godzilla, and an unnamed third monster have to team up in order to cut this guy down to size. You may have noticed I haven’t mentioned the human characters, primarily because they’ve never been more irrelevant in the Monsterverse’s scheme of things. If you want mild human drama, Apple TV’s Monarch has you covered, but New Empire is wisely focused on the widescreen possibilities of its conflict. That’s not to say the cast is bad – any ensemble with Rebecca Hall, Bryan Tyree Henry, and Dan Stevens (doing his Ace Ventura best) is a pretty solid one – but they’re fundamentally filler in a way that doesn’t dominate the feature like it did in King of the Monsters, or how people think it does with the Edwards Godzilla (I’ll put up with dogshit dialogue for that perspective any day of the week, folks). They’re supporting roles, and although the Western takes on these movies have never really figured out that they can be swell color commentators, their main purpose is to enable our giant monsters to punch each other. So, what you get is action-packed fun that refuses to steep to Spielbergian profundity in an attempt to try and be something it is incapable of being: serious. Once a second monster comes into the mix, you have transcended the original limitations of the parable and stepped firmly into the ridiculous, and Wingard understands and embraces that. This isn’t a “turn off your brain” movie or whatever; it’s just aiming for a different pleasure center – the kind that gets you jacked up when, say, a wrestler pulls off a plastic Sting mask to reveal that it is, in fact, Sting, in full face-paint, beneath the mask. It’s clever and rewarding in a way that audiences can quantify but which can elude people who spend too much talking about the number of acts in a given story structure for a film like this. Three acts? Five acts? Eight acts? Oh, sorry, no one was paying attention — the rest of the world was paying attention to the radioactive dinosaur body-slamming a giant ape into one of the Pyramids of Giza. Please don’t think I’m dismissing intellectual endeavor here — lots of fantastic scholarship has been written about these films, but it typically comes after the fact, once the thrills have faded and culture has moved on to the next shiny blockbuster on the calendar. Indeed, this defense understands and acknowledges the frivolous nature of this type of entertainment. But is that frivolity really a bad thing? The spirit of the Showa era in the Godzilla canon was one of tightly budgeted excess, in which the way forward was through increased absurdity – a testament to the cultural creativity of the Japanese in an era in which, in the aftermath of atrocities perpetuated by and against them, they forged a new national imagination through boundless creativity. A national icon of nuclear terror (and a proverbial horseman of death, tormenting a rebuilding nation for their sins) becomes a guardian of the Earth with an array of colorful pals at his side and an entire island to house them like a big ol’ happy family. The Heisei era offers another perspective for Japanese audiences, transforming the character for a rebuilt Japan. But those original stories became meaningful enough to people worldwide that he became an icon: cartoons, comics, even squaring up against Charles Barkley in the ‘90s for a Nike ad before getting paid the highest compliment: A terrible American remake. This is Wingard’s true accomplishment: He is the lone Western filmmaker who tries to synthesize all of these eras into one specific international entertainment without any given element overwhelming the rest and his two films in this universe succeed at evoking that sustained creativity that is where the franchise gets its reputation for “fun.” There should be no guilt in indulging in these pleasures because the Puritan notion of edification-through-art is a functionally conservative one that wholly omits aesthetics, and to deny New Empire‘s successes at crowd-rousing is to ignore the hum of delight emerging from a late-night crowd as they watch a mini-van-sized tooth sail through the streets of Rio or the laughter that follows when Kong smirks at the giant ape-man whose mouth he’s just knocked it out of. This may not be the best American Godzilla film, or anywhere close to the best Kong, but it is certainly the best evocation of the Toho spirit to emerge from these shores. "
"Apr 1, 2024",positive," There is absolutely no need for any humans in “Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire.” If they were taken out along with any spoken language, this movie would still work as a rip-roaring, silly-faced good time. That’s because when it comes to monster movies no one actually cares about the people. We want spectacle and gargantuan beasts. And this movie definitely delivers on the latter. It’s the latest entry in Legendary Pictures’ MonsterVerse, which is somehow holding strong while its fellow universes over at the MCU and DCEU need serious tinkering. It helps that the headliners are two movie brands that keep adjusting to every new decade. Godzilla and King Kong rematch but it’s not a repeat of their last standoff, 2021’s “Godzilla vs. Kong.” This one goes fully camp while expanding the fight, leaving the humans with even less dimension than the monsters. In the aftermath of the events from the last movie, Kong is still running and munching through Hollow Earth, that trippy other world in our planet’s interior. The gorilla “Titan” is also suffering from a toothache. Keeping track and care of Kong is Monarch scientist Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall), who remains an adoptive mother to Jia (Kaylee Hottle), now nearing adolescence but still linked to Kong. Something is going on when Godzilla emerges once more from the ocean depths, this time stomping through Rome, apparently in search of great energy for a coming showdown. There is a strange distress signal coming out of Hollow Earth and detected by Jia. When Ilene and Jia reunite with conspiracy podcaster and Titan expert Bernie Hayes (Brian Tyree Henry), they follow Kong back into Hollow Earth accompanied by Titan veterinarian Trapper (Dan Stevens). What they find is an unexplored corner of the place along with a hidden civilization and a looming, monstrous threat preparing to attack the surface. Out of the MonsterVerse output, “Godzilla x Kong” is the title that falls most into the clichés viewers tend to associate with kaiju movies, meaning it is a lot of logic-defying beast action where people are reduced to screaming bystanders. This was always ironic considering the first ever “Godzilla” from 1954 remains a sharp allegory for the dangers of nuclear weapons and the psychological toll of Hiroshima on Japan. The atomic lizard’s home country has kept this richer storytelling tradition going as seen in last year’s Oscar-winning “Godzilla: Minus One.” The first MonsterVerse movies, Gareth Edwards’ 2014 “Godzilla,” and Jordan Vogt-Roberts’s 2017 “Kong: Skull Island,” were both unique and inventive. Director Adam Wingard is back after having made “Godzilla vs. Kong” with trippy adventure and cornball yet convincing human angles. “Godzilla x Kong” is the lesser but still retains a sense of self-referential humor, this time going for broke with over-the-top absurdity that never sits still. Sly gags work, like Kong needing to get an infected tooth pulled by Trapper. This might be a reference to 1986’s “King Kong Lives,” where the furry hero needed a heart transplant. Godzilla has also decided his prime napping spot is the Colosseum in Rome. There’s not much to say about the humans, so it’s best to get that part out of the way before going into the movie’s truly wild moments. Ilene and team are thrown into a bare bones plot that jumps around in spurts as the movie tries to stay focused on the massive beasts. Essentially, the humans are here to just explain what the story itself is. It turns out there are two new big discoveries in Hollow Earth. First, the Iwi, led by a queen (Fala Chen), worship the luminous Titan Mothra and have their own special connection to Jia. Second, the big villain is another giant ape, the Scar King, who plans a savage invasion of the surface with his chained Titan servant, Shimo. Godzilla fans know this as another giant lizard which happens to emit a deadly frost. Quite literally, the only task at hand for the humans is to stand around hilltops, yelling who is who, or decipher some cave carvings to explain why there should be a showdown between the Scar King and everyone else. The screenplay by Terry Rossio, Simon Barrett and Jeremy Slater features dialogue that’s all exposition. There’s much more character development with a small ape who befriends Kong and becomes his protégé. For audience members walking in just wanting to see well-made CGI monstrosities shake the walls in Dolby surround sound, the real movie kicks off when Godzilla and Kong throw down with the Scar King and Shimo. What these MonsterVerse movies have always had going for them, even above Marvel at times, is their genuine visual scale. The special effects never look boring and here we still get some epic popcorn sites. Kong battling Hollow Earth canines, chomping on some giant sea critter or Godzilla demolishing Rome, before sucking radiation out of a nuclear power plant somewhere else, are deliriously entertaining on their own. The Scar King inhabits a lair with cascades of lava, snarling orders we don’t need translated because his menacing rictus is enough. Climactic battles pound all over Cairo and São Paulo, with little concern for the safety of historic landmarks. No one seems to comment on how the pyramids of Giza get pretty smashed up. But that’s the tradition of kaiju flicks. Nobody watches “Gamera: Guardian of the Universe” wondering about who will pay for all the damages in Tokyo. Godzilla gets less extended screen time than Kong this time around, but once he powers up and starts to glow, he matches his foe-turned-buddy in the ensuing stompathon. Great cinema this is not. It iis not even one of the better MonsterVerse movies, but if your sole aim is to see kaiju heavy metal onscreen, “Godzilla x Kong” will work as enjoyably bad. Because the editing and visuals still have scope, playing around with the idea of size and perception, this movie also retains some inventiveness. When we see Kong and the Scar King face off, surrounded by the villain’s other ape goons, everything looks of equal size. Once they are seen by the humans, we are reminded they are giants by comparison. That is still fun in a classic Saturday morning cartoon way. Still, one hopes the next movie finds a better balance between all the players involved, large and small. The previous MonsterVerse movies featured genuine human villains representing corporate greed or the dangers of playing God. Much of these Godzilla-Kong moments almost work like a silent movie. The people become the equivalent of intrusive subtitles. A better balance will mean we can be engaged beyond just the earth-shaking roars."
"Apr 1, 2024",positive," Although both of the main characters have their origins in film rather than printed matter, GODZILLA X KONG: THE NEW EMPIRE feels more like an old-school mainstream comic book than most movie releases from Marvel or DC. The good guys are very good, the bad guys are very bad, warnings on computer systems frequently have double exclamation points, and, should an unfamiliar language need translation, one of the characters can always exhibit previously unmentioned telepathic abilities regarding fellow humans. GODZILLA X KONG: THE NEW EMPIRE is the latest in the series of interlinked movies that began with 2014’s GODZILLA and continues through 2017’s KONG: SKULL ISLAND, 2019’s GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS, and 2021’s GODZILLA VS. KONG, as well as the 2023-2024 Apple TV+ miniseries MONARCH: LEGACY OF MONSTERS. Summarizing the details would take forever, so here are the basics. Godzilla has turned out to be one of a number of giant creatures, called Titans, inhabiting the Earth. While he doesn’t interact with humans and has no respect for real estate, Godzilla will sometimes defend humanity against more hostile Titans. As a giant gorilla, Kong is fonder of people, especially young deaf Jia (Kaylee Hottle). Like Kong, Jia hails from Skull Island; she is the last known survivor of the Iwi tribe. In GODZILLA VS. KONG, Kong and Jia bonded via sign language. At the end of GODZILLA VS. KONG, the big lizard and the big ape teamed up to take down Mecha Godzilla. Godzilla then went back to the ocean depths, while Kong took off to explore the underground/alternate dimension/someplace-not-here of Hollow Earth to search for more of his kind. This is where we’re all at when GODZILLA X KONG begins. Kong is continuing to look for other giant gorillas. Jia’s adoptive mother, Dr. Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall), is one of the head scientists at Monarch, the organization that’s been studying the various Titan creatures since the 1950s. When there seems to be trouble in Hollow Earth, Ilene, Jia, eccentric but brilliant podcaster Bernie Hayes (Brian Tyree Henry, also back from GODZILLA VS. KONG), and mega-veterinarian Trapper (Dan Stevens, new to the franchise) all go there to find out what’s wrong, at the same time that something seems to be bothering Godzilla topside. Although Godzilla is first in the title, this is really Kong’s show. He gets to emote, reflect, grow as an individual, and even go on a hairy hero’s journey. (It’s a real shame the motion-capture performer is not prominently credited.) Godzilla is there mainly to serve as punctuation whenever pacing dictates that city sections have gone unstomped for too long, and of course for the climactic battle. Director Adam Wingard, back for a second go-round after VS., devised the story with Terry Rossio & Simon Barrett; Rossio is credited with the screenplay along with Barrett and Jeremy Slater. They all keep things moving at a good speed, although Wingard and the VFX team have proportional problems with one new character, whose size in relation to his surroundings is frankly confusing. We do wonder why the previously water-dwelling Godzilla is showing a taste for napping in the hot sun here, which is not addressed. It might be less of an issue of the movie were less sincerely geeky, but here it seems like something that would worry the Monarch scientists, and appears to be more for visual value than story coherence. We see lots of different monsters, which are enjoyable. It must be said that the primary villain here is a bit underwhelming, especially after the formidable King Ghidora in GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS and the gloriously absurd Mecha-Godzilla in GODZILLA VS. KONG. Still, GODZILLA X KONG proceeds pretty much as it feels like it should. We also get a lot of joy from the actors, who are all energetic and ready to set up and/or deliver punchlines with verve. It’s especially pleasing to see young Hottle, who is deaf and indigenous, hold center screen with such poise. GODZILLA X KONG: THE NEW EMPIRE has a sincere commitment to its tone, which is being huge and playful without winking directly at us. It’s straight-faced dumb fun."
"Apr 1, 2024",negative," Amid the somewhat convoluted story is a theme of teamwork, as the monsters must learn to trust one another and work together to defeat a greater evil. Story also shows importance of stepping up and offering your personal skills and services when needed. While the humans must chip in and offer their personal skills and services, characters are pretty shallow and tend to contradict themselves; e.g., Dr. Andrews at first wonders about the possibilities of the new subterranean world but at other times believes things are ""impossible."" And Bernie flips back and forth between being curious and excited about scientific possibility and behaving like a third-rate comical coward. Human characters are diverse on the surface level, though none are particularly well developed. The main human character is a female doctor (Rebecca Hall). Co-star Kaylee Hottle comes from an all-deaf family; her character, Jia, communicates with her adoptive mother via American Sign Language (ASL). Podcaster Bernie Hayes is played by Black actor Brian Tyree Henry, and Chinese-born Fala Chen plays the Iwi Queen. Rachel House, who comes from the Māori people of New Zealand, plays an important member of Dr. Andrews' team, Asian Australian actor Ron Smyck plays a member of the Hollow Earth outpost, and Black actor Kevin Copeland plays a submarine commander. Many more characters of color and women in smaller/background roles. Danger/peril and giant monster fights, with slamming, punching, choking, etc. Godzilla blows up a crab-type monster and showers yellow goo everywhere. Kong eats chunks of the creatures he's killed in battle, slurping stringy innards like spaghetti. He also rips open a hyena-type monster corpse and showers green guts all over himself. Bloody claw prints. Human attacked and eaten by sentient tree roots. Outpost attacked; dead body seen underneath wreckage. Kong takes a young ape by the foot and swings it around for use as a weapon in a fight. Kong's paw is sliced open by a sharp blade, as well as frozen and injured by frostbite. Ape heads displayed on poles. Character has a brief, angry rant about internet trolls. Infrequent uses of ""s--t,"" ""ass,"" ""hell,""  and ""damn"" and exclamatory use of ""God"" and ""oh my God."" Character calls an internet troll a ""trash bag."" Parents need to know that Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is the fifth film in Warner Bros.' MonsterVerse series. Violence, as expected, is the main issue. Expect lots of giant monster fights, with slamming, punching, and choking. Kong rips open a hyena-type monster corpse and showers green guts all over himself, and slurps up the innards of the creatures he's killed in battle. And Godzilla blows up a crab-type monster and showers yellow goo everywhere. Kong also takes a young ape by the foot and swings it around for use as a weapon in a fight. A sharp blade slices open Kong's paw, and a human is attacked and eaten by sentient tree roots. A dead body is seen underneath wreckage. Language includes infrequent uses of ""s--t,"" ""ass,"" ""hell,"" and ""damn"" as well as ""God"" and ""oh my God"" as exclamations. There's no sex or substance use of note. As usual, the monsters have more personality than the humans, and the story is too convoluted, but the big, boomy battles are fun. To stay in the loop on more movies like this, you can sign up for weekly Family Movie Night emails. In GODZILLA x KONG: THE NEW EMPIRE, peace has been established, with Kong living in the subterranean realm of Hollow Earth and Godzilla roaming the surface world. Dr. Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall) keeps tabs on them both while raising young Jia (Kaylee Hottle), the last surviving Iwi from Skull Island. Suddenly, Kong returns to the surface with a toothache, and Dr. Andrews calls in veterinarian Trapper (Dan Stevens) to help. Meanwhile, Godzilla stirs and starts traveling the world, absorbing enormous amounts of power. Dr. Andrews, Jia, Trapper, monster podcaster Bernie Hayes (Brian Tyree Henry), and pilot Mikael (Alex Ferns) accompany Kong back to Hollow Earth. There, Kong finally discovers a tribe of apes like himself, while the humans stumble upon evidence of an ancient civilization of Iwi. Everything leads up to a major showdown against an evil ape leader; to defeat him, Godzilla and Kong must bury the hatchet and work together. Par for the course for the MonsterVerse series, the monsters have more personality than the humans, but at least watching them battle and smash things has some visceral entertainment value. Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire has to find some way to get the two big guys to join forces, and it's a convoluted process, with so many steps—including a ""chosen one"" and a prophecy—that the humans are mostly just there as exposition machines who must keep explaining the plot every time the camera points at them. As a result, they're reduced to familiar cardboard cutout types. Brian Tyree Henry has the hardest job, whipping back and forth between being a nerd who's both excited about discovering all this monster stuff and a whimpering coward, like something right out of an old Abbott & Costello movie. That said, the Hollow Earth design is truly gorgeous, and the monster fights (which include some new guest stars) land with a concrete impact. Truthfully, the computer-generated characters are so much better at telling the story, with their wordless gestures and expressions, that Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire might have been better without any humans in it at all. But its biggest challenge may be that it's being released just months after the Oscar-winning Godzilla: Minus One, which was made for around a 10th of the cost of this one and is certainly 10 times better. There's more to monster movies than smashing. Families can talk about Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire's violence. How did it make you feel? Was it exciting? Shocking? What did the movie show or not show to achieve this effect? Why is that important? The first Japanese Godzilla filmmakers used monster suits and miniatures to create their special effects, not CGI.

"Apr 1, 2024",negative," I had no idea walking into “Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire” that I was about to sit through two hours of CGI brawling behemoths in a rock opera.  OK, it's not explicitly a rock opera, but its 80s-inspired synthetic score and a handful of throwback hits set over irreverent action sequences give the film an added boost of energy that, accounting for its flimsy premise and lackluster human character development, is essential to keeping viewers awake. It's the Marvel effect; if you've seen ""Thor: Ragnarok"" or any ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" film, then you'll understand why director Adam Wingard has taken the initiative to pump up the volume on his second film in this franchise.  After all, the law of cinematic attraction clearly states that any movie with a weak plot is made instantly more appealing when its video is overlayed with decades-old, nostalgia-laden audio. There is an instant spray of pheromones pumped into the theater when Godzilla and Kong hit their stride, pummeling their opponents to a kickin' beat.  Godzilla and Kong were pitted against one another in the last film. This one opens in Hollow Earth (a world below ours), where Kong lives without fear of attack from his nemesis Godzilla, who patrols the world above. But Kong is bored, spinning his wheels with local battles until another crack in his subterranean home reveals yet another hidden universe. Godzilla, ever the giant teddy bear-human babysitter, spends his days battling the previously released Titans that threaten humanity until there is an abrupt change in his behavior. He can sense a threat brewing, and it takes his human keepers at Monarch, the secret multi-national governmental unit tasked with studying the monsters, an embarrassing amount of time to catch up. Godzilla and Kong will be united against one adversary: the Scar King, a deranged colossal orangutan who has been plotting to escape his sub-sub-realm to decimate the humans and live in the sun's warmth. Rebecca Hall returns as Ilene Andrews, a scientist at Monarch and adoptive mother to Jia (Kaylee Hottle), the last person from the Iwa tribe who were the ancient keepers of Kong on Skull Island. Dan Stevens stars as a comic relief, rock 'n' roll cowboy veterinarian, and Brian Tyree Henry returns as Bernie, the conspiracy theorist and podcaster who, incredibly, becomes Dr. Andrews' first line of defense when Jia starts having eery premonitions. Of all the points at which audiences must suspend their disbelief in a film about skyscraper-sized amphibians and apes, there is no moment as incredible as when Dr. Andrews casually agrees to allow Bernie, a civilian, on her very classified mission to Hollow Earth. It's a small plot point, but one that speaks volumes to the film as a whole: ""Godzilla x Kong"" has no interest in manifesting any form of reality. Is this too much to ask of it? Should we only expect escapist entertainment? Perhaps releasing in the direct shadow of ""Godzilla Minus One,"" which won an Oscar for its visual effects, does not help its cause. ""Godzilla x Kong"" cannot be compared to the latter and isn't attempting to compete. This is pure Monsterverse fantasy. The plot is a means to an end, a mode of transport to watching our titular giants pulverize Rio de Janeiro and tail-slap one another.  It's never been more clear that the live-action characters are more hindrance than interest, ancillary pests we are required to cut to every few scenes. Much of the film's runtime is set in Hollow Earth, a Looking Glass mutation of the Upside Down from ""Stranger Things."" A crossover of ""Jurassic Park"" and ""Journey to the Center of the Earth."" If you saw the Pixar flop ""Strange World,"" you could make a heavy argument that the oddities in Hollow Earth are moving body parts of a larger organism or some other silly twist. Above all, it feels very derivative, an unoriginal amalgamation of various other fictional worlds in our pop culture lexicon.  There is some good, and by ""good,"" I mean something of interest to some viewers. Despite Godzilla's top billing, Kong is the feature here, and he's a much fleshier, sympathetic character than in the last film.  His search for belonging — a mission parallel to Jia's, who also discovers her own tribe in that mystical capsule of under-the-crust space — garners the minimal amount of empathy and affinity a film would need to connect its viewer with its subject. There are some new, cute animal characters with enough expressive know-how to give a generally mute population of monkey mutants a voice without words.  Overall, however, the overwhelming amount of CGI was like watching a strobe light in a mirrored room. There is simply too much going on: multiple generated monsters, the many strange intricacies of Hollow Earth, fast-moving cameras and quick action sequences. It was a chore for my eyes to keep up.  The film spends at least half its runtime in a CGI-created world, following CGI-created characters and placing its live-action characters against a green screen. If I wanted to watch an animated feature, I'd catch an encore of ""Kung Fu Panda 4."" The few interesting moments, particularly the big tag-team finale that is the Godzilla-Kong versus Scar King showdown, is undermined by all the aforementioned inadequacies. Mothra, a longtime super-insect in the Godzilla universe, makes a fluttery, unremarkable appearance as a marketed savior. If, like me, you're a non-Godzilla/Kong expert, don't enter the theater expecting much more than some nifty fight sequences trapped in a hollow shell of a film."
"Apr 1, 2024",neutral,"While always nice to see some kaiju fisticuffs in the daylight and away from water, the film still suffers anytime the humans are center stage even if none are to be found amongst the obvious casualties lowering the stakes considerably."
"Apr 1, 2024",positive," Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire--2021's Godzilla vs. Kong began with Bobby Vinton's ""Over the Mountain, Across the Sea"" on the soundtrack, as Kong showered in a waterfall to start his day. This new saga starts with Jim Reeves singing ""Welcome to My World"" as the super simian lopes through his new home at the center of the earth. Things aren't so bucolic for the big ape; he's plagued with dental pain, harassed by hideous creatures and, assuming he's the last of his kind, he's lonely. Meanwhile, up on the Earth's surface, Godzilla is keeping busy. He vanquishes a spidery Lovecraftian nightmare in the streets of Rome and then, rather adorably, he curls up to get some shuteye in the Colosseum like it's a cat-bed. In other words, this is the second American kaiju flick in a row that declines to take itself too seriously. Is it as good as last year's startlingly sober Japanese national rumination Godzilla Minus One? Not remotely. Is it even as good as Godzilla vs. Kong? Probably not. But it's still plenty of fun. Kong plumbs an unexplored region of the Hollow Earth where he meets an endearing mini-Kong and others of his own kind. They're enslaved by Skar King, a vicious ape dictator, and his brutal goons. Kong understandably feels the need to act. Along for the ride are a few humans, including Rebecca Hall, returning as the Kong-ologist from the previous film, Kaylee Hottle as her beautiful, pained-looking adopted daughter, the last known Skull Islander, Brian Tyree Henry as the conspiracy-minded podcaster and Dan Stevens as a cocksure kaiju veterinarian. But the focus is less on humans here than even in the earlier films in the series. As preposterous as Godzilla x Kong is, it's also genuinely and freewheelingly imaginative. Director Adam Wingard and his gaggle of co-screenwriters give us scenes of Kong sauntering among the Pyramids, or Mothra over Rio, or Kong taking a belly-flop dive from the summit of Gibraltar, that seem to owe more to cheerful whimsy than to logical plotting. Still, without too much straining, one could even tease out an allegorical political subtext here. It's not hard to guess who the mangy, patchy, orange-furred King Skar might symbolize, but the source of his tyrannical power has a parallel, too. Skar maintains his rule because he holds in bondage a huge, spiky, frosty-pale monster with freezy breath. This behemoth started to remind me of a certain currently subjugated Grand Old Party. There was also something I liked about this movie's ending: It has one. It doesn't have twenty. When the dramatic arc has been satisfied, Godzilla x Kong doesn't keep piling on extra codas, as if panicky it hasn't given us enough. It wraps things up in under two hours and gets out while the getting is good. Let it serve as an example to future big franchise movies."

"Mar 31, 2024",negative," We are living in a Godzillaissance, and Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire continues on the trend of resurrecting Godzilla and Kong as characters and monsters for a new generation of moviegoers. The script is nothing more than exposition to buy time before the next CGI Titan fight. Maybe that’s all you are here for anyway… I dunno. Much of this just feels like you’re watching someone play a really loud and impressive video game of Big Beast Go Fight and Smash. After awhile, with the stilted dialogue and uninteresting developments, the popcorn and snacks only get you so far. December’s Oscar-winning Godzilla Minus One did more for the Godzilla franchise in 15 minutes than this movie does to sustain any legacy, other than someone saying: “Godzilla x Kong? Do they fight together? Are they in the same movie again? Didn’t Ghostbusters just make a movie with ‘Empire’ in the title?” A soulless, empty endeavor, full of CGI monsters beating the hell out of each other, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire spins its wheels in an effort to create a massive spectacle of mayhem and excitement. Well, certainly we have mayhem, not so much on the excitement part.Perhaps Adam Wingard’s new film suffers from the euphoria that surrounded Godzilla Minus One, the Oscar-winning stunner which made Godzilla a villainous behemoth and immersed audiences into a parallel universe where the tension felt earned, the visual effects beyond impressive on a limited $15 million budget and a cinematic experience that Nicole Kidman waxes poetic about in her AMC Theater ads.In all seriousness, though there are some nice moments in Godzilla x Kong, this is a movie that simply uses exposition and surface-level storytelling as a means to get to Godzilla battling massive beasts around the world and Kong returning to Hollow Earth. This is where our core group of four main characters make a number of new discoveries and continue their quest in attempting to understand Kong’s history, the lineage of a young girl, and how one character will amass enough audio and video footage for his blog and podcast. (This is a plot point.)Do we even call things “blogs” in 2024? I digress.For those who may have missed 2021’s Godzilla vs. Kong, which arrived during the pandemic and was released on HBO Max and in theaters at the same time, Wingard catches us all up on what we may have missed the last go ‘round. That’s helpful. This allows us to dive right into the meat of the matter if you will. Kong is in Hollow Earth, co-existing in a world that is both impressive and menacing, while Godzilla fights the mutant “Titans” who seemingly try to destroy humankind. After one such victory, he curls up for a nap to sleep off the battle. Of course, as one does, he naps inside the Colosseum. However, Godzilla is also seemingly drawn to nuclear power plants and radiation sites. He’s powering up for something, and scientists are at a loss. Meanwhile, Dr. Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall) is made aware of strange behavior at school by her adopted daughter Jia (Kaylee Hottle). Jia is drawing patterns and appearing to black out, or go into a trance of sorts, while doing so. Concerned, Dr. Andrews remembers she’s seen these patterns before and they relate to the Iwi Tribe, Jia’s lineal descendants who were defeated years before.At this point, it feels like maybe we have something - like screenwriters Terry Rossio, Jeremy Slater and Simon Barrett are going to mix and match a compendium of subplots and create something that immerses us into this otherworld of adventure and mystery. And I will say, when impressive visual effects are the best thing this movie has going for it, you best believe that Hollow Earth looks incredible, the creatures and beasts and CGI is flawless and the film is impressively staged.  A soulless, empty endeavor, full of CGI monsters beating the hell out of each other, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire spins its wheels in an effort to create a massive spectacle of mayhem and excitement.

Both films feature monsters who can freeze anything in its path. It’s too bad the Ghostbusters couldn’t have hitched a ride to help with the mission that Andrews, radical veterinarian Trapper (Dan Stevens) and bumbling podcaster Bernie (Brian Tyree Henry) take up on behalf of Earth and all its people. At times, I wondered what would happen if Godzilla and Kong and whatever they were up against just destroyed everything in its path. I kind of want that movie. A MonsterMania style destruction the likes of which we have never seen.

Then what? Who survives? How does a world essentially run by the monsters who destroyed society as we know it adapt, evolve, and cultivate a future?Maybe someday we will have someone brave enough to make that movie.

To have a successful garden, you need to know when it is the best time to plant. Here are the best plants to start in May."
"Mar 31, 2024",negative," This sequel to the big monkey versus big lizard smackdown (2021’s Godzilla vs Kong) finds Kong moping in Hollow Earth while Godzilla listlessly lumbers around the surface world. But it would take more than a geologically improbable parallel dimension to keep these two apart, and returning director Adam Wingard ups the ante with yet more huge, furious creatures. Rebecca Hall, as titan specialist Ilene, is mainly required to explain the plot between battle sequences; Brian Tyree Henry, playing monster-blogger Bernie, provides incredulous double-takes; Dan Stevens’s Trapper brings Hawaiian shirts and devil-may-care rashness to the mix. Dumbed-down and stripped of the symbolic subtext of the earlier movies, the picture is not without seat-shuddering thrills, but it’s like a tag-team wrestling bout for monsters rather than a picture with meaning and even a modicum of thought."
"Mar 31, 2024",negative," For several entries, the series dubbed by Warner Brothers as
the “Monsterverse” has been declining into Transformers territory. Godzilla
x Kong marks the point at which that dreaded barrel-bottom has been
reached. A numbing excursion into CGI carnage, the film does an adequate job of
presenting monster-on-monster action while completely ignoring the human cost
of, for example, a Battle Royale in and around Rio de Janeiro (the Christ the
Redeemer statue survives; they same can’t be said for the Pyramids of Giza in a
separate fight). There’s a sense of diminishing returns in these American productions
– a growing sameness to the action that swapping the participants can’t change.
The best Monsterverse battle to-date remains the Godzilla/Ghidorah clash in King of the Monsters.  Perhaps the greatest hurdle for this movie to overcome is
the existence of Godzilla Minus One. The best big-screen Godzilla excursion
in years, it reminds viewers what a real Godzilla movie can be like. Godzilla
x Kong doesn’t come close. Godzilla Minus One has heart. It has
scope. And, most important of all, the title creature engenders a sense of awe.
There’s nothing of the sort in this fifth Monsterverse chapter. Godzilla is
still a little “off” and Kong (the “King” is never used) is almost as big an
imposter (emphasis on “big” – he’s ten times the size he was in 1933) as the
sad-sack version in Toho’s 1962 King Kong vs. Godzilla.  The story – if it can be called that – picks up a few years
after the conclusion of Godzilla vs. Kong. Kong has gone deep underground
into his Hollow Earth home to look for others of his kind. He’s getting lonely
and has developed a toothache. Meanwhile, Godzilla is running around on the
surface, occasionally causing upset such as when he decides to turn the Coliseum
in Rome into a bed (curled up like a cat, he fills it up). Eventually, it
becomes apparent that Kong is not alone in his milieu – there are a whole bunch
of other giant gorillas ruled over by the cruel, vicious Skar King. When Kong
challenges him for rule of the troop, the Skar King reveals his secret weapon: Shimo,
a captive ancient titan capable of controlling and channeling cold. To defeat
him, Kong must return to the surface and find a way to bring Godzilla into
Hollow Earth. Oh, there are some humans running around as well. They don’t
serve much purpose beyond providing exposition and occasionally moving the plot
forward. Returning characters include Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall), a Monarch
scientist; Bernie Hayes (Brian Tyree Henry), a conspiracy-loving podcaster; and
Jia (Kaylee Hottle), the mute child with a special connection with Kong. Newcomers
include Trapper (Dan Stevens), a kaiju dentist; and Mikael (Alex Ferns), a
no-nonsense military pilot. The movie tries to develop an adoptive
mother/daughter storyline between Ilene and Jia, with the latter trying to “find
her place,” but it’s done in such a clunky, unsubtle way that it loses all
possible emotional impact. In truth, Kong’s interactions with a young gorilla are
as affecting.  It's tempting to say that Godzilla x Kong is the
worst written of the major kaiju movies but that would be short-sighted. This
is, after all, a franchise that included (among other gems) Destroy All
Monsters, which is best watched drunk, stoned, or both. The level of
plotting and dialogue evident in Godzilla x Kong are on par with the
worst of Michael Bay’s Transformers travesties. Godzilla x Kong
would have been better if it had been 100% CGI with no people whatsoever. Then
it could have concentrated more on the thing people see these movies for in the
first place. No one goes to a Godzilla movie for Rebecca Hall.  Anyone seeing Godzilla x Kong may be disappointed by Godzilla’s
arc. He doesn’t do much except romp around, engaging in the occasional bout of
destruction and “fighting” other titans. His goal is supercharging himself so his
dorsal plates turn a pretty pink/purple. Kong, meanwhile, gets a lion’s share
of the screen time as he searches for others of his kind then tries to prevent
the Hollow Earth apocalypse from spilling over to the outer world. He gets to
try his hand at parenting (in sequences that director Adam Wingard improbably
says were inspired by Three Men and a Baby) and re-connects with Jia
when he goes to see the dentist.  As with other Godzilla movies, this recalls earlier films.
Unfortunately, most aren’t the best associations. A lot of the Kong material causes
a bad acid trip flashback to the 1986 monstrosity King Kong Lives (there
are far too many similarities for this to be coincidental, although the
mechanical heart has been replaced by an artificial tooth). And the Godzilla
stuff doesn’t exactly resurrect memories of the King of Monsters at his best –
more like when he was tangling with things like the Smog Monster (a.k.a. Hedorah)
during the 1970s. Tone is something Wingard struggles with. Although the best
Godzilla movies have been serious endeavors with allegorical elements, the team-ups/smackdowns
have tended toward high camp with WWE-style flourishes. Starting with King Kong vs. Godzilla, the Toho-produced movies grew increasingly silly during
the Showa era. Had Godzilla x Kong fully embraced this tone rather than
trying for things like “emotional resonance,” it might have been more
enjoyable. However, while there are comedic/satirical aspects, the movie as a
whole takes itself too seriously. When watching something like this, I occasionally feel like
deferring to my eight-year-old monster movie-loving self. I think that version
of myself would have been a little bored by the lengthy periods of setup then delighted
by the three big battles (Kong vs. King Scar, Kong vs. Godzilla redux, Kong/Godzilla/Mothra
vs. King Skar/Shimo). But even for those who have an orgasmic reaction to kaiju
confrontations, far too little of the film is devoted to them and the
overreliance on CGI leeches away the immediacy and awe associated with the spectacle.
This isn’t as bad as the 1998 Godzilla misfire but it’s perilously
close. If there are to be any more Monsterverse movies (something I don’t favor),
turn them over to Takashi Yamazaki. He knows how to do it right."
"Mar 30, 2024",positive," When a burst of seemingly random radio interference is identified by Monarch — an ignored predictor of previous kaiju confrontations — everyone is on high alert… especially Godzilla, who appears to be powering up for a coming battle somewhere on Earth’s surface. Jia (Kaylee Hottle), the last surviving member of the Iwi tribe from Skull Island, also appears to be attuned to the warning signal, a source of worry for her guardian Dr. Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall). Safe from a certain overgrown nuclear lizard, a lonely Kong has been searching The Hollow Earth for remnants of his own kind and finding nothing… until an uncharted subterranean region becomes exposed. Along with “Titan Truth” podcaster Bernie Hayes (Brian Tyree Henry) and Titan vet tech Trapper (Dan Stevens), Ilene and Jia follow the unique signal into The Hollow Earth, but when an ancient threat rises to the occasion, it may take more than Godzilla and Kong putting aside their differences to save us all. Warner Bros. and Legendary have unleashed their newest Titan-powered spectacle with director Adam Wingard following up on his previous entry Godzilla vs. Kong. The initial teasers for the new film featured a mechanical appendage for Kong and Godzilla swapping his trademark blue atomic power for Barbie pink, fueling online speculation — and what’s all this The New Empire nonsense looking like Iron Maiden is about to drop anther new album? Apple TV+ watchers who’ve absorbed season one of “Monarch: Legacy of Monsters” may be wondering how any or all of that backstory fits in with this fifth installment of the MonsterVerse franchise. With a significantly lower reported budget than previous installments and moviegoers itching for an excuse to invade their local multiplex instead of staying home with a simultaneous HBOMax release, how big could The New Empire get on the heels of successes Dune Part 2 and Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire… and yes, even last year’s Godzilla Minus One? While this film may only be the next big loud theater entry to more casual moviegoers, detail-obsessed fans of the MonsterVerse are in for a treat. Not only does New Empire look incredible with splashes of color and marked improvements in VFX, it boasts the craziest battles since King of the Monsters. In context, even the weirdest glimpses from the trailers make sense, and the story is amazingly easy to follow considering huge swaths of time between human dialogue sequences. The Titans are front and center this time, from a sleepy downtime Godzilla to an overwhelmed and driven Kong. Viewers can feel the emotion coming from these creatures, including a perfect “I’m too old for this shit” expression when Kong realizes he has to confront Godzilla (again). There are a couple of surprises, too, which won’t be spoiled here, but with so many secrets being divulged out of Monarch’s media control, the ending of this latest entry means there are plenty of directions to go from here… as long as audiences keep showing up. Last year’s Oscar-winning Godzilla Minus One was a great war movie that just happened to include Godzilla; it isn’t part of the Legendary MonsterVerse and exists independently from it (in spite of all the inspiration drawn from Toho). New Empire is exactly what it claims to be: a fun ride at the movies as a shared experience. The attention to detail for the CGI designs and the practical sets are Easter eggs all their own, from a despondent Kong trying to make a social connection to Bernie Hayes’ scruffy podcast-central home. Whenever a portal from The Hollow Earth opens up near a new un-MUTO-touched city, it’s giggle-worthy hearing the collective groan of the audience knowing what’s about the happen there… and unable to look away. It’s also a nice touch the way Monarch has evolved to go with the flow of their hero Titans rather than stand against them, although they too often seem to be the last in the know considering their chosen role as Earth’s gatekeepers. The human characters exist for context, exposition, and to lend a helping hand when necessary — which is exactly perfect — while world governments look for excuses to cut funding to the very folks best able to help out — which is spot on. Make no mistake: New Empire is a destructive slugfest spectacle delivering what audiences want and will cheer for: the unearthly beasts previously thought of as fanciful scribbles in uncharted waters. To quote Captain Barbossa, “You’re off the edge of the map, mate. Here, there be monsters.” Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is rated PG-13 for creature violence, action, and figuring the big guys will go out for a beer afterward."
"Mar 30, 2024",positive," Ok, so let’s get into the math and start with that title equation, the most baffling since Ballistics: Ecks Vs Server. I get that the word ‘empire’ must test well with the algorithms, because Adam Wingard’s latest installment of Universal’s Monsterverse follows on from Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire, and there’s nothing particularly empirical about either of them. But how do you even say this? Apparently the ‘X’ is silent? So I’ve been saying Godzilla Times Kong, which is apparently wrong, but what else does an “X’ mean? Godzilla Loves Kong? Godzilla Kissy Kissy Kong? It’s not VS any more since Godzilla and Kong are batting for the same team in this slam-bang monster mash for the holidays. So of course there’s all sorts in Hollow Earth, including a telekinetic tribe, other Kongs and another titan to fight. Despite top billing, Godzilla doesn’t figure much even though we’re told his ‘vitals are surging’ which sounds painful; he’s running down the clock with time-wasting, using the Coliseum in Rome as a crash pad in between minor kaiju fights but pressed into service as various factions converge for a monster smack-down amongst Egypt’s pyramids in the final scenes. There’s more jukebox music (Kiss, Golden Earring, Badfinger) from several generations ago, comedy relief/antagonism from Dan Stevens as a silly sausage Englishman gibbering about ‘funny turns’, adverts for Volkwagen, and Alex Ferns turns up to give us yet another comedy Scot with a less-than-radical reworking of the hoariest clichés about Scottish aggression; ‘I’m going to take your camera and shove it up your arse,’ he cries seconds before being gobbled up by something or other. I’ve reviewed all of the Monsterverse projects at three stars and this one is no different; for all the talk of ‘something we’ve never encountered’, it’s all much of a muchness. These new titans are ‘world protectors’ and the one here ‘caused the ice age’ but one giant lizard is much like another and it’s up to Mothra, after a phoned-in, two-line intro, to shake things up as a late substitute much as Mechagodzilla did in the previous film. Most of the Hollow Earth creatures have green snot for blood, which makes the fights seem less violent, and returning characters make small talk about their new hairstyles and run into each other’s backs like the Hair Bear Bunch when confronted with the next disposable monster. Hollow Earth is something of a bore, with no sense of scale; watching Kong face off against a bunch of other apes, they might as well just be normal sized, and I could have done without Kong’s wee ginger-nut pal pictured above who can FRO as far as I’m concerned. Something of a stop-gap while we figure out what comes after superhero blockbusters, Godzilla Twitters Kong is a serviceable continuation of a crowd-pleasing if unexceptional franchise;  brief, bland, just about passable holiday fare. I actually left the theatre with a headache earlier today. It was Transformers and Man of Steel all over again. I recall, towards the end, actually wishing the human characters would have another scene to break it up a bit. Takes a lot for me of all people to be so harsh on Godzilla films for how much a fan of I am. But this film was so bad I literally left the theatre physically worst off. Don’t even know how to start writing my own review of it yet! I had forgot to mention… My theory on the titles ‘X’ is that the director’s cut of this film will only be available on select adult websites. Godzilla Minus One may have been the very best film I saw last year. Saw it in black & white, and I think ultimately it may be a “mic drop” moment for me as far as future Godzilla films. I’d seen them all up until it, but I don’t think I need to see any more. High praise! I don’t understand why they didn’t run an awards campaign in the UK, but did in the US, but that’s how I missed it. Have been looking forward to it for months, very annoying. Saw this film yesterday. For me, perhaps the worst Godzilla movie I’ve seen . Now I know enough to not compare it to the epic Godzilla Minus One. I’m talking comparing it to any other Godzilla films made from say 1985 on. Bad, bad, bad. And…bad. But from an outsider’s perspective, you including a link to a movie on your site in every single comment you’ve made comes across as incredibly spammy. Talk about those other movies, but it looks like 100% self-promotion with the link every time. Fair point. I’m not trying to spam links. Just sharing my content that’s all. But if you have a problem with it, I understand.  You’re not the first person to confront me about this. I will leave it to the blog to decide whether to accept or reject my comments. Not self promotion. A way of sharing my love for films with the world. Thanks for the comment. However, I just feel that it’s a useful way of sharing content. I don’t allow comments on my website anymore due to cyberbullying. I’ve had enough of WordPress which isn’t a very nice platform for promoting content. But I will try and keep links to my website to a minimum. Thank you for making me aware of the issue. “Minus One” is pure japanese Godzilla, far away from the Warner monsterverse, and I confirm it’s great. So is the 2016 “Shin Godzilla” directed by Hideaki Anno, father of Evangelion. Jumping in here….
Have you seen the original Evangelion and the 4part movie reboot? I’m wondering if the reboot is worth the time to watch. I have a pretty high tolerance for this sort of crap, but from the look of the trailer even this may be testing it. So much crap out there. This demo site is only for demonstration purposes.

"Mar 30, 2024",negative," ‘Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire’ is a fresh tale of kaijus vs. kaijus as the (subjectively) enormous titans fight for the fate of humanity. The world is full of dangers from manmade weapons to ecological disasters. But in the world of movies, there’s another unpredictable threat capable of mass destruction that’s nearly impossible to stop: kaijus. With military forces barely able to make a scratch, these giant monsters’ only natural enemies are each other. Like aliens in our domain, they don’t belong. In some cases, humans disrupted the creatures’ native habitats or, worse still, ripped them from their homes and brought them into strange cities. In other instances, sensing the environmental harms being intensified around the globe, they arose from their deep slumbers to make things right. In Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, a fresh set of titans enter the arena. Monarch is the government agency tasked with monitoring kaiju activity in and around Earth, and Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall) is the head of the team that watches over Kong in Hollow Earth. Her adopted daughter, Jia (Kaylee Hottle), maintains a strong connection with the colossal ape, but she’s having issues fitting into her new life on the surface. Meanwhile, Godzilla serves as humanity’s protector against the other kaijus that wreak havoc around the globe. However, there is an unidentified signal putting everyone and everything on edge. But with the help of conspiracy theorist Bernie (Brian Tyree Henry) and kaiju vet Trapper (Dan Stevens), Illene and Jia are going back to Hollow Earth to figure it out. Whether it’s a warning or call for help, there is something else coming and the titans are preparing for the battle of a century. Director Adam Wingard primarily made horror movies before entering the epic Monsterverse, first pitting the giant icons against each other and now placing them on the same side of a larger-than-life war. There’s a few separate stories unfolding for most of this picture as everyone is on their own mission to prepare for what’s coming, before their paths finally converge at the end. It’s big and the battles result in unparalleled destruction across several major cities, leaving audiences in wonder and bewilderment at the devastation that has become acceptable collateral damage for coexisting with these creatures. However, in spite of the immensity of the characters, the film has a major issue with scale. These monsters are supposed to be hundreds of stories tall, but in many of the scenes it’s difficult to determine how big they really are. The camera angles do not covey size and unless they’re framed next to a skyscraper or human, there’s no way to gauge the kaijus’ enormity, which diminishes some of the narrative’s awesomeness. Nonetheless, the action sequences do not disappoint and the city battles are where their magnitude is most apparent and applicable. To further up the ante, Godzilla has levelled up with new atomic breath and Kong is sporting a shiny mech hand that makes him even stronger. The presence of an unexpectedly upbeat soundtrack that includes Loverboy’s “Turn Me Loose” and KISS’ “I Was Made for Lovin’ You” also adds a layer of entertainment to these scenes.

"Mar 30, 2024",positive," There’s about half an hour of amusingly goofy material in Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, but the movie is nearly two hours long, so your mileage may vary. Arriving on the heels of Godzilla Minus One—an emotional war drama from Japan’s Toho Studios—this American kaiju cousin takes more after Godzilla’s late “Showa” era, in the ‘60s and ‘70s, with its action-figure sensibility. Unfortunately, the iconic lizard ends up backgrounded for most of the movie, but its incarnation of King Kong has enough of a human spark to be charming and fun. Godzilla x Kong is the latest entry in Warner Bros.’ ongoing “MonsterVerse,” which turns 10 this year. The series features an electric Godzilla reboot, a deviously fun Kong re-imagining (Skull Island), a middling kaiju mashup (Godzilla: King of the Monsters), an underwhelming crossover (Godzilla vs. Kong) and even a Godzilla show on Apple TV (Monarch: Legacy of Monsters). There’s a definite continuity between them—characters tend to cross over between films, though they seldom last more than two entries—but you needn’t be too concerned with who’s who. Kong is the main event, and he isn’t the only “Titan” around. On the human side of things, the last film’s monster expert Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall) returns alongside her adopted daughter Jia (Kaylee Hottle)—a mute Indigenous girl who shares a special connection with Kong—and they inexplicably seek the help of returning conspiracy radio host Bernie Hayes (Brian Tyree Henry), who still has a chronic case of The Quips (symptoms include: a lack of sincerity in the face of beauty, and the compulsive need to make wry observations about the movie you’re in). Their roles largely involve extraneous set up. However, while it takes the movie about an hour to even establish its central premise, from there on out, things get kind of wacky. The film is largely set within Hollow Earth, the subterranean realm introduced in 2021’s Godzilla vs. Kong, where enormous, Kong-sized flora and fauna run wild, free of human influence. Kong is content down there, but as the last of his species, he’s on the lookout for more giant apes, though none seem to exist. You know what they say, though: be careful what you wish for. After Jia begins experiencing psychic visions, which Ilene and Bernie learn are underground distress signals, they join up with a roguish monster-veterinarian, Trapper (Dan Stevens having the time of his life in a Hawaiian shirt), and head down into Hollow Earth to see what’s going on. None of this is very interesting, and the film seems to rocket past any jokes, conversation, exposition, or even shots of objects and creatures that might make it feel remotely coherent. Don’t leave just yet, though. Near its hour mark, Kong goes off on his own subterranean adventure and he does, in fact, discover a society of giant apes like himself. He fights some of them—he even throws a giant baby orangutan at them, who he then befriends!—and he seeks to free the rest of them from the clutches of a tyrannical, red-furred ape known as the Scar King, who wields a whip made of a serpent’s spine, and psychically controls his own ice Godzilla, with whom he hopes to escape to the surface world and unleash a new ice age. No, you aren’t having a stroke. Yes, that’s the real premise of this movie. In the absence of boring human characters, who take the time to explain every image on screen—as if the studio notes had insisted that audiences are complete morons—these dialogue-free sections, focused entirely on the giant apes, are a ludicrous delight. It takes a long time to get there, but seeing the lanky Scar King posing like an androgynous anime villain speaks to the kind of movie that director Adam Wingard truly wants to make: one where image and body language pop, and the action involves over-the-top theatrics. Kong wields a bone ax with a Godzilla scale for a blade. Godzilla suplexes Kong into a Great Pyramid when they finally come face to face, as though they were played by pro-wrestlers in chunky costumes (recalling Godzilla’s man-in-monster-suit roots). Unfortunately, the film Wingard is allowed to make ends up restrained by the kind of production issues that have plagued modern Hollywood for several years. Chief among them is a seemingly rushed production pipeline, which ensures that overworked VFX artists aren’t allowed the chance to render creatures that have a definitive sense of weight or scale. The kaiju and the humans rarely feel like they exist within the same physical space—which is part of why the movie works best when Kong and the other apes are off in their own corner of Hollow Earth, where size doesn’t matter. Granted, in a movie about giant apes and lizards, it absolutely should, but Wingard and co. make do with the hand they’re dealt. Godzilla spends most of the movie either sleeping (amusingly, in Rome’s Coliseum) or re-charging his batteries underwater and changing color. But when he finally joins forces with Kong—who Trapper outfits with a mechanized enhancement, i.e. a robot hand that punches real hard—things get delightfully loopy. Conceptually, the film seems to anticipate having to work with weightless CGI and actually pits its characters against a scenario that takes advantage of Hollow Earth’s bizarro physics. The result is a hilarious romp: an absurd (if short-lived) action set piece where giant apes and lizards float across the screen while trying to knock each other silly. To get to this stage, you have to put up with a whole lot of painful exposition—at times, Hall literally reads backstory and setup off the wall of an ancient ruin—but if you’re able to put up with it, the payoff is cotton candy. It also helps that Kong retains his distinctly human traits, like mild annoyance, from previous films. Fans of Skull Island, who recall him casually slurping a giant octopus like spaghetti, will feel especially catered to. Unfortunately—or perhaps fortunately, if you squirm easily—Godzilla x Kong isn’t as gross or tactile as it wants to be, owing once again to shoddy visual effects, which rob several scenes involving blood, guts, and monster goop of their cartoonish impact. Sadly, even recommending Godzilla x Kong comes wrapped in caveats and apologies, given how little of it actually works. It has none of the scale or grandeur of Hollywood’s 2014 Godzilla—or Japanese highlights like Minus One, Shin Godzilla, or the original 1954 Gojira—let alone any of the brazen political imagery of Skull Island or…the original 1954 Gojira. But if you feel starved for hints of big-budget Hollywood spectacle, Wingard’s latest entry has just enough by way of imaginative shlock to scratch that particular itch, until something better comes along."
"Mar 29, 2024",positive," Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, the weirdly punctuated fifth monster mash in the Legendary Pictures MonsterVerse saga that kicked off with Gareth Edwards’ 2014 reboot Godzilla, is a good enough good time wherein a capable company of gifted actors elevate the predictable material.  I refer, of course, to the ultra-heavyweights in the title roles: The last surviving 300-foot ape from Skull Island and the even larger (I think?) radiation-absorbing-and-redistributing amphibian are both showing their age in this fun but frivolous installment. They also seem to be burdened by more than a little mutual resentment that they’re in another team-up movie instead of being free to continue their solo star vehicles: This one is a direct sequel to 2021’s Godzilla vs. Kong, which I definitely saw and from which I cannot recall a goddamn frame. Their bickering-buddy-cop dynamic is clearly a concession to an increasingly competitive market for Kaiju flicks: The most recent Japanese production starring Big G, last year’s Godzilla Minus One, shares a title that sounds like an equation with this American one, but it cost about a 10th what Godzilla x Kong did—and it’s roughly 10 times as good.  So Godzilla x Kong does the reluctant-allies thing for the second time in two movies, and it can’t quite hide that, despite their palpable love-hate chemistry on-screen, G and K probably don’t get along any better in real life than Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd. Maybe Kong is jealous that this movie not only gives his scaly co-star top billing, but also lets him (?) claim the Colosseum in Rome as his very own dog bed, leaving it only reluctantly and curling up back inside the arena where Russell Crowe won an Academy Award for demanding “are you not entertained!?” once the day’s city-smashing is done. The big ape’s grievances are not without merit. While I can’t deny that unconscious speciesism almost certainly makes me more sympathetic to Kong than to the Artist Formerly Known as Gojira, based on their performances here, Kong is clearly the more versatile and expressive actor.  The ever-reliable Rebecca Hall and Brian Tyree Henry, reprising their roles from the prior entry, are here too, demonstrating once again what stone-cold pros they both are when they’re not showing their bona fides in tonier flicks such as Passing and If Beale Street Could Talk, respectively. Henry, as a neurotic podcast host determined to blow the lid off the giant-monster conspiracy that that entire world already seems to know all about, has the easier job. His performance is all fright and astonishment, with minimal expository fiber. It’s Hall who must chew her ways through lines like “Tell the Italian military Rome would’ve been flattened if not for Godzilla!” and “It’s some undocumented vortex!” She does it, by God. She’s a trooper. Hall’s character is also our emotional anchor, having adopted Jia (Deaf child actor Kaylee Hottle), presumed to be the last survivor of a tribe of people native to Skull. Jia feels like an outcast among the other scientists’ kids on the Monarch compound—Monarch being the multinational Kaiju-monitoring agency in these movies—but has a bond with Kong, with whom she can communicate in sign language. Dan Stevens shows up, too, as a naturalist/Kaiju veterinarian who makes his entrance using some kind of HoverCrane to pull an infected tooth from the (sedated) big ape’s mouth. The film does not tell us how much dope it takes to prevent Kong from waking up while you’re ripping one of his teeth out. I wanted to know. The Dentistry Sequence, as future generations of cinephiles and Sight and Sound poll respondents shall doubtless refer to it, is the climax to what is in essence a fun short film that plays over the opening titles. Kong is on the hunt “SOMEWHERE IN HOLLOW EARTH,” as one of the film’s three best* location-establishing title cards tells us, and just the fact that he’s fleeing from a group of vicious, pack-hunting creatures seems to suggest his reign is faltering. I was sure I saw some gray fur in his face during this sequence, and the fact he must rely on cunning rather than brute strength to make his would-be predators back off suggests he’s slowing down. After that battle, a different creature steals Kong’s meal, and he just seems too tired to resist. He worked for his supper, too, ripping one of those pursuing creatures in half above his head and then showering its green entrails out of his fur beneath a waterfall. Truly, if I were rating just the first 10 minutes of this film, I’d award it five stars.  Alas, there’s about another hour and 45 after that, which knocks the star count down to a respectable three, save for the five-star interlude wherein Kong, after suffering a greivous injury to his right forearm, gets upgraded with a fucking robot fist. The fist is not some jury-rigged solution welded together from M1 Abrams tanks and diesel locomotives or whatever, but a ready-to-wear, one-size-fits-one ape-cessory that the Monarch people just had lying around. No questions, please. Five stars. My own unerring professionalism compels me to say there’s a plot to this film, wherein some kind of mysterious signal emanating from the world beneath the surface turns out to portend a threat that requires the combined might of G and K, and a whole lot of collateral damage, to resolve. It isn’t so absorbing that it kept me from wondering exactly how much of this film was computer-animated, as not just the creatures but many of the environments have a screensaver-y quality that, absent the truly immersive digital trickery of Avatar and its sequel, just looks a little flat.  The 2014 Edwards Godzilla had a somber quality about it, a sense of the cost of all the destruction it documented, making it metaphorically of a piece with the best of the Toho Kaiju movies, including the 1954 original—suffused with the trauma of a nation that had two atomic bombs dropped on it in less than a decade prior—and 2023’s Godzilla Minus One. There’s none of that richness here. Even franchises built around a more thoughtful premise than two giant beasts duking it out for our amusement tend to become parodies of themselves by the fifth outing. Godzilla x Kong is fleet, fun, and forgettable, and that’s enough.  *Writer’s note: The other two title cards in the top three are the one that says “SUBTERRANEAN REALM—UNCHARTED AREA” and the one that says “CAIRO, EGYPT” over a shot of the fucking pyramids. We don't have one. Readers like you keep our work free for everyone to read.

"Mar 29, 2024",negative," by Walter Chaw Maybe this is how it starts, though I know we must be in the middle if not at the end. More to the point, maybe this is when we notice how close we are to the door to the processing house–to the slaughter. I want to be clear, for posterity’s sake, that I believe we are at the very edge of it. I want it to be on record that I’m afraid. I think we may even be inside, in the stench of its fear and blood and shit, pop-eyed with the too-late realization that all this time, we were waiting in this line for this outcome, and we’ve known it all along. We have been conditioned to be surprised every single time it swims to our attention for a few minutes (which used to happen infrequently, first years, then months, then days, then hours apart; soon it will be seconds) that our lives hold no value to the machineries running us save for the material weight of our flesh. We have been conditioned to forget this every time we’re accidentally confronted with it again. They did it by teaching us to question–and discount–the suffering of others. Not completely; not everyone and not yet. But mostly, and some of you are making me a little worried. I feel like Kevin McCarthy in Invasion of the Body Snatchers, although I’m not as sure I’m who I used to be anymore, either. Adam Wingard’s execrable Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is too foul and hamfisted to be the cause of anything, but it, like sputum when examined under a microscope, might point to the root malady spreading through us like fire through dry brush. It is an exercise in nihilism, in anti-empathy. It is a punishing, bludgeoning sensory device punctuated at regular intervals by the wholesale annihilation of monuments to human achievement while laying waste to cities without also showing the agony of people in the seconds before they’re turned to paste and buried under rubble. In 2015, the terrorist group ISIS broke into a museum and destroyed artifacts of the Assyrian Empire; I remember it was referred to as an act of “cultural genocide” in a campaign to eradicate traces of pre-Islamic culture in areas they controlled. The images of it left me nauseous. Using American weaponry, Israel is now levelling landmarks and universities in an area they would like to populate with settlers, and we’re not allowed to call that anything other than righteous. When I see the Parthenon vaporized in a big-scale “entertainment” intended for a mass audience, I think about the trailer for Michael Bay’s Pearl Harbor and how crowds cheered the technical wizardry that gave us a bomb’s-eye view of ordnance dropped on American servicemen. At least this was seen as tasteless and problematic at the time. I doubt Godzilla x Kong will inspire any dialogues of the sort. Part of that is because Godzilla x Kong is inoculated against criticism. Lob any at it, and you will be identified as a humourless scold incapable of joy. The joy of an animated baby gorilla having an hours-long “conversation” with an animated adult gorilla through gestures, wet eyes, and yawps. The joy of glimpsing Toshiro Mifune’s performance from Yojimbo as it’s surreptitiously mapped onto the face of a giant ape. The joy of seeing the Great Pyramids reduced to bricks and sand as part of the grand spectacle of erasing any evidence of spiritual aspiration from the face of this soulless wasteland. Speak of how Godzilla and King Kong, both, are loaded relics of the American Empire–artifacts of war crimes committed against the Japanese and chattel slavery here at home, respectively–and be crowned King Wet Blanket at the bread and circus of the moment. The minimum requirement is that this film be accepted; the urgent demand is that it be enjoyed. If you don’t enjoy it, there’s something wrong with you. If you don’t enjoy a cacophonous, invasive, unimaginative slog, a two-hour strobe light of a thought-eradicating mindwipe that teaches us to watch the Rio de Janeiro beachfront get flattened along with a substantial portion of its six million inhabitants like a spectator at a wrestling match, then there’s something wrong with you. You are too sensitive. You wonder about all those people when the movie, dummy, is giant things engaging in inscrutable battles using your lives as collateral, justification, and cannon fodder all at once. King Kong rides Godzilla for a second in slow-motion as they launch themselves, also in slow-motion, into battle with a red ape and its servant, a frost lizard. The red ape, by the way, wields a whip and controls hundreds of Black apes (like Kong) in a quarry where they’re treated like slaves. I mention this because you might tell me I’m reading into the Kong character and not out. If I’m doing it, the filmmakers are doing it, too–the difference being they don’t want you to think about it. The mystical native earth child from the last film, Jia (Kaylee Hottle), returns to again be the “pure,” Avatar-like stereotype who serves as a bridge between Man and Beast, with the added issue of interracial adoption in a horrifyingly glib subplot about her relationship with her new mom, Dr. Andrews (Rebecca Hall). If the demand is that I not dwell on things like this in a movie that is such garbage you must not think about it before, during, or afterwards to fully enjoy it, I wonder why this was even included. There is a band of natives in the film, all portrayed by Asian actors who don’t talk–not even their leader, played by Hong Kong actor Fala Chen, who found her most tremendous success recently in a television soap in which she plays another non-verbal character. Is this providence or a play at acceptance into the Chinese market? Whatever it is, it’s a lot of Asians in mystical outfits doing magic among the apes in the middle of the planet. If you are bothered by any of the racial dynamics of Godzilla x Kong, you’re obviously doing it wrong. Do not be bothered by anything, that’s the first step. The next is to enjoy the thing that is bothersome. Like it. Slurp it up. None of this is to say that I loathe this movie for its shoddy politics and abhorrent timing. I loathe it because it’s terrible in every other conventional way as well. The dialogue is appalling, slack and rhythmless–a conductor using an old piece of celery in place of a baton to beat you into thundering, exhausted submission. Fwap! Fwap! Fwap! To liven things up, Wingard attempts a James Gunn-ism, randomly dropping Badfinger and Kiss into incoherent action dumps, but the tracks are witlessly curated and employed (just like the previous entry’s insertion of a Dobie Gray classic that saw Kong longing for the “freedom of [his] chains”). Comic relief Dan Stevens and Brian Tyree Henry have whatever timing comes naturally to them neutered by lousy editing and worse writing, while poor Hall can’t save her character from being the thing that says, “I forgot to tell you…” to introduce one loud deus ex machina after another. She’s the ring girl who tosses a folding chair into the cage match. Eat it up, paying customers! I will say that the monsters don’t destroy Christ the Redeemer, even though it’s right there to be used as a cudgel or a sap. Why doesn’t Godzilla x Kong demolish a Catholic relic the way it destroys Egyptian, Asian, and ancient Roman ones? Didn’t I tell you to stop thinking? It’s not a plot that drives Godzilla x Kong, it’s a march of chryons and establishing shots identifying what they’re going to pulverize on the way to a touching scene where Kong adopts red ape baby and Jia tells Dr. Andrews that, despite all the contrary evidence of her actions and convictions, she would rather be in Dr. Andrews’s white upper-class world than in middle-of-Earth with her fabulous Asian children of the planet savouring their Cirque du Soleil matinees and revues. You are allowed to feel touched by this cheap, unearned, and dishonest sentiment. You are allowed to wallow in the majesty of the eradication of hundreds of thousands of human lives, vanished at your pleasure. You are not allowed to think about who you were when things bothered you or who you’ve since become. At least until the door closes behind you and you hear the blade meant for you sharpen against the strop. Then you can think about that all you want. Go ahead."
"Mar 29, 2024",positive," Directed By: Adam Wingard
Written By: Terry Rossio, Simon Barrett, Jeremy Slater, and Wingard; Based on the character Godzilla created by TOHO Co., Ltd.
Runtime: 115 minutes
MPA Rating: PG-13 for intense sequences of creature violence/destruction and brief language. The epic Monsterverse continues in Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire. In this new colossal showdown, the bitter enemies Godzilla and Kong must form an unlikely alliance to face a greater threat that endangers the planet. Godzilla x Kong is by no means a deeply thoughtful, post-war drama exploring the tragedy and trauma that war brings to its victims. Instead, The New Empire opts for big monster blockbuster thrills. The movie succeeds and delivers on that front, but the rest of the plot is sorely lacking. Picking up about two years after Godzilla vs. Kong, the world resettles into the post-Titans era. Kong has safely relocated to Hollow Earth, where Monarch has its own observatory outpost. Meanwhile, Godzilla resides on Earth’s surface, taking care of the other more disastrous Titan menaces in between naps in the Roman Colosseum. Kong now holds dominion as the alpha creature of his new homeland, but he longs for companionship. However, the notion that Kong is the last of his kind is deeply misguided. Soon Kong inadvertently unlocks a gateway leading deeper into Hollow Earth, where the other Great Apes have been imprisoned for thousands of years. Meanwhile, something from Hollow Earth is sending out a signal that’s being received by Jia (Hottle), the last surviving Iwi villager, who was adopted by Dr. Ilene Andrews (Hall) and befriended Kong. After Titan podcaster Bernie Hayes (Tyree Henry) helps uncover the origin and nature of the signal, Dr. Andrews brings Jia, Bernie, and Titan veterinarian Trapper (Stevens) along for a recon mission to get to the bottom of the mission. They eventually discover a deadly new Titan that could threaten the world, but their discovery also holds the key to Jia’s destiny. Meanwhile, the signal coming from Hollow Earth prompts Godzilla to absorb massive amounts of energy as he preps for the greatest battle of his life. The Monsterverse’s longstanding problem of dull human characters persists through The New Empire. Talented thespians make up the cast, but they serve little purpose besides providing the audience with perfunctory exposition dumps. These scenes lack any notable substance and only serve to break up the major kaiju fights and action.  What does work about The New Empire is how the film builds the Titan characters beyond just big, smashing monsters. The Titans emerge as the most fascinating and textured characters of the story. Most of the action in The New Empire is driven by Kong as he seeks to solve the mystery of the hidden pathway in Hollow Earth. These scenes have no dialogue, and The Titans’ primal actions and physical behavior drive the sequences forward. The intent of the Titans comes across through their visual actions and body language.  Wingard excels as a filmmaker in these interesting scenes. Whenever the humans show up again, they follow traditionally boring, predictable beats, reciting corny jokes or verbalizing hackneyed dialogue. The human characters are usually the least compelling part of any Godzilla movie, and while that should not be the case, there is little reason to care about them. Early on, a Monarch soldier, Mikael (Ferns), is introduced as the lone military escort for the reconnaissance mission to Hollow Earth. At first, Mikael appears to be a reasonable and workable character. As the plot unfolds, Mikael quickly spirals into becoming a one-note, antagonistic idiot who meets a predictable fate. The New Empire is not interested in elevating the human subplot, and that is fine, to a point, since the monster material works exceptionally well.  The main drawback of the central threat is the payoff of the new villain, dubbed the Scar King, who doesn’t quite meet the buildup. Considering Godzilla spends most of the movie preparing for the battle of his life, the Scar King should be more formidable. He certainly has a unique design, but it seems like he needs to present a stronger threat as the Titan who draws Kong and Godzilla into fighting together.  When the Titans clash, the action is undoubtedly entertaining. The fights meet the massive scale of the monsters, and humans are merely spectators rather than active participants. However, Tom Holkenborg’s overly bombastic score fails to meet the majesty of these cinematic icons. There is a hint of a decent theme when Godzilla is onscreen, but it never meets its full potential.  Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire takes positive steps with developing the Titans as characters rather than merely big setpieces, but the human elements are still woefully lacking. The New Empire acts more like a tribute by Wingard to the later Showa Era films of Godzilla’s cinematic history. It works relatively well in that respect, at least when it’s time for the kaiju to smash up the place. While various aspects could have worked better, The New Empire presents an alternative type of flavor for Godzilla cinema, and there’s nothing wrong with that. Copyright © 2024 411mania.com, LLC.

"Mar 29, 2024",positive,"A hollow but vibrant ""Saturday morning cartoon"" entry in the Monsterverse that effectively delivers a themed-park-like experience that fans of all ages can enjoy. [Full Review Spanish]"
"Mar 29, 2024",positive," Never underestimate the power of a movie that makes you feel like a kid again. Watching Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire reminded me of sitting in a massive theater gazing up at the screen in awe as it showed Godzilla vs. Megalon and the 1976 version of King Kong. Those larger-than-life creatures captured my imagination and, honestly, never let go. This newest entry in the Warner Bros. “Monsterverse” is a great big, nonsensical hemorrhage of CGI that’s not going to earn points for plot and characterization. It does, however, deliver spectacularly on the promise of giant monsters engaging in epic feuds. In the follow-up to 2020’s Godzilla vs. Kong, Kong now lives in the Hollow Earth (i.e. the center of the planet). Godzilla is above ground, sleeping inside the Colisseum in Rome. Dr. Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall) detects bizarre seismic activity coming from Kong’s realm, so she assembles a team that includes large animal dentist Trapper (Dan Stevens) and conspiracy theory podcaster Bernie Hayes (Brian Tyree Henry). They venture into Hollow Earth, only to discover that the activity is a call for help that will force the adversarial titans to join forces against a common foe, a vicious ape called Skar King. There’s more to it than that, but describing it is useless because the story is mostly present to bide time between sequences of monster chaos. A whole subplot exists about a “lost” tribe in Hollow Earth and how it relates to Andrews’ adopted daughter Jia (Kaylee Hottle). You won’t care about it too much. The game cast holds these sections together. Hall brings a reliable sense of purpose to her character, while Stevens and Henry provide appealing comic relief. We’re here for the monsters. We get them. Boy, do we ever get them. Godzilla and Kong do battle among the pyramids in Egypt. Kong and a baby ape take on Skar King and his minions. The last twenty-five minutes constitute an enormous, destruction-heavy melee that incorporates another familiar kaiju from the world of Godzilla and sees Kong fitted with a mechanical arm for extra punch strength. If you grew up loving monster movies of this sort, it’s almost impossible not to feel a little giddy about it all. Director Adam Wingard is obviously a fan himself, so the mayhem is staged with real enthusiasm. Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire must be approached with that mindset. The film makes no pretention of being anything other than a wild ride with these beloved characters. A willingness to not take itself too seriously is the tipoff. Certain moments are clearly meant to be funny or self-mocking. Whereas a picture like Godzilla Minus One - which is admittedly superior - uses the kaiju concept to explore deeper themes, Wingard and crew are coming from a more visceral angle. If a 9-year-old kid playing with Godzilla and King Kong action figures could have their ideas magically transferred to the screen, the result would not be terribly different from what we get. My mind ran on two tracks for most of the running time. The intellectual side was saying, “This is silly and empty CGI overload.” The emotional side was saying, “I’m having a lot of fun watching this.” Both sides were fighting, just like Godzilla and King Kong. In the end, the emotional side won out. Feeling like a kid again for a couple hours was a wonderful detour in my day."
"Mar 29, 2024",negative,$135m worth of Hollywood gruel.
"Mar 29, 2024",neutral," There's life left in the ""Godzilla"" franchise, and it was seen in last year's ""Godzilla Minus One,"" a monster movie made at human scale, which made you care about things like story, character and yes, that big radioactive lizard at the center of all the chaos. ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" was already in the bag by the time ""Godzilla Minus One"" surfaced, so it had no time to learn any of its lessons. But it could have benefitted from them, any of them, because even while this monster mash features two larger than life mega movie icons, it can't find a single interesting thing to do with either of them. OK, there's one. Godzilla, who stomps around the globe leaving a wake of destruction in his path (what else is new?), occasionally gets sleepy, and when he does, he curls up inside the Colosseum in Rome, like the family dog plopping down in its bed. That's a good bit. And it stands out in a movie that could use a lot more of them. ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" picks up after 2021's ""Godzilla vs. Kong,"" and the ""x"" between their names signifies that they're not so much feuding anymore as they're working on a brand collab. (This movie is their collab.) They're off doing their own thing, with Kong in Hollow Earth and Godzilla's whereabouts on the surface closely monitored by a team of scientist-types tasked with keeping eyes on him. And there's peace between the two parties, sort of, until there's not. Kong, who runs afoul with a new bunch of giant beasts, pops up to Earth through the portal that's been set up for him because he's got a cracked tooth, which is fixed by Trapper (Dan Stevens), who plays a freewheeling rock and roll dentist with feathered hair and an Aussie accent. (At least Stevens is having fun.) Trapper is part of a team of humans who follow Kong back down to Hollow Earth and are occasionally asked to spell out the details of the film's plot, which are wholly convoluted and nearly impossible to make heads or tails of. Rebecca Hall is Dr. Ilene Andrews, and she's forced to explain things like Godzilla's moods, and how it affects all the screen goings-on. Ilene has an adopted daughter, Jia (Kaylee Hottle), who speaks to Kong in sign language and is the last of her Iwi tribe. Brian Tyree Henry plays a paranoid podcaster who's always talking about livestreams and his followers. This group serves to narrate the story, such as it is, while the monsters get prepped for another big showdown. Godzilla and Kong aren't alone. Kong comes across a gang of evil Kongs, led by Skar King, who carries a whip made from some monster's vertebrae, which looks like a weapon out of ""Mortal Kombat."" He's also got his own Godzilla-type monster, whose breath spews a freezing agent, whom he keeps as an enslaved pet. There's also a Diddy Kong-like red-haired little guy, because as Baby Yoda and the mini-Stay Puft Marshmallow Men have shown, we love tiny, cute versions of our favorite screen characters (and they make great plush toys). Fights ensue, because of course they do, and what else would they be doing here if not destroying cities and world landmarks into piles of rubble. (Sorry, pyramids, you were fun while you lasted.) Here's the thing though: At this point in movie history — and in Godzilla and Kong history, who have more than 50 movies between them — we've seen all the monster clashes and city destroying we ever need to see, and unless there's a human element to grasp onto, it's all just a whir of digital effects and CGI vomit with no emotional connection or reason to invest. ""Godzilla Minus One"" worked not because of how big it was, but because of how small it was, and the care with which it was made. ""Godzilla x Kong"" wants to be a top-of-the-line, all-out battle of the brutes, but for all its size, it barely manages to hold your attention, because there's no human element at its core. Director Adam Wingard — who, it should be noted, gave Stevens his best film role in 2014's Goth-tinged '80s homage ""The Guest"" — at least attempts to lighten things up and bring some levity to the proceedings, but it's mostly a lost cause. ""Godzilla x Kong"" is as big and loud as expected, but when the dust is settled, there's nothing to hold onto. The kaiju clash is a crushing bore."
"Mar 29, 2024",positive," This year marks two milestones in kaiju history. The first, and most important, is that it has been seventy years since everyone’s favorite giant, atomic breath-spewing lizard first tromped across Tokyo in Gojira. It’s also been ten years since the premiere of the first entry into what is now called the MonsterVerse: Gareth Edwards’ Godzilla. In this past decade, we have been introduced to many kaiju—or Titans, as these films refer to them: The MUTOs (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism, a term which was replaced by Titan), Mothra, King Ghidorah, Rodan, Mechagodzilla, several other minor Titans and, of course, King Kong. While Kong and Godzilla were enemies in the previous film, aptly titled Godzilla vs. Kong, they now have to learn to live with each other’s existence in the new entry, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire. Since their defeat of Mechagodzilla, Kong has taken up residence in Hollow Earth, the world below our ground, while Godzilla resides up top to protect us whenever another Titan gets a little uppity. Kong has been searching for any others like him, but has found nothing, so far. That is until a sinkhole opens, revealing a sub-subterranean world beneath his subterranean home. There he meets a young ape named Suko, who reluctantly leads Kong to a tribe of giant apes. They are ruled over by the tyrannical Skar King who, long ago, tried to take over the surface world, only to be defeated and trapped in Hollow Earth by Godzilla. Meanwhile, up in our world, young Jia (Kaylee Hottle), the deaf only surviving member of the Iwi tribe (those who protected and served Kong on Skull Island), is having visions connected to Hollow Earth. Her adoptive mother, Dr. Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall), is desperate to figure out what Jia’s visions mean. Godzilla has also been affected by something, and he appears to be absorbing energy in preparation for an oncoming fight. Dr. Andrews and Jia, accompanied by Titan veterinarian Trapper (Dan Stevens) and podcaster Bernie Hayes (Brian Tyree Henry), travel down to Hollow Earth to figure out exactly what all this means. Godzilla x Kong takes everything that’s been fun about the Japanese side of the franchise over the past seven decades and wraps it all in the spectacle we’ve come to expect from the Hollywood versions. Directed by Adam Wingard, the first director of a MonsterVerse film to return for a second go-around, this is kaiju entertainment in its purest form: Giant monsters fighting each other with no regard to the destruction they’re causing. Yet, something these MonsterVerse films have done pretty well, too, is create compelling human storylines. We genuinely care about the safety of our team of explorers as they trek through this world that’s still fairly alien to them. Granted, having already gone on one filmic journey with most of them does help. Of course, we have to address the kaiju in the room. Many people have been comparing Godzilla x Kong to Godzilla Minus One, since they were released so close together. This is completely unfair to Godzilla x Kong. Any film is going to pale in comparison when put up against the magnificent genius that is Minus One. That film is meant to tell a harrowing, yet hopeful, tale of not only a country dealing with an attack from a giant monster, but also a country trying to rebuild after a devastating war. Godzilla x Kong is the exact opposite and should be viewed as such. This is a film that’s obviously made by Godzilla fans who, like me, grew up watching the older movies on Saturday afternoons after our cartoons were over and we still wanted more TV time. As such, that’s entirely how this film plays…and it nails it. So, as long as you don’t expect the heavy social examinations we’ve come to expect from the recent Japanese output, you’ll probably have as good of a time as I did.

"Mar 29, 2024",positive," There is a certain elegance in letting oneself go. Forget expectations and obligations, and just focus on finding joy in what seems to matter most. To a certain degree, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire has let itself go. Plot and character development are forgotten in lieu of effects and titan battles, and it sometimes works just fine. Though, when it tries to clasp to the remaining dregs of audience sympathy manipulation and world building it teeters toward collapse. The film picks up a bit of time after its direct predecessor, Godzilla vs. Kong with a few of the same characters. Rebecca Hall as Ilene is the head of managing Hollow Earth’s research, and her adoptive daughter and Skull Island orphan Jia (Kaylee Hottle) is starting to go through pre-teen rebellion and a need to find her place in the world. Thankfully, Brian Tyree Henry is also back as internet armchair researcher and podcaster Bernie, bringing with him some much-needed humor. Don’t remember any of this from director Adam Wingard’s previous film? Don’t worry about it! For the most part Godzilla x Kong is a stand-alone entry into their cinematic universe, in that the important bits of exposition are covered early and clearly, and frankly do not seem to matter too much. The real star, and truthfully the only joy to be found in the film, is the massive battles amongst titans. Both on the Earth’s surface and below in Hollow Earth, Kong and Gozilla are fighting their fights for survival and to remain at the top of the pecking order. Though Godzilla’s motives for battles are initially unknown, that does not stop them from being far flung across the globe and good, splashy fun. Kong’s mission is more of a personal undertaking as he fights to survive in Hollow Earth and search for where he belongs. As the elected emotional anchor of the titans in this series, there feels like more riding on the outcome of his battles, but they rise to be just as bloody and inventive as Godzilla’s skirmishes. If all that is expected of a kaiju versus gargantuan gorilla film is some epic battles for honor and a few new creatures sprinkled in to heighten the stakes, then Godzilla x Kong mostly succeeds. The running time is largely dedicated to those expectations, and it knows what is wanted. However, like so many monster movies (with the glaring exceptions of Godzilla Minus One and Shin Godzilla) the movie stumbles hard when it comes to forcing a human plot around all that good jungle mayhem. Kong’s search for belonging mirrors Jia’s similar path, though they are both handled very differently. Without needing to or ever fully addressing it, Godzilla x Kong chooses to veer into issues of slavery and captivity. Taking on such heavy material in a light but ferocious context feels reductive and convenient. Similarly Ilena’s reunion with former college friend and (I swear I am not making this up) Kong dentist Trapper (Dan Stevens) feels like a reason to have the two characters flirt a bit, without any character or plot value added. But in the end, Kong and Godzilla and friends all fight the good fight while we get to sit back and take it all in. If that was the singular goal of Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, it sure did do that thing. All You Need Is Death is the latest in the Celtic folk horror genre that will appeal to fans of You Are Not My Mother, A Hole in the Ground and Men.

"Mar 29, 2024",positive,"A big, dumb fun kaiju movie that's all about the popcorn fun. There are humans in it, yes, but we don't really care as the real action is watching ape-on-ape, ape-on-lizard, and lizard-on-lizard action. Shift your brain into neutral and enjoy."
"Mar 29, 2024",positive," The film is called “Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire.” It is not Hanks X Streep or De Niro X Mirren. That means you should not go into the theater expecting complicated character development, intricate plot twists and/or Award-winning performances. This latest offering on the Godzilla and King Kong universe is an endless stream of action sequences stitched together by a thin script. The human part of the cast – that includes the very talented Rebecca Hall – is about as necessary as a flea collar on King Kong. The new theatrical release is the follow up to “Godzilla vs. Kong.” Since their last battle, Godzilla has been stomping through major cities to defeat the Titans. These city-destroying tussles never seem to take place in a rural area where the worst disaster would be a silo destruction. Godzilla actually has a plan. He is absorbing vast amounts of energy including the devastation of a nuclear plant near Paris that will have everyone’s croissants glowing. Occasionally, a worthless human will make some statement about how Godzilla must be planning something big. This year’s Oscar for Stating the Obvious goes to this film. Meanwhile, Kong is living a lonely life in the world that exists at the core of Earth. His search for other great apes creates a problem that requires a few stereotypical humans to visit the land that is really down under. Ilene Andrews (Hall) is a scientist/mom who is torn between work and her newfound daughter, Jia (Kaylee Hottle). There’s the local big animal vet in Trapper (Dan Stevens) who is a poor man’s Peter Quill. Rounding out the team is disrespected podcaster Bernie Hayes (Brian Tyree Henry). Also in the group is the pilot but he might as well be wearing a red shirt from “Star Trek.” Fans of the show will know the fate of the character. These characters are needed to try to keep the film going as the script by Terry Rossio, Simon Barrett and Jeremy Slater is never in a rush to get to the reason for the title. Godzilla’s tearing up cities above ground while Kong is facing a large shrewdness of apes who want to rule the world. Big creature films like these never depend on logic or the laws of physics. But there is an endless string of moments that are either unintentionally funny or cheats with the story just to get to the next big reveal. One of Kong’s new buddies is a miniature version of him. Early in the film, Kong uses the baby ape as a living bat to beat other apes. Such abuse would leave any ape either dead or endlessly confused. Then there is the moment everyone realizes an injured Kong can’t win the day. As luck would have it, a prototype for a mechanical arm for Kong was in a storage closet at the facility in the underworld site monitoring Kong. It is difficult not to laugh at such insulting moments in the script. The biggest gaff is the discovery of writings that predate humans on the surface. They tell of a great ape with a scar looking to rule the world. That ape is still alive. Are they immortal? Don’t ask the writers as they don’t know. Director Adam Wingard – the man behind “Godzilla vs. Kong” – is not slowed by the lack of story. He loads the movie with huge fight sequences that are as fast paced as any “Transformer” movie but are far easier to follow. The work is solid enough that it makes the structure of having Kong and Godzilla not get together until the last 20 minutes all the sadder. The film is being sold as the teaming of these film titans and that should have been the focus of much of the movie. King Kong has been terrorizing the world since 1933 while Godzilla has been a pain in the Tokyo for the Japanese since 1954. They are strong enough to be the masters of their own action film and making them part of a zoological buddy story doesn’t add anything. It all comes down to your taste in movies. If all you want is action, the name says it all. For the record, in the name “Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire” the X is silent according to the studio. Why? Again, don’t ask the writers. To have a successful garden, you need to know when it is the best time to plant. Here are the best plants to start in May."
"Mar 29, 2024",neutral," Sure, if it's kaiju action you're looking for, The New Empire has it - and lots of it. But its determination to explain its weirder elements takes away any sense of wonder or mystery. Poor Rebecca Hall is essentially wasted as an exposition machine, saddled with pages of laboriously expository dialogue that makes sure the audience understands the whys and wherefores of every single detail of its convoluted plot. What it misunderstands about those Shōwa era films (and the darker Heisei era films, whose neon city-scape battles it also emulates) is that the plots of these films don't really matter. Everyone is here to see giant monsters duke it out, and attempts to complicate that with intricate mythology to make it somehow more plausible feels like a shallow distraction from the main event. In the case of Godzilla X Kong, that mythology feels confusing at best and irrelevant at worst. There are some fun monster battles to be had here, and the reappearance of Mothra is a welcome surprise after she was essentially wasted in King of the Monsters (even if it still doesn't really seem like the American films know what to do with her), but the film feels painfully bloated. It also has the unfortunate position of being released just three months after Toho's Oscar-winning Godzilla Minus One. And while these are clearly two different films with two very different aims, it's almost impossible not to look at the Japanese film and think that Toto is doing this better than their American counterparts. This may be a more lighthearted adventure than the more somber Minus One, but Godzilla X Kong feels buried under the weight of its own mythology, at once over-explained and undercooked."
"Mar 29, 2024",positive,"This might be one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen, and yet, I can't help but find myself enjoying the heck out of it. GxK delivers a ton of action, spectacle and a whole lot of blockbuster moments. Audiences should get what they pay for with this."
"Mar 29, 2024",neutral," As the old saying goes, there are two kinds of people on this Earth: Those who like their movies with a giant evil ape swinging a vertebrae like a lasso while riding a kaiju controlled by a crystal, and those who don’t. The former types will have much to cheer in “Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,” a ground-stomping, radiation-spewing monster-mash feast. Technically, we are not on this Earth. We’re inside it, in a subterranean jungle world that gives the movie’s filmmakers an exotic, untrampled realm in which they try to chart some new ground for a pair of well-traveled beasts. But aside from the film’s strong Jules Verne streak, “Godzilla x Kong” is no drastic pivot for its long-in-the-tooth monsters. For that, you were better off catching last year’s Toho-made “Godzilla Minus One,” which grippingly returned to Godzilla’s post-WWII origins and in the process won the 70-year-old lizard its first Oscar. Other, less respectable creatures might have used an Academy Award as a springboard for more dramatic roles. But not Godzilla. No costume dramas for him, unless you count the robotic fist that Kong gets outfitted with midway through the movie. No, we are back in the pure spectacle territory that has traditionally been Godzilla and King Kong’s stomping ground. It’s even a very small title tweak from the previous installment, “Godzilla vs. Kong,” to “Godzilla x Kong.” This one promises a team-up, with the frenemies joining forces to fight a mutual foe. If things keep up this way, we can look forward to “Godzilla xoxo Kong.” Returning director Adam Wingard kicks things off with his two stars separated, like star-crossed lovers, with only Earth’s mantle in between. Godzilla roams above ground while Kong romps around in Hollow Earth. To humankind, this is a good arrangement that keeps city-destroying rampages to a minimum – though Godzilla’s choice of bed, the Roman Coliseum, is surely unpopular among archeologists. Every movement of each monster is closely tracked digitally. The humans in “Godzilla x Kong” verge on being bit players — or more like roving sports commentators — who spend most of their time trying to analyze what the goliaths are up to. It’s a lean crew of scientist Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall), conspiracy-spouting podcaster Bernie (Brian Tyree Henry) and biologist Trapper (Dan Stevens) who fly into the Earth’s center when Kong is hurt and confusing distress signals seem to emanating from the underworld. With them are Ilene’s adoptive daughter Jia (Kaylee Hottle), the lone surviving member of the tribe that protected Kong’s Skull Island. Being in Hollow Earth takes some of the fun out of things. What good is a colossus when you can’t fling it against a skyscraper? Some of that comes later in “Godzilla x Kong.” But most of the film’s thrills come out of the strange dimensions that can turn up around every corner. In Hollow Earth they stumble onto a host of lost civilizations and a cavernous lair held up by giant crystals that look like the roman numerals of a Super Bowl logo. That also leaves “Godzilla x Kong” residing in a purely CGI arena without even tenuous connections to reality. It’s a empty chamber for movie spectacle and nothing else, where the only option is to pile elements on top of each other until you have, you know, a giant evil ape swinging a vertebrae like a lasso while riding a kaiju controlled by a crystal. But this mostly a very big, very simple tag team affair. The bad guys underground — the nasty gorilla Skar King and equally unpleasant lizard kaiju Shimo — eventually battle Kong and Godzilla in a finale that strips out the last vestige of reality, gravity, in a floating melee. Who is there to root for here? Godzilla has first billing but it spends most of its time traipsing around the globe sucking up radiation. Of the humans, Hall does the most to bring something real to the movie. Kong, as he’s been throughout this iteration of the franchise, is the main guy. But he’s just on the lookout for a friend or two. His most emotional scene, like Nick Nolte in “Affliction,” is due to a tooth ache. That, and the resulting yank via helicopter, prompted me to wish the movie was just a series of medical issues for an aging Kong. A knee replacement. Some reading glasses. “Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,” a Warner Bros. release, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for creature violence and action. Running time: 115 minutes. Two stars out of four."
"Mar 29, 2024",negative," GODZILLA X KONG: THE NEW EMPIRE begins with a lonely Kong suffering the pain of an infected tooth, and the loneliness of being the last of his kind. It’s a good place to start, and if the filmmakers had stayed with the big guy on his adventures, this would have been a much better flick. Instead, they expanded the action to include the humans from the last film in this franchise (NEVER to be confused with the infinitely superior GODZILLA MINUS ONE franchise), and things went downhill from there. Not that some of the humans aren’t fun. Certainly, Dan Stevens as Trapper, the holistic hippie veterinarian in a Hawaiian shirt is a delight with his chewy Aussie twang and sense of fair play among all living things, even mosquitos. Even better is Brian Tyree Henry as Bernie, the conspiracist podcaster with a gift for gab who talks himself into unfortunate situations with comic panache. Again, if they’d left it at these characters, we would still have had a popcorn flick with some well-earned guffaws and belly-laughs amid those primo special effects. Alas, the star of the piece is an all too solemn Rebecca Hall, hog-tied into a role as Dr. Ilene Andrews that allows her little more than a flicker of irony and far too much treacle. This is especially bad when dealing with Dr. Andrew’s adopted daughter Jia (Kaylee Hottle). the last of the Iwi people of Kong’s home, Skull Island. That she is also in middle school with all the attendant moodiness does not help, though when a girl has gone from protector of Kong to Algebra I, who can blame her for being a little down in the dumps? Particularly when subjected to psychic visions of a disturbing, inchoate nature. Getting back to Kong, he’s now living in the Hollow World, safe from annoying Godzilla, who is topside protecting the world from kaiju, like the immense spidery arthropod terrorizing Rome. But something weird is afoot, with electrical anomalies that set off Bernie’s conspiracy alarm, and Godzilla making a beeline for a nuclear power plant in France to recharge big time. But that’s not all, Kong and his magic hatchet have tumbled into the uncharted part of the Hollow Earth, and while he discovers more of his kind, it isn’t the love fest he might have hoped it would be. It all gets very silly very fast with a plot whose main function is to get the humans from point A to point B, and to do so without taking away any more time than necessary from the action-packed effects sequences.  Did I mention they are great?  And not just the action-packed ones where Rio is flattened. There’s also the sight of Godzilla curling up like a kitten in the Colosseum after a long day of kaiju fighting, and Trapper yanking Kong’s incisor. The best effects are in the service of an army of primates animated to such a fine degree that they have more shades of characterization than the poor humans are allowed. There are good monkeys and bad monkeys that carry scenes without dialogue, and a duplicitous baby one (still the same height as a mid-size skyscraper) with an expressive face and superb body language that will warm your heart and make you want to toss it into a handy lava pit. The relationship it strikes up with Kong is startlingly complex and easily the most compelling in the story. Forget Dr. Andrews and Jia, this is the parent-child relationship worth following, and about which you might even want to take a few notes. You can do that while the convoluted and contrived plot in which the humans are enmeshed takes place. GODZILLA X KONG is an example of where kaiju films go wrong. If the plot is silly, at least make it lively and internally logical. And now the inevitable comparison to GODZILLA MINUS ONE. Where Takashi Yamazaki made the kaiju a metaphor that was arch and moving, thereby raising the emotional stakes as Tokyo crumbles, for GODZILLA X KONG, that mayhem is the point, and the story just so much filling (made with artificial color and flavorings) to hold it together. When there is another sequel in this franchise, and heaven help us there will be, please, I beg you, spin off vet and the podcaster and let them romp merrily amid the kaiju."
"Mar 29, 2024",negative," Thanks to those of you who have already subscribed after my first post. Any further support would be much appreciated and, just as a reminder, the whole newsletter is completely free for now.  The MonsterVerse over at Warner Bros is a very curious thing indeed. We started a decade ago with Gareth Edwards’ weirdly coy game of kaiju peekaboo in Godzilla, followed it with the equally middling Kong: Skull Island, and then snoozed through the galumphing disaster that was Godzilla: King of the Monsters. Fortunately for this franchise, Adam Wingard’s enormously silly Godzilla vs. Kong was exactly what we all needed as we emerged blinking into the open after a year and change of pandemic lockdowns. That brings us to Wingard’s return for the bafflingly titled Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire. It had lots of very difficult questions to answer. What else lives in the Hollow Earth? Can these two titans co-exist? What the heck does that X mean? Some of those questions are answered in the movie — not the one about the X, sadly — but it also poses plenty more. Notably, how can a blockbuster film about warring behemoths in a subterranean wonderland be this tedious? The story begins with Godzilla and Kong separated by the divide between worlds. Lizard Boy is waging occasional kaiju wars on the surface, while Axeman Ape is marauding around the Hollow Earth being a badass. That’s until Kong tumbles down a sinkhole and uncovers an even older civilisation of great apes with less than honourable intentions for the surface world. It’s very much the Qui-Gon Jinn school of storytelling — there’s always a bigger fish. Unfortunately, that’s as far as we go in terms of ideas. The human characters are even more perfunctory than usual — Dan Stevens doing Aussie-cum-Kiwi-cum-Mockney is unforgettable in the worst way — and the plot is threadbare even for a movie about giant creatures twatting each other in the face. So close to Godzilla Minus One’s Oscar-winning revitalisation of kaiju storytelling, this feels unforgivable. The core problem is that, with so much of the story taking place in the CGI environs of the Hollow Earth, the sense of scale is gone. Are these creatures massive or proportionate? How big is the transparent merchandise play Diddy Kong? (sorry, Nintendo) When they all fight, these guys just look like specks floating in digital space, rather than massive, tangible beasts capable of doing damage outside of a computer. Wingard, to his credit, realises this enough to transplant the third act to Rio de Janeiro for some crumbly building action. But without any sense of the human peril involved — it’s all banal platitudes about “saving the world” — it doesn’t feel any more physical and important than it did beneath the surface. Ultimately, it feels like they’ve just run out of ideas at this point. When you’ve swapped the Mothras and the Ghidorahs of the world for a villain straight out of The Mighty Boosh, something has gone wrong. “What if Kong was red?” is not enough of a brainstorm session for a blockbuster with a six-figure budget. Godzilla vs. Kong felt like the rampaging id of this franchise but, in attempting to deepen its mythology, this new entry has fallen apart. We’ve been asking for more monsters and fewer humans and, to be fair, Wingard delivered that. Unfortunately, he forgot that, without humans, you need to find another way to inject stakes. When this is just an existential war for the survival of a few thousand pixels, it’s really hard to care. Godzilla and Kong wish they could match the titanic status of Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain. Watching them go toe to toe on the big screen is akin to a WrestleMania championship match. But, to be honest, it’s difficult to know what to make of Mothers’ Instinct.  Its cinematic heritage is clear. This is one of those “there’s something twisted behind the white picket fences of suburbia” movies, so fill in your comparison of choice: The Stepford Wives, Blue Velvet, American Beauty, all the way through to the risible Matt Damon black comedy Suburbicon. Set in the 1960s, it follows the fractured relationship between neighbours Céline (Hathaway) and Alice (Chastain) after one of them is hit with a terrible tragedy.  To say more would be to spoil the surprises of the narrative but, ultimately, seasoned cinematographer Benoît Delhomme’s directorial debut — a remake of a Belgian thriller — isn’t nearly as twisty as you want it to be. Initial layers of psychological intrigue and lashings of high camp — I was reminded of the more deliberately over-cranked parts of May December — give way to shrieking insanity, and not even the fun kind, in the third act. But, despite all of that, I had a really good time. Chastain and Hathaway sink every perfectly white tooth in their mouths into Sarah Conradt’s intentionally ripe script, with Hathaway in particular relishing the shifting personas of Céline. Chastain’s work is necessarily more subdued, but her take on a potential victim of murderous gaslighting is very watchable indeed. This film might not shock and enthral the way it wants to, but there’s no denying the intensity of the heavyweight clash between Hathaway and Chastain. That’s worth its weight in melodramatic gold. I was utterly wowed by Sacha Polak’s first English-language feature Dirty God back in 2019. She has reunited with that film’s star, Vicky Knight, for her follow-up Silver Haze. This time, it’s even more personal for Knight, as the story is heavily inspired by her own childhood, in which she suffered serious burns in a fire at the pub where she lived. Some of the supporting players are her real family members. What’s most impressive about Silver Haze is that it’s an absolute shape-shifter of a film. Every time you feel you know what it’s going to be, it changes and morphs into something else, orbiting around Knight’s protagonist Franky. It depicts her search for justice, but also her burgeoning romance with one of the patients at the hospital where she works (Esmé Creed-Miles). Then it becomes something else entirely when Franky finds another surrogate family. Ultimately, this makes for a bit of a narrative jumble, but Knight is such a unique screen presence — you want to support Franky, even when she does awful things — that all of the disparate parts make sense amid her gravitational pull. It’s a more complex film than Dirty God — and often a more frustrating, mercurial one — but it’s just as fascinating and fulfilling. It’s well worth catching, and you can find out more about the BFI’s cinema release here. Last year, I watched Apple TV’s thinky sci-fi series Foundation for the first time, with low expectations. Hard sci-fi isn’t my thing; I prefer it soft, squishy and more than a little silly. But Foundation reorientated my take on the genre entirely with its epic tale of cloned emperors and mathematical foresight. It’s now one of my favourite TV shows and I’m very much hoping the behind-the-scenes turmoil around season three doesn’t hurt it too much. So with my newfound love of this sort of thing, I decided to give 3 Body Problem a go on Netflix, burning through all eight episodes in less than 24 hours. I wrote for Radio Times this week about how it’s actually very ill-suited to binge viewing, but I still very much enjoyed the show. Created by Game of Thrones showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, the series is based on the first in a trilogy of sci-fi novels by computer engineer turned writer Cixin Liu. It’s a complex tale in which a string of suicides in the scientific community triggers an investigation involving a super-advanced virtual reality game built around the physics conundrum of the title, not to mention a pivotal decision made in the wake of the Chinese Cultural Revolution. Over the course of just eight episodes, the show gets through a lot of material. The world we leave at the open-ended conclusion of the series couldn’t be more different to the familiar one we join in episode one. Benioff and Weiss know how to do epic. 3 Body Problem never feels like it’s in a hurry, allowing the first half of the series to unfold at a methodical and thoughtful pace before really amping up the spectacle once the truth of the story is unveiled. There’s one (clearly very expensive) set piece in episode five that is genuinely one of the most shocking and brutal things I’ve seen in a TV show for years. I almost had to go for a lie down afterwards. But the show also very much has characters at its heart. Jess Hong particularly shines as genius physicist Jin Cheng — thrust into a level of prominence for which she gets no time to prepare — while Eiza González’s take on the guilt of nanotech pioneer Auggie Salazar is heart-breaking. Meanwhile, Benedict Wong provides a joyously snarky lighter side to proceedings as no-nonsense Mancuian investigator Da Shi. The second half of the series does feel a little over-stuffed and, at times, the show’s ambition exceeds its grasp a little. But as big idea sci-fi goes, this is deeply impressive in both spectacle and substance. Unfortunately, though, this is a Netflix binge-watch and so nobody will be talking about it in a week’s time. It’s just the way of the world. “In conjunction with our amazing graphics and production design team, all of whom worked tirelessly to give this film the 70s aesthetic we had always imagined, we experimented with AI for three still images which we edited further and ultimately appear as very brief interstitials in the film. We feel incredibly fortunate to have had such a talented and passionate cast, crew and producing team go above and beyond to help bring this film to life. We can’t wait for everyone to see it for themselves this weekend.” The response to this has been weird and, actually, sort of tribal. Many people who saw and enjoyed the film prior to this revelation have been keen to defend it against the other camp — those who flat-out refuse to see a movie that utilised AI in any way, or feel tricked if they paid to see it before they found out.  A quick glance at the Letterboxd page for Late Night with the Devil shows this duality pretty clearly, with the most popular review stating clearly: “Don’t let this be the start of accepting this shit in your entertainment.” My own feelings on this are quite complicated. Naturally, my instinct is to defend the film. I absolutely loved it and would hate to see the work of dozens of genuine creatives binned and forgotten because corners were cut in one specific aspect of the project. Film is a collaborative medium and so I always think it’s a shame to call for a boycott because of the actions of one member — or a few members — of the team. However, the creeping influence of AI on our art is absolutely something that needs stamping out in no uncertain terms. I completely understand the strength of feeling, particularly from those who, like me, work in industries vulnerable to the rise of AI. If people want to draw a red line, I get it and I respect it. One aspect that I haven’t seen talked about as much, though, came to my attention in a Twitter exchange between critics Eric D. Snider and Phil Nobile Jr. They pointed out that, when Late Night with the Devil was made in 2022, AI wasn’t seen as quite as harmful as it is now.  In fact, apps like Lensa were very popular, using AI to generate stylised avatars for social media. As recently as December 2022, dozens of online publications were reporting on the AI avatar trend, and nobody seemed all that bothered. Objections were made, but they were fairly quiet in among all of the people sharing pictures of themselves morphed into various high school yearbook archetypes. Of course, this doesn’t absolve the filmmakers of responsibility. Late Night with the Devil premiered a year ago at the SXSW Festival and it would have been easy for those images to have been replaced between then and its wide release. But certainly, AI wasn’t seen as nearly as much of an existentially threatening demon in 2022. The change in attitude since then, if anything, underscores just how rapid the development of the technology has been. The solution to all of this, clearly, has to come from regulation. One of the big achievements of the SAG and WGA strikes last year was protection for their members from the influence of AI. That now has to be passed on to other workers within the TV and film industry, including designers and illustrators. Studios, obviously, are going to want to cut costs where possible, and there does need to be a resistance to that. However, I’m not sure completely rubbishing a fairly low-budget horror film is 100% the answer. I think the best solution at this stage is to note the controversy when discussing the film, so it doesn’t go unnoticed. As the film’s star David Dastmalchian said this week, “it’s an important conversation, we gotta have it”. But at this stage, conversation is better and more useful than condemnation. That’s it. Please let me know which bits of this you liked (if any) and whether or not I’m wasting my time by trying to make this into something. See you same time next week for more reviews, opinions and film-y stuff!"
"Mar 29, 2024",positive," Godzilla and King Kong are back in action in a new adventure as they take to the screen in Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire. I’m gonna be honest. The release of this film comes way too soon following the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore. You and I both know how frequently buildings and infrastructure get destroyed during the course of these films. My screening came way too soon after hearing what happened in Baltimore. This isn’t to take anything away from the film itself but to serve as something of a warning during this sensitive time. All that notwithstanding, I don’t ask for much out of these films other than to be entertaining. Suffice it to say, it did its job in that regard. While bringing over a few characters from Godzilla vs. Kong, the film also introduces Trapper (Dan Stevens), the dentist to the Titans. While the film does give viewers some background into Trapper’s character, I would love to see a spinoff about his dentistry work with Titans. The gist of the new Monsterverse offering is that our favorite Titans must come together to face off against a new threat from an undiscovered world beneath Hollow Earth: the Skar King. It’s a threat that will challenge Kong as he searches for family but really pisses off Godzilla in a way that changes his behavior. He starts destroying everything in his path without any regard for life or infrastructure. After getting a brief glimpse of Hollow Earth in the previous installment, this new film is about learning about not only its history but what threats it offers. Meanwhile, Kong becomes something of a father figure to Suko. It was bound to happen at some point that they would incorporate Son of Kong into the storytelling. Or something like it. I’m hopeful that Warner Bros. and Legendary will treat viewers to at least another film featuring the two Titans. As to what other threats may be out there, I’m not sure. What I can say for certain is that the Monsterverse is in capable hands with Adam Wingard at the helm. He’s already given us two films starring both Godzilla and Kong. I love how he balances the human element with the Titans. The destruction can be a bit much at times but it is what it is. There’s also the humor element from both Brian Tyree Henry and Dan Stevens. Maybe it’s because Stevens speaks with a British accent or his character is a dentist. Adam Wingard knows what he’s doing with Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire and it’s just entertaining enough. But seriously though, I want a Trapper spinoff and stat!

"Mar 29, 2024",negative," Considering the massive stature of the titular beasts, it’s remarkable how the sequel Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, actually feels bigger than its predecessors. Whether it’s better is a different argument. This latest entry in the effects-driven monster mashup franchise after Godzilla vs. Kong has plenty of kaiju set pieces to thrill series devotees without advancing the mythology in any meaningful way. The film opens with King Kong peacefully sequestered beneath the planet’s surface in Hollow Earth while erstwhile nemesis Godzilla minds his business among the pint-sized humans. “As long as they don’t venture into each other’s territories, we’ve got nothing to worry about,” reasons a scientist (Rebecca Hall) basically in charge of making sure that doesn’t happen. But it does, of course, thanks to some agitation from other behemoths seeking world domination, including a formidable primate known as Skar King who pushes Kong’s buttons, and a highly charged undersea reptile who lures Godzilla into a trap. There are other human characters, too, some of which are holdovers. They include a conspiracy blogger (Brian Tyree Henry) trying to secure followers, an explorer (Dan Stevens) whose thirst for adventure comes in handy, and a deaf girl (Kaylee Hottle) with a mysterious past who’s a conduit of sorts to Kong. Their collective role is to look bewildered and helpless, spout pseudo-scientific nonsense, and act as de facto narrators to translate the grunts and roars for non-fluent moviegoers. All the brawls on the undercard cause some loyalties to shift and lead into an obligatory large-scale finale that triggers catastrophes on both sides of the Earth’s crust. On the terrestrial side, such landmarks as the Colosseum, the Rock of Gibraltar, and the Egyptian pyramids are part of the collateral damage. Returning director Adam Wingard and his crew deserve credit for some elaborate world building and meticulous creature design. It’s a marvelous collection of computer-generated visuals. A loud and proud exercise in spectacle over substance, the otherwise silly film delivers the goods with an abundance of slow-motion titan clashes that convey a visceral intensity. However, despite half-hearted attempts to connect on a deeper emotional level, it’s almost impossible to muster any significant rooting interest in characters of any species. With its expansion of the goliath roster, The New Empire feels more like a bridge to future installments, or the battle before a war that’s yet to materialize."
"Mar 29, 2024",neutral," Would you eat from a sensible veggie tray when a chocolate éclair is right next to it? Would you settle in Council Bluffs when Omaha is mere miles away? Would you be a huge Superman fan when Spider-Man exists? Of course not. Nor would you center King Kong in your narrative over Godzilla. Because you have excellent taste, unlike the deciders behind Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire. We get a multiplication symbol in the latest title in the series, which is only odd because it follows the release of Godzilla Minus One. I guess it’s true what they say: Forget sex. Math sells, baby. Unlike the sincere melodrama of Minus One, GxK is epic goofballery. That is mostly fine, except that it spends way too much time on the oversized gorilla’s lonely wallowing and nowhere near enough time on the atomic-breathing mega-lizard, who represents the promise and peril of the nuclear era. “King Kong sad because him no have friends” will just never be more interesting than Godzilla’s will they/won’t they sexual tension with Mothra, let alone other bigger metaphorical issues connected to the cultural icon. Anyway, this whole dumb thing is about Kong finding a hidden hollow part of the already hidden hollow earth they found in the last movie. There’s a bunch more big apes in the newly found hole. One of them is mean and keeps an ice-breathing dragon on a chain. While Kong processes his feelings about befriending a baby giant gorilla, Godzilla is on the earth’s surface, fighting to defend humanity against hordes of evil monsters. No, it’s fine, Kong. You make some friends while the G-Man keeps the planet alive. The human subplot is commendably almost nonexistent. Dan Stevens is a hilarious hippie kaiju veterinarian. Rebecca Hall is…I want to say a scientist? She’s been in these before, but I can’t remember where Vera Farmiga’s Godzilla character stopped and Hall’s started. There’s some maybe-uncomfortable stuff about a “lost tribe” that comes pretty close to the gross “native populations are literally made of magic” trope. Brian Tyree Henry plays a likeable podcaster, which is a character more fantastical than the aforementioned ice dragon. Things are constantly happening in the movie. That much can be confirmed. It’s actually fine that they don’t really amount to much plot-wise, as nobody is hoping for Christopher Nolan-ian exposition. The problem here is really the same thing that has given Marvel’s superheroes heavy boots these days: The need to constantly “up the stakes” now feels somehow less interesting. Obviously, the sheer size of the characters involved necessitates a big problem to solve. But this feels less like an epic disaster spectacle and more like the obligatory comic book sequel that rolls out a new, scarred evil doer with a generic army of baddies. Some of the visuals work. Stevens is a delight. I treasure the multiple shots of Godzilla sleeping in the Roman Colosseum like it was a doggy bed. But it is all too effervescent in its entertainment, all fizzy fuzzy CGI without metaphor or meaning. This is what you get when you hitch your wagon to what is basically the Hulk in need of a haircut instead of a living incarnation of humanity’s scientific folly. This is a carrot dipped in ranch, not custard-filled goodness. This is not the Good Life, but…whatever Iowa’s motto is (Caitlin Clark Plays Here, maybe?). This is not “with great power comes great responsibility,” but “up, up, and away” from your memory. Amy Nicholson at The Washington Post says “Wingard’s not a sentimentalist, and Godzilla x Kong stumbles whenever he tries to slap phony emotions onto the film to make it more like a generic crowd-pleaser. He’s a showman, a popcorn guy with excellent aesthetics. Let James Cameron give his Avatar organisms biological plausibility. Wingard just wants to tint one monster hot pink, another one gold and another the opalescent shimmer of a 12-year-old’s first bottle of nail polish.” Radheyan Simonpillai at The Globe and Mail says “For all the buildup toward a slugfest between Godzilla, Kong (outfitted with a new mecha-arm), some surprise allies and an army raised from the Earth’s core, this one is egregiously dull. It’s just a bunch of cartoonish limbs flailing, with bursts of fireballs and beams, lacking any of the graceful or exhilarating movements that a little human choreography could have helped with.” Charles Pulliam-Moore at The Verge says “those hoping for the film to establish a way for the franchise to keep evolving may be disappointed because it’s difficult to imagine where Legendary takes the Titans from here. The studio probably doesn’t want this to be the Monsterverse’s last chapter. But going out with a big, absurd, pink-hued bang might not be the worst thing for Godzilla and his ax-wielding friend.”"
"Mar 29, 2024",neutral,"We’ve seen that there are ways to do this sort of thing very well. Unfortunately, Godzilla X Kong is satisfied to simply give us more of the same old beasts."
"Mar 29, 2024",positive," If you struggle to remember what happened in 2021’s pandemic-frustrated theatrical and streaming release of “Godzilla vs. Kong,” you are not alone. And viewers who got bogged down in the drama-infused Apple TV+ limited series “Monarch: Legacy of Monsters” need not worry about playing catchup before taking in this new theatrical installment. Overarching plot coherence and continuity aren’t a priority for director Adam Wingard and his “The New Empire” team. The goal for this entry is monster-on-monster devastation, and on a purely brainless entertainment level, there’s nothing wrong with that. This monster movie installment is a marginal improvement over 2021’s “Godzilla vs. Kong.” Still, “The New Empire’s” heavily animated weightless special effects can’t hold a candle to recent Oscar winner “Godzilla Minus One.” And “Empire’s” story, if you can call it a story, is minus any attempt to be coherent or emotionally engaging. Tender moments are few and far between as skyscrapers tumble to dust, taking potentially millions of lives in the destructive process. There’s nary a dull or quiet moment in “The New Empire,” a bombastic monster movie that should come with a breakfast cereal box warning that it lacks any nutritional value. This entry picks up in the years since the discovery of the subterranean world known as the Hollow Earth. This underground wicked paradise is where titans rule and occasionally find their way to the surface, where they wreak havoc. However, to combat the escaped creatures, humans managed to cultivate a relationship with mortal enemies Godzilla and Kong. To prevent the two from fighting and demolishing every major city on the globe, Kong has been banished to the Hollow Earth while the unruly Godzilla roams freely topside. Whenever another titan, a monster of enormous size, emerges, Godzilla acts as our planet’s protector by using his great strength and nuclear breath to vanquish dangerous forces. But when a chasm opens in Kong’s new basement dwelling, a fresh group of monsters step forth. Will Kong and Godzilla join forces to save the day? Any fan will already know the answer to that question. After all, the title gives it away. But the fun is in watching Kong and Godzilla duke it out with each other and take on a colorful assortment of strange creatures. The silly, self-aware performances by actors Dan Stevens and Brian Tyree Henry help sell the film's goofy tone. Their rolling commentary as the epic battles dominate acts as a good contrast against Rebecca Hall’s strait-laced scientist. The problem here is the lack of any serious stakes. Possibly millions perish as the monsters destroy major cities, which is met with a slew of empty jokes. Gone is the pathos introduced in the opening sequence of 2014’s “Godzilla,” which started this new series of monster movies. In giving up and giving into the base, temporary glee evoked when Kong repeatedly punches his skyscraper-sized opponent or those initially exhilarating moments when Godzilla’s nuclear breath is sprayed onto a fellow threatening kaiju, studios Warner Bros. and Legendary Entertainment shoot for low-hanging fruit when they should be aiming higher."
"Mar 29, 2024",positive," For better or worse, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire feels much more like the movie director Adam Wingard — who now also totes executive producer and story credits — wanted to make when he was directing Godzilla vs. Kong.  Gone is the responsibility of fulfilling contracts for legacy characters from the previous two films, like Millie Bobby Brown, Kyle Chandler and Alexander Skarsgård. The human cast is pared down, focused on delivering exposition between monster fights. Wingard staple Dan Stevens shows up as the male lead, just having a good time. The soundtrack is a blend of pop-song needle-drops and electronic synths courtesy of Junkie XL and Antonio Di Iorio. The violence here is fast, furious and surprisingly graphic — befitting a director who started in indie horror and has worked his way over the last decade into the blockbuster space. It lovingly harkens back to earlier films while feeling like its own distinct approach to the monster-mash style of kaiju adventure. Compared to its predecessor, GxK feels like a story someone was excited to tell, with the means to tell it their way. All of that sounds good on paper, and indeed much of it is perfectly fine on screen. But I can’t shake the feeling that Wingard’s sensibilities and my sensibilities are not a great fit when it comes to this sort of film. Like Godzilla vs. Kong, this is basically a sci-fi Kong movie with Godzilla strapped in for action sequences and occasional bits of tension. The subterranean Hollow Earth is explored here and, in fact, we find out it has its own under-layers. All of the remaining human cast members are principally concerned with Kong. Rebecca Hall returns as Dr. Ilene Andrews, who is now the head of the scientific research organization Monarch. Her adopted daughter, Jia (Kaylee Hottle), continues to have a connection with Kong. They bring conspiracy-theory podcaster Bernie (Brian Tyree Henry) along for the ride, and he’s just as annoying as ever. The aforementioned Stevens shows up as Trapper, a veterinarian to the Titans (the name given to the kaiju in these films). Stevens’ introduction has a sense of scale and lived-in world-building found in 2014’s Godzilla, Kong: Skull Island, and 2019’s Godzilla: King of the Monsters — the first three Monsterverse films — but generally lacking in Wingard’s previous film. The humans are led to the Hollow Earth in pursuit of a signal only Jia can pick up. Likewise, Kong is on his own journey, searching for any other apes that might exist in the world below. Godzilla can sense the signal and starts traveling around the world searching for power-ups. These arcs barely intersect, and the introduction of the main villains — Skar King (a large, red orangutan) and Shimo (an Ice-breathing Titan) — takes far, far too long. In the meantime, the two titular Titans get plenty of action beats, fighting a variety of creatures who stand in the way of their respective missions. These fights have diminishing returns because many of their foes have names; even when they do, they don’t have personalities. Even the dumbest villains in the worst old Godzilla films from the 1960s had names and seemed to want something, even if that was to just be jerks. Have you ever heard of Ebirah? Some would say he’s just a lobster and sure, that’s what he is. But he’s also a grade-A jerk. That goes a long way for me, and for whatever reason it just takes Wingard’s script ages to ever arrive at the point where we meet Skar King. When we do, it’s immediately clear he’s a lightweight villain. This is, after all, the series that brought in King Ghidorah with an apocalypse aesthetic in the second film. It’s never clear why Skar King is a threat to the surface world or frankly a threat to either Kong or Godzilla. He’s a big, angry ape with a whip. Without the help of his enslaved Shimo, he’s a total nobody. My issues with pacing wouldn’t sit at the forefront of my mind if I felt like Wingard nailed the biggest moments, but he approaches filmmaking with what I can only describe as an ADD-addled mindset. I know where he’s coming from: We’re in the same generational cohort. His use of needle-drops is excessive, but I understand it. His love for throwback visual choices is ridiculous, but I respect it. It’s the ADD of it all, though. Wingard rarely holds a shot (although it’s pretty great when he does), and the action is so fast, so busy, so delirious that it starts to become headache-inducing. Even when Kong is simply fighting other apes, things almost move at a blur. What’s interesting is that my 5-year old, the target audience for this stuff, feels basically the same way about the Wingard films. I’ve never led him on. I don’t want him to dislike something. He’s just never been able to connect with Godzilla vs. Kong due to its extremely choppy pacing and difficulty establishing a tone. He felt similarly about this one, especially the earlier parts that lean into villainous ape henchmen. The movie feels erratic. That’s not a problem in most of the other movies in this long-running franchise, which are often slower than they should be. Sometimes patience is a virtue. Lest it seem like I disliked Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire more than its predecessor, well, at least this one has some sense of style to it even if it doesn’t work for me. There are quite a few great moments at the end when Wingard allows them a few seconds to breathe before moving on to the next scene. On paper, this is a lot of what I want from this series (that is if I can’t ever again have anything as good as Godzilla: King of the Monsters). Kong’s B.E.A.S.T. Glove is really cool. Shimo has a great design. Godzilla and Kong becoming friends thanks to an intervention from an old friend is really lovely to me. It’s a wonder we got this film only a few months after Godzilla Minus One delivered a great serious take on the character (and gave plenty of film critics an excuse to be pretentious about Godzilla without actually watching the older films). There are many different types of Godzilla stories, and this leans heavily into the mash-up movies of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Beware any critics who want to tell you the problems with GxK rest with how it depicts the characters; faults aside, Wingard knows what he’s doing, and it’s a valid approach. I just wish his style clicked with me."
"Mar 29, 2024",neutral," IT’S CURIOUS that Godzilla received top billing in Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire because this fifth installment in Legendary Pictures’ MonsterVerse is really King Kong’s movie. Actually, the movie features a whole host of giant apes, but many of them don’t have Kong’s sweet disposition. The MonsterVerse is the film franchise in which mighty Titans roam the earth and humans scramble through the streets trying to stay out of the way. But where do these monsters come from? The Hollow Earth, of course. Godzilla x Kong opens with Monarch, the Titan-tracking government agency, beginning to explore the realm of Hollow Earth, but anxiety levels spike when sensors detect an electromagnetic signal emanating from the mysterious land. Monarch’s also concerned because at the same time Godzilla starts acting strange. Dr. Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall) heads down to Hollow Earth to solve the mystery of the strange signal. Her team includes a military man (Alex Ferns), a Titan-tending veterinarian (Dan Stevens), a podcaster (Brian Tyree Henry), and Ilene’s adopted teenage daughter (Kaylee Hottle). I’m not sure which strains credulity more, the existence of a Hollow Earth or the makeup of the crew for this reconnaissance mission. In the subterranean realm, the team learns that a clan of giant apes led by a wicked king plans to ravage the surface. Stopping the invasion proves too much for Kong to handle on his own. He’ll need a little help from his human friends and Godzilla. Last year, the Japanese film Godzilla Minus One proved that a monster movie can contain compelling human drama. Alas, that’s not the case with Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire. Some of the scenes involving our human explorers elicit a chuckle or two, but the group dynamics feel like a warmed over rendering of those in the original Jurassic Park. In this case, however, the characters are trying to get into trouble rather than escape it, which makes no sense. Every time they stumble across a situation that would cause any right-thinking person to turn around, they charge ahead. But fans don’t go to Godzilla and Kong movies expecting finely tuned plots. They go for the monsters, and Godzilla x Kong has those in abundance. As I’ve already noted, Kong is the star of this movie, and even though he doesn’t speak, he manages to inject more pathos into this film than any of his human co-stars. The thoughtful visage of the computer-generated giant ape moves from weariness to confidence throughout the film, and his interactions with other monsters provide some silent humor. Godzilla, on the other hand, is harder to read. We’re told an intelligence guides him, but the enormous radioactive lizard seems unaware of the destruction he leaves behind. There’s a measure of fun in watching giant monsters duke it out, but when the fight moves to an urban center, like Cairo, Rome, or Rio de Janeiro, part of my mind gets distracted by the property damage and number of lives lost. I suppose every Godzilla movie needs street scenes of people running every which way and shots of the fearsome reptile knocking over buildings, but this wanton disregard for human life causes some cognitive dissonance, pulling me out of the action. Seventy years ago when Godzilla was a villain, it was fine for him to level a city, but this version of the King of the Monsters is supposed to be a hero. No matter. In this movie, both the good guys and the bad guys plow through cityscapes indiscriminately. Perhaps the urban devastation is a metaphor implying that humans aren’t the masters of nature that we believe ourselves to be. But when I consider Godzilla x Kong’s relatively weak plot, I start to doubt the filmmakers intended any deeper meaning. Collin is WORLD’s arts and culture editor.

"Mar 29, 2024",positive," Ever since the wider world caught wind of it, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire never made any secret of where its interests laid; to be a big, flashy, over-the-top brawl involving, among others, the two undisputed heavyweights of monster movie history — this generation’s All Monsters Attack, if you will. The fearlessness with which the film owns that distinction has delighted some and turned off others, and neither of those responses are invalid. On the one hand, there’s no more important item on a film’s checklist than figuring out your identity and sticking by it, whether or not that identity has much merit, and let’s face it; giant monster fights are some of the most carnal, undiluted fun you can have in genre fiction. On the other hand, it’s hard to disagree that a Titan-stuffed slugfest seems like a massive downgrade from Godzilla and King Kong’s thematically cerebral roots; that is, Godzilla as a nuclear allegory, and for Kong, the dangers of natural spectacle, and the utilitarian side of love. Indeed, even if blasting these two monsters with the current iteration of the Hollywood franchise ray didn’t outrightly ruin them, The New Empire should have never been a film truly worthy of any score higher than, in this case, three and a half out of five stars. Read that again; it should have never. On paper, this movie had no right to challenge the ceiling that its monster genre identity placed upon it. And yet, somehow, someway, a brilliant, granular glimmer shone in The New Empire’s eye, and despite not taking enough advantage of it (hence why it’s still pressing against said ceiling rather than smashing through it), this glimmer should earn a tip of the hat from even the film’s most rancid doubters. Let’s get the obvious out of the way first; The New Empire is about a bunch of monsters fighting each other good-and-evil style, and the scenes where a bunch of monsters are fighting each other good-and-evil style are the meat of the triumph here. Each earthshaking confrontation boasts at least one of three winning elements; dazzling evocation, bombastically entertaining choreography, and peculiarly effective humor, and more often than not, there are at least two of these aspects involved. The undisputable highlight of the film is a zero-gravity battle between Team Godzilla-Kong and Team Skar King-Shimo (plus a few extra faces on either side), which takes those first two elements and utilizes them to supremely crackling effect. That being said, there are a few exchanges of punches and energy beams that could have been played to much better effect, with Kong’s difficult recruitment of Godzilla being the prime example. For context, at one point in the film, Kong returns to the surface world to bring Godzilla back to Hollow Earth so he can help Kong fight Skar King and his army, but Godzilla rolls up swinging, no doubt hoping for a salty runback. After trading a few blows with Godzilla to the beat of a stentorian background symphony, Kong becomes fed up with Godzilla’s nonsense, and eventually incapacitates the reptilian Titan before dragging him to the Hollow Earth portal. Godzilla regains consciousness, however, and aims a blast of his newly-acquired pink atomic energy at Kong, ultimately prolonging the fight. Now, the film frequently and quite deliberately plays itself for laughs, but this fight wasted a massive opportunity to play with convention. By treating this bout as a somewhat epic battle courtesy of the orchestral soundtrack, the film deprives it of the chance to really express itself in the way that its textual presentation suggests it wants to; namely, Kong and Godzilla humorously and unceremoniously slapping each other around a bit before Kong basically goes “Listen bud, I don’t like you either, but you’re coming with me whether you like it or not, and we’re gonna solve this new problem, so behave,” before flippantly dragging Godzilla to wherever Kong needs him to be. Furthermore, concluding the fight at that point would have allowed for a much bigger, more exciting reveal of Godzilla’s new powers by saving them until the final confrontation. The human characters in The New Empire serve an important purpose, make no mistake; to lay the expositional and logistical groundwork to set up all of these giant monster fights. That said, the film both knows this all too well, and forgets this a bit too often.  When the likes of Rebecca Hall, Brian Tyree Henry, and Dan Stevens serve monologues on Titan history, upgrading Kong, or explaining why if A happens, then B will happen, The New Empire is on its strongest footing. It’s when the film tries to involve us in a vague impression of a mother-daughter emotional core, or when Henry’s Bernie Hayes stretches his role as comic relief (in name alone), that The New Empire proves it needed a bit more time in the oven. To truly become its best self, a movie should demand excellence from what it excels at; but in its family drama, and awkward, spoken zingers (the film’s comedy is only ever truly effective when it comes by way of the monsters), The New Empire falls far short of excellence. Given this context, the human characters being in service of the monsters and their antics is an absolute necessity, and it’s that mostly-incomplete-but-nevertheless-present intention that gives The New Empire the potential to be a genuinely fantastic movie. Godzilla and King Kong have long since outgrown the constraints of their more erudite origins, especially as characters of The New Empire, and exist exactly as unchained, intelligent, top-of-the-food-chain beasts would; as animals with a commitment to nature, be that their own, their kin, or the natural world, itself. A human watching classic King Kong films might be concerned with how King Kong, as an abstraction, represents love and spectacle. King Kong himself isn’t concerned, though, nor does Godzilla spare even a shadow of a thought of how he parallels atomic devastation; they’re instead thinking “This is bad and dangerous, I need to fight it,” as any animals would. And what is The New Empire if not a bunch of monstrous animals fighting what they’re sensing as bad and dangerous? Thus, by placing its human characters almost entirely in service of this monster-centric story, The New Empire restores Kong and Godzilla not as one-off cinematic case studies, but as infinitely more mythological, wild beings who are beyond human control and comprehension; indeed, we humans with our media literacy and academia are no longer in control of these two – they’ve stepped into a much more independent truth befitting of all-powerful forces of nature. Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is a fun, brisk popcorn movie, despite not using all the tools at its disposal, and not always having the right idea about which tool to use. Nevertheless, it’s beyond proficient with the tool it needs the most, and works from a blueprint for something pretty incredible. Worst case scenario, you’ll dislike the film despite knowing exactly what you’re getting into, at which point it’s your fault for watching it in the first place. Best case scenario, you walk away satisfied, potentially hyped, and even surprised at what it managed to be."
"Mar 29, 2024",negative," There’s no weight to anything in Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire. Certainly no figurative weight — this tag-team adventure for the most iconic giant monsters of movieland has all the gravitas of a toy commercial. But no physical weight either. Though its marquee attractions loom like mountains, we never feel their footsteps in our bones, never get the tingling sensation that something impossibly heavy stands before us. At one point, the big beasts crash through the Egyptian pyramids — those ancient wonders of architectural ingenuity — and we might as well be watching a sandcastle blow away. It’s all so flimsy. This expensive eyesore, this gimcrack nothing of a blockbuster, has the misfortune of arriving in the immediate aftermath of the newly minted Oscar winner Godzilla Minus One. Now there was a kaiju movie; exciting and soulful, it brought its 70-year-old marquee attraction back to his roots as a terrifying allegory for postwar Japan. Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, the latest in the big guy’s parallel Hollywood franchise, is more like the frivolous Toho monster smackdowns of the 1970s, when Godzilla had become a jokey, kid-friendly defender of humanity. At least those movies had some actual weight to them — as in, the kind carried by real stuntmen in real suits stomping on real models. Here, everything on-screen is a digital mirage, a cluster of 0s and 1s lumbering across a glittering backdrop of the same. The previous movie in the series, surprise pandemic hit Godzilla vs. Kong, was no great shakes either. But it had the advantage of leaning on its Vegas fight-promoter hype — the promise of two colossal headliners whaling on each other for the first time in half a century. The New Empire lacks even that hook. Nor does it much capitalize on the promise of these frenemies begrudgingly joining forces. Though that little x in the title is supposedly silent, it might as well be a slash given the little screen time the reptile and ape share. Most of The New Empire unfolds across Hollow Earth, aka the Vernian lost world at the center of our own, which was discovered by the scientists of the last movie. With its gaudy, multicolored foliage and flocks of pterodactyl, the place suggests what Pandora might look like if James Cameron spent only a long weekend rendering it. While director Gareth Edwards shot the first entry in this reboot series mostly on location, augmenting real landscapes with effects afterwards, The New Empire has the flat, anti-immersive scenery of a movie made almost entirely on a soundstage draped in green screen. Picking up where Godzilla vs. Kong left off, the plot is nonsense even by the standards of movies aimed at 8-year-olds of all ages. It hinges on Kong, long believed to be the last of his kind, stumbling upon a tribe of fellow massive apes in an uncharted stretch of Hollow Earth. These distant relatives include an aggressively cute toddler of Mighty Joe Young proportions, as well as the movie’s villain, a crimson-colored anti-Kong who wields a chain-like melee weapon and plots to mount an attack on the world above because … well, does an evil giant ape really need motive? Still, one might wish returning director Adam Wingard (The Guest) spared even a moment on Kong’s desire for belonging. Long scenes of chest-beating territorial conflict evoke Planet of the Apes, but without the, well, humanity Andy Serkis has lent his primate characters. This is, as it might be clear, more of a King Kong movie than a Godzilla movie. That focal point makes sense: The ape is the more expressive character — and by dint of his shared-ancestor lineage, easier to project upon. But where does that leave Toho’s finest? Mostly running errands on the periphery. Edwards used the G-man sparingly, too — it remains a point of contention for fans — but he made each appearance count. Wingard can’t seem to find much for Godzilla to do before the inevitable fisticuffs climax; he curls up for a quick nap in the Colosseum and gets his spikes done, emerging with spiffy hot-pink radioactive highlights. Who knew a 400-foot dinosaur could look bored? As for the humans, they’re a motley assortment of new and returning spectators. The once more sprawling ensemble has been whittled down to an earnest scientist (Rebecca Hall), a jaunty veterinarian (Dan Stevens), a neurotic comic-relief podcaster (Causeway‘s Brian Tyree Henry), and the last daughter of Skull Island (Kaylee Hottle), whose orphanhood mirrors Kong’s. Can you really blame Millie Bobby Brown, among others, for jumping ship? There’s little for an actor to do in these movies but spout pseudoscience or quips. While Godzilla Minus One proved it was possible to care about the people in a giant-monster movie, The New Empire can’t even be bothered to make it seem like the performers are occupying the same universe as their CGI co-stars. Never once do they convincingly interact with the monsters they won’t shut up about. Not that the kaiju stuff is any better. The underwhelming effects give you new appreciation for what Godzilla Minus One did at a fraction of the cost. And the spectacle succumbs to what we might now call the Quantumania problem, shrinking away the fun of the material by removing any sense of scale. What’s the point of making a movie about creatures of skyscraper stature if you’re not going to emphasize their size through contrast? Setting the action primarily within a jungle landscape, away from throngs of puny humans, misplaces the lizard-brain appeal of a Godzilla movie. Even when the action shifts to a metropolitan arena, Wingard deflatingly opts for medium shots that fail to convey just how damn large these warring titans are meant to be. Edwards knew better. For all his 2014 Godzilla divisively denied the audience instant gratification, it was a triumph of scale; by shooting the carnage from the ground and framing it through a terrified civilian perspective, he made the monsters look unfathomably massive — and in their computergenerated way, almost real, too. The sequels, supposedly course correcting away from the restraint of that franchise-launching hit, have delivered bigger doses of prehistoric combat, the dumb fun we were said to have been deprived. But they’ve also tacked steadily away from anything resembling grandeur. The New Empire is a new low in that respect. It’s big in a very small way. If there's anything we live for in the streaming era, it's the weeks where we have more than enough new shows to watch. This week, Amazon Prime Video has dropped all eight episodes of Fallout, which could take up a weekend all by itself. And on Sunday, April 14, HBO and Max are premiering the first episode of The Sympathizer, a miniseries that will likely earn Robert Downey Jr. an Emmy Award next fall. Apple TV+ has also premiered Franklin, a Revolutionary War-era miniseries about Benjamin Franklin's time in France. That show arrived right on the heels of Apple TV+'s Sugar, which premiered last week. And there are still more new shows coming in April. After one of the great cliffhangers in the show's history, fans are eager to gather every detail about Stranger Things 5. Understandably, season 5, the finale of Netflix's Stranger Things, is now one of television's most highly anticipated events. Since Vecna succeeded in tearing open a massive gate to the Upside Down, audiences now expect the heroes of Hawkins to engage in an epic final battle against the evil psychic and his army of monsters. Netflix continues to build an impressive library of action films. Whether you're interested in violent action films (The Equalizer, Extraction 2, The Outpost) or sci-fi action (The Hunger Games, 65, Looper), Netflix has multiple genres to choose from to satisfy your action needs.

I don’t care if they keep spending hundreds of millions of dollars making more Godzilla movies. I’ve already seen the best there is. No fluff piece of toy marketing, last year’s Oscar-winning “Godzilla Minus One” was a real film, with artistry, symbolism and epic drama. But, the cinematic gears have to roll on, feeding the “star-maker machinery” as Joni Mitchell once said. Into theaters this week lumbers “Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire.” Designed as a sequel to 2021’s “Godzilla vs. Kong,” the plot centers on another kaiju crisis that erupts from Skull Island just as humanity has come to believe in Godzilla as their savior and Kong the bully on the block. Both have been monitored by the scientists of Monarch, a covert organization that keeps track of the earth’s titans, after the defeat of Mechagodzilla. Much of the Monsterverse franchise is dependent on the Hollow Earth Theory, a belief that our planet has a vast underground chamber at the center. This is where a mysterious signal is being emitted that has been picked up by young Jia (Kaylee Hottle), the deaf daughter of Monarch scientist Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall). It is during investigation of this signal in Hollow Earth that it is discovered to be inhabited by a variety of gigantic creatures, including a population of monstrous apes. As you would expect, the rivalry between Kong and Godzilla dissolves as a common enemy appears in the form of a gigantic ape who has been keeping a powerful monster captive using pain. A movie that feels like it was rendered entirely from marketing surveys, “Godzilla x Kong” is noisy and confusing. Its script by three different writers, and directed by Adam Wingard, who did the prequel “Godzilla vs. Kong” (2021), serves as a clunky way to connect the dots between epic beatdowns featuring massive destruction and presumably horrific loss of life for humans in their way. At least Mothra makes an appearance. I always thought this was one of the better monsters in this universe. As for the human actors, Rebecca Hall, Kaylee Hottle, Dan Stevens, Brian Tyree Henry, and Fala Chen did their best, but their work tends to be overwhelmed by the need to keep the titans duking it out. Based on a New York Times bestselling novel by Karen Kingsbury. ""Someone Like You"" is described as an achingly beautiful love story. After the tragic loss of his best friend, a grieving young architect launches a search for her secret twin sister. Directed by Tyler Russell, this film stars Sarah Fisher, Jake Allyn and Lynn Collins. It is set for a Tuesday (April 2) release. These films are showing at the Mitchell Storyteller 7 Cinemas, 110 Old Talpa Cañon Road. For tickets, showtimes and additional information, call (575) 751-4245 or visit storyteller7.com. Set in France in 1889, the film follows the life of Dodin Bouffant as a chef living with his personal cook and lover Eugénie. They share a long history of gastronomy and love but Eugénie refuses to marry Dodin, so the food lover decides to do something he has never done before: cook for her. Directed by Anh Hung Tran, it stars Juliette Binoche, Benoît Magimel and Emmanuel Salinger. This film will be screened Friday (March 29). In modern-day Helsinki, two lonely souls in search of love meet by chance in a karaoke bar. However, their path to happiness is beset by obstacles - from lost phone numbers to mistaken addresses, alcoholism, and a charming stray dog. This film is screening at the TCA Saturday (March 30). Seydou, a teenage boy who, together with his cousin Moussa, decides to leave Dakar in Senegal and make his way to Europe. A contemporary Odyssey through the dangers of the desert, the horrors of the detention centers in Libya and the perils of the sea. Directed by Matteo Garrone. This film will be screened Monday (April 1). Written and directed by Academy Award nominee Ava DuVernay, “Origin” chronicles the tragedy and triumph of Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Isabel Wilkerson as she investigates a global phenomenon of epic proportions. Portrayed by Academy Award nominee Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor, Isabel experiences unfathomable personal loss and love as she crosses continents and cultures to craft one of the defining American books of our time.

"Mar 29, 2024",positive,"Absolute absurd popcorn fun! The most silly, trippy, rock-em sock-em, entertaining installment yet in the MonsterVerse. The Kong & Godzilla tag team rumble is worth the ticket. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Mar 29, 2024",negative," Every one of the recent English language kaiju epics from Legendary Pictures has walked a different path, and “Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire” continues the tradition. This one is a direct sequel to 2021’s “Godzilla vs. Kong,” a simple movie inspired by the 1962 Toho Studios film “King Kong vs. Godzilla” that pitted the big lizard and the big ape against each other before teaming them against a robot foe. But rather than just repeat the template in ""The New Empire,"" returning director Adam Wingard and his two co-writers offer a more fragmented and sometimes knowingly silly narrative, cross-cutting between lines of action in multiple locations that all lead to a huge showdown with a lot of creatures.  Artistically it’s the most hit-and-miss entry in the current MonsterVerse, lacking the cohesive and distinctive vibe that powered all of the others, whether it was the 2014 “Godzilla” (basically “Close Encounters of the Godzilla Kind”), “Kong: Skull Island” (a bizarro riff on Vietnam movies), “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” (the first “team-up” entry, with lots of family melodrama stirred in), or Wingard’s original, gloriously goofy Godzilla-Kong flick, which owed quite a bit to 1960s exploration sci-fi like “Journey to the Center of the Earth” and 1980s Hong Kong and American action thriller/buddy films where the two main guys have to have a fistfight before they team up against a dangerous villain.  Rebecca Hall’s anthropologist Ilene Andrews is the main character this time, tending to her adoptive daughter Jia (Kaylie Hottle), and trying to figure out the connection between mysterious energy pulses detected on the Monarch Project’s monster-measuring tech and frenzied drawings that Jia has been scrawling on school desks and scratch paper. The answer—uncovered with help from muckraker/conspiracy podcaster Bernie Hayes (Brian Tyree Henry), another character from the last movie—is a return to the “Close Encounters with Godzilla” notion, positing that what they’re all experiencing is a combination distress signal and warning about an impending catastrophe. As intimated in trailers and other promotional material, there’s a secret civilization of giant Kong-like primates imprisoned in an unexplored portion of Hollow Earth, plotting their escape and a takeover of the surface world. Their leader is a scarred and sadistic despot who enslaves his own kind in a mining operation in a hellish volcanic cavern, a set that confirms the filmmakers have seen “Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom” more than once.  As somebody who’s been a booster of this franchise from the beginning, it’s my sad duty to report that “Godzilla x Kong” is all over the place, barely working up a proper head of steam before cutting to something else. It makes ""King of the Monsters"" seem single-mindedly on-message. And it’s even more larded with redundant and wooden “make sure that everybody in the audience understands everything that’s happening at all times” exposition than the previous films. The showdowns are rousing and often brilliantly choreographed, particularly the finale, a multiple-monster main event with lots of other creatures bustling around in the margins. The live-action and motion capture performances are mostly marvelous, despite the bum dialogue and Wingard’s tendency to rush through sequences and whole relationships that might’ve been extraordinary had they been presented with patience and elegance.  Dan Stevens is a pleasant though functionally absurd addition to the cast. He plays a swashbuckling, poetry-quoting ex-boyfriend of Ilene who's famous for being the first and so far only kaiju veterinarian, and is introduced extracting an abscessed tooth from Kong’s mouth by rappelling down into it from a hovercraft. (I don’t know if it was Shakespeare or Freud who said that a man with a toothache cannot be in love, but this movie offers a corollary: a giant ape with a toothache cannot defend the surface world.) Stevens has real chemistry with Henry, whose dialogue often sounds ad-libbed even if it wasn't. There are times when they seem like they’re at risk of cracking each other up and blowing a take. But the movie fails to take advantage of their connection and build it into something truly memorable.  Kong’s relationship with a big-eyed little scamp of an ape that he meets while exploring Hollow Earth is a much bigger missed opportunity, although the bits we do see are performed by motion capture performers and the FX teams with imagination and care. The younger ape is essentially an abused child who is treacherous, selfish, and cowardly because he grew up in a cult. He suddenly now has a good parenting model courtesy of Kong, a hairy, burly single dude who lives a solitary existence, is an orphan himself, and had no parent role models (at least not that we know of), yet still treats the younger ape with patience and compassion even when it’s not earned, and makes a decent primate out of him. Adam Sandler has told a version of this tale many times. As presented here, it’s a mirror of what’s happening between Ilene and Jia—the latter reconnecting with her own roots and Ilene growing increasingly sad at the possibility that the girl might outgrow the need for her. Two adoptive parents, two different sets of challenges, but the same basic story: so much could’ve been done, but wasn't. More for the minus column: The computer generated creature skins look more cartoony than in previous entries. And the screenplay introduces its genuinely terrifying and charismatic villain, Skar King, too late to give him and Kong a chance to build and flesh out their antagonism, as the preceding movie did with Kong and Godzilla's relationship. It’s fascinating to watch the slow revelation of Kong’s value system and realize how starkly it contrasts with the behavior of his evil doppelganger, a swaggering, preening rotter who seems to have been played via time warp by Gary Oldman in the '90s. Kong's triumph here should have felt cathartic: a victory of decency over despotic cruelty rather than narrative box-checking.  The whole film needed more ape content, really. It's the stuff that really hits. The movie doesn't seem to recognize how powerful it is. A more smartly prioritized film might have focused on the vividly rendered and characterized apes and the humans that follow them around, perhaps to the exclusion of Godzilla, who is treated here mainly as a mayhem-producing force that the movie cuts to regularly because the film has “Godzilla” in the title. (He does have his moments though, like using a pro-wrestling suplex to slam an adversary and sleeping curled up in the Roman Colosseum like it's the world's largest dog bed.) If you love the “what the hell, let’s try it” sensibility that the Legendary Pictures monster franchise has embraced thus far, you’ll still find plenty here to enjoy. But it shouldn’t have been necessary to go looking for it.

"Mar 29, 2024",negative," Taking away the hook of what made “Godzilla Vs. Kong” somewhat engaging, Adam Wingard’s follow-up forgoes a clash of titans in favor of a convoluted sequel that features poorly rendered CGI which, blown on up on an IMAX-sized screen, show’s just how far the mighty have fallen. Perhaps we were spoiled when “Godzilla Minus One,” a Japanese import from Toho studios that took the radioactive lizard to soaring new highs, reinvigorated interest in a character who has headlined 30+ movies over the last three decades. Alas, “Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire,” is a digital slugfest without much punch or emotional levity. The human characters, especially poor Rebecca Hall, are used for no other purpose than to exposition dump and are completely ineffective to the plot. Something “Minus One” did not struggle with.  Ditching the “vs” in the title all but confirmed we weren’t going to see the two prominent poster children in the “MonsterVerse” saga duke it out for total supremacy, which means there must be something worthy enough for them to emerge from Hollow Earth, a sanctuary they roam freely. But doing this means establishing a framework of lore and mythology that becomes so entangled within itself, the movie becomes vapor. A passing mist that evaporates as soon as it enters your eyeballs.  It sees scientist IIene Andrews (Hall) and her adopted daughter Jia (Kaylee Hottle), who can communicate with Kong, unearth a disturbance deep into the surface of Hollow Earth with no real explanation as to why, but it’s probably got something to do with the fact Kong has been going bananas and Godzilla is being lured to various landmarks around the world. Trying to solve the issue, IIene enlists conspiracy podcaster Bernie (Brian Tyree Henry – once again demoted to being the token comedic relief) and monster veterinarian Trapper (Dan Stevens – sporting a Hawaiian shirt and about the only beacon of enjoyment in this mostly joyless affair) to traverse into the unknown realms of the artificial planet in the hopes of understanding what’s got these titans all wound up.  Turns out, Kong isn’t the only giant ape alive and, though we hear a narration about his constant search for long lost relatives and the need for companionship, the ones he stumbles upon are, uh, not very nice, and they serve a leader known as The Scarking, who also happens to conveniently imprison a Godzilla-like creature for reasons Hall explains in one of those mind boggling exposition monologues. Of which there are many. Don’t even think about keeping up. So, with conventional human characters (we didn’t even really discuss the forced mother-daughter relationship nor the cheesy jokes) and lame special effects, “Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire” sinks the franchise to new lows. A stoic, monster-mash-up that has buckets of destruction, some of historical landmarks in Rome, Cairo, and Rio de Janeiro, and not a single ounce of imagination. Perhaps these two behemoths need to sit down and work out their differences, so we don’t have to be subjected to another bloated action-adventure that’s got no sense of purpose. "
