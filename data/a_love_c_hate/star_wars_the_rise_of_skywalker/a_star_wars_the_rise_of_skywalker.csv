Apr 6 2024,negative,disney lost me in the star wars franchise with this movie too many inconsistent and character motivations force abilities and implausible choices felt like new force abilities were being created out of nowhere to try and wow us problem is those abilities are unsustainably overpowered and ruin future storytelling would love to see  stories written as if each character were the main character of their own story that is a high bar though i believe youre very capable of it disney
Apr 4 2024,negative,while last jedi did more damage to the story this movie comes out as the overall worst movie of the saga by a panic to over correct characters act out of character whole plotlines come to an end abruptly and without any fan fare whole other plotlines are just retconned out if anything it retroactively makes the last jedi and the entire trilogy worse knowing that nothing led anywhere had they had the guts to stick with it they could have smartly tied things together and even make us look at last jedi in a new and appreciative context the final movie in the trilogy does away with any setup from the previous films to bring back palpatine which cheapens the original 6 films to try and get butts in the seat disney views this franchise as a cash cow and they quickly realized that poor quality and writing doesnt equal lots of tickets
Mar 28 2024,negative,visually stunning actionpacked absurd convoluted shallow drivel flashy without substance amounts to bird droppings on the tombstone of star wars which died with tlj
Mar 25 2024,negative,at its core episode ix is an acceptable film however its incredibly underwhelming for the last installment of the skywalker saga
Mar 21 2024,negative,as a generic sci fi film the rise of skywalker works fine but unfortunately it is the concluding chapter of the 8 previous star wars films in this case this movie fails in almost every possible way to give the saga a satisfying ending yes the movie does not bore you it is action packed and moves at a relatively fast narrative speed but there are absolutely nothing that makes the previous films special left in this film it is terribly hallow characters that have enormous potentials like finn and poe does not get any attention in the film and the main character rey which trilogy spends two movie portraying got to be one of the most disappointing main character in any star wars media daisy ridley is a good actress and did the best she could with what she was given but that does not change the fact that what she was given was a mary sue character who barley have any character development in any of the movies now to the antagonist bringing palpatine back shows that the producer does not want to spend any time on portraying a new character but the reveal is not only poorly writtensince the film never explained how he returned bring palpatine back basically means all the work that the characters did in the previous six films are worth nothing cause according to the moviesomehow palpatine returned the ending of this movie is also terribly written until now 5 years later i still does not understand why rey was able to defeat palpatine just because she got another lightsaber oh did i forgot to mention there are no ending fight scenes in this movie just a mary sue character reflecting lighting overall if episode 8 is a movie that divided the franchise episode 9 united the franchise once again because of how disappointing it is
Mar 15 2024,positive,star wars episode ix the rise of skywalker attempts to tie up the sagas loose ends with epic scale and nostalgia but falls short of delivering a perfect conclusion the sagas end boasts impressive visual effects and thrilling action sequences though its pace and convoluted plot leave little room for total closure with strong performances from daisy ridley and adam driver episode ix closes on a relatively strong note though leaving viewers with more questions than answers
Mar 13 2024,negative,it tried to repair the damage from episode 8 but ended up becoming overdone and childish it assumes the audience will accept just about anything it throws their way including the ridiculous reveal in the opening crawl its a fun movie i guess especially for young children but it is not a good movie by any means a disappointing end to a disappointing trilogy i blame episode 8 for setting it up for failure
Mar 5 2024,negative,it was terrible not visually but the story was straight up taken out of a trashcan nothing makes sense they straight up forgot a lot of lor and rey is a palpatine not a skywalker
Mar 3 2024,negative,some meme worthy scenes redeemed it from being unwatchable but it is still pretty abhorrently peeved together balanced try too hard of a movie it felt a slap in the face if you look for depth in star wars stories in the new era because it gave you the ending stage naruto storyline and little to none emotions just cheap twists and thrills shame on you sw franchise
Feb 29 2024,negative,ugh this was a forgettable awful wrap to a forgettable awful trillogy big issues i had with it was in character development lazy writing palpatine died mcguffins really a dagger that aligns perfectly with the wreckage of a deathstar that has a thing that comes out of the handle that points to the exact spot contrived garbage that is so unbelievable it pulls you out of the film cheap laughs at the expense of degrading characters it is flashy but all the glitz cant hide the flaws garbage film making
Feb 19 2024,negative,when you finish watching this as the finale to the sequel trilogy you really realise that the writers had no idea what they wanted to do with the film series such a shame they ruined the star wars reputation after the revenge of the sith masterpiece
Feb 19 2024,positive,absolutely loved this movie a perfect way to wrap up the saga with great conclusions for the major characters
Feb 13 2024,negative,somehow palpatine returned yeah as someone who is a pre2009 trekkie at heart and just a scifi lover in general it kind of hurts my heart to see how a fellow scifi giant will all the potential in the galaxy fall so short of how it could grow and expand the actors are fine the franchise and the ips involved are very loved but it is the story writing that hurts this film the most and is the biggest thorn in the sequel trilogy in my humble but widely shared opinion this film hurts cannon and lore and messes with loved and established characters  i hope the higherups at lucas film and disney take more heart to what the fans are talking about and to have more respect for the original source material
Feb 10 2024,positive,the visuals were really really cool   but the story was just macguffin to macguffin to macguffin all the way until the end that being said i was entertained
Feb 8 2024,positive,its just okay not the best but not the worst
Feb 2 2024,positive,very nice watch not as happy with the plot as i would imagine just too many things did not make no sense or werent mentioned imagined ben to have better ending
Jan 26 2024,negative,the twist ending not only comes out of nowhere and doesnt land but partly ruins the plot of the original trilogy which is a huge disservice to fans rey continues to be a onedimensional mary sue and finn and rose are almost sidelined completely and their romance from the previous movie forgotten there is little cohesion at all with the events of the previous film thanks to corporate interference and the changing of directors the cinematography is great as us usual but beyond the visual spectacle this is a mess of a film
Jan 22 2024,negative,the story is just dumb   makes no sense full of coincidences and has no connection to the prior film
Jan 18 2024,positive,okay this movie takes the cake  i love how this is the final movie of star wars it is epic how much i love it and the return of palptine and the return of the classic star destroyers it is a blast watching the movie but sad that they had to include carrier fishers death in the movie
Jan 14 2024,negative,not a good movie on any level convoluted plot betrayal of the lore poor acting betrayal even of the trilogy its a part of some good special effects but not worth watching stupid plot twist which is that palpatine is still alive reys resolution is meaningless whos to say she wont just end up like luke the movie can also function as a giant middle finger to carrie fischer total disrespect not only to the character of leia but also to the human being who portrayed her as well as to anyone who ever appreciated her art
Jan 12 2024,negative,the second movie in the row to break preestablished lore on what is and isnt possible in the setting terrible payout bad reused gillian unsatisfactory stakes due to people somehow appearing out of nowhere when there travel time would not allow ramps up the bad guy power creep with no build up or reasoning that makes logical sense
Jan 11 2024,negative,i have a rather large bone to pick with the new star wars movies and their lack of representation this movie just felt boring and they essentially ditched finn as a character also whats up with the random kiss at the end  between the two women that we know nothing about i love to see lgbtq characters but not if theyre just there to check off a diversity box and  we dont even know their names
Jan 10 2024,negative,the whole point in making movies is to challenge the audience create something unexpected and original sw tros does not do this this film grabs at the cringiest ideas of the fan base to appease people who have no grasp on what good writing is its hard to fathom that this movie exists in the same franchise as sw tesb and whats worse is that it leaves that thing finn wanted to tell rey as unanswered the film also leaves the identity of landos daughter for the viewer to read on other media as the conclusion of the skywalker series everything should have been answered in this installment   largest points of awful writing spoilers snokes origins reys origins inconsistency luke catching the lightsaber inconsistency hux being a spy force healing too convenient lazy writing  creates plot holes throughout the entire franchise kylo fixing his helmet inconsistency made his design look dumb should have just had more copies of the helmet
Dec 19 2023,negative,terrible movie dont get me wrong good action scenes good acting and lots of plot twists but that doesnt make a good star wars movie a star wars movie has to be special and creative and this movie lacks all creativity and specialness i hate what this franchise has become and i hate how there was a director change midway through the series because now the trilogy is all over the place i wish the makers of these movies knew how to read an audience and actually make a good movie
Dec 16 2023,negative,the rise of skywalker makes haste through what barely constitutes as a script when it comes to tone characters and story this is really just any rushed out actionspace adventure and the only thing that makes it star wars is the useage of familiar names and locations in all honesty this is barely watchable
Dec 16 2023,positive,i loved this movie as a culmination of the skywalker saga with palpatine returning as the villain i was very happy brilliant performances from ian mcdiarmid daisy ridley and adam driver
Nov 28 2023,negative,palpatine is my fave star wars character  but even he is butchered in this
Nov 28 2023,negative,better but the writing is still pretty bad
Nov 28 2023,negative,the final chapter in the star wars sequel trilogy the rise of skywalker sees jj abrams back on directing duties since the force awakens as the story of new characters rey finn poe and kylo ren draws to a close in typically epic fashion  with the mixed reaction second chapter the last jedi prompted back in 2017 there seemed to be a conscious effort by disney to regroup somewhat especially after the disappointing reception of solo a star wars story the following year the rise of skywalker had to be either universally beloved or at the very least satisfying as an ending to most star wars fans to make this regrouping worthwhile from its opening text crawl this sequel already appears to make a conscious jump past the last jedi and back onto more familiar territory with the reintroduction of emperor palpatine ian mcdiarmid and reys plot focusing even more on her origins  the dead speak we are told moments before kylo ren adam driver travels solo to the emperors lair an oldschool mad scientist lab complete with halffinished supreme leader snoke clones in water tanks lol screaming lightning im not kidding and big magnifying glasses everywhere still not kidding palpatine is every bit as overthetop as youd expect and the overall tone here is reminiscent of old horror bmovies which certainly could have been apt seeing as the likes of horror giants christopher lee and peter cushing were once a big part of this franchise unfortunately the palpatine scenes are where all this begins and ends and all that remains is the nagging feeling that these tonal shifts and this apparently random reviving of emperor palpatine might not actually work  somehow the emperors back poe dameron oscar isaac exclaims at one point in the movie with the word somehow doing a heck of a lot of heavy lifting here and this is a good way to understand whats off about this movie somehow most of the last jedi isnt so important now somehow rose isnt a main character anymore somehow lando calrissians back and he has the entire world on speeddial somehow force healing is a big thing all of a sudden somehow the emperor is all the siths somehow rey has mastered every power by running in the woods and so on  not that the film never explains anything but there is a lot it indeed doesnt explain and in fact the overall pacing of this installment feels extremely rushed and jj abrams erratic perhaps more star trekfriendly direction is mostly to blame for this   fortunately after a frankly clunky first act we are given a solid second act thats genuinely entertaining and should keep the attention of even the grumpiest star wars fan rey wrestles with the good and the bad within her as kylo ren closes in c3p0 anthony daniels doing great work as usual becomes key to the resistances success poe reveals his darker past and there are some fun action sequences along the way fair homage is paid to the late carrie fisher and there are some enjoyable enough if gimmicky cameos here and there sadly brand new characters like richard e grants allegiant general pryde and naomi ackies jannah arent given much to work with and the likes of rose kelly marie tran and maz lupita nyongo are criminally cast aside as if there was never any plan for them  the softening of the last jedis bolder ideas hurts this movie which too often feels like a cowardly retreat into safer territory actual drama be damned there are elements explored here that do work admittedly the closing of kylo rens character arc is mostly effective and its rewarding to see ben solo being himself even for a brief moment while poe and finn collaborating as the new leaders of the resistance makes sense there are also some good ideas in there like rey potentially killing chewbacca by mistake or c3p0 tragically losing his memory to save his friends lives but the film refuses to actually go there and undoes all this within minutes perhaps for fear of offending a single diehard fan who might tweet negatively about all of this or for fear of instilling real emotions into the movie  truthfully this feels like a film based on an older script that was reworked much later on with lots of unclear ideas thrown in and shadows of better prior ideas still visible but only just the writing as a whole by the way is rather weak especially when it comes to the dialog but weve seen this many times before in the star wars franchise so its almost to be expected at this point though its never all that welcome  this is a fastpaced movie that does everything youd expect in a star wars film ewoks even pop up briefly but it doesnt so much feel like the end of an epic trilogy as it does the final breath of a rebooted franchise that was not carefully workedout from the beginning and cant wait to end once and for all some of it is fanservice some of it is almost stream of consciousness none of it feels quite right but at the very least its never dull   missed opportunity this was
Nov 26 2023,negative,its funny really the user score is opposite to the critic score even when pretty much everyone agree this is a bad movie and it is but just because you hated last jedi and the critics loved it and now when the critics hate it you upvote this trash lol its really shows that star wars fans are manbabies just because last jedi is bad does not make this one good in fact i would say as someone who only like force awakens that both this one and last jedi are bad who is worse this one probably last jedi at least had some balls to its script this one ray is the granddoughter of palpatine wtf thats makes the star wars universe incredibly small in huge galaxy its only the story of 2 families lol but yes there is some good one and that is rouge one rouge one was pretty much the best star wars movie since revenge of the sith
Nov 25 2023,negative,not just a terrible star wars film but one of the worst movies ive ever seen
Nov 5 2023,positive,i really liked the movie only thing is that it was a bit confusing and often i found that they would find a problem only to solve it in the next scene
Nov 2 2023,negative,i almost walked out of this movie ive wonder why we have not seen any interviews with jj abrams since this movie maybe someone can point me in the right direction id love to know some behindthescene details on how this movie got to this level of awful
Nov 2 2023,positive,star wars comes to an epic and satisfying conclusion in the rise of skywalker which has rey facing palpatine  and ben and hux turning sides from the bad guys side a sensational desert chase youll want to watch over and over everyone has fun with their characters and locations are a sight the rise of skywalker is an adventure youll want to experience again and again
Oct 31 2023,neutral,in my honest opinion this film does justice to the star wars trope of the final instalment being the best driver is great in his role while other star wars fans might see the introduction of the main villain as a poor choice i see these criticisms and put it down to awful execution a good concept but overall a bad film
Oct 25 2023,negative,the absolute worst inconsistent unlikeable no character growth
Oct 20 2023,positive,it doesnt do a whole lot for the already bland unoriginal plain awful new trilogy of star wars but the increase in action and the return of a badass terrifying villain did this installation a lot of good
Oct 19 2023,negative,a bad movie with a bad plot poorly written characters the only reson ray exists is to be a girlboss she is shown as incredibly powerful with a lot of skill and expirence even tho she never earned that she never learned  she was instantly able to deafeat everyone zero character development
Oct 17 2023,positive,the characters arent themselves but it was an overall good conclusion to star wars
Oct 16 2023,negative,this is easily one of the worst movies ive ever seen
Oct 15 2023,negative,although episode 9 is more entertaining than the mess of episode 8 it is not so far from competing with the previous one mentioned for who is the worst in the saga  if the previous one took away the development of the characters in this one apart from that it also did it with the canon how to revive palpatine that rey without training is more powerful than the jedi masters themselves that she can now heal wounds with the force  that ghosts can touch things and use force and much more  and not even the fanservice is well done since only the voices of the ancient jedi appear but not in ghosts that palpatine goes from starring in one of the best star wars deaths in episode 6 to the most pathetic and meaningless of the saga  or that it was the ghost of han solo that convinced kylo to turn to the light side when it would be more logical for it to be anakin  and well despite that i give him a star because there was only one who did his job well the great john williams
Oct 15 2023,negative,this movie spat on the legacy of george lucas and made the anakins sacrifice pointless the only thing this movie succeeded at was being a complete disgrace from top to bottom
Oct 15 2023,positive,it is a decent movie some things are messy indeed but i loved it
Oct 15 2023,positive,i was quite deeply upset with the last jedi it just wasnt a star wars movie and basically blatantly disregarded so much of the previous films rise of skywalker fixed every mistake that was made in last jedi and has the perfect ending to the saga with just enough of a cliffhanger to keep the star wars universe open to new movies i absolutely love the creative direction of jj abrams and obviously the entire cast are incredible actors
Oct 13 2023,negative,easily the weakest film in the star wars saga so far abrams and company seemingly tried to make something that would temper the anger felt by some fans over the last jedi but trying to appease so many conflicting encampments while also closing out three whole trilogies and introducing a major twist means that theres no time to explain anything or let any emotional moments really land honestly i do not understand why they didnt delay this movie to put the work in that the screenplay clearly needed    i mean the answer is money but still
Oct 10 2023,negative,the movie reminded me of a road runner cartoon
Oct 6 2023,negative,somehow this movie was made  seriously i could not have been more disappointed even if it were a oneoff film the story was flimsy at best and the fight choreography was weaker than some of the lesser clone wars episodes
Oct 6 2023,negative,there are not enough rotten tomatoes to describe how awful this movie was they killed the context of what a star wars movie means this movie includes a very bad dialogue and boring new charters but it ends with the same bad guy of all the previous movies a failure of a great franchise
Oct 6 2023,negative,this is nonsense unfortunately
Oct 5 2023,negative,so after destroying luke they made anakins sacrifice insignificant because at the end of the day rey is the one killing palpatine and wow the poetic ending of luke giving up and surrendering and refusing to fight in rotj immediately got trashed with all the jedi telling rey to kill palpatine i mean even obi wan told luke to kill vader but he didnt and that was the entire point of im a jedi like my father before me the entire trilogy is embarrassing
Oct 4 2023,negative,i thought this movie ruined star wars the writing and dialogue were shocking and the actors tried
Oct 2 2023,negative,a complete mess with no originality or stakes  a betrayal to the star wars universe and its baffling it has a higher rating then movies like rots
Oct 2 2023,negative,the first half of the movie is about searching for the sith navigation really a whole hour for just that man i never felt asleep in the first six instalments include tfa thats first seven instalments  too much emotional scenes those are not in necessary is this a space actionadventure movie or love story like a couple arguing between kylo n rey from the start to the end i dont feel the excitement in the whole movie  finally where is the epic lightsabre fight their fighting styles are like chopping chicken with the sabre is there even a fighting art director
Oct 1 2023,negative,the ending its very bad why rey says that her lastname its skywalker that its not possible
Sep 29 2023,negative,the effects were super but to see a complete copy of the original trilogy as overdosed cocain version was enough
Sep 28 2023,positive,i had to cry it was so beautiful i cant put it into words
Sep 26 2023,negative,im being generous in giving this movie a 15 star rating because there was nothing abrams could have done to salvage the sequel trilogy after the last jedi even taking that into account this movie relies on contrivance and macguffins for nearly every plot point and spoiler alert brining back palpatine was both lazy and decreases the stakes of his defeat in the original trilogy i wish this movie could be retconned but at this point the damage is done
Sep 24 2023,negative,one of the worst movies ive seen in my life
Sep 24 2023,negative,an honest attempt to rescue what johnson ruined in the last jedi and it wasnt pretty mindless exposition a disconnected plot that lacks innovation acting that borders on madefortv quality basically abrams just wanted to put out the fire and he did but thats all he did leaving behind the the ashes of the star wars legacy mildly better than a trip to the dentist
Sep 23 2023,neutral,the best out of the sequels but still bad great visuals but thats it
Sep 20 2023,negative,the fuck86 why is it 86
Sep 19 2023,negative,good special effects but as all  films from the last trilogy its all a mess with poor characters development fin could be way more important in the series rey has a  poor development as a hero through the 3 films phasma could be a way more valuable vilain too a buzz droid and a droideka has way more presence in the series
Sep 18 2023,neutral,this one had a real shot at redemption it looked for a bit as if rey might turn to the dark side and kylo might redeem himself by returning to the light side would have been a much better more original and unexpected turn of events the star destroyer fleet looked great honestly i only went because 1 the kids wanted to and 2 i started this journey when i was nine so i figured i should see it through no matter the cost to my childhood memories
Sep 18 2023,negative,so much potential wasted wouldve been far better if she had been a palpatine as is her blood rather than this rubbish of her becoming a skywalker especially when anakin was the only decent skywalker character anyway the way the characters of the republic are just makes you want the empire to win and come back to power and rid the galaxy of this nonsense wouldve been a better if rey went to the dark side and her character probably wouldve become likeable shoddy storyline from the newest trilogy in my opinion and better writers are needed
Sep 18 2023,negative,terrible writing awful plot lines and abhorrent massacre of the star wars franchise the series would be better without this film
Sep 17 2023,negative,no words can explain how stupidly written this movie is nor could they describe how insulting george must feel that this is what was made from the beautiful world he imagined its only completely aweful if you truly love the star wars universe and understand the bigger picture of what is going on in the galaxy everyday folk who know nothing of star wars would probably find this movie mildly entertaining
Sep 16 2023,negative,this really seems to have been more of a commercial in an effort to bring together a divided fandom when disney didnt need it they were in the process of trying to attract people to star wars lands at disney parks
Sep 15 2023,negative,i appreciate jj abrams attempt to make a coherent story out of rian johnsons sludge filled disaster but the convoluted and creatively bankrupt ending fails to achieve satisfaction
Sep 15 2023,positive,seriously to keep up with the prophets and overseers  seers star wars rather it be even star wars lego and the mandalorian and especially most currently important ahsoka have been up to date with state of the arts metaphoric role playing and act describing  if people ever discover why the story about ahsoka has postively forced me to break down in tears with controlled uncontrollable tremors in my stomach they will how ever soon shortly find out why theyll understand why ahsoka has been the absolute only best female jedi bounty hunter  in fact during battlefront 2 the storyline depicted that 1 of her near demeanorship descibed in graphics had been murdered during battle  i stopped playing battlefront 2 at that point which was about at the 75 mark of the total role play game yet it was indeed a replay about her ahsoka yet she was brought back to life resurrected after that murder after during 1 large ground battle that i really believed that if i had played the game more efficiently and especially at that point i could had prevented that murder against occuring  shes absolutely the coolest humblest and experienced female jedi knight yet really a female knight being a valkyrie and as of 15 september 2023 without it being defined to me i dont even know why yet yet the entire thing has caused tears to surface from my stomach
Sep 14 2023,negative,really disney all you can come up with is zombie palpatine no wonder tfa started strong tlj was the the start of the crash tros is the wreckage
Sep 14 2023,positive,in all my years watching the star wars franchise i have never seen a movie quite like this all of the action and all of the suspense that has made this series a fan favorite has led to this moment as the skywalker saga comes to a close there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that there will be more incredible adventures in the near future with that being said star wars the rise of skywalker will hold a very special place in my heart as a story that will never be forgotten if theres one thing that ive learned while watching this franchise its that there will always be a very special adventure that can only take place in a galaxy far far away
Sep 14 2023,positive,somehow palpatine returned                                                                                                                     it had fabulous features and a great finale but there were just some weird as characters and scenes
Sep 13 2023,negative,how does this terrible film have a high audience score this movie almost ruined the star wars franchise dumb sequels fans rate this movie appropriately for what it is cause its terrible
Sep 12 2023,positive,decent enough but a huge step down from the previous installment
Sep 10 2023,negative,this is by far the worst movie ive ever seen do you love star wars if you do do yourself a favor and dont watch this movie it will ruin your perception of the franchise episode 6 was the perfect ending to the skywalker saga anakin bringing true balance to the force in the perfect conclusion so theres no need to watch episodes 7 8 and 9 and watch beloved characters drastically change their personalities off screen mark hamill stated it best when he said that he felt he wasnt playing luke he had to pretend it was a different character that he named jake skywalker theres nothing that brings me more anger and rage than this movie just thinking about it boils my blood but if you like hearing a character yell rey repeatedly they fly nowyeah they fly now seeing major liberties taken with the force to make you feel like youre in hogwarts and space horses then this movie is for  you
Sep 9 2023,neutral,takes an upper hand against episode 7 and 8 even though the rise of skywalker is disgraceful at the end when rey says she is a skywalker the movie still has some good elements such as pretty well storyline using lando in a correct way  good end fighting scene the chemistry weve been waiting for with rey and ren seeing ren be more badass in the movie etc i didnt like how they had to rewrite c3pos memory when the dagger didnt even say anything that important
Sep 9 2023,negative,this entire trilogy was an awful mess  i would sue if i owned stock in disney for not representing the best interest of the shareholders
Sep 8 2023,negative,despite the incredible special effects there was no way of distracting from the poor storytelling revolving around a contrived fetch quest with glaring plot holes and terrible character arcs how writers can take an absolute s tier franchise with an already bakedin enthusiastic fandom of hundreds of millions and run it into the ground is beyond me
Sep 7 2023,positive,i enjoyed this movie it was a good conclusion to the sequel saga it could have been done better but considering it followed up the last jedi it was significantly better the effects were great and the sith troopers were awesome but i dont really like the ending scene where she decides she is a skywalker that was weird it had great effects and a decent story considering the other movies in the saga they did a good job of working with what they had
Sep 7 2023,positive,a great wrap up for the star wars movies sadly you can feel some of the rewrites regarding the fan backlash from 8 despite 8 being fresh and trying something new
Sep 7 2023,negative,the magic of star wars is gone
Sep 3 2023,neutral,it was okay but like so many films these days it seemed like the film was more interested in asserting its woke bonafides than in presenting a believable portrayal or a compelling narrative
Sep 3 2023,negative,its one thing when someone has no idea how to finish a series and makes a rushed and ham fisted effort to conclude it  it is however an entirely different thing when a movie undermines ever single past instalment of the franchise renders a heros sacrifice meaningless ruins a villains redemption and rewrites ever single piece of canon about its own universe some of which were established or confirmed within the same trilogy to deus ex machina its way out of the corner it backed itself into this movie makes every previous star wars movie worse by its very existence because it has completely undermined all of them   anyone who says this is a good movie turned their brain off sometime between sitting down to watch it and the opening title screen the story has more holes in it than the nevada desert and is so clumsy it is a threat to its own health and safety the supporting characters have been ground into fine dust and scattered about the scenery to just exist and fill the background any interesting ideas the previous two movies had have been dragged out back and shot the main characters have been turned into 2d shapes with no depth or nuance its sanitized watered down and sanded into a perfect sphere to avoid any sharp edges  it wasnt badly executed it needs to be executed badly
Sep 1 2023,negative,absolutely awful the prequels were better
Sep 1 2023,negative,the visuals and music is great but the lazy story terrible character arcs endless plotholes makes for a very disappointing finale to the star wars sequel trilogy
Aug 29 2023,negative,after the polarizing last jedi the goal of the rise of skywalker is basically to retcon the previous film and turn the trilogy back into the popcorn familyfriendly thriller ride the force awakens was the problem is abrams doesnt do anyone any favors including detractors of the last jedi as most elements are poorly done and rushed as the final installment of a trilogy nothing really gets proper closure in the end its not a bad movie because it was very badly made the movie is entertaining enough on the surface the real issues are that the script the characters arcs and all closure are rushed lack continuity when paired with the other movies and ends up being incredibly dissatisfying on every level
Aug 29 2023,negative,all of the sequels have been bad and this was by far the worst terrible plot terrible acting and it appears disney have done everything they can to drain every last penny out of the franchise without actually coming up with an original story literally one of the worst films ive ever seen if it was possible to give 0 stars on here i would have
Aug 29 2023,neutral,this movies is a disgrace to star wars some people are giving a 1010 or 55 witch is observed but i did like the beginning was amazing just did not like then end
Aug 28 2023,negative,this is the worst star wars movie ever the holiday special is much better in quality they dont even explain how palpatine came back in the actual movie i felt they didnt even know how he came back his return makes vader redemption a lot less important and rey is the worst character and the writing was embarrassing and the ending with rey skywalker was so bad and spits in the face of luke and leia and why did my genaral hux a spy it didnt make sense and why did rey say shes all the jedi thats so cringe  in general its garbage 
Aug 28 2023,negative,this appears as though there were too many cooks in the kitchen and not a clear direction of character scene plot or acting
Aug 27 2023,negative,the worst of them all
Aug 27 2023,negative,terrible overall and easily the worst of the franchise the main issue that kills this is the terrible pacing this movie never commits to ideas and is more concerned with throwing more and more nonsensical incoherent going against canon nonsense at you at a rapid rate while the fast pacing worked for force awakens it does the exact opposite here from rey being a palpatine luke knowing she was a palpatine and trained her anyway lando getting the whole galaxy together in a few hours horses rey kissing kylo saving kylo giving kylo a lightsaber telepathically finn never telling rey what he wanted to say the wayfinder matching the destroyed death star ii ruins in a very specfic spot millions of sith chewies fakeout the emperor just being back out of nowhere none of it makes any sense and as stylish slick nostalgic and well produced production wise this is it starts to slowly collapse under its own weight of incoherent ideas to the point this movie somehow becomes boring by the second half with no suspense the editing isnt good either while we say focused on the same group of characters after the first 20 minutes it follows them with just an illogical flow of ideas and telling of events that doesnt flow at all the music is about the best thing its good but not up to par with the rest of the franchise mainly because of the inconsistent tone and inconsistent scenes the cinematography is not good despite having all the production value the cgi is decent but used in over the top oversaturated ways especailly at the end and the production value is used for nonsensical scenes the acting is just ok these are good performances but there weighed down by decisons and motivations that make no sense a lot of times and every so often espeically poe they have to give long plot exposes to explain this mess as best they can the emperor shouldnt have been here and feels so out of place this never commits to ideas ignores canon and ignores things like rose which was set up from the last film as being pivital skip this even though its the last one its a mess
Aug 26 2023,negative,so many bad things they wanted to build something without a base because part 8 barely left anything but they miserably failed with a bunch of plotholes bad lines and lazy writing
Aug 26 2023,negative,didnt have high hopes for this pile of disney star wars crap due to the previous train wreck and wasnt surprised starwars has consistently gotten worse  worse over the years its sad that disney takes advantage of starwars fans because theyll watch any pile of crap thats called starwars i dont even understand why people bother anymore
Aug 24 2023,negative,like trying to watch a drive thru christmas light show at 60 miles per hour this movie was jarring and hard to follow  by trying to please everyone the movie ended up pleasing no one  the story makes little sense and is disconnected with its disney predecessors  i wanted to like the film but i left the theater feeling conflicted  i will not be watching it again
Aug 23 2023,positive,one of the best and most underrated movies of all time this has so many amazing moments for example rey being a palpatine amazing general hux being a spy amazing the final battle amazing the call backs to the original trilogy amazing i can go on and on for hours about how amazing this movie is and its really impressive that it turned out amazingly with the death of carrie fisher and they did an excellent job with the little time that they had with leia and lukes redemption ark was awesome and the scene with han solo and kylo ren was one of the best moments in the franchise and kylo rens redemption ark was amazing and this also has all the emotions so its without a doubt worthy of a 5 star
Aug 22 2023,negative,stereotypical characters old reused plotlines painfully boring and slow action sequences and dialogue so bad that it belongs in one of the directtodisney shows are all the reasons why the rise of skywalker is the downfall of star wars
Aug 19 2023,negative,after the opening reveals there will be a lack of creativity its best to sit back and enjoy the laser show rise of skywalker is mediocre story with excellent visuals
Aug 18 2023,negative,yeah i can say i wasnt a fan of this film and the sequel trilogy as a whole final 3 movies got worse as they went on and i wasnt a fan of how this film was paced
Aug 15 2023,positive,it was definitely better than episode viii god at least they tried to save what disney had done to luke skywalker im tired of the woke crap disney tries to cram down our throats
Aug 14 2023,negative,star wars universe destroyed
Aug 13 2023,negative,this movie ruined star wars
Aug 13 2023,negative,seems like the entire movie plot was made up on the fly pretty awful movie
Aug 9 2023,negative,the same story over and over and over rinse repeat and add the nostalgia character s and you have you next star wars movie this series has turned from the epic of generations into the laziest writing of all the ips disney has now has lay waste to a monument to creative bankruptcy
Aug 7 2023,negative,yet another disney star wars movie sequel from hell  this movie is so bad that i only got 30 minutes into the film before i turned it off   the only star wars movie i have never finished although i wish i never finished the last jedi either  i have loved star wars for over 40 years now first falling in love with it when i was 4 years old  well im out of love now and looking for a mistress
Aug 6 2023,negative,it was alright but rey aint no skywalker or the chosen one
Aug 5 2023,neutral,wait this is the end typical nowadays disney aside from some standout moments this might be one of my least favorite star wars projects
Jul 28 2023,positive,the story is good but bad explained the return of emperor palpatine is a good idea but bad explained the desintegration of the galatic empire after the episode 6 is because of the fact that the emperor want to became imortal e because of that he none designed a sucessor but a error of the movie is not explained how the emperor back from the dead the novelization of the movie explained that the emperor moved his soul to a weak cloned bodie but the movie dont explained that the fleet that comes to exegol also are bad explained problaly the fleet is a fleet of free worlds citizens sons of veterans of the rebelion and civilians ships with weapons but the movie dont explained that the movie is good but bad explained
Jul 27 2023,negative,an awful embarrassment of a film its the nail in the coffin of a once great story rey is in no way shape or form a character for the future of the franchise shes dull and boring
Jul 26 2023,negative,i thought i liked it in theatres but it turns out i was just high
Jul 25 2023,neutral,at least its better than the last jedi
Jul 23 2023,positive,in an attempt to rectify the fallout from the last jedi jj abrams delivers a visually impressive and actionpacked finale yet the film suffers from a convoluted and messy narrative that struggles to tie up loose ends resulting in a mixed conclusion to the skywalker saga
Jul 21 2023,negative,this whole saga was a complete waste of time broke my heart
Jul 19 2023,positive,it was like watching a michael bay movie with a pointless plot and a bunch of star wars eye candy  the emperors role was forced no pun intended where are all the answers to the bread crumbs in the first one and maybe to s lesser extent the second movie  who was maz kanata how did she have lukes light saber why was ray abandoned  who the heck was the emperors son and how was he conceived and why did they abandon ray    it makes 0 sense it was for her protection who were the knights of ren they played no role as alluded to in episode 7 tfa  jj did his best to salvage episode 9 after a disastrous episode 8 that crushed every inroad and 8 also did nothing to set up 9   i still cant get over episode 9 and literally 30 star destroyers appear outta nowhere fully staffed fed and ready to conquer the universe lol   the sith stadium and the whole mcguffins thing with the exegol gps this movie is soooo meh  id rather see a solo movie sequel with a different actor playing solo
Jul 18 2023,negative,this movie was so disappointing and  i could write an entire book of how bad and why it is so bad please dont watch it watching it was very painful to me but instead of wasting even more time on that movie  i just end this review here
Jul 18 2023,negative,i believe the series hinged on this third act had they simply extended what was established by ryan johnson in my opinion the best since esb this could have been a true expansion of the lore and universe instead of realizing why the force awoke into something new and necessary evolved and why it called a nobody  the powers that be retreaded on same ole story line of another kid having to clean up their dads mess in this case her grandfather
Jul 17 2023,negative,damn ending they look for the easy sense of nostalgia by putting a villain who just had to stay dead completely wasted on snokes potential as a villain rey forcing herself to go by the name skywalker makes me pale with disgust i sincerely hope that there will be a change of direction between creative directors and writers cancel all this crap tv series included not all but most and give life to all those comics and books that were canon before they would a lot of money making the fans happy too hoping they are faithful to the content of the works
Jul 17 2023,negative,only movie i have ever reviewed my brother made me watch it with him this movie belongs in a trash can
Jul 16 2023,positive,seems like this movie was made in a hurry
Jul 14 2023,negative,the worse star wars of the franchise they chasing an object come out of nowhere all the damn movie so it make episode 07 and 08 useless to watch that mean they wrote them without knowing where they go at the end rey palpatine call themseft a skywalker she also love and kiss kylo the worse bad boys of the galaxie dont worry girl he will change for you  ignore posttrilogie and stick to the orignal
Jul 13 2023,negative,if i could give this 0 stars i would
Jul 9 2023,positive,if you go into this movie just looking for a good time you will have fun of course i love star wars and think that the sequels messed up the lore pretty badly but i did enjoy this movie it was dumb and a boring route for disney to take but hey i had a good time
Jul 8 2023,positive,even though they had to cut leia out the movie was very emotional so it was good
Jul 5 2023,negative,the build up of the movie is great the emotionslos play a major role but the battles are bad snoke is killed of too easily force healing wasnt used correctly and palpatine returned for absolutely no reason
Jul 4 2023,neutral,a convoluted mess of a film  it cares more for trying to course correct and please angry fans then it dose about staying true to the story it set up in episode 7 this did not feel like it was even connected to the originally trilogy or the prequels  it was a stand alone story that could only have room to breath after it had killed off what came before only by killing the magic your left with a cast we are supposed to feel a connection too yet as the sun sets we see a stranger carrying the the legacy that once belonged to our dear childhood friends  the villain who is used to wrap up the series is plucked out of thin air in terrible forced decision that comes across as insulting to  fan base and pleases know one resulting in everyone who has watched this disney trilogy to feel very confused asa result
Jul 4 2023,positive,great ending and daisey ridley is just what the star wars franchise needed after the disastrous george lucas prequel trilogy i liked all of the final trilogy that took us back to what star wars was all about from the beginning   excited to see rey skywalkers next adventure
Jul 3 2023,positive,where do i begin  okay its 100 the answer to the last jedi if we remember correctly tlj left us asking more questions than not so they made this movie to answer all the questions we were scratching our heads with i felt like i was in a marathon there was never a moment to breathe and take it in so sad that kylo ren was having a time of redemption but its like not talked about i dont know so many wrong otherwise its visually beautiful
Jul 3 2023,negative,the creative treatment was fantastic with this trilogy but as a lifelong fan who was 5 when i first saw return of the jedi and then watched the originals my entire life im just so offended by what they did first luke is not a quitter second bringing back the emperor revealed in the 1st minute so nothing to spoil  after darth vader gave his life to save lukes and bring balance to the force  is so unbelievably offensive to me i dont know where to begin because its as if it was all meaningless according to this movie and we all know thats simply not true luke is the chosen one and princess leia doesnt fly she strangles jabba the huts with chains and if she suddenly learned the force then maybe you should explain to us how that happened anyhow there was so much potential with these movies and rogue one was the only one that got it right so for this fan return of the jedi will always be the true ending im not a book or comic book guy just the movies and unfortunately that invalidates this entire trilogy for me lol but if you like it thats cool but luke was our genx god and this argument is my final battle
Jul 2 2023,positive,i loved it this made up for the last jedi i was afraid to go see it but it went way above my expectations 
Jul 2 2023,negative,a silly ending for a silly trilogy
Jul 2 2023,positive,another excellent entry was a very emotional close to the trilogy
Jul 1 2023,positive,daisy ridley shines in her iconic role as rey bringing jacked kylo ren back to the light as ben solo
Jun 30 2023,positive,when i walked out of the cinema and i had a huge stupid smile on my face as i enjoyed myself a lot from start to finish this star wars movie had everything and was as entertaining as return of the jedi its a shame as the more questions you ask the more confusing and annoying it becomes  as things dont really make a whole lot of sense that could be due to the last jedi messing things up this easily could of been two movies by just how rushed it all felt i like rey but i dont believe she should of been a palpatine but i certainly liked the idea of them flipping it and her turning to the dark side oh well  the emperor was at his most menacing in this movie then ever seen before even if bringing him back undone luke and anakins story a little this film is best when you switch off and enjoy the nostalgia and the epic moments it does have to offer visually the best star wars and also some brilliant acting theres things wed of all liked to see but this is what we got and it still doesnt touch the ot but it is easily the most entertaining of the 3   kylo ren ben solo cemented himself among my favourite star wars characters who easily had the best character arc
Jun 30 2023,negative,horrible ending to an overall amazing franchise the rise of skywalker is a stupid movie just let your star wars marathon stop at episode 6 because the sequels are just a waste of time
Jun 29 2023,negative,a terrible ending to a horrible sequel this trilogy killed star wars
Jun 28 2023,positive,it was mid i enjoyed the acting the plot twist was like the inside of a wampa now dont get me started on the bloody force healing but this movie was a big step up from the previous
Jun 22 2023,positive,we watched it at theatre and for a star wars comeback it was way to bad
Jun 22 2023,positive,has some great moments but this movie seems to be trying to please too many people and subsequently becomes a bit of a jumble at times a solid finale
Jun 19 2023,negative,a disappointing conclusion to the trilogy just goes to show how disney doesnt care for star wars
Jun 18 2023,negative,waited all these years for lukes return and this movie destroyed it terrible huge disappointment and a terrible movie
Jun 17 2023,negative,this  movie was a huge disappointment  it has an overly complex and incoherent plot  it replays scenes from other better star wars movies without bringing anything new  if you havent seen it skip it  the heart of this last star wars  trilogy was the characters of ray and kilo  this movie is filled with so many random side quests that the main characters feel lost  they even introduce a new villain the emperor instead of just going with the obvious kilo is the villain  his story of redemption  or the lack of redemption would have made a great film   this is a story we sadly will never see
Jun 17 2023,negative,horrible nonsensical movie worst of the franchise
Jun 17 2023,negative,this movie is one of the worst i have ever seen why because it shouts in your face that you as a viewer are dumb the character arcs a non existent to bring back palpatine because they were unable to build up anything over the last two movies is just giving up and to make up for everything they present everything in a hilarious number spoiler instead of one death star we now have an infinite number out of nowhere instead of a rebel fleet we now have a infinite number of random ships who just happen to arrive at the right time because it is written in the script and palpatine is now all the sith and rey is all the jedi and that is an original quote face palm
Jun 17 2023,negative,this film was definitely something it felt really rushed and the plot is dumb its as if a kid was playing with star wars toys and they made this entire thing up also palpatines return is unoriginal and it wasnt needed come on disney you couldnt have come up with anything better approaching the finale it didnt feel very impactful to me i could definitely tell that disney was trying to make the finale like an avengers endgame moment when the citizens fleet showed up clearly it was meant to be impactful but they couldnt pull off what endgame did overall this film felt rushed stupid and a disgrace to star wars the sequel trilogy couldve been something more but it simply doesnt live up to the other trilogies
Jun 16 2023,positive,one of the best star wars films despite its flaws  saved the sequel trilogy as best as it could after all the damage caused by the last jedi
Jun 15 2023,neutral,so much missed potential too many rushed but critical scenes then a useless waste of screen time spent a race of musical aliens to remind the audience about positivity and the celebration of good yuck plus theres just too many convoluted plot threads that dont add up unlessyou happened to go to the theater with the novelization in your pocket stuff happens that only makes sense the viewer would need a pause button to sit there  fill in all the blanks but theres no time because of the smash cut editing and pointless action i feel awful for finns character who is clearly sidelined here poe is downgraded to a silly sidekick as well im not one of those fans who thinks they can write a better movie i absolutely cant but hey thats not my job disney has endless fundingresources and it was their duty to end this 40 year saga with some integrity and its disheartening for the regular people like myself who love star wars to watch as this movie disregards the tremendous possibilities that the skywalker saga presented wow this film couldve had some emotional heft to it abrams couldve gut punched us with an emotionally explosive conclusion but instead it feels like kathleen kennedy was breathing down his neck the whole time to not make the last jedi and bring the whole thing in under two hours and 30 minutes there are lots of movies with a 3hour run time and this one couldve easily used another 30 minutes of character development smoother editing and an epically emotional final act if you think im wrong sit down and watch andor that has  a perfect mixture of powerful acting character development special effects and star wars vibes 
Jun 14 2023,negative,breakneck pacing too much happening at once with the plot or things happening too fast a lot of things did not make sense because they are not developed the movie like the previous ones fails to explain what was going on how everything reached to this point and what motivates anyone to do anything here other than to defeat the bad guys it is difficult to get emotionally invested in most of the characters because there is so little development or substance to them i think the only real protagonist you could follow and be interested in was adam drivers character another saving grace is ian mcdiarmids performance is as great as ever  and it is great to see billy dee williams reprise the role of lando this movie would have been better if they cut it down and perhaps treated it as a contained adventure without all the bloated extras the main battle is over the top illogical and actually just a shoehorn to get palpatine back in glad this series is over as it was becoming less enjoyable as time went on
Jun 14 2023,negative,this film has more plot holes than the streets of buffalo after a harsh winter this film tries to repair all the flaws in the previous two films the problem is there are so many flaws to fix its simply not possible without a good story base of the previous two films the third cant really bring it to a close this film is like titanic 3  the ship has already sunk and is rusting but lets bring her up and continue the trip very disappointing
Jun 14 2023,positive,first time watching a star wars trilogy and i thought this was a good conclusion to this trilogy it was entertaining with beautiful cinematics although it falls short to the force awakens which was spectacular
Jun 11 2023,positive,i strongly disliked  the last jedi it ruined the story for me this movie made up for it even though having emperor palpatine coming back i strongly disagreed with the action lightsaber battles were some of the best in all of star wars scenes looked really good not as much cgi actors were on point with emotions even c3po  love luke skywalker catching the lightsaber always good to hear john williams music once again  hes in the movie as well the story was definitely not perfect it redeemed itself from the last movie though and was highly entertaining emotional and enjoyable
Jun 11 2023,negative,the plot was basically just made up by the writers beacause they were in a hurry you can tell especiallt by the unexplainable plot twist it clearly was not something they planned ahead since we had no clue or reference in the previous movies that it was going to happen i did not like the absurd absence of any sort of character development except for kylo ren wich is the only remotely well written character in the triology i did not like the settings wich felt cheap 90 of the movies since disney acquired the franchise are in deserts landscapes remote villages wich are not that fitting imo and lastly the finale was just a copycat of avengers endgame i feel like the writers just took the insane amount of story telling potential this franchise had with jedis siths mandalorians criminal undergrounds imperials futuristic societies and straignt up threw it in the toilet and flushed it in favour of a decent low cost movie for their standards of course wich makes good profits the only reason im not giving it less is the cgi wich wasnt bad
Jun 5 2023,negative,terrible disney has destroyed another franchise
Jun 2 2023,positive,somehow palpatine returned just get over it and enjoy the lightning show  force dyads dark side heritage redemption sith wayfinders babu frikkin frik etc this movie flies high just like the rocket troopers they fly now
May 31 2023,negative,incoherent story that completely destroys all established star wars lore the emperor was brought back in a fortnite game somehow  they erased the whole achievement of anakins arc creative control was definitely held by people who did not care about star wars lore or worldbuilding
May 30 2023,negative,boring predictable repetitive with the same 2 persons senseless fighting over and over
May 28 2023,negative,in latin america we have a joke about who will inherit grandmas land this is a bad joke of that joke going to far
May 27 2023,positive,i liked very much this movie it was not of the best but it was awesome to me
May 27 2023,negative,what a terrible ending of a trilogy it is obvious that nothing was planned and the audience is supposed to just suckle the blue milk rian discarded jjs ideas in the last movie and here jj takes back control the entire trilogy feels like 2 kids fighting over a toy in a sandbox this movie is just fetch quest after fetch quest stuff just happens with no explanation jj must have really like avengers endgame because its the same ending
May 26 2023,negative,nothing new sky walkers family again climax not as excited as episode one or six not even close
May 24 2023,negative,this movie couldnt have been good tlj left the trilogy with nowhere to go and thats what happens when there is no plan and you let a self centered hack write the middle considering all this i cant imagine fixing the trilogy without having rey wake up and the whole movie was a bad dream and then moving forward with the real one so what did they do a ridiculous mcguffin hunt that makes no sense to a 10 year old an ancient artifact that points the way using a fallen star destroyer a part of the death star that fell to a planet it wasnt orbiting and remained intact a secret planet you can only get to with one of two wayfinders made for no real reason lando remaining on a planet for 20 years looking for a mcguffin without success only to have it found the same day the newbies show up just skip this dumpster fire
May 23 2023,negative,better than ruin johnsons previous pile of dog crap still not woth your time flimsy premise bad acting too many coincidences that solve plot holes and its from disney and kathleen kennedy so that should clue you in
May 23 2023,negative,so sensationally bad not sure why the audience score is as high as it is spits in the face of george lucas as well as destroys the skywalker saga so much inconsistency and things that just dont make sense how certain things progress seem very all of a sudden and not organic at all the ending is complete garbage this belongs in the trash burned taken out and buried at the bottom of the mariana trench
May 22 2023,negative,trying to fix the 2nd movie of the trilogy with the 3rd movie just didnt work long bouts of exposition handled so ham handed its hard to believe the incompetence
May 21 2023,negative,this movie is a terrible fetch quest with no clue what its doing  it ruins darth vaders sacrifice to save luke by killing the emperor  somehow he returned lol
May 19 2023,negative,this is the worst of the sequelsthe other two movies should not even have the star wars titlebut this onethis is beyond a insult to everything that is star wars
May 16 2023,positive,this was a fun epic movie
May 15 2023,negative,this movie is wrong in many ways bringing back palpatine ruined anakins redemption back in episode 6 also if i were rey i wouldve been honest about my lineage yes she doesnt want to be a palpatine but shes not a skywalker either
May 15 2023,negative,this movie is a disgrace to star wars and cinema there are so many plot holes and mistakes that it is hard to watch without wanting to kill myself
May 15 2023,negative,thats movie is a afront to the vision of jorge lucas
May 14 2023,negative,i love star wars but this movie was a total waste of time jj abrams destroyed the storytelling of basically all characters in this movie theres no point in watching this since theres no decent story or characters
May 12 2023,negative,the storyline made no sense it made all of the previous movies pointless although the graphics were really good the story writers didnt know what a star wars film is im utterly disappointed as this couldve been an amazing series finale but unfortunately we got palpatine returned and rey skywalker just completely devastated that this disgusting movie even exists
May 12 2023,negative,just awful one of the messiest films ever made and the worst star wars
May 12 2023,negative,it was really dissapointing to see that they just try to revive a character  that was already done and he also suddenly had a huge army that no one saw the good thingof this movie is that they are done with this story its really sad to see how a really great saga is destroyed with a team just focused on winning money
May 9 2023,positive,i believe this movie did the best it could after the tragedy of the prior film
May 9 2023,negative,wow hollywoods best writers and they can still only polish up a disaster of an amazing franchise
May 8 2023,negative,spoiler free incoherent mess attempting to undo what what already done the plot is all over the place its too busy there is no clear direction and there are too many plot conveniences to let slide theres little to no growth for the main characters and it doesnt feel like they have any chemistry in their relationships with eachother truly just no real depth to them and it makes it hard as an audience member to connect with the film visually its stunning but that only takes you so far the film feels like like putting makeup on a pig and then saying its beautiful there is not a single person that ive talked to online or in person that genuinely liked this film yet theres a relatively high audience score which make it seem like there was an attempt by disney to skew the narrative in their favor which works against them in reality
May 7 2023,negative,disney has absolutely destroyed star wars  what an absolute tragedy
May 6 2023,negative,star wars the rise of skywalker is a disappointing and underwhelming conclusion to the skywalker saga from the very beginning the film feels rushed and disjointed as if the filmmakers were trying to cram in as much fan service as possible without regard for storytelling or character development  one of the biggest issues with the film is its reliance on convenience and contrivance to move the plot forward characters appear and disappear at random and events unfold without any real explanation or context this makes it difficult to become invested in the story or care about the characters as everything feels arbitrary and meaningless  another problem with the rise of skywalker is its lack of emotional weight the film tries to tug at the heartstrings with various callbacks and nostalgic moments but these feel hollow and forced theres no real sense of consequence or stakes as the film seems more interested in checking off boxes and hitting familiar beats than telling a compelling and meaningful story  perhaps the biggest disappointment of all is how the film handles its characters many of the established characters are given short shrift with little to no development or payoff for their arcs new characters are introduced without much explanation or backstory leaving the audience to wonder why they should care about them at all  overall star wars the rise of skywalker is a forgettable and unsatisfying conclusion to the skywalker saga it fails to deliver on its promise of a compelling story and emotional resonance instead relying on cheap gimmicks and nostalgia to try and win over audiences fans of the franchise deserve better than this lackluster effort
May 5 2023,negative,how this movie has an 86 on this site is beyond me its so stupid and boring i thought i was being generous by giving it 15 stars
May 5 2023,negative,the worst star wars movie ever made
May 5 2023,positive,it was decent but the palpatine storyline was questionable at best  no thought was put into this trilogy ahead of time and that is plainly seen as it wraps up
May 5 2023,negative,somehow palpatine returns  this eliminates the sacrifice that anakin has to do including the death of padme and also all the sacrifices and failures from luke   also you dont become a rey skywalker by just calling yourself that rey is and will always be rey palpatine   the writers didnt understand what star wars is all about
May 5 2023,positive,good action film but rey calling herself a skywalker threw me off
May 5 2023,positive,it was entertaining at best
May 5 2023,negative,this movie was okay but had many plot holes such as rey finding her way to exegol but then a million ships turn up with no way of finding it overall this movie is pretty bad
May 4 2023,negative,i think palpatines return explains my onestar review the guy got thrown into the void of space and is blown up moments later only to return to this random planet in pretty good shape likely story
May 1 2023,neutral,attempting to course correct from the last jedi rise of skywalker manages to bring back the fun of star wars making it slightly more enjoyable than the previous entry but misfires with a messy story and the most uninteresting return of one of films greatest villains ultimately the most unsatisfying conclusions to any film series
May 1 2023,positive,this movie gets overhated its actually really fun the return of the iconic sheev palpatine by ian mcdiarmid is great adam driver nails as kylo ren and i just love the return of franchise characters in a closing chapter it always gives me this feeling of joy its not the best star wars movie but its my favorite though
Apr 30 2023,negative,the worst of all he sw films so boring
Apr 30 2023,negative,this movie is rotten big time due to the last jedi alot of random fan services just to cover the fact they failed at the perfect opportunity to do proper star wars sequels shame
Apr 25 2023,negative,some how palpatine returned what more can you say about this movie there is so much wrong with it  i love daisy ridley but her character rey hasnt earned anything in these past 3 movies  her managing advance force powers by accident is ridiculous finn was just trying to get reys attention through the entire movie that was his character arc they wasted finn again and john boyegas time oh by the end of this movie their is no skywalker its just rey taking the name for herself this is star wars at its weakest and worse
Apr 24 2023,negative,i just wish it would have all ended at rots if this is how its going to be
Apr 24 2023,negative,worst star wars movie it was completely dumb and made no sense broken chain of cause and effect
Apr 20 2023,negative,the rise of skywalker was an absolute disaster the plot was convoluted and lacked any coherence making it impossible to follow the characters felt shallow and underdeveloped making it hard to care about what was happening to them  the pacing was frenetic and disorienting with scenes jumping from one location to the next without any clear reason or purpose the special effects were impressive but they couldnt save this poorly written mess of a film  the dialogue was cringeworthy with cheesy oneliners and forced attempts at humor falling flat the ending felt rushed and unsatisfying leaving me with a feeling of disappointment and regret for having wasted my time watching this train wreck of a movie  the rise of skywalker was a massive letdown and a disgrace to the beloved star wars franchise save yourself the trouble and avoid this film at all costs still better than last jedi though
Apr 20 2023,negative,disrespectful to star wars  should be retconned
Apr 18 2023,negative,insult to the original trilogy please remove these from history and do it again with mark hamill as the director
Apr 18 2023,positive,beautiful ending to the skywalker saga dont listen to hater and critics just watch the movies from 1 to 9
Apr 18 2023,negative,i hate disney they ruined star wars this movie is a joke i literally walked out of it when theyre riding horses on top of a star destroyer in space how can they breathe thanks jar jar abrams for ruining the best thing about my childhood
Apr 17 2023,negative,this entire sequel trilogy is the worst thing that has ever happened to star wars  it managed to tear apart and ruin one of the greatest franchises of all time
Apr 17 2023,positive,i give this movie 35 stars for its spectacle its nostalgia and its humor it is a film that tries to wrap up the star wars saga with a bang while also paying tribute to the legacy of the franchise the film also features some impressive visuals exciting action sequences and witty dialogue the film also showcases some great performances from its cast especially daisy ridley as rey adam driver as kylo ren and ian mcdiarmid as palpatine the film also delivers some emotional moments and satisfying resolutions for some of the characters  however i also think that some aspects of the film are disappointing such as the plot the characters and the music the film sometimes feels rushed and messy especially in its pacing and structure the film also struggles to develop some of its characters and make them compelling and consistent the film also lacks some of the originality and creativity that made star wars so captivating the film also alienates some fans with its controversial choices and changes that undermine or contradict the previous films the film also fails to answer some of the questions and mysteries that were set up by the force awakens and the last jedi nevertheless star wars the rise of skywalker is a decent end to one of the greatest sagas of all time
Apr 17 2023,positive,better than the last one
Apr 17 2023,negative,terrible terrible terrible movie wasnt helped at all by the disaster of the last jedi incoherent storytelling driven by a series of coincidences
Apr 16 2023,negative,many fans were upset and perplexed by the latest star wars trilogy the plot appears confusing and the return of palpatine is especially difficult to comprehend given the lack of explanation as to how he was able to return   furthermore while several characters were introduced with the potential for substantial character development they ultimately seemed to have no meaningful function in the tale as a result many fans believe that this marks the end of the star wars franchise
Apr 15 2023,negative,i appreciate all the actors for playing their parts and no disrespect to them as an avid sw fan this movie isnt getting accurately reviewed and deserves a lower score i understand some people like these new movies but not 86 of sw fandom the original didnt make these movies or intended to make them nor did the originals apprentice all three are well funded fan films with subverted expectation dilemmas in story development we arent asking for much make jedi train to be good dont disrespect established and well written characters dont edit fight scenes by digitally deleting weapons from praetorian guards hands wtf is this animal titty milk scene
Apr 14 2023,negative,felt like the movie was written by someone that hasnt watched a star wars movie but only heard what people say about it  movie flip flops on each scene characters change perspectives faster than they developed in any of the previous movies horses are better than ships the deathstar blew up why is half of it on a planet if a moon sized object crashed into a planet all life on that planet should be dead
Apr 14 2023,positive,a good end of story
Apr 14 2023,negative,very bad they tried to fix the mistakes the last jedi made but it made it worse
Apr 14 2023,negative,dont understand plot at all and how did emperor palpatine survive
Apr 13 2023,negative,another boring sequel that doesnt bring anything new to the table it seems like in the rise of skywalker they were trying to patch up all the cracks left from the last jedi which results in it being a somewhat of a mess adam driver is brilliant and daisy ridley also does well with what material they have to work with but i found the film very predictable and was never on the edge of my seat oh what could have been
Apr 12 2023,positive,the story was actually good   i watched it not expecting anything after how terrible episode 7 and episode 8 had been but i was pleased to finally witness a good story and the essence of star wars in place
Apr 12 2023,negative,the worst movie i have ever seen i am a huge fan of star wars and this movie killed that for a while luckily it has been redeemed but this was not only a bad star wars movie it was just a terrible movie in general no one had the courage to continue with plot points that were set up because some of the fandom whined so hard about the last jedi well this is what you end up with honestly maybe we deserved it
Apr 12 2023,negative,this would have played better as a cartoon since its as believable as one if you check your brain at the door and not think about anything yeee haaa otherwise what a pathetic end to a once great story its also clear that anyone gushing about this film is a disney bot
Apr 12 2023,negative,horrible many reasons
Apr 12 2023,negative,you must joking  somehow palpatine returns hundreds of clones of him and snoke  he had a whole world full of star destroyers with death star capability  the entire universe then hyper speeds their way to the secret planet save the day  po and finn go no where as characters rey still acts as young and impulsive as she did in the first movie   contrast that to luke skywalker in a new hope to return of the jedi his composure and discipline showed he had matured as a person a true and compelling heros journey where have these story tellers gone
Apr 11 2023,negative,the biggest acomplishment of this movie is that it isnt worst than the last jedi and thats all horrible movie
Apr 11 2023,negative,the right conclusion for a terrible trilogy that should have never be made a pointless film that negates the very core of the 6 movies that came before that was a bust at the box office and finally ruined star wars legacy  thanks again disney
Apr 10 2023,negative,i had no idea what what was happening the entire time jumping place to place and bringing back villains never mentioned in previous movies for no reason the movie concluded with the most powerful man in the galaxy and beyond being killed when the main character picks up two lightsabers instead of one reflecting force lighting back into palpatines face that isnt how lightsabers work at all they even have the gaul to bot these reviews with the same loved rey and kylo and great ending to the franchise comments to boost the score this film was a narrative nightmare with no direction that threw away the plot of the previous films leading to a disjointed mess that just gives the main characters what they need to rush though the story as fast as possible its not worth watching for first time viewers just pretend it ended in the last movie with the death of smoke even with that movies flaws its a masterpiece in comparison to this tragedy
Apr 9 2023,negative,seemed rushed and copied a lot of the story plots of the original trilogy
Apr 9 2023,positive,starwars the rise of skywalker isnt the most well put together film in the saga but it does its job at finishing this amazing saga with a satisfying end  rating 66
Apr 8 2023,negative,dumb poorly written ridiculous plot overall just awful only episode 8 saved it from being the worst star wars movie
Apr 8 2023,positive,yay its over  better than the last one
Apr 8 2023,negative,this is a casual fans fever dream the visuals sound design and score are spectacular the fan service is everywhere and everyones favorite villain returns jj abrams may not know how to make a star wars movie but he knows tricks of the trade to keep any noncritical eye happy however this is not the case for the dedicated fan there are many plot holes in this movie with the two major ones being force healing and resurrecting an actual sith after the prophecy of the chosen one was supposedly fulfilled on top of this it undoes the few good things the last jedi did right the last jedi was not a good movie but it was at the very least unique if the ideas it introduced had been properly built upon this movie could have been good however this entire movies purpose is to retcon every single thing about the previous entry the last jedi set up that reys parents were nobody thats gone the last jedi set up that kylo ren would be the main villain of this one gone the last movie set up that nobody was willing to help the resistance gone then the cherry on top the characters are still not interesting after 3 whole movies  some other issues that i dont care to elaborate on 1 plot contrivances 2 minor dialogue issues 3 essential things introduced in the last movie 4 goonies fetch queststyle story 5 power scaling 6 rey skywalker
Apr 8 2023,negative,absolute garbage i am really dissatisfied with how this trilogy progressed this was a disappointing end to a poor trilogy that just got worse with each installment
Apr 8 2023,negative,jj tries to cobble together a film from the shipwreck that was the last jedi there are consequences to starting out on the 1st film of a new trilogy and the 7th of a franchise with no plans for where you are headed these disney films are not canon
Apr 8 2023,positive,the rise of skywalker significantly better than the prior film the last jedi which was absolutely atrocious  the climax was exciting and it had appropriate conclusions for many of the main characters without spoiling the film as a minor star wars fan it was interesting through a great majority of it
Apr 7 2023,negative,nostalgia cash grab retconned major characters and more importantly plot points actors did their best
Apr 7 2023,negative,bad storytelling and directing that is just lazy and a lot of plotholes and annoying carachters
Apr 7 2023,negative,an improvement over last jedi which isnt saying much
Apr 6 2023,negative,how on gods green earth did people actually like this movie it makes absolutely no sense and never had a plan hinted at many consequences for our hero accidentally killing a major hero potentially turning to the dark side being unable to kill the antagonist for fear he would occupy her body to name a few none of which paid off or had any consequences in the least completely invalidated the sacrifice vader made to bring balance to the force in rotj simply because the creative team admittedly had no plan going in forced a cringeworthy kiss between the impossibly unchallenged hero and the psychotic galactic serial murderer only to satisfy a select few theorists completed finns arc as an utterly wasted character gave us an impossibly poorly thoughtout mcguffin that baffles my mind to this day they had to stand right there for it to make sense how did they know what the death star debris would look like before it was even destroyed and arguably worst of all introduced both an army of baddies that couldnt have possibly existed and an army of goodguy helpers who took 10 minutes to assemble and have been suspiciously absent up until this point in the entire saga just because they needed a big battle to hell with actually writing a story that makes sense right  everyone disney thinks we are all stupid and they have forgotten how to tell stories its time to stop paying them its the only way they will learn a lesson and start hiring talented storytellers again
Apr 2 2023,positive,the conclusion to the skywalker saga is epic we learn reys past poe has really turned into a leader which completes his arc from the last jedi and finn has developed force powers kylo ren was awesome as usual such a great movie
Apr 2 2023,negative,i liked the star wars sequels up until this one it either retconned or threw away all that the last jedi set up just because the people behind this film cared more about pleasing angry fans than finishing up the narrative set up by the previous film the rise of skywalker is sloppy full of weird retcons and dumb fanservicey moments
Mar 30 2023,negative,terrible film made absolute no sense really showed disney had no plan sequel trilogy is awful
Mar 30 2023,negative,nothing like the original star wars trilogy way worse than the prequels decides to kill of the remaining main characters like leia and ben solo  the plot is a total mess characters are 1 dimensional unimaginative tries to emulate star wars dark forces comic books  would not recommend especially to fans of original star wars trilogy or prequels
Mar 29 2023,positive,i didnt really like this movie but it had its good points like the last fight and its cgi not only that during the last fight you could hear voices from past jedi like obiwan anakin mace yoda ahsoka luke etc action it great it could have been slightly better acting is ok it could have been a lot better cgi is perfect no doubt about it villain this is another reason why i liked the movie because it brought back sidious and whats really interesting is why did the villains still exist even when palpatine died in the explosion in epi vi and this movie answers that question writing i think that the writing was okgood it could have been better storyplot it was ok and interesting casting is goodgreat characters i think that the characters are great mostly because of the voices in rays head adventure i think that the adventure was good like most star wars projects because we good threw and explore the galaxy and in this episode we traveled to the land of the sith mystery mystery is good because i always wondered what happens next especially in a movie like this bringing back the best of villains ending in my opinion the ending was good but it does bring me to think no 1 did palpatine take over rays body no 2 did palpatine die and if my first theory is true than why isnt there an other star wars movie called episode x to continue from episode ix
Mar 29 2023,negative,makes the holiday special look like a work of art
Mar 26 2023,negative,they had so many options to work with for the sequels dumping everything from legends for a definitely inferior and plot hole filled mess of a story is extremely disappointing i personally have watched these movies only once and that will be it i honestly refuse to accept this as canon and i have not purchased any merchanise which has anything to do with these 3 movies you cheapened and damaged key and generation defining characters which even the actors have openly criticised  disney stop ruining a franchise which many people love and have shaped their childhood with your corporate rubbish
Mar 23 2023,negative,this is the worst movie ive ever seen in my entire life id rather watch peter greenaway artsyfarts nonstop like in a clockwork orange id rather see the room everyday of my life forever than ever need to watch this piece of insulting and obscene sewage ever again
Mar 23 2023,negative,souless nonsense just like all the rest of the new star wars movies and spin offs
Mar 23 2023,negative,the rise of palpatine terrible movie the story and plot was everything that was not star wars  unwatchable im keeping my kids away from star wars
Mar 22 2023,positive,why have ive watched the saga so many times for some many years i dont understand 
Mar 21 2023,positive,fantastic addition to the franchise had me in my feels the whole time thank you to everyone involved
Mar 21 2023,negative,after the first film written by those who understood nothing about star wars the second one written by those who hate star wars the premises for another failure were all there there was no time to understand the universe for which they were writing a new story so they tried to figure out what the fans want incredibly they believed that fans still wanted to see palpatine again oblivious to the fact that for a true fan palpatine has served his purpose narratively speaking and having him return is just a symptom of laziness and lack of new ideas
Mar 20 2023,positive,i love this film  and i have nothing wrong with this film its perfect and its one of the best films of all time and one of my personal favorite as well i stand bye it and i always will i think it has great action great character arks and a truly satisfying conclusion to this amazing saga that did so much set up that when you get into the final battle it makes me feel like im in the world of star wars
Mar 17 2023,neutral,star wars episode ix  the rise of skywalkergood
Mar 16 2023,positive,rise of skywalker is a masterpiece brilliant i must of rewatched about 500 times sheev was amazing
Mar 16 2023,positive,after a disappointing last jedi this was fun to watch and brought back that star wars feeling ending on a hopeful note
Mar 15 2023,negative,palatine has returned  kathleen kennedy should be fired if the last jedi was an insult to star wars fans the rise of skywalker is like being shot in the head  this movie offers nothing of value to the star wars universe is full of plot holes and bad writing and actually undoes the entire finale of ep6 by magically bringing back sidious as villan   it was later revealed that disney had no plan while making the sequel trilogy for any of the questions posed during the force awakens and that is not only disgraceful to star wars and its fans but unforgiveable  if you love star wars or even just good story telling avoid the sequel trilogy at all costs
Mar 11 2023,negative,anyone who says they liked this movie is lying to themselves you thought the prequels were cringeoh boy just you wait
Mar 10 2023,negative,terrible tried to fix a lot of the mess of the last jedi but the film was a convoluted mess for the love of god disney can you ruin star wars anymore
Mar 9 2023,negative,well apparently studios disapproved the previous episode so they chose to destroy it again and rebuilt it with plot holes implausibilities incoherences and cheap plot twist at the end we have a unconsistent deformed trilogy for forever very young kids only does it worth it i dont know  yet the pictures are beautiful
Mar 9 2023,positive,i honestly really like this one the action was cool and it had some nostalgic moments i can defintly see the flaws but its a guilty pleasure for me
Mar 7 2023,negative,not star wars not even good enough to qualifiy it as a cringie fan fiction legend
Mar 7 2023,negative,this one manages to be worse than the episode vii as the license owner continues to try to transfer the brand equity to the new characters while killing the original ones this trilogy should not exist
Mar 6 2023,positive,as the final installment of the new star wars trilogy and the conclusion of the skywalker saga the rise of skywalker had a lot of expectations to meet while it was a visually stunning and actionpacked film it struggled to balance its many plot threads and deliver a satisfying conclusion  one of the strengths of the film was its cast with daisy ridley adam driver and john boyega all delivering strong performances the chemistry between the actors was also evident providing an emotional anchor for the film additionally the films special effects and cinematography were topnotch providing breathtaking visuals and exciting action sequences  however the films plot felt overstuffed and rushed there were multiple storylines and character arcs to follow and the film struggled to give each one the attention it deserved as a result many plot points felt rushed or underdeveloped and it was difficult to fully invest in the films story  the rise of skywalker also relied heavily on nostalgia and fan service often at the expense of character development and plot logic while some moments may have been enjoyable for longtime fans they did little to advance the story or provide a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy  in terms of direction jj abrams returned to helm the film after directing the force awakens and while he was able to recapture the excitement of the franchise the film suffered from a lack of cohesion and a clear vision it felt like abrams was trying to please everyone resulting in a film that tried to do too much and ultimately fell short  the films score composed by john williams was a highlight as expected the iconic star wars themes and motifs were used effectively adding to the emotional weight of the films key moments  overall star wars episode ix  the rise of skywalker was a flawed but enjoyable film while it may not have been the satisfying conclusion that fans were hoping for it was still an exciting and visually stunning adventure in the star wars universe
Mar 5 2023,positive,this was ok but enough already this was a good conclusion to this gargantuan series of films that simply must put in every single easter egg from all the other films into it and then some rey amd company join forces and then go all over the place to discover how to get to darth sidiouss lair and kill him once and for all rey and kylo ren still dont have the best relationship and many many droids are seen a fun watch but i was glad when it was over
Mar 1 2023,negative,a frustratingly mediocre conclusion to the skywalker saga poorly written mostly concerned with fan service and undoing everything the previous movie set up bringing back the emperor is the star wars equivalent of jumping the shark shame we will never see duel of the fates as much as i love the original trilogy star wars as a brand has become overrated
Feb 28 2023,positive,i wouldnt say i hated this but its the type of thing youre glad to see done with im not bothering with the mandolirian at all rey finds out more about who she is ben finds out more about who he is and everyone gets ready for the battle that will essentially be a do or a die for the rebel fleet old characters come and go the dumb humor that seems to have taken hold and refuses to let go is well still there and in the end well youre glad to see its done
Feb 26 2023,negative,one of the worst films ever in cinematic history i dont think chatgpt could invent something worse
Feb 26 2023,negative,this may be the star wars movie with the worst script ever and with a payoff thats beyond disappointing  we spend 2 movies only to see our heroes battling palpatineagain
Feb 25 2023,negative,dreadfully bad  like a bad marvel comics movie  the plot doesnt even make sense  the pacing was awful   i cant say just how disappointed i am on this one   pretty sure lots of fake reviews disney bots on this one
Feb 24 2023,negative,ruins the entire franchise of star wars  star wars was my love and life growing up but i have grown distaste of it since the creation of the sequels  nothing but plot holes bad writing and some of the worst directing ive seen  jj abrams should have his reputation ruined for having ruined arguably one of the greatest film franchises of all time
Feb 24 2023,negative,another terrible sequel
Feb 23 2023,negative,oh god no  how you do luke skywalker dirty like that
Feb 21 2023,negative,a truly horrendous example of filmmaking  not only is it poorly written and directed it effectively ruins one of the most important moments of the original trilogy where palpatine dies and we all saw it happen  jj abrams is a small minded hack and a cultural vandal  he will never be forgiven for ruining the most treasured film franchise of all time
Feb 20 2023,positive,loved it critics and self proclaimed star wars experts got it wrong this is a fun movie plot holes yes still enjoyed it as a popcorn classic nonetheless
Feb 17 2023,positive,my least favorite of the sequels but i love them all billy dee williams returning as lando is something to be treasured for a lifetime and ian mcdiarmid returning as emperor palpatine is a sight to behold great film
Feb 14 2023,positive,the ending moment was the best part that ending part was very nice in my opinion 
Feb 13 2023,negative,jj abrams ensures the sequel trilogy was the worst of the 3 trilogies by essentially reconning half of what was added in the last jedi almost like he wanted to sabotage what it added to the star wars story out of spite while simultaneously characteristically thinking adding a huge battle scene with no story makes a good movie tlj was controversial but at least told a story and got creative jj abrams took a hammer to it  i just watched it 10 minutes ago and i couldnt even tell you what its about except for destroying the empire excuse me the final order because apparently he even had to rename it again to make sure tlj had no impact on the canon again and some big battle scene that made no sense at the end and was full of bad writing even the characters seemed to have trouble getting on board with half the things in abrams contribution to the story  the only thing that saved it is the star wars universe and continuity canon and story that alone made it entertaining and a movie a star wars fan should obviously watch but as many diehard fans have prepare to be outraged with the complete lack of respect to the sw universe and rots predecessor the last jedi while simultaneously being hands down the worst title out of the 9 movies  if youre going to take a hatchet to the last directors work because you dont like what they added to the canon and universe at least be ready to do better rots doesnt even get off the starting blocks
Feb 12 2023,negative,my fandom of star wars was inherited from my late uncle i say this because it means that anything star wars reminds me of him and almost always makes he happy this film did not have that affect if i had to guess not a single individual person actually cared about the finished product this movie feels closer to living in tsarist russia than living in the world of star wars stay away and pray for the future
Feb 12 2023,positive,absolutely loved the third trilogy and this one was perfect seeing the heroes of my childhood return was so emotional and i totally recommend these films
Feb 9 2023,neutral,a little lame with some very stupid plot points that dont make any sense but you could say that about the prequels so meh very meh theres nothing really else to say except for kylo ren was great but i really think finn and rey would be great together to be honest i kind of feel bad for rose 510
Feb 9 2023,negative,to be honest with you ive seen this film twice and i still dont quite understand anything about this universe star wars to me is just over the top world building that just confuses everybody its not something easy to take in and to understand he literally have to be glued to a television and write down in a logbook in order to keep up this movie just completely did the same thing to me and threw me off confused me and then seen the world implode with the public completely demolishing this film made my head spin multiple times its not a terrible movie but its definitely something ive never revisited again
Feb 7 2023,negative,worst movie made and all of this due to jj abrams terrible writing and story telling he just killed the spirit of star wars
Feb 4 2023,negative,not really a starwars movie and portrayed luke entirely wrong but isnt the worse
Feb 4 2023,neutral,terrible writing pathetic story it really doesnt even make sense but disney always likes to make the real heros look like idiots
Feb 2 2023,negative,terrible plot ruined star wars
Feb 2 2023,negative,very very very bad aint no way palps came back and rey died by palps but some voices in here head beans here back to life omg garabage
Feb 1 2023,negative,i am a huge star wars fan and i have to say this is one of the worst movies ive ever seen  it was obviously rushed poorly written poorly conceived regurgitated material that lacked any of the spark that george lucas created  disney really needs to take star wars is an uncharted direction and allow the creatives to execute their own vision  this was like watching bad anime that i would prefer didnt exist in the continuity  the fact that the sequel trilogies didnt even have a solid arc mapped out prior to filming shows that this entire ip is being mismanaged and it needs to be saved for the fandom
Jan 31 2023,positive,eh it was alright cant say the same about the other 2 movies in this overall terrible trilogy though
Jan 29 2023,negative,this is absolute garbage my living room couch would make a better executive producer than kathleen kennedy i am convinced you could write a better film by cramming dialogue into a baby and then having it projectile vomit across the room i saw this in cinema and it was a waste of 30 and the better part of three hours three hours that could have been spent doing something better more wholesome and healthier for the brain like eating a 10course meal made entirely of asbestos the writers have such a severe lack of intelligence that im surprised they have the brainpower to breathe this film is one of the biggest affronts to the entirety of cinema history i have ever seen right up there with jar jar binks and the eragon movie
Jan 29 2023,negative,bad movie retconed the origonals and prequels when anakin killed the emporor in the origonals he brought balance to the force and the fact that the emporor is still alive ruins the point of the first 6 movies along with the fact that all matirials are recicled over and over agian however this brought a satisfing and spectacular end to the carrer of who ever wrote this crap
Jan 28 2023,negative,poor writing bad directing
Jan 27 2023,negative,somehow palpatine returned kind of sums it up even disney admits they didnt know what they were doing here all the promise of the characters from awakens is completely abandoned the story here just feels like it was written by a committee i really dont know what to say it really leaves you with an empty feeling
Jan 26 2023,neutral,this unsatisfying and uninteresting finale to the star wars franchise relies more on special effects than on the actual plot of the movie
Jan 25 2023,negative,bad ending to a bad trilogy not as bad as episode viii though
Jan 24 2023,negative,somehow palpatine has returned  in the aftermath of tlj they had their hands full trying to fix all of the problems the second movie in this series had introduced and while there are a few good moments overall they failed the previous movie left things in such a mess that in an attempt to make this one better they went too deeply into the well of nostalgia and ended up creating some of the worst moments in star wars  im a huge star wars fan but the disney era hasnt been good for star wars movies go watch the mandalorian or andor and skip this
Jan 23 2023,negative,as a fan of episode 4 to 6 this crappy episode is unbelievably hard to watch
Jan 22 2023,positive,this movie  it had so much potential i really wanted to like it it has some great ideas and visuals secret dead sith world with cool army a reborn palpatine but it does virtually nothing with them does nothing to justify or earn them and makes no sense lore wise at all and doesnt even try to explain them at all  even the great performances by ian mcdiarmid adam driver and daisy ridley cannot save this fun but absolute mess of a film this being said it still is a mostly enjoyable watch so long as you dont try to think about it too much
Jan 21 2023,positive,def good as the old ones but it was still very nice to watch
Jan 20 2023,negative,jj abrams really forgot to write a coherent plot 
Jan 19 2023,neutral,bad the whole franchise gets 2 and a half stars only for the fact that its star wars would deserve 0 otherwise
Jan 18 2023,negative,it was just bad people were crying about last jedi but i liked it except for casino storyline but this one is just bad
Jan 18 2023,negative,palpatine died in episode 6 darth vader during his redemptive arc killed him by throwing him down a reactor shaft even if palpatine survived the fall the death star blew up which wouldve killed him bringing him back undermines the redemptive arc for darth vader besides that the movie doesnt feel as epic as it should for a finale it doesnt have any phenomenal battles or remarkable lightsaber fights furthermore rey poe and finn arent given enough backstory rey is a palpatine but this concept is never explored and the movie doesnt say much about finn or poe this whole trilogy by disney was a massive disappointment
Jan 17 2023,positive,is it perfect no but its fun
Jan 17 2023,negative,likely to be the only star wars film that could ever be counted as worse than the last jedi rise of skywalker not only continues to insult the intelligence of viewers but insults the medium of film itself
Jan 17 2023,negative,literally undid the entire point of the story of the sequels   vaders sacrifice useless palpatine survived somehow and it reads like a bad fanfic but ackshually da emperer survoived an hesa zombie now an he has a whole fweet with a thousand ships and they all have death star layzors an the good guys ride their magic space horses across da ships and win wif friendship ans din kilo rim dies bekus he used to much force healz to save raie
Jan 14 2023,negative,i was eleven when the first star wars film came out and i absolutely loved the original films with a passion this garbage is so far removed from what i once cared about
Jan 13 2023,positive,its obvious that rise of skywalker isnt as good as the original trilogy but its still a great film and you should watch it
Jan 13 2023,negative,completely destroys canon of first 6 films does nothing to describe or grow the characters best to just treat this latest trilogy as though it didnt happen
Jan 13 2023,negative,what is there to say that has not already been said truly this is just another of so many rebootssequels of beloved franchises that openly mock and insult their fan base claming to be made for modern audiences
Jan 12 2023,negative,how the heck does this have an 86 this movie is awful with some of the worst writing ever please do not watch this movie
Jan 12 2023,negative,just and awful plot with so many plot holes you wonder if they ever even thought about the script before hand how does palp have the money or man power to produce all these ships lol and plenty of others just like her striking down palp just as she said but hes gone either way mary sue is just the worst
Jan 10 2023,negative,nothing more than an appeasement exercise for fan boys a dreadful end to the skywalker saga and quite possibly the worst of them all
Jan 9 2023,positive,great cgi kylo was amazing as always so big in scale and rey truly became a jedi i do not understand why people hate on this masterpiece bringing back palpatine and the death star was nostalgic and all the fights were amazing
Jan 9 2023,positive,this is what happens when you try to please both sides of a polar divide and end up disappointing the entire spectrum it has its fun moments and the cast chemistry is charming its always fun to spend time with the legacy characters it was nice to see c3po get to shine sorry unfortunately once you become immune to the nostalgia bate youre left with a mess of a movie its fine but it should have been great
Jan 8 2023,negative,i am not one of those people who talks down to people who like this movie im not going to call someone an idiot for liking a movie i like because thats just dumber than the movie is the main reason why im so down on the the rise of skywalker is that it contradicts anakins prophecy i know some eu novels do the same but those are not canon this is
Jan 8 2023,negative,if u hate yourself watch this movie and youll realize there is no god
Jan 8 2023,negative,the worst trilogy ever made the first order was never explained they misused the original cast in fact they were all disrespected in how they were utilized this whole thing was without honor and without imagination ray was a mary sue who the hell was snoke etc as far as im concerned the story ended on episode 6th  sorry 
Jan 6 2023,negative,the entire sequel series was rushed for a quick buck on disneys part the wrong people put in charge entirely clearly not super fans of star wars castrated luke freaking skywalker split han and leia kills off han rey is 500 overpowered and has no experience at all and its just so unbelievable cheesy and an embarrassing movie with the star wars name should have went with georges original plan for the sequels rey thinking she can call herself a skywalker and for some reason shoot lightning by accident come on or defeat her grandfather in like 5 seconds  yeah right the sequels never happened for me and many many many star wars fans i dont even believe this audience rating on here
Jan 5 2023,positive,easily my favorite of the skywalker saga the only sad thing is we arent getting another trilogy centered on these characters working to build a better world in the aftermath of the first order
Jan 5 2023,negative,money grab with bad acting and no well of originality  sad to see such meaningless messages act important for the sake of greed
Jan 4 2023,neutral,the movie suffers from poor character development from the main character along with ridiculous plot armor and an underwhelming villain even the return of a great character from the past couldnt make the movie memorable
Jan 3 2023,positive,i was really looking forward to this movie but it almost felt messy lots of things from the previous instalment were left explained and some of this just felt very confusing and sloppy almost to set up for new spin offs the emperor died at the end of return of the jedi yet is somehow mysteriously alive theres lots of things here that just dont sit right and almost feels like a disappointing end to the series
Jan 2 2023,negative,really bad holy movie based on the fact that palpatine somehow returns insane mcguffin plot with not much logic not really this movies fault but this movie is really bad
Jan 2 2023,positive,sw ros is an incredible film with as good a storyline as could have been concocted with the following caveats 1 it in many ways invalidates the core message of episode 8 that really anybody can be a jedi 2 that the location of exogol was so readily located by rey and crew when luke had been searching for it for some time presumably 3 that palpatine came back to life or was cloned why not have the first order based out of the cloning planet in this case i wonder 4 the compass thingy  otherwise hey hey hey this movie is amazing
Jan 1 2023,negative,pretty bad story was terrible but the ships and stuff were cool
Dec 29 2022,negative,poorly written good visuals
Dec 29 2022,negative,a mess it jumped from one thing to the next without ever caring to see if the audience was onboard or not
Dec 29 2022,negative,i was on an intercontinental flight and bored out of my mind i tried watching this movie but it was just so terrible i couldnt take it anymore when after i somehow made it half way through i prefered being bored for another 5 hours than continuing this movie for a minute
Dec 29 2022,negative,shockingly bad story disjointed and a hot mess what a way to spoil star wars disney you should be ashamed of yourselves and jj abrams too
Dec 28 2022,negative,passable but still not a decent film to carry on the story of the prequel or original trilogy over the sequel trilogy was disjointed and plagued by uninspiring writing and a chronic inability to bring originality to the franchise
Dec 27 2022,positive,youve got to give a lot of credit to jj abrams for salvaging the mess left for them by the prior movie
Dec 26 2022,positive,the movie isnt great as it shouldve been but after replacing the director for 8 this is to my opinion the best saving jj could have done
Dec 21 2022,negative,ruined an already flawed uneven new trilogy that lacked a coherent vision
Dec 20 2022,negative,i just did not enjoy this movie i think it was annoying how it tried to fit everything in and it just failed
Dec 19 2022,negative,this is the absolute worst star wars movie ever made apart from the last jedi it really feels like it was written by a toddler
Dec 19 2022,neutral,it had its moments and was far better than episode 8
Dec 18 2022,negative,jj abrams tried to do a repair job in this film to make up for the last jedi but doesnt pull it off ill always wonder what mightve been if jj had manned up and directed all three movies but the fact remains that promise of force awakens was never fulfilled
Dec 17 2022,negative,actually the funniest movie i have ever seen it is an absolute joy to watch and laugh at how bad it is  like a parody that doesnt know its a parody  good casting and great performances that is its one unironically reddeming quality so that bumped it up 1 star  totally uninventive and bleh  pew pew zap kaboom
Dec 12 2022,negative,this movie wasnt great to say the least  the characters were bland there is rushed love that doesnt make any sense  star wars continues to suffer from bad writing in the sequels
Dec 12 2022,positive,good action great starring cast dont love the direction they took the story but being someone that loves all star wars if you accept their decisions you will enjoy it and the effects are top notch 
Dec 9 2022,negative,it was weird watching a star wars movie and just not caring what happens  i found myself again and again saying what  sure i guess  stuff kept happening that didnt make sense was cringey or contradicted previous stories but i just went along with it  whatever  i guess thats a thing now  admittedly it must have been difficult to rescue the franchise after the last jedi  they really painted themselves into a corner with that one  i guess they had to undo some of the things from that film that in turn had undone things from the force awakens  the whole sequel trilogy is a mess and this film caps it off aptly
Dec 3 2022,positive,be honest it was not that bad i know it is not good as the rest but its not too bad
Dec 2 2022,negative,he has neither feet nor head of the one who has been able to like this
Dec 2 2022,positive,good but wanted more
Nov 30 2022,negative,this film was so bad that it made me say oh to hell with this for the entire franchise itself it is chockfull of utter nonsense either explained away in single lines or not at all and its grand finale is entirely disappointing doing away with two films worth of conflict in a baffling move the parting shot and accompanying final words of the saga are such that it ruins the entirety of the 9episode film collection
Nov 29 2022,positive,this was honestly a pleasant experience to see in theaters while there isnt much difference between the st and ot what the st added to the universe makes up for thispartially and in my opinion overall ok movie i could sit through the entirety and be pleased
Nov 28 2022,negative,couldve been fine as standalone but its a dumpster fire considering the jarring turns this took from the previous two movies like who thought this was a good idea
Nov 26 2022,negative,one and a half stars in sympathy for jj abrams who had to try to retcon the trilogy after the last jedi fiasco  unfortunately he failed  bland characters and a stupid sloppy plot make ros a soulless corporate mediocrity
Nov 24 2022,positive,it was okei wrong that they made rey related to palatine
Nov 22 2022,positive,the film that resurrected passed characters killed off key characters and took itself far too seriously than it needed to almost sounds unbearable to watch i would highly disagree its fun plots twisted tales and insane cgi graphics make it a fun and highly enjoyable film rated 355
Nov 20 2022,positive,now i understand that people dislike this movie but i dont understand why from its emotional fights and heartfelt deaths to its funny comedy and great finale i consider this to be my favourite cinema experience of all time topping the force awakens it has brilliant acting a good story and is one of the most enjoyable and rewatchable star wars movies at the moment 910 for me way too overhated
Nov 20 2022,negative,this is a really terrible movie the podcast criticism of the movie is 3hrs long which is longer than the movie itself  jj bordeoms needs to stop producing terrible scifi films with lens flares he needs to be forcibly removed as director from future scifi projects
Nov 18 2022,negative,this movie was all over the place it brought back characters that should have been left alone the plot felt like it was invented at the last minute which is probably accurate considering the feedback from the second movie and some characters get no screen time at all when they were focal in the first two movies or just the second one rose super weird movie was ultimately worse than the second one because at least the second one felt plausible this one feels like a 5 year old wrote the script and i am not a huge fan of the second one either
Nov 16 2022,negative,where did the thousans of fully maned death star star distryers come from with the sith knife you need to line it up with a crashed star destroyer exatly like what if they were 100 meters to the left the it wouldnt of lined up also the part with palpatine was horrible like he died in the original trilogy you dont live from an explosion that completely destroys you the part with rey saying i am all the jedi and you hear their voices was really cool it was a super underwhelming movie
Nov 16 2022,negative,it was the perfect end to a shitty trilogy
Nov 15 2022,positive,the movie is good and its better than tpm and aotc
Nov 15 2022,positive,a movie that should have been two movies a decent movie in and of itself if you can let yourself ignore the plot contrivances and dropped side characters this movie had to deal with the brunt of the damage caused by the flipflop of directors and did its best with what it had   all of the actors do their best with what they are given and the performances by ridley and driver are particularly undeniably superb
Nov 15 2022,positive,i dont care what people say i think this is a brilliant movie
Nov 12 2022,positive,great i love this one every part of the story is important 
Nov 11 2022,negative,one of the worst star wars movie ever
Nov 8 2022,negative,this is just a lazy writing the duel of the fate title that they cancelled is better
Nov 7 2022,positive,sad to see the saga end but it was good
Nov 7 2022,negative,not much to say honestly lazy writing at its finest acting mediocre at best not really a star wars saga worthy product tbh more suitable for a b production kind of a flick gruesome and dismal
Nov 6 2022,negative,the whole script is an insult to fans the lack of character developments throughout the sequel trilogy is glaring and the fact that episode 8 really broke everything about the skywalker saga cannot be undone especially not by brining back palpatine instead of fixing the last jedi it just keeps on digging deeper into stupidity
Nov 6 2022,negative,how this is rated so much better than the last jedi baffles me this felt kind of messy fan servicey and just not good i accept it into the canon because im not a baby but i just really dont like this
Nov 4 2022,negative,the worst part of this movie isnt the horrible story pacing and insane plot points its the fact that they introduce a completely impossible ability that is literally a spit in the face to the entire saga before that the fact that a random girl with no training can heal and bring people back to life with the force when anakin skywalker the one born from the force literally caused the entire original trilogy because he couldnt do this is honestly insulting to everything george created how did they manage to create a character so absurdly overpowered that they made darth vader look weaker
Nov 2 2022,positive, ends the trilogy without doing anything memorable with any of the new characters like finn wanting to tell rey something that he never does with palpatine back for no good reason still its entertaining half assed ending
Nov 2 2022,positive,best thing jj could have done after johnsons terrible and cringe the last jedi
Nov 2 2022,positive,i know a lot of people dont like this movie and rey but this movie and rey its good ok just accept that
Nov 2 2022,negative,reys story could have been better kylo rens redemption could have been less predictable and finn and rose were sidelined i blame the toxic fans of star wars for how this movie turned out
Nov 1 2022,negative,by far the worst star wars movie the script acting and directing all of it the ony good part is oc the music they could have done everything better id love to see an movie with the old script overall this is the worst star wars movie
Nov 1 2022,negative,i dont know how jj abrams managed to go from a great movie like the force awakens to a disaster like rise of skywalker this atrocity breaks every already established rules of star wars by adding any power that the plot requires a good movie has a protagonist that has flaws and in the third movie featuring rey she seems to lack any flaw at all there are absolutely no stakes in this movie the villain was completely unoriginal it seems that the writers seemed to have forgotten that the emperor died in return of the jedi and the addition of a love story that makes as much sense as count dooku and jar jar binks this movie is lucky that solo exists because it is the only thing that saves it from being the worst star wars movie i would rather watch the star wars holiday special and three ewok spin offs consecutively
Oct 28 2022,negative,i was surprised at how bad this movie was jj abrams usually has great tastes when it comes to scifi but his charm just wasnt there the entire movie was a rushed hodge podge of fan service featuring no original score a cringeworthy opening crawl and no feeling whatsoever palpatine was really boring in this movie which i would never say about his performance in the other movies the ending where poe says theres too many of them and lando saying but there are more of us was just trying to avengers endgame so hard but this movie is nowhere near as good as endgame hell in my opinion its not even nearly as good as the other star wars movies yes that includes the prequels and the last jedi this movie just killed my interest in the franchise that i hold very close to my heart it was so tiring none of the characters were likable and was clearly an example of disney having a tight deadline on everything if this movie had more time in the oven it couldve been something special but its not
Oct 27 2022,negative,i am a big fan of star wars my favorite tv serie but this last trilogy is a total failure it is the movie that never should be done
Oct 27 2022,positive,the film suffers from the same problems as the last jedi long dialoguedriven plot lines full of exposition and dull character moments but it comes full circle to a thrilling satisfying conclusion
Oct 27 2022,negative,star wars is some of the most sophomoric storytelling
Oct 24 2022,positive,disappointing close to the trilogy but had some good moments in there and amazing cgi overhated and still very enjoyable but very valid criticisms
Oct 23 2022,positive,the rise of skywalker perfectly concluded this legendary skywalker saga of star wars the twist of palpatine is one of the best in sw rey being palpatines descendant makes much more sense considering her raw powers this movie tributed the saga and legacy characters perfectly stunning work by jj abrams and again daisy ridley nailed it her performance as rey will surely be among the greatest star wars performances rey skywalker is now an iconic  one of the great sw characters
Oct 23 2022,negative,worst star wars i dont even think they thought this through at all terrible waste of everyones time
Oct 22 2022,negative,really you resurrect palpatine to save face this is what fans get for being fans i am at a loss for words this is the death of science fiction as we know it denis villeneuve please save us this movie is riddled with bad acting terrible script extremely bad space battle tactics and worse yet  plot another movie where cgi is used to make lots of shiny screen time so as to hide the bad and hollow characters seem larger than life
Oct 21 2022,positive,star wars the rise of skywalker suffers from a frustrating lack of imagination but concludes this beloved saga with fanfocused devotion
Oct 21 2022,negative,incoherent story very lazy writing why do they have to create the story that way somehow palpatine return thats stupid if he needed to show up at least a force form
Oct 21 2022,negative,this movie should be considered a crime against humanity there is not a single second of enjoyment watching it not a good catchphrase or a good action sequence just a sad series of scenes where a good franchise depoisits its hopeless hopes and fades into oblivion ive never felt as bad as i did watching a movie in my life
Oct 19 2022,negative,for someone who genuinely enjoyed the force awakens and the last jedi the rise of skywalker was a massive letdown   i think it would have been a better story with a different director and screenwriter
Oct 19 2022,positive,the haters can say what they want about this movie but ill tell you the truth the conclusion makes no sense if you are a 48 year old gamer man living in their mums basement but to someone who likes the franchise and can accept it for what it is the vfx are stunning and palpatine is awesome either way my only quarrel is inventing a fourth tatooine genosis jakku desert planet just pick one the colour palette is extremely recognisable a blue grey dominating the film kylo ren is menacing however i do think kelly marie trans rose tico was sidelined substantially in this instalment undoing all of the last jedi either way its better than the last jedi and an overall good film
Oct 18 2022,positive,it was an oke movie could have been better
Oct 17 2022,negative,made a rt account just to give it 1 star messy way to end the trilogy they obviously didnt plan out the whole trilogy together they just tried to throw in a bunch of fan service to make a big ending
Oct 16 2022,neutral,the movie delivered on a conclusion all rightit just didnt deliver on much else  to its credit this film had some bold ideas but they werent very good and too much of the movie felt like the studio was trying to clean up after the terrible last jedi the movie as a whole feels lazy and while the ending has the finality of what someone would expect from the conclusion of a decadesold franchise it doesnt feel earned after the first act the plot feels predictable and boring the character development is almost nonexistent three major characters have fakeout deaths or conclusions that are then retconned within minutes and the script is borderline amateur   while the cast is still great they really had their work cut out for them on this one
Oct 16 2022,positive,this is another pretty decent cgi filled star wars films with some impressive landscapes quirky characterscreatures including babu frik and some good dialogue it didnt grip me quite as much as other films but its by no means a bad film the plot is interesting i thought it was surprising that richard e grant appeared in this film certainly an entertaining film this is still worth seeing if your a fan of the franchise certainly
Oct 16 2022,positive,in my opinion the sequels asw very overhated i will say this one feels like there was stuff they needed to change it is still a good film
Oct 15 2022,positive,its good movie yll
Oct 15 2022,positive,star wars was a magnificent franchise but now the saga has ended but with an amazing conclusion although the final duel didnt left any memorable sensation for the franchise as a finale
Oct 14 2022,negative,the dysfunction of the sequel trilogy is on full display with the rise of skywalker i wonder what jj abrams and rian johnsons relationship is like because according to these films they absolutely despise each other from the line a jedis weapon deserves more respect to the minimization of rose to the following interaction we need to pull some holdo maneuvers come on that move is one in a million abrams is purposefully jabbing at the last jedi the whole film  take away those feelings of division and this film is still not very good it was nice to see the three heroes on a journey together though that probably should have happened in episode vii there are some truly stunning visual sequences though not as good as episode viii  unfortunately since the stakes keep getting raised every film death star bigger death star fleet of death stars etc my investment level is very low when finn says we take the war to them i stopped and wondered who exactly is them  a disappointing end to a retcon mess of a trilogy its frustrating to think about the potential of what could have been  best character poe best scene passing the lightsaber from rey to kylo though i dont love the implications with force manipulation the scene is pretty cool best quote in the event i dont make it back i want you to know youve been a real friend r2 my best one in fact  c3po
Oct 12 2022,negative,as a lifelong fan of star wars it is sad to see what the franchise has become the film tries to please as many people as possible and as a result it feels soulless as if it were created on an assembly line while all films lie somewhere on the spectrum between art and commodity this feels so removed from any passion that so many feel for the franchise that it feels like a nauseating roller coaster you never think about again once you get off of it disney has discovered they can throw near anything out the masses and rake in a billion dollars that their desire to tell compelling stories is gone
Oct 8 2022,negative,this movie is devoid of any story it is one big noisy music video with little or no plot doesnt help that you have a main villain that is like a raging twit throughout and a heroine that is so op it is a pointless character this is worse than the ep 13 and second worst sw movie of all time after the idiotic last jedi where people can breathe in space with no consequences
Oct 6 2022,neutral,the plot was a complete mess and after about 40 minutes i started to think that maybe i had missed a movie in this series because i had absolutely no understanding what was happening and even when the movie ended finally i was still confused about what the point of it was you had to see it to believe it but everyone in this movie possessed superpowers that could rival supermans and they were all on the move looking for artefacts and heading somewhere the upcoming films better be a bit different or even take some inspiration from the old films as there was nothing really wrong with them
Oct 5 2022,negative,its hard to get my feelings on this movie at times and the movies narrative is a bit mcguffiny and messy the rise of skywalker is still a brilliant movie with fabolous performances a great portrayal of palpatine epic action solid humor and shocking moments that make this the perfect conclusion to the 42 years old skywalker saga enter false
Oct 5 2022,negative,this was hefty please stop the greed and ignorance and give us some intelligent script writing and some good character development at least
Oct 5 2022,negative,plot is kinda weird bringing palpatine back was a terrible idea a couple dumb moments in the plot and some dumb characters entertaining but not satisfying
Oct 4 2022,neutral,i will openly acknowledge that this film is considerably more entertaining and considerably less insulting both as a star wars fan and as a human that believes in decency than the last jedi and unlike that horrible film i can see myself maybe revisiting this movie from time to time  i mean were talking maybe once or twice a decade but its not alongside tlj in my i genuinely hope i never have to go through that again list of films  having said that the rise of skywalker is a very very very dumb film overblown in every conceivable way and chockfull of contrivances that come from absolutely nowhere to allow the plot to progress at a clip that was likely set solely so nobody in the audience can stop and think about how stupid it all is  however considering that every plot thread from the force awakens was severed and made irrelevant in the last jedi its clear that the writers were forced to come up with something to completely rewrite this now completely broken trilogy  i will also give the movie that it actually does have some good action sequences  something that was somehow almost entirely missing from its two predecessors and both the cinematography and art design are better than in the previous entry as well  the music is solid and the vfx which i actually helped with  not as an artist but as someone who actually helped fix a problem with a render farm  no seriously are generally very solid as well  the acting is kinda flat but at this point it was clear that the morale of those involved with this trilogy had plummeted so i dont discredit the actors or the director  and in terms of things that this movie genuinely does right it does allow the three main characters to be together for much of the movie which is good as they have a unified charisma when together the movie doesnt have the morally repugnant lessons that its predecessor had and while i hated the finale from a story perspective i do appreciate what it actually tried to do like serious points for trying  they also had a moment i genuinely loved where chewbacca breaks down and cries when leia dies her actress passed away before filming so this isnt a spoiler as characters grieving the losses of those that they and the audience loved was something also sorely missing from this films predecessor  the biggest flaw really beyond the almost insultingly contrived plot is that the reintroduction of palpatine as the main villain only acts to negate almost entirely the struggles of the main heroes in the original trilogy  its odd as simply having this be a different villain wouldve made this a lot better  overall the rise of skywalker has fireworks has energy has charisma and has braindamage  it tries and utterly fails but i actually felt like the film wanted me to be happy and so truthfully i cannot bring myself to hate it despite how bad it ultimately is
Sep 30 2022,negative,unlike the force awakens or last jedi it is boring and the story is lame this title doesnt even deserve the name star wars to be in its title such a sad way to end a great franchise absolute shit show410
Sep 29 2022,negative,i dont like that the bring palpatine back and i especially hate the way they explain him being a clone of some kind better then 8 but thats not saying much
Sep 27 2022,negative,what a mess  it undermines the movies that came before it an illogical plot  the failed attempt to make meaningful dialogue out of the few carrie fisher scenes leftover from earlier movies are a slap in the face to a great actress  director jj abrahams seems more intent on making a collection of catchy scenes than of building a compelling story  it even rips off the goonies at one point the knife map  sad and underwhelming
Sep 26 2022,negative,it was better than the last jedi it was worse than the phantom menace all things considered the tv survived the movie barely
Sep 24 2022,positive,probably the best what anyone could do after ruin johson nearly killed whole saga e9 is not good and doesnt add or creates anything but at least it fixes sequel tragedy i mean trilogy so it doesnt break sw mythology
Sep 24 2022,positive,the original trilogy is still better it seems a little ridiculous after having watched it
Sep 24 2022,negative,plot holes and poorly written at least the effects were good
Sep 22 2022,negative,i wish that i could give it 0 stars no storyline no character growth just super awful to watch an insult to the star wars saga and should have been removed from canon a long time ago
Sep 21 2022,positive,i like this movie i have always felt like it is a star wars end game now it has problems many problems but i can look past most if not all of them and immerse myself in this bad ass film
Sep 21 2022,negative,visuals were amazing the story was not
Sep 19 2022,positive,best of moviestv series collection
Sep 18 2022,positive,i do not get the hate for this movie it is still not a good star wars movie but out of the new trilogy this is the best one
Sep 17 2022,negative,the rise of skywalker manages to undo the most important character arc of the original trilogy for the sake of having a bad guy that people recognize canon is destroyed interesting characters like finn are sidelined and wasted and were left with an incohesive and relatively unmemorable mess as the capper of the sequel trilogy fans of the franchise will actually long for the prequels   if youre a star wars fan that hasnt seen this youd do best to avoid it and watch clone wars rebels or mandalorian instead
Sep 15 2022,negative,the first film was a microwaved leftover of the original trilogy the second was an embarrassing attempt to subvert expectations at all costs this final film was just a desperate last attempt to recover something lost along the way it was just a bitter disappointment at the end of an awful disjointed trilogy  dont get me wrong as always a star wars film is a visual spectacle in that regard alone this film succeeded in all other ways including the atrocious pr from disney before and after the films release treating disgruntled longterm fans and critics like perpetrators of hate crimes the movie failed utterly every plot twist and reveal seemed horribly contrived every attempt at humor was forced even the action scenes came across as though the showrunners treated it like some kind of obligation somehow in the end though dont know what i find more worthy of contempt this films bizarre lackluster script or the fans of the film with their heads in the sand save yourself the trouble and avoid the online community its a toxic wasteland the film is not much better
Sep 14 2022,positive,with the disaster that was its predecessor the odds were stacked against this film it does an okay job at trying to salvaging this trilogy but ultimately the whole story feels chaotic illthought and rushed as well as bouncing around all over the place i feel it missed opportunities to give longtime fans some payoff  hayden christensen should have had a cameo in this film its a suitably disappointing conclusion to a forgettable trilogy
Sep 13 2022,negative,a very hollow ending the characters didnt have any trouble with anything they just happened to stumble upon every they needed the whole trilogy didnt even have a plan from the beginning it feels like you can see the director jj abrams fighting with the director of the last movie the last jedi directed by ryan johnson on screen and in the end the person with no training is able to beat emporer palpatine at the most powerful he has ever been without even trying just deflecting his lightning back at him which palpatine knows hurts him so he should have stopped when it started also the anakin is the one supposed to bring balance to the force yet this character if you can call her that has not had any training and brings balance to the force
Sep 13 2022,negative,feels like i watched the same thing but with new cast felt very meh
Sep 13 2022,negative,the worst ending for a starwars film they should have never done this trilogy
Sep 12 2022,negative,this movie was so disappointing the actors did their best but the story and the characterization of the protagonists was just so stupid there is so much wrong with this movie for me to list everything sadly it was just fast paced nothing
Sep 12 2022,positive,enjoyed this next installment in the series and thought it was a great continuation of the story  legacy of star wars as it pays tribute to princess lea  luke skywalker cant wait to see what happens next with rey kylo rhen and the gang on their adventures against the dark forces
Sep 10 2022,neutral,its acceptable the prequels are worse than this but comparing the films doesnt make this a good movie its still a mess somehow a character that we havent seen in years  hasnt been mentioned or hinted at returns as the main villain of the movie with no explanation other than somehow palpatine has returned i also hate how the force is used in this movie as basically plot magic i dont mind if the force is used in new ways we havent seen before but using the force to just explain every question in the movie is frustrating the only thing that works in this film for me is kylo ren except for his redemption it felt super lazy  generic to me  the fact that rey beat him many times before this film so it makes me not find him as much of a threat when he is up against rey
Sep 9 2022,negative,restart the sequels with young luke waking up from visions like anakin did in rots so all this movies can be considered a vision that someone sent to luke disney can easily fix this situation please do it episode 9 is a major disappointment and i am really sorry to say this
Sep 8 2022,negative,this movie was kinda doomed to fail after tlj still it amazes me how actually bad the movie was in the end lets go  they ressurected palpatine  so desperate so dumb insane pacing why does the first order reign oh rey is training she can fly stupid mcguffins all over the place a dagger that fits the ruins of the deathstar are you kidding me video game progression of the story super weird carry fisher scenes and dialog well she was dead idiotic plot planet killing star destroyers that chill around in a planet the dont know which way is up they loose against small junk ships kylo ren has a stupid arch rey cheapshots kylo then heals him again oh yeha rey can force heal now so can kylo he dies though she doesnt
Sep 8 2022,negative,an attempt to stitch together a bunch of broken sequels
Sep 7 2022,positive,growing up in the 90s i was shocked when i learned that people didnt like or even hated return of the jedi i loved it now here i am with a not uncommon experience of feeling disappointed with rise of skywalker there are some fantastic scenes even some interesting new lore to explore in this movie i cant help but wonder how this movie will be seen ten or twenty years from now
Sep 7 2022,negative,we all wanted to be good but its sadly not the actors dont make you believe the story there is no scenario a disappointment
Sep 7 2022,negative,terrible all 3 of the last trilogy were terrible
Sep 7 2022,negative,expected something better from jj abrams  this finale to a wellestablished and revered franchise is nothing short of an embarrassment
Sep 6 2022,neutral,a mediocre end to what started as a promising new trilogy couldnt make good the hatchet job of the last jedi
Sep 5 2022,negative,well it wasnt as awful as the last jedi but not by much the story once again is ridiculous mystery box mania which goes no where the characters are all flat except for kylo who actually seems to be trying to act the humor is not funny and the ending is pure drivel the only thing good about this film is that finally the cringy sequel trilogy has ended
Sep 5 2022,negative,not only is it an insult to the the past movies and the complete star wars universe but it is also absolute garbage the plot progresses horribly the entire movie not having clear goals having plot holes left and right no propper set up for things overall its almost as bad as the last jedi
Sep 5 2022,positive,i watched it for its visual effects
Sep 4 2022,negative,pretty darn bad but i am sympathetic to the challenge of trying to pick up the pieces after the last jedi basically mashed together empire strikes back and return of the jedi killed off snoke and luke in unsatisfying fashion and permanently split the fanbase this whole movie is an exercise in quick lets hurry to the next thing to try to keep the audience from thinking about how none of this makes sense
Sep 3 2022,negative,the characterization of established characters is bad and in conflict with their experiences even when they try to patch up previous movies portrayals that are also awful the new characters are poorly written with lack of actual character and depth the plot is frankly ridiciculous full of plot holes and coincidences on galactic scale and it ignores what is established from previous movies yet also contradicts itself even
Sep 3 2022,negative,ignoble end to a legendary saga
Sep 3 2022,negative,completely incongruous with the other two films you can tangibly feel the mad scrambling of the film creators trying so hard to salvage something anything to make this film work whats left is just sad
Sep 3 2022,negative,incredibly bad all the way through completely ruins its legacy while it walks and stomps all over it a limp finale for a terrible series
Sep 3 2022,negative,not good worse then the 2nd installment in the trilogy and i didnt think that was possible
Sep 2 2022,negative,last minute rush job to try and rescue a disastrous trilogy with no vision or planning
Sep 2 2022,negative,better then last jedi but that is the worst big blockbuster released in the last twenty years so not saying much this is still terrible in every area truly laughable how anyone made it and thought it was any good
Sep 1 2022,negative, this was such a bad film im glad that we can ignore the disney installments and pretend none of this happened
Aug 31 2022,negative,a failed attempt to fix the problems the last jedi created and arguably the force awakens too
Aug 30 2022,negative,just a huge mess  made no effort to integrate any of what came before  even lando showing up isnt enough to save the day     maybe its for the best though maybe the failure of one of the golden cows of cinema will give a little look in to original material even star wars was new once
Aug 30 2022,positive,star wars the rise of skywalker achieves to undo the direction of its predecessor though the movie still remains visually stunning to look at without standing special facts star wars episode nine fails to recover from the jumbled mess that was episode eight the only reason why i am being gracious is because this movie did move at a pretty good pace and i did have more fun with the action in this movie overall this movie was extremely sloppy
Aug 29 2022,neutral,had some cool moments but still the worst of the sequels the writing is so attrocious its almost satire at times horrible pacing and editing cheesy dialouge  and boring story
Aug 29 2022,negative,this is my least favourite film of all time it is completely devoid of soul rehashing character arcs already completed to bring back a long obsolete character that died meaningfully and that we were done with it is riddled with constant plot holes and half of the films run time is a fetch quest filled with padding and complications that amount to nothing this film is a complete failure of all imagination it fails at every opportunity to come up with anything new i assume children who havent seen the originals who are unable  to understand the references will leave this movie confused and unimpressed by how underwhelming the film is you could have 1000 nostalgic feel good moments but it could never be a good story instead of continuing the story that was set up with the last jedi they decided to make a nostalgic omage to star wars and the worst part is the retconing of luke skywalker who died meaningfully saving the rebellion lukes sacrifice was meant to be showing the galaxy the legendary warrior version of luke the hero despite the fact that that version of luke didnt really exist that didnt matter because he played the part anyway buying time for the rebellion to escape and create a legend that will inspire hope for generations but what does this film do it undermines all of that by having luke catch the lightsaber and saying that all of his previous conclusions were wrong all because some dipshits who dont understand story telling didnt want good ol luke skywalker to die this way because i dont know apparently luke is supposed to be fucking imortal or something the rise of skywalker is by far the most disgusting unimaginative and pathetic piece of cinema i have ever had the displeasure of witnessing
Aug 29 2022,negative,instead of real star wars movies we get these hyperproductized safe emulations that suffer from boringly overwhelming lack of creativity in terms of ideas there is just a surface that is nothing more than a tenuos collage that constanty collapses due to its brute forced buildup suddenly falling through sand to find a dagger that suddenly shows a way to a map then a noncreative epic battle at the end  this is plot carrying at its worst
Aug 29 2022,positive,i am a first order guy and i think that emperor palpatine is the best i think that rey being his grandchild is dumb and not true and the star destroyer being destroyed is not good i know that rey is not a skywalker and it does no look good on the skywalker name
Aug 27 2022,negative,black holes learn how to suck from disney starwars makes episodes 12 and 3 look like masterpieces
Aug 25 2022,negative,this movie is bad in so many ways but what bothers me the most is how good and ready the protagonist is there is no journey like we see with anakin and luke
Aug 24 2022,positive,while it is still frustratingly inconsistent and leaves a whole lot unanswered it does fix some of the obvious carelessness with the last jedi and even offers some explanations to the force awakens
Aug 24 2022,negative,the fact ppl liked this shows just how dumbed down humans have become
Aug 24 2022,negative,i hope the cast and crew continue on to have great success in the industry and make their mark on the world of cinema the producers head writers and darth abrams on the other hand i hope this massive failure will teach them to stop underestimating audience intelligence and to stop using mystery boxes and whiplash inducing subversion devices
Aug 23 2022,negative,disney once again you took what you already killed and proceeded literally resurrect it and then kill it again the sith won congratulations a palpatine literally stole the skywalker name stole lukes home his lightsabers and his sunset
Aug 22 2022,negative,its pretty much one of the worst star wars movies i gave it one full star instead of half a star only because the movie is technically good sound visual effects etc the movie fails to provide sensible character motivations and comprehensible pacing the worst offense is how it breaks the lore of previous films anakins sacrifice and redemption didnt mean anything the struggles of the rebellion were for nothing and an old baddie is shoehorned in because star wars is afraid to do anything different
Aug 22 2022,negative,no direction character development and senseless plots  granted there was no direction or point in the last one to come up with a way to continue it the idea made no sense and destroyed the points of the originals  they should have outlined a story before starting the sequels  the empire had countless people suddenly to run each star destroyer  everyone is wishywashy on what side they are on
Aug 22 2022,negative,does not even deserve half a star absolute garbage that completely retcons the prophecy of the chosen one if anakin didnt actually kill palpatine then his entire character arc over six movies is pointless and irrelevant jj and kennedy should be absolutely ashamed of themselves
Aug 22 2022,negative,didnt hate either tfa or tlj when i watched them both were kind of just meh for me this film makes me look back on both of them with disdain im no star wars super fan but this ruins everything good about the franchise this is truly one of the two worst films i have had the displeasure of seeing ever in my life
Aug 21 2022,negative,one of the most incompetent movies ever made
Aug 21 2022,neutral,its very hard to get behind this movie i disagree with the very way that they set out to make it honestly they felt the need to wrap up the trilogy as well as every other episode in the series while at the same time catering to the people who hated all of the changes from the last jedi within that context they probably did make the best movie they could but thats just way too much to try to cram into one movie and i feel its unnecessary in the first place the only good thing i can say about it really is that it does bring everything to a conclusion nothing is really left unanswered even if it was answered in a terribly clunky way really its just painful to watch this trilogy at all knowing how it ends and how much better it could have been 510
Aug 21 2022,negative,truly awful   absolute destruction of fandom
Aug 19 2022,negative,as a life long star wars fan i couldnt be more disappointed the only reason i gave it one star was because abrams was given a horrific mess by rian johnson to clean up
Aug 16 2022,negative,franchise ruined completely crapped all over their own fanbase  cool business model kathleen kennedy
Aug 15 2022,negative,the worst thing star wars has ever created a movie that feels like it has no relation to all the movies before it which detracts from maybe even destroys anakin luke and so many other characters arcs and which decides to forget finn poe rose and every other character the previous movies introduced in order to focus solely on rey and maybe a bit of kylo ren overall this movie just feels like it is a massive joke on all the other star wars movies up to this point and is not at all deserving of being the finale nonetheless canon in star wars
Aug 14 2022,negative,the laziest movie ever made somehow palpatine returned
Aug 14 2022,positive,this is so dang good i loved every second of it it had a lot to do in the time it had i really didnt enjoy last jedi i only watched it once and i wanted to just get up and leave but this one had me on the eage of my seat  in the good way this one is a match to the first one and the characters feels true to the ones we are introduced to in the first one and the story makes more sense and feels like we are back in the world of star wars if you like the first one you will definitely like this one but if you liked the last jedi then you might not like this one as mucht as this is a returen to the world introduced in the first one
Aug 10 2022,negative,meh not good at all the plot was nonsensical your basic mcguffin chase against a villain who once again has the capability to destroy planets but the mcguffin itself didnt make a lot of sense and the villains ability to destroy planets was a vain attempt to up the ante for a series in which the villains have already been capable of doing that three times already   the appearance of the main antagonist basically steals the thunder from the original trilogy in this series and his plans were seemingly patched together to keep the plot moving forward   this latest trilogy was bad as a whole but this last installment was the worst and easily skipable
Aug 10 2022,negative,so many plot holes inaccuracies and mistakes were made it feels like someone without any knowledge of star wars wrote the plot prepare to have you nostalgia bone sucked even drier
Aug 8 2022,neutral,upon my original 810 review  just did a tripple bill topped with a midnight screening blimey anyway i hated the last jedi at what i promised would be my last midnight screening and although movies this late are spoiled by the timing of these midnight screening things this one managed to keep me stoked actually finishes the whole saga off very nicely the handling of the carrie fisher difficulty was quite good considering they just wrote new dialogue around scenes cut from the first film in this trilogy rather than cgi ing her in a little forced but for the most part worked its probably something of an 810 maybe more they introduced a rather spectacular dark side aspect that i wish they gave a little more time to breath another positive that came out of this one is that it ties on to the last jedi quite well i felt the last jedi ended up messing things set up in the first one in the hands of another writer but feel differently about that middle chapter now  a later viewing one that significantly down graded it  having rewatched the originals the prequels rolled through the new seasons the new movies i reached this again to find it lacking something significant i realise carrie fishers death doubtless threw this movie out of orbit however i think they would have done well to have recovered something of what was originally intended by cgi ing her in while also adding the cut material from the force awakens and writing around it her inclusion being limited to that and the writing to shoe horn her in really undermined it all seems horribly forced secondly spoiler they shouldnt have killed ben off at the end they ended his life with a kiss between him and rey and well im just going to fan edit his disappearance out of it so it seems as though they may have become something more afterwards  something of a troubled love story  theres a lot of ideology thrown in here too which sadly kept taking me out of the movie  shall never escape it it seems
Aug 8 2022,positive,bad ending to the star wars saga
Aug 8 2022,positive,i love that there is another star wars movie but this seemed like disney was trying to please everyone and the movie was blah
Aug 7 2022,positive,the greatest final 02 hour and 22 minutes ever
Aug 7 2022,negative,i dont know how this movie managed to waste an incredible cast a massive budget and the entire history of a 8 movie saga and make all of them worse with this being the conclusion i dont even wanna watch episodes 7 or 8 which i think are decent anymore because i know this comes after it
Aug 5 2022,negative,not as bad as the last jedi but thats nog saying much weak story no star wars magic wish i could forget ever seeing movie 7 8 and 9 but what has been seen can not be unseen
Aug 4 2022,positive,many parts of this movie felt forced it was just filled with random and questionable points for example on the planet pasaana rey and everyone were being chased until they crashed into sinking sand after sinking and falling into an underground tunnel system it happened to be the exact place that had the exact thing they were looking for the next clue which was a sith dagger questionable choice to bring back palpatine though it didnt bother me cause it was important to the story plus hes just dope very random that there were so many ships with palpatine on exegol there were still lots of things i enjoyed like the scenes with the force connecting rey and kylo between different planets luke was much more likable in this movie the scenes at the death star ruins were awesome acting was great cgi was great final fight scene with rey kylo and palpatine was awesome as well as the rest of the fighting that happened on exegol
Aug 3 2022,positive,i was very surprised how much i liked this movie it had some flaws and some unbelievable things happen in it for sure it makes up for the last jedi though and abrams cleverly connects the dots from what i disliked from the last movie that this move makes up for it this movie had some great lightsaber battles and very good emotionally acted scenes overall was a fulfilling move with the nostalgia and i like what abrams did with the ending this movie helped redeem the last movie
Aug 2 2022,negative,please dont its  getting worse and worse since disney took over
Jul 31 2022,negative,not the worst movie ever but it suffers from the previous movie completely derailing the story so many scenes felt like they were rushed and i believe its because rian johnson decided he wanted to tell his own story rather than continue what was started in the force awakens i give the movie a 2 star rating due to having to finish up after the steaming pile of crap that was the last jedi it really deserves more like a 15 at best
Jul 28 2022,negative,what a bad movie i didnt like the end is like throwing to thrash all of the skywalker legacy
Jul 28 2022,negative,lazy just plain lazy the movie only works by retconning many established parts of previous movies in a lay way to get to the finishvery disappointing end to a once great saga
Jul 28 2022,negative,an absolute insult to george lucas darth vader and the lore of star wars itself if you love star wars this movie will only anger you
Jul 26 2022,negative,this movie is so bad that im getting sad and tired as i type this single line review
Jul 25 2022,positive,not that good of a movie but an amazing save from the last movie which was a disaster
Jul 23 2022,positive,my rating for the film is a 6810
Jul 20 2022,negative,i only gave this a 2 star rather than half a star because the last jedi tlj made it impossible for anyone to get this movie right the plot of the movie just doesnt make sense somehow palpatine returned yeah somehow so getting thrown down an engine shaft straight into the core of the death star is a survivable experience  this is not an ability that has ever been discussed but they pass it off by saying the dark side is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural stealing the line out of rots but out of context all this means is that darth vader died for nothing this is a major plot hole  the prophecy of the chosen one is that anakinvader would bring balance to the force and destroy the sith  before this movie the prophecy was intact the plot is also full of coincidences lando just happens to be on the planet to provide assistance just as the gang turn up without him they would be captured he just so happens to know the location they need to look for the way finder they get this dagger by complete luck after falling through some kind of new quicksand that happens to have tunnels underneath the dagger is inscribed in the language of the sith c3po can translate it but cant tell anyone so this leads them on a stupid side quest to reveal the location of the wayfinder the whole movie just feels like coincidence after coincidence rather than logical decisions are being made to advance the movie  in terms of characters poe doesnt progress in this movie  we get a small look at his back story but i think they added that in as an afterthought too fin doesnt progress luke is a different person compared to tlj and thats a good thing but terrible in terms of continuity rey has godlike powers and somehow kills palpatine i assume hes dead but you just dont know now  in the prequels and originals there is a power level structure  palpatine is more powerful than vader yoda is more powerful than luke the prequels have it similar with mace and yoda the most powerful and obiwan and anakin just below them  the sequels have completely ignored this rey is the most powerful jedi to ever exist  she must be if she is more powerful than palpatine  just because theyre related does not mean she should be as powerful  star wars has never explicitly said that offspring will have the parents force abilities  the only instance is vader and luke but even then luke had to train hard to become as powerful as he did in ep6 up until this movie rey had never trained i dont count the lightsaber and rock scene as training so how she has these abilities is ridiculous at least this movie shows her training but still not enough to be palpatines equal hes been a force user for decades  we are lucky this is only a circa 25hr movie because it needs to be longer to fill in all the plot holes  5 hours would suffice so negatives out the way this movie is visually impressive the vastness of the battles doesnt come across quite as well as rots intro but its still very good  its something i always expect from jj abrams  i blame disney for this primarily jj needs some of the blame but it sounds like he had a few weeks to write this script before they started filming
Jul 18 2022,negative,negative stars the one great character they had in this movie was not the main lead and he was abused by the horrible plot and storytelling
Jul 17 2022,negative,i gotta be brutally honest this movie is not good at all it might just be the worst ending to any film series and i do not say that lightly this movie spends most of its time trying to undo the last jedi which is a very cowardly thing to do as someone who actually liked the last jedi that really annoyed me because now i cant watch force awakens and last jedi without thinking that this is how the trilogy ends the ending itself is just trash for a standalone film the ending could work but this is the ending to a nine part saga and its a rushed mess that you will probably forget about what happened at points when you finish it the one word that can describe this movie is overwhelming and not in a good way i also hate that palpatine is in this movie it completely ruins anakins sacrifice but i gotta give credit where its due ian mcdiarmid was phenomenal as palpatine in fact all the actors were giving it their all this movie does have good moments but if im judging the whole thing i cant give it a good score this movie is proof that disney had no plan whatsoever with this trilogy
Jul 15 2022,negative,terrible end to george lucas next level story telling
Jul 15 2022,positive,great effect good story
Jul 14 2022,neutral,why does this film have to be so dumb they gave up on trying something new and instead brought back a villain who already served his purpose this movie was the best i could have been coming off the previous film which was not good either
Jul 14 2022,negative,one of the worst movies i have ever seen cannot even put into words how bad this dumpster fire was
Jul 13 2022,positive,not as good as force awakens but an excellent movie
Jul 12 2022,negative,this movie has a terrible plot and it has so many inconsistencies that its hard to count but it does have some nice character moments and a cool final battle there were some really strange directorial choices though somehow palpetine returned really thats the best you got overall this movie is really disappointing but has some fun moments
Jul 12 2022,neutral,well is it a good movie absolutely not the amount of questionable choices made in this movie is insane but it is still watchable so for that it is more enjoyable than the prequels
Jul 10 2022,negative,my least favourite of the saga just dreadful story character arcs and lack of a feeling of star wars instead with lazy writing and this wasnt the actors fault they just had nothing to work with
Jul 10 2022,negative,no respect for the dead reinforces my preference for star trek movies
Jul 9 2022,negative,another bad movie that is killing the star wars franchise this movie is little bit better then the last jedi but it is still a very big disappointment in my opinion it is bad for rey to be angry all of the time and becomes a jedi even anakin who became vader was not so angry compared to her was more of a jedi than her strange that rey calls herself a skywalker she is not part of the family of ananakin vader luke or lea yes vader would be like a grand uncle to her i know jj abrams was trying to fix all of the damage done from the last jedi fiasco from rian johnson
Jul 8 2022,negative,the worst star wars has been since the holiday special  who thought jj abrams was a good choice for an ending
Jul 7 2022,negative,abrams for almost 3 hrs is trying to undo the last jedi in this poorly told story this nonstory made no sense from start to finish disney has lost their way it should of been called the rise of profit
Jul 7 2022,negative,very poorly written abrams is one of the greatest at creating characters but his ability to tell a story is weak
Jul 7 2022,negative,a bad end to a bad trilogy
Jul 5 2022,negative,disney star wars clearly has the capacity to make visually stunning and financially viable films but as the budget and hype of projects goes up the amount of care and love for the franchise gets lost in the focus groups without a dave filoni or a favreau breathing life into it rise comes across as incredibly boring and contrived in narrative while seeing it once on the big screen might trick you into thinking its epic rewatches and stripping back the visual appeal betray poorly written characters abysmal dialogue even compared to george lucas scripts and most sinful a star wars movie that isnt very much fun at all thanks again kathleen kennedy 
Jul 3 2022,positive,it managed to be magical in spite of being muddled kind of a waste of a wonderful setup in previous movies
Jul 3 2022,negative,the absolute low point of star wars a derivative mess a travesty of a movie
Jul 3 2022,negative,the worst star wars movie ever it completely ruined anakins redemption and broke all the important rules of the star wars universe
Jul 3 2022,negative,this movie completely disrespects every other star wars movie made i dont hate on the new trilogy 7 and 8 were fun to watch but this movie is just an abomination the force can do anything characters are underdeveloped there are massive plot holes but as i mentioned the worst of it all is that this destroys the franchise as this is supposed to be conclusion of a longrunning saga
Jul 2 2022,negative,mary sue palpatine cannot carry a tv show much less a trilogy
Jul 1 2022,negative,didnt enjoy it but i honestly cant blame them for it being that bad tlj ruined the series so bad they really couldnt recover from it
Jun 30 2022,negative,very bad nothing to do with the original canon 
Jun 30 2022,negative,rise of skywalker is a complete and utter disaster it lacks direction characters are bland jokes are cringe and the ending is frustratingly awful to this trainwrecks credit the score and cgi is obviously amazing but thats not enough to save it the entire sequel trilogy was absolute wasted potential
Jun 29 2022,negative,the good stuff  special effects and cool saber duels  the bad stuff  pretty much everything else  i was in disbelief with how bad the writing was  if youre going to essentially rewrite one of if not the best trilogies of all time at least make it make sense  but no disney had other ideas  a palpatine bringing balance to the force  kylo ren murdering his father only to be turned to the light by said palpatine  and then to top it off the return of the palpatine because well clones  ive seen and heard better storytelling from my 6year old niece  this trilogy made a mockery of the originals and even the prequels it was that bad and spat in the face of george lucas mark hammill and even harrison ford and carrie fisher  the only reason id recommend this trilogy to anyone is to give them a bigger appreciation for how incredible the original trilogy was  absolute trash
Jun 29 2022,positive,the best rotten tomatoes got this wrong one of my favs
Jun 29 2022,negative,this movie is ass i was going to give it 05 stars but adam driver does a decent job rest of the movie is ass major ass
Jun 28 2022,negative,this movie was a disappointing conclusion to the skywalker saga the last jedi is no excuse for the way this movie turned out
Jun 27 2022,negative,just a poor rehash of return of the jedi
Jun 27 2022,neutral,yeah this is better than cats
Jun 26 2022,negative,story was boring and didnt really make any sense to think that they could have made any star wars movie with whatever villains they could imagine and some how came up with lightningemperor from episode 6 to be the big bad guy is disappointing  the whole thing reeks of disneys poor story telling quality this was made to make money not to entertain people
Jun 25 2022,negative,the worst star wars movie ever made the phantom menace had better writing
Jun 25 2022,negative,not much could be done to salvage the stinking wreck that was the last jedi  yet the rise of skywalker is still able to disappoint fans in other ways
Jun 24 2022,negative,this movie has no real plot emperor was killed by vader years ago
Jun 24 2022,negative,soooo palpatine wins after all
Jun 24 2022,negative,i dont understand how palpatine returned it just makes no sense at all
Jun 24 2022,positive,the worst thing for me is that they ruin anakins legacy
Jun 23 2022,negative,it doesnt make any sense with anything its a terrible end thats not how the force works
Jun 23 2022,negative,this film is tied with the last jedi for the worst in the franchise so far the disconnection from the previous two films is inexcusable the choreography in fight scenes is lazy the villains cant be taken seriously the attempts at humor are awkward and take away from immersion overall just wish the sequels wouldnt be considered canon they need to try again
Jun 23 2022,negative,this was all over the place it was trying to make up from the last jedi while also trying to provide cheap fan service with the bringing back of palpatine just terrible
Jun 23 2022,negative,it is just a copy of episode 4 its success was based on nostalgia and pure fan love for sw
Jun 22 2022,negative,this film is the best example of mediocre management scenario impotence lack of acting talent and of mary sue thank you kathleen kennedy thanks to you we now know how to make the worst movies in history even tommy wiseau is far from you
Jun 22 2022,negative,i cannot believe this audience score was legit this movie was a hot mess nothing made sense if theres no consistency then how can you get invested in anything  basically disney star wars kept changing the rules and then using them to mess with the audience there is no way this movie wouldve worked if it had not relied on the star wars nostalgia as it was it did not work anyway and you can tell because people still talk about the original star wars and nobody talks about rise of identity theft anymore
Jun 22 2022,negative,a plot so dumb it seems like it was written on a napkin after a night of heavy drinking  this is the sad conclusion to a messedup trilogy that true fans are more than willing to forget or write off as fanfiction
Jun 22 2022,negative,worst movie ever broke the movie universes own laws of physics and upped the dangers to pointlessly ridiculous levels that made it feel like eating raw sugar instead of a lovely dessert
Jun 21 2022,negative,junk movie making destroying beloved ip with weak story telling and narrative driven characters
Jun 21 2022,negative,they made a lot of decisions and they were all wrong
Jun 21 2022,negative,this and all other ones close to this killed sw  rogue one   best ever star wars made  period
Jun 21 2022,positive,a fitting end to the sequel trilogy given its disastrous predecessors handling of most characters  while it may be disney canon i dont think it was the greatest comclusion to the skywalker saga for multiple reasons  but given its constraints episode ix at least handles the new and legacy cast with respect and makes the best of a poor setup from the last jedi  the cinematography and audio are amazing and it feels like star wars
Jun 20 2022,negative,really just bad writing and lukewarm acting the anti trilogy
Jun 20 2022,negative,terrible movie for everyone that cares about the star wars universe in the slightest it destroys the lore and makes other movies not make any sense
Jun 20 2022,negative,sighdisney disney disneyenough  so the ip of an original 70s film that spawned a sequel better than the first and established a fan base of prodigious proportion is reshot recast gussied up with better cgi photocopied drizzled with nostalgia and served up as if it were something new  its the same as a new hope  and there is no hope that disney will do anything other than this ingenuous repackaging with its stable of ip  its the equivalent of fast food  all bright and no substance if only it had kept on the trajectory set by the rian johnson film then we would have had a film worth watching  no lets resurrect emperor palpatine becausei forgot what i was saying
Jun 19 2022,negative,palpatines return was confusing and little to null explanation i dont believe much thought was put into this trilogy
Jun 19 2022,negative,if you made me choose between the existence of the three new movies or a 5 minute scene from the mandalorian or obi wan i would certainly choose shows new movies were aweful worst part is i barely remember plot total waste and a money grab  glad they finally got their act together with the shows
Jun 18 2022,negative,almost the worst film of the sequel trilogy
Jun 18 2022,positive,this film is a brilliant ending to the sequel trilogy and the entire skywalker saga featuring a wonderful message about how family is more than just your blood  sometimes your true family is the one that you find along the way it also gives a strong assurance that you do not have to follow the dark path of those whove come before you you can create your own legacy you can choose to be better than the ones who came before the ones who would want to see you fall which is incredible the film is also just tons of fun c3p0 is a pleasure to watch shine in this palpatine makes the perfect appearance to tie all nine films together into one deranged arc adam driver gives such a good performance as kylo renben the scene between ben and han may be the greatest star wars scene ever made everyone is excellent in this while this film wraps things up beautifully it also feels like a beginning of something new too i truly hope we get to see more of rey finn poe rose connix chewie jannah and beaumont in the future as the film makes it very clear that they are just getting started finn i just know youre going to be a jedi poe i just know youre going to kiss finn lol all that being said i love the sequels excited to see what comes next
Jun 17 2022,negative,somehow palpatine returned nah this is just kinda dogshit as a diehard star wars fan this movie couldve been really great if they just made kylo the ultimate villain of the trilogy after snoke was murdered but no they just brought back the dude incinerated the end scene was okay at least
Jun 17 2022,negative,this movie feels nothing like a war just a fortunate series of events leading to a predictable end backtracking and undoing so much of the last jedi instead of focusing on what worked was a huge mistake
Jun 17 2022,negative,frustratingly tries to undo the prior movie and directly making the ending of the previously trilogies less impactful and this film and the whole trilogy a complete mess
Jun 16 2022,negative,i felt that it was just focused on undoing everything that the last jedi setup i recently read colin trevorrows script  duel of the fates and i think that its way better than the rise of skywalker it just seems that instead of falling through with their plan for the sequel trilogy they bailed based on a very small but loud minority of people who didnt like the last jedi so i will always wonder what could have been if they took a chance and did colins story
Jun 16 2022,negative,well this movie copied endgame
Jun 16 2022,neutral,this movie is a weird one for me cause some days i love it and some days i wanna burn it with fire the best part of this movie is adam driver as kylo ren he really gives it his all here and is absolutely incredible as a tortured villain rey is still pretty lame and so is finn but the best part is the music the music is great and the worst part was palpatine being included
Jun 16 2022,neutral,it seems they did their best with the mess left by the previous film but a compromise ends up pleasing nobody
Jun 16 2022,negative,boring frustrating awkwardly paced and an insult to our prior knowledge of this universe
Jun 15 2022,negative,just another great example of jj abrams  cos abilities thus a total failure  ridiculous story  somehow palpatine is back and just a disastrous ending to a project we didnt really need and which already began in the worst possible way the sequels thats no star wars
Jun 15 2022,positive,its not all good but it closed the skywalker saga in a relatively satisfying way
Jun 15 2022,negative,just abysmal ruins the legacy of the skywalkers episodes 7 8 and 9 do not exist in my universe
Jun 15 2022,negative,palpatine somehow returned  thats what we get instead of im your father revelation thats about sums it up  mary sue runs around being lucky gets new forces out of nowhere defeats everyone with no effort youre not skywalker youre an impostor born out of lack of creativity and we thought prequels were bad id better watch jar jar doing a pod race than this
Jun 15 2022,negative,this movie had some okay points but a lot lacking also because of the first two movies it didnt make sense lastly reys powers just dont make sense in the universe of star wars very disappointed
Jun 15 2022,negative,although the story makes no since at all it has a couple good things  1 jedi force healing is alright i guess 2 it is the last film in this trilogy
Jun 14 2022,positive,effectively jj abrams is strong on effects but weak on depth again there is a feeling of revisitation of places and people of old in a not very meaningful way there is a lack of heart
Jun 14 2022,negative,i am all the sith and i am all the jedi scene is a lazy writing and the final battle is also lazy as well because they just copy the scene in avengers endgame the mandalorian is better
Jun 13 2022,negative,the worst star wars films of them all so bad you cant even believe what youre seeing nothing makes any sense and they have stopped pretending its just effects on screen and famous actors to bring some nostalgia factor and make us forget that all the new characters are utterly forgettable or downright annoying and offensive to any fan of the original franchise its a train wreck so bad it hurts and it makes you sad as a star wars fan to see a great saga finally ruined by disney in this way
Jun 13 2022,negative,worst starwars film ever or really worst thing on screen ever
Jun 13 2022,negative,way to ruin star wars for ever
Jun 12 2022,positive,loved it i love kylo and rey
Jun 12 2022,negative,worst movie of the saga  rey skywalker w t f
Jun 11 2022,negative,i dont even need to say anything just watch the movie and see how they ruined the entire point of the star wars franchise
Jun 11 2022,negative,this is by far the worse star wars film i have ever sat through the story makes no sense
Jun 11 2022,negative,everything about it is bad the story makes zero sense and is just trying to under tlj and give the fans corny fan service moments 
Jun 11 2022,negative,its just bad anything canon is gone anything with common sense gonethis is not star wars
Jun 10 2022,negative,loved the storyline but the acting was horrible i could get my 4 year old niece to act better then most of these prof actors
Jun 10 2022,negative,this movie has so many problems inconsistent and terribly executed people behind this project clearly had no idea how to conclude or even begin the continuation of the original trilogy absolutely terrible
Jun 9 2022,negative,this movie was rough to watch given that we have multiple examples of just how good a piece of star wars entertainment can be its predecessor set it up for failure and it committed plot contrivances terrible dialogue and poor characters are just a few of the problems that plague this movie
Jun 9 2022,negative,this movie along with episodes 7 and 8 accomplished one thing make the awful prequel trilogy films look like they deserve oscars for best picture
Jun 8 2022,negative,horrible like the rest of the sequels
Jun 8 2022,negative,by bringing back the old cillian for someone else to kill it completely negates vaders turn to the light side and the sacrifice he made there is no curse in any language that would bring justice to the level of horror this movie brought
Jun 8 2022,negative,total distraction of star wars on display here what a disgrace to luke
Jun 8 2022,positive,should have stayed with one director throughout the trilogy and not switch for the 2nd movie the rise of skywalker course corrects the last jedi palpatine returning in this movie kind of ruins the sacrifice darth vader made in return of the jedi overall is a much better movie than the last jedi but is a disappointing entry and conclusion to the sequel trilogy would hope to have a jj abrams cut of the last jedi and rise of skywalker that shows what he wanted to do with the whole sequel trilogy some day
Jun 7 2022,positive,amazing ending but a little slow in some parts
Jun 7 2022,negative,honestly it sucked didnt feel like star wars at all had too many things that we had never thought possible in canon but disney made it so that with those new things they could do whatever they want to keep their precious rey alive
Jun 6 2022,negative,i grade a movie based on how many times i can watch it or the quality of the story and plot  this movie fails on both ends  i have no interest in ever seeing more than once and the storyplot are very dissapointing  but i gave it a 2 because im a huge star wars fan
Jun 6 2022,negative,cant believe they made this movie equally as worse than the last jedi this movie isnt good at all the fact that they brought palpentine back is so outrageous for me and he should never have brought into the sequel trilogy at all they did it because they are desperately making last attempts of trying to save the sequels but no can do for me i dont quite understand the appreciation from this film even the ending was very mediocre and cant save the film god when are we ever going to get a star wars movie like those in the original trilogy
Jun 6 2022,negative,great vfx decent fight scenes but thats just about the only good things about the film sidelines rose gives zero development to poe and finn rey is ridiculously powerful looking at the timeline and ben solos redemption arc is laughable retconned parts of return of the jedi made very little sense and the pacing was terrible how do people like this movie
Jun 5 2022,negative,fails in every regard as a finale as an end to the sequel trilogy and as a sequel the last jedi and as a conclusion to the skywalker saga even by itself it fails
Jun 5 2022,negative,310  ooof that was rough  saw this in theaters when it came out and i heard from friends that it was better than the last jedi  after i viewed it i knew they were lying to me  palpatine coming back was definitely the first red flag but i tried to be optimistic about the movie but it kept on having really stupid moments to bring my mood down rey is an uninteresting character the story was very messy and filled with macguffins did not feel like a satisfying farewell message to a years long saga but rather a sad whimper of a goodbye  i would not recommend this movie to anyone my dad watched it with us in the theaters and he is a really big star wars guy he was visibly saddened by what he just saw and it made me pretty upset
Jun 5 2022,negative,the best of the worst star wars trilogy maybe after the last jedi the only place you could go is up
Jun 4 2022,negative,rise of skywalker is a continuation of jj abrams making mistakes the potentially largest is the idea of each movie centring around an original cast member sadly carrie fisher was supposed to be the main original cast member for rise of skywalker this weird idea reduced time from her appearing in other films   from a lore standpoint this movie also heavily backtracks on the idea anyone can become force sensitive which ironically is suggested in the first two films of the sequels by making rey be related to palpatine it enforces the idea of forcesensitive bloodlines   ultimately this movie is the result of not knowing what story you are telling say what you will about the prequels they actually told a story that can be followed by the audience from the force awakens these sequels have been confusing and have had no clear direction dont seem to know what they want from their characters  its like they are making everything up as they go along and adding lots of nostalgia as simple fan service not anything that furthers the plot   im glad this sad chapter of star wars is finally finished
Jun 4 2022,negative,borders on unwatchable proof that last jedi wasnt a fluke disney doesnt understand what makes star wars special 
Jun 3 2022,positive,moving exciting and for me a great wrap up to the skywalker saga i must say the filmmakers were at a severe disadvantage here with the passing of carrie fisher they really set her up to shine in this movie and her absence really prevented this movie from reaching its true potential that being said i was still impressed with what they were able to accomplish given what little they had to work with but reys revealed lineage really brings the skywalker saga full circle and gives a great send off with the true antagonist of star wars
Jun 3 2022,positive,the entire trilogy yes all of them is astounding and this is a great end to it star wars is wonderful and this served as a great bookend to this trilogy
Jun 3 2022,negative,trash felt like a really bad fan fiction
Jun 3 2022,negative,i have to assume for this movie to get an 80 tomato score the reviews must have been written by not true star wars fans this movie is idiotic bringing back palpating was stupid starting the movie with no context of what happened after the last one was confusing please this movie had so many flaws
Jun 3 2022,negative,the action was ok i just wish that the movie could give us some time to breathe because sometimes there is to much action and when we got to breathe it was just praising and original trilogy character the acting was cool then the story most of it doesnt make sense like why and how did palpatine come back and the whole sequel trilogy was just a rip offrehash of the og trilogy because when you look at the sequel trilogy storyline its just copying the og trilogy but i like how they gave us the leia jedi training scene that was cool but id give the story as a whole a 2510 the visuals were great the characters are cool im just sad of when they teach rey like somethings are stronger than blood at the literal end of the movie she changes it to skywalker
Jun 2 2022,negative,well mostly not very good i really just forgot about it cause it was not very good so i forgot about it cause you know not very good mostly bad though
Jun 2 2022,negative,wow that was terrible  easily bottom 3 movie of all time  horrendous writing plot dialogue ect  literally nothing about this movie was even remotely enjoyable
Jun 2 2022,negative,disappointing and disgusting  many forgettable characters are introduced here for the sake of diversity but are never fleshed out and ultimately distract from the story for no reason  the main plot is flimsy and relies heavily on nostalgia and special effects in order to draw in audiences  worse still is the character assassination of classic and beloved characters for the sake of pushing a clear political agenda
Jun 1 2022,positive,the movie that had to be sacrificed after 8  not much to say it is a big mess filled with plotholes and shortcuts due to how it has to fit two movies worth of plot into one as well as rebuild the things destroyed by the previous movie  however it has some nice ideas and cool visuals and cameos to keep you entertained enough  a real shame how the trilogy turned out however it will be interesting to see where they take those characters after now that this is over
Jun 1 2022,positive,though this films plot and ending may be viewed as stupid and uninteresting the star wars action is severely present during this film
May 31 2022,negative,i watch the film but it didnt have anything cool like the old star wars films and how is palpatine back like bruh they could have made a new villain for the star wars characters but no and rey is not even a skywalker that ending is bullshit and the ending of the cool lightsaber emo kid dies bruh the new films are bad anyways they are just bringing back characters from the old movies instead of making new villains or new characters they just using old ones the films are just so bad to the star wars fan base and no one loves the new films
May 29 2022,negative,its not a good movie but a disastrous finally for a trilogy and a nightmare being part of the star wars continuity
May 29 2022,neutral,the critic reviews are closer to the truth than audience plot was crowded last jedi didnt leave much to work with too much too messy too late
May 28 2022,positive,ok this was a good star wars movie
May 28 2022,positive,abrams had to work with the steaming pile of s rian johnson had left him with
May 28 2022,positive,it gets a bad rap but so much better than the jar jar days
May 27 2022,negative,honestly had no expectations for this movie though i doubted theyd be able to pull the trilogy together i wouldve given this half a star but ben solos arc in this at least brings it to a one the first hour of the movie is worthless as the characters do a lot of pointless planethopping which is unnecessary finn and poe are both reys sidekicks with pretty much no development or purpose in the film palpatine was a hamhanded choice for a villain the only worthwhile thing about him was the implication that he is actually darth bane and that the sith have possessed each subsequent apprentice in some kind of group consciousness when they were struck down in anger this implies palpatine or even plagueis were never the sith lord but possessed by the one who started the rule of two and that they intended to possess anakin andor luke as well and it just didnt work out fan fiction aside the movie couldve been five minutes and had the same impact
May 22 2022,negative,the character assassination mishandling and plot holes are so sad sadly this has what happened to star wars
May 21 2022,positive,the movie was awesome 
May 20 2022,neutral,this movie could have been great but the only problem with it is the fact that it is a conclusive chapter its basically making a endgame without an infinity war there is no movie setting up palpatines return its just bam palpatine is there you may argue they said what happened between movies setting up his return in marketing but that marketing was in a fortnite event
May 20 2022,negative,ive always understood that the new saga was meant for kids but it is still poorly executed the saga has no direction unnecessaryunrealistic dialogue confusing backstories and to wrap it up rey buries luke and anakins lightsabers in the sand for no reason except to show off the two yellow lightsabers she acquired somewhere offscreen my recommendation get drunk and enjoy the visuals because thats all these movies are good for
May 19 2022,negative,a terrible mess with some beautiful moments
May 18 2022,negative,bad writing bad story bad characterization only good thing are the images but the moment you look deeper you have to admit that this is not a movie worthy the label star wars anakin skywalker not being in this movie proves it to be not part of the skywalkersaga at all  he will always be the chosen one
May 17 2022,negative,this movie did suck but it was a star wars movie that was made for star wars fans
May 15 2022,negative,an incoherent insulting mess of a film star wars the rise of skywalker does the impossible and dethrones the last jedi as the worst star wars film to date the cgi doesnt suck most of the time and there are some characters and moments that have potential however an extremely convoluted story that confuses itself half the time and an unclear direction on the directors part make for an absolutely awful movie the main characters are as bad as ever with the actors just feeling tired of their roles at this point there is also an abundance of plot holes throughout rewriting the whole franchise and rendering nearly every other film useless there are a ton of dumb moments as well and many of the subplots lead to literally nowhere overall the worst film of the entire franchise and an insult to the entire fanbase
May 14 2022,negative,what an great way to end such a bad trilogy wtf is even disneys star wars at this point
May 11 2022,negative,watching how the sith kitchen knife was used showed me how useless a motif can be made
May 10 2022,negative,better than the last jedi but that doesnt take much more disney and jar jar nonsense all three disney films should be wiped from cannon utterly dreadful
May 9 2022,positive,it was better than the last jedi bit more enjoyable but i didnt like certain things such as the return of palpatine the dark scenes and was very cluttered specifically the star destroyers too over the top and the horse creatures on the star destroyer alright idea but would suit better on land as im surprised the ship didnt just try and knock them off the surface otherwise the movie wasnt too bad
May 9 2022,negative,and thus dies heroes journeys and memories of good old time without any hope of a better future a slaughter prone to be studied in films school
May 8 2022,negative,debatably the worst starwars movie to date the rise of skywalker fails in every way where the phantom menace put audience into a coma with boredom the final entry into the skywalker saga is different in the way it is so flawed its entertaining put together by a studio scrambling to mend their mistakes the rise of skywalker does a better job at retconning and destroying the legacy of the originals whilst tarnishing its own trilogy
May 7 2022,negative,it gets some stars for trying to fix the last jedis mistakes but awful pacing insurmountable plot holes and continuously bad choices were still made everyone knows now that these movies had no end game vision and were written as they went which caused the directors to pull on each other in all the wrong places this hurt all movies and even stunted the force awakens which was an acceptable movie at the time
May 7 2022,negative,this movie is just chaos its like they tried to appease everyone i dont know why palpatine had to be brought back he was never really a good villain but neither was snoke problem was there was that all the new protagonists storylines were all over the place and broken they tried to split the sarcastic antihero between both poe and finn and make them the new han and lando shouldve just gone with the heir to the empire storyline instead of making this story that really didnt go anywhere
May 5 2022,negative,this film is an absolute mess of an experience it spends most of its runtime frantically trying to retcon the last movie while simultaneously attempting to win over the audience with unearned fanservice that ultimately harms the film more than it salvages it its clear that this trilogy had absolutely no plan or clear direction from the beginning and was made only to try and milk as much cash from the consumer as possible with no regard for artistic or creative drive the rise of skywalker with its abhorrent pacing and nonsensical plot retroactively makes the films that came before it worse making it nothing more than a 275 million waste of time
May 5 2022,negative,i hate everything about this terrible movie first of they made her a phalpatine which was the dumbest thing and then she calls her self a skywalker whens shes the literal opposite and the lightsaber fights suck worst star wars movie and i do not suggest the only reason it gets 2 stars its because its star wars final rating 410
May 4 2022,negative,worst writing in a movie ive seen in my lifetime
May 4 2022,negative,poor plot  ideas and treatment of all characters
May 3 2022,positive,they course corrected after the last jedi mistake in my opinion
May 2 2022,negative,absolutely horrible created so many plot holes that ruined the point of the previous films in the franchise
May 1 2022,negative,this movie shts on everything i liked from the first two sequels its lazily made the plot is stupid it has no tension and most scenes are very cringe andor dumb i also hate how this movie is so obsessed with undoing everything that happened in the last jedi
Apr 29 2022,neutral,star wars the rise of skywalker brings back jj abrams as director and is the last movie of both the sequel trilogy and the skywalker saga this movie much like endgame serves as a conclusion to one of the most popular sagas in history yet is mediocre jj falls into the same pitfalls of force awakens as well as adding new problems this movie relies on nostalgia fest to please fans retcons the last jedi in response to the backlash and it makes decisions that come out of left field in the end pleasing no one in this story after kylo ren rises as supreme leader an old foe returns emperor palpatine back from the dead to exact revenge this means rey and the resistance must stop him although the premise can work the execution is not very good with a convoluted screenplays good seeing the return of familiar characters like lando calrissian ian mcdiarmind as emperor palpatine shines among all the negatives of the movie ian brings the darness cunning and evil cackle that this character is known for truly ending his run as the emperor but this movie despite its beautiful visuals and many easter eggs to all previous 8 films of the saga is a mediocre ending to one of the greatest sagas in history
Apr 29 2022,positive,schlocky jay bauman mike stoklasa sonic is the best thing ever
Apr 29 2022,positive,while this is a step down from the first two films in the trilogy this is still an emotional and epic finale to this beloved saga  i still wish it wouldve tied things together more smoothly for this new trilogy but i still think that this film as well as aotc are the most criminally underrated films in the star wars franchise
Apr 29 2022,negative,im sure on a technical level this film worse than the last jedi but i cant hate this movie its too stupid to hate and at the very least it has the decency to be entertaining unlike the last jedi i still wouldnt recommend the movie though skip it unless you just really have to know how this trilogy ends or youre a masochist same thing really
Apr 29 2022,negative,literally starts with a scroll saying a dead villain has appeared somehow thats not a paraphrase they actually use the word somehow and goes downhill from there  theres a whole secret planet full of death stars and the lightning is more biggerer than its ever been and oh my god they really had no plan did they
Apr 27 2022,positive,the rise of skywalker is a mixed bag for me on one hand i think the rey and kylo subplot is handled really well the acting is still quite good and its mildly entertaining but on the other hand palpatines return is completely wasted there is too much unnecessary fan service and the plot is a mess definitely the weakest installment of the sequel trilogy 510
Apr 27 2022,positive,this was an okay movie  
Apr 25 2022,positive,i truly have no words i didnt love it but i didnt hate it solid movie and way better than last jedi there are just so many unanswered questions throughout the entire movie credit to adam driver for giving a great performance
Apr 24 2022,positive,the final battle between emperor palpatine and rey rey hears the voices of past jedis we hear the voices of anakin obi wan mace windu and many more and that is why this movie is worth watching
Apr 24 2022,negative,this movie has the worst writing in all of star wars it completely destroyed the skywalker saga and anakin and luke legacies by bringing that villain back it just doesnt make sense at all
Apr 23 2022,negative,so bad  the movie was a mismatched combination of several good ideas and several bad ideas poorly smashed together  everyone loves a good villain and palpatine is the only one in star wars that lasted after you see his face  the impending doom mcguffins on the secret base run by the evil in the shadows only accessible by the compass mcguffin seems like a good start point  the character plot points and interactions make it seem like it was being read to us by an elementary school child with something they just wrote in one sitting
Apr 22 2022,negative,this movie was created after basically running out of ideas they bring back a villain that got exploded in a death star twice and cant even give a good explanation nothing fits together at all please if your a star wars fan ignore the disney trilogy
Apr 22 2022,positive,l was happy when it finished the original trilogy and it was fantastic well story universe and l was happy how it really are visual and actor was well done
Apr 21 2022,negative,this movie ruined star wars for me if youre a new watcher stick to the original trilogy and the prequel trilogy thats it do not watch this new trilogy i would rather watch morbius three times than watch the new trilogy
Apr 20 2022,negative,there are so many useless things going on so fast in this movie that only an hyperactive inattenting child could appreciate it incoherent pointless and unwothy the worst movie of the worst star wars trilogy its impressive how much effort and money were spent to create something which had an incredible potential yet came out so disappointingly bad
Apr 19 2022,negative,this movie was the worst way to finish the skylwalker saga too bad they lost me
Apr 19 2022,positive,by a landslide the best film in the sequel trilogy and im glad jj abrams came through for all of us who heavily neglected last jedi and gave us a fitting conclusion  but still one way or another this is still not even close to best star wars movie overall
Apr 19 2022,positive,not the triumphant conclusion to the skywalker saga that people wanted but lets be real thats a movie impossible to make ending something 40 years in the making that touched so many people no film could meet that expectation it allowed people to say goodbye to characters they loved and wasnt ridiculously predictable although slightly cheesy
Apr 17 2022,positive,a good film with an adventurous story with magnificent fights and special effects in short a great film to finish a saga that has been going on for more than 40 years
Apr 17 2022,negative,one of my least favourite films a slight improvement from the last jedi but still very bad this is a terribly written film which also ruins the legacy of anakin skywalker this film is the result of not having a clear plan and story from the beginning
Apr 14 2022,negative,i dislike the clear attempts to retcon the last jedi despite my disagreements with the decisions made in that movie a poorly constructed finale with way too much going on despite some of its better moments an incoherent end to an incoherent trilogy
Apr 14 2022,negative,awful and lazy writing
Apr 12 2022,negative,ruining vaders sacrifice not being the move is the least i have to say about this movie lmao
Apr 12 2022,negative,though the visuals were stunning and it passed my holiday time it destroyed the legacy of the 9 films anakin was supposed to end the sith being the chosen one but instead no he was never the chosen one and all jedi were wrong its just horrible that a random mariesue can just defeat the dark lord with two blades
Apr 10 2022,negative,this movie was a product of lazy writing combined with some bonkers storyscript decisions most of the lead ups felt forced hard to believe within the universe and had no setup or previous film explanation the decision to digitally insert carrie fisher into this movie not only made me personally discomforted but is an extremely disrespectful decision to the cast member family fans and franchise overall this movie left the franchise with a good closing of its third trilogy but desperately needed some more fresh competent story writing
Apr 8 2022,negative,its a okay movie if you just want a sommer blockster filmnight but if youre a star wars fan its a complete disapointment for me i dont like that they completly break the rules just denies what happend in the orginals like rey and wide boy kylo ren fight in the ruins of the death star like what the death star was completely destroyed
Apr 8 2022,negative,terrible movie but i think jj abrams got a rough hand from the previous disaster
Apr 7 2022,negative,finn got played he went from potential jedi to lando in just one movie
Apr 6 2022,negative,crappiest installment yet i actually hate rey get a personality somethinganything make me care i wish i could have that time back
Apr 4 2022,positive,considering all of the residual last jedi mess that abrams had to clean up rise of skywalker turned out to be a sufficiently satisfying conclusion to the skywalker saga  the star wars aesthetic is back along with abrams and some really compelling visuals in new environments i wasnt thrilled that this came back to palpatine again but since johnson took all other options off the table in last jedi i dont know what else they could have done  there were some pretty significant plot leaps but again i found them understandable since we had to get from a really lousy point a to an acceptable point b and we were definitely in a star wars movie the whole way glad to see luke redeemed somewhat and rose written out a boring pointless character leftover from last jedi  all in all i found rise of skywalker acceptable probably tied with return of the jedi for 3rd best star wars movie
Apr 4 2022,positive,good film a personal look in black widows past
Apr 3 2022,positive,yeah this film made me intensely happy it wrapped up nine films worth of storytelling so well
Apr 3 2022,negative,this is not the finale star wars deserved really really terrible
Apr 3 2022,positive,i understand the negative opinions but particularly i loved it
Apr 1 2022,negative,pointless storyline hard to watch
Apr 1 2022,negative,a good movie minimises the number of logic holes in the script this movie is a collection of illogical scenes and it seems as if the script was written by schoolchildren the animation however is breathtaking as always enjoy the space battles and forget the story
Mar 31 2022,positive,wouldve been great if the story explainded why the emperor is alive but a nice end to the sequels
Mar 29 2022,positive,jj abrams returns to finish what fans wanted but therefore adds in his own favorites that do create a good story but fail to correct what happened in the original trilogy and create weird plot holes
Mar 24 2022,neutral,saw the rise of skywalker just before christmas with my sister but it took me a while to gather my thoughts on it being not sure what rating to give it or how to express my opinion on the film will admit that when seeing it in the cinema to me it was enjoyable but had a lot of faults since watching the rise of skywalker then though the more it has been thought about the more it has gone down in my estimations my reservations felt back then still remain the same as well as what struck me was good while thinking of more since  my opinions on the previous stars wars films were much more definite being a fan of the original trilogy and while the prequel trilogy had a lot of flaws to me they werent that bad also thought the force awakens and the last jedi were better than expected am aware that possible blasphemy has been committed here but the last jedi certainly had a lot wrong with it solo was good fun on its own terms too absolutely judging it from an open mind the rise of skywalker left me very conflicted however and ended the trilogy on a whimper rather than a bang its not deserving of a 110 but it is not near deserving in my opinions of the 1010s mostly given to counter the negativity in classic critic bashing style of the franchise this was the one in all honesty that left me the most disappointed  will start with the good things with the rise of skywalker it is gorgeously shot and designed and the special effects are often a marvel john williams delivers yet another rousing score that has its own character but cleverly includes the wellknown iconic themes from the previous films  there are some great performances here daisy ridley carries the film outstandingly having become more confident with each film and adam driver is menacing and conflicted carrie fisher again brings nostalgic poignancy to leia while john boyega and oscar isaac are charismatic and do their best with what they were given which was quite weak in my view and how great it was to see ian mcdiarmid again as palpatine again his material was not great but he does a good job with it chewbacca is as adorable and funny as ever and c3po provided a few amusing moments babu frik was a nice new addition and there were a couple of touching and nostalgic moments some of the action is thrilling namely the extended blaster battle and rey and kylos forcebased clash  for all those good things the rise of skywalker has a lot of major flaws with so little time to breathe in the story the film feels far too rushed which made it very difficult to digest the more convoluted parts of the story there is also too much going on so the film feels very cramped by the final act and also too many characters some are fun but too many of them are underused or even pointless and tacked on such as lando and rose tico mark hamill and harrison ford only seemed to be there for nostalgia purposes and are merely walkons  although the action has its moments too much of it doesnt rouse like it should do and is in a way forgettable the big reveal that has been much discussed here made absolutely no sense the atmosphere felt at that part in the packed auditorium in the cinema was like a uniform what the heck and really convoluted the storytelling later on leading to a conclusion that felt rather too anticlimactic and made a waste of the characters involved in it a long way from a bang morever the dialogue is as bad and even downright laughable than the worst of the prequel trilogys with far too much exposition and unrealistic conveniences  overall have seen far worse but a big disappointment if some people liked it good for you it just didnt work for me and many others for reasons that are valid and it is inexplicable as to why people have an inability to accept that and not just for this film but for almost every film here 510
Mar 20 2022,positive,some may hate palpatine returning some might say trevarrwos script was better some might say tlj took more risks i say jj abrams has made a film that is a glorious love letter to everything star wars its rollercoaster of action and pathos drama and redemption
Mar 18 2022,negative,rushes through too many things at once all at a breakneck pace brings palpatine back for zero reason ignores finn and has been completely forgotten about due to its lack of innovation and an interesting story
Mar 16 2022,positive,i havent cried so much over a movie in a while sw9 justifies and gives meaning to the entire trilogy the best of all
Mar 16 2022,negative,pretty awful and disappointing on every level i dont recommend  ep 7 8 or 9
Mar 15 2022,negative,its like they tried fix everything thst was wrong with the last one but some made it ridiculously stupid and predictable just let it die disney 
Mar 15 2022,negative,ill give 2 stars for it being entertaining and the visual art is very impressive but storywise it is terrible long story short just the bringing back of palpatine as the main villain ruins the point of episodes 16 the point of the previous 2 trilogies is anakin and his arc eventually defeating the emperor and saving the galaxy with palpatine just not dyeing or getting a new body from this it almost completely craps on the story of those 2 previous trilogies if someone wasnt a fan of the original or prequel trilogy then they would probably like this trilogy but for all those fans most of the time it feels like a remix of a story thats already been told
Mar 14 2022,positive,spoilers this movie is the end of the skywalker saga the part that i didnt like is that this movie is incredibly rushed rey knows where luke was looking where a wayfinder gone kylo ren finds out that reys on a certain planet deploy spaceships c3po knows where the wayfinder is but cant tell them erase his mind and make him tell us cant get across the sea to get to the wayfinder rey just straight up leaves without any notice and now kylo rens here these people are so rushed to find a wayfinder or emperor palpatine or even just looking for each other id rather have the original duel of the fates script happen never read it but i think it would be much better i hope the next star wars movie is less rushed
Mar 14 2022,negative,the film looks great but just like the other sequels has a highly contrived plot which continually raises huge plot issues but never addresses them  you cannot just bring back a dead villain and handwave it away  the whole thing with the mapknife please show a little respect for your audience
Mar 14 2022,negative,absolute convulted garbage led nowhere beginning with a ridiculous revival of an old enemy and finishing with an utter mess of a nonsense ending no explanation or proper character development just exposition and deadpan concise rubbish
Mar 13 2022,negative,an underwhelming end to the skywalker saga palpatines return did not make sense
Mar 13 2022,negative,the worst episode of the entire star wars franchise the cast is ridiculous silly and the storytelling can just be considered as weak why is disney destroying the complete story and the origin characters
Mar 7 2022,negative,completely irrelevant and incoherent as a movie even worse as the finish of star wars bad at every level except visually  its great there a sad ending for a beloved franchise i really hope that someone one day says the sequel trilogy was some nightmare we are making it anew
Mar 6 2022,positive,star wars 9 is ridicously fun but if j j abrams directed the last movie this would have been the best star wars movie ever
Mar 3 2022,positive,the rise of skywalker offers a satisfying conclusion to the sequel trilogy and its main characters while giving us some memorable and nostalgic moments however outside of that tros lacks the pacing writing and cohesive story in order for it to be put on the same pedestal as other star wars films
Mar 1 2022,negative,it truly bums me out to see how much people favored this movie over the last jedi and are willing to accept what felt to me like some of the laziest and sloppiest writing i have ever seen especially for star wars there are so many infuriating moments that are clear attempts to appease fans who were not happy with the last jedi that the whole movie feels like it doesnt make sense in the trilogy or the saga the pinnacle of this laziness was somehow palpatine retuned we are not given what the message that went across the galaxy unless you happened to play fortnite before the release in theaters overall it felt shallow lazy and like it was trying to spoonfeed me with nostalgia and condescending simplicity
Feb 25 2022,negative,if it were any other movie it would probably be a two or twoandahalf star rating  but this was star wars and i can say it was my least favorite in the entire series  the special effects were great excellent actors and some good action sequences  it was just so nonsensical  theres been loads of criticism hurled at the prequels over the years but all of them are better than this movie  very very disappointed  after such a great start to the sequel series with force awakens too
Feb 24 2022,neutral,honestly it could have been a better way to end the saga properly the screenplay has huge issues not to mention the lack of originality and imagination to create an intriguing plot despite this it has potential as far as special effects are concerned cinematography and sound are both good but honestly not that much as its predecessor 2017 a good beginning that unfortunately drops down to a complete collapse at the end final score 5510
Feb 24 2022,positive,the cast is very well done but the film gets lost in nonsense the settings are really beautiful worthy of the previous films the appearance of the emperor amazed me but at the same time it seemed to me a very recycled idea a film still appreciated
Feb 23 2022,negative,jar jar abrams did about as good as he could have hoped to  he only had one movie to basically tell the entire story since ruin johnson trashed the entire sequel in the third move  it would have been better to declare a 4th movie and pretend ruins story never happened leah training rey and palpatines return  oof  this this was a dog
Feb 23 2022,negative,this was a huge mess of a movie that didnt know how to recover from the last jedi if you dont wear a brace you may break your neck trying to keep up with the pacing none of the plot points make sense and the whole movie is cringy
Feb 23 2022,positive,star wars the rise of skywalker wins the award for best opening scene in any star wars film a movie with wonderful design great choreography nicest cinematography stunning costuming and an amazing score so where could the film go from such a great opening does it go up from there or does it fail and falter throughout the rest of the film  me being an avid star wars fan the return of the emperor was a great surprise but it leaves so many questions one being why what purpose did this serve to the new trilogy could it have been avoided couldnt we have brought in a new villain once you get past the strange and horrific return of the notorious emperor palpatine the film is really special there are so many stand out aspects of this film that separate it from the others since im a sucker for cinematography and colors i have to say that this is the best cinematography ive seen in any star wars film   this movie is pure nostalgia it brings back old characters and memories that we love or hate possibly the first time seeing lando since the original trilogy is surprising and extremely exciting i remember seeing this in theaters on release night and man did the audience go wild there are many times during tros where tears will fill your eyes as youre overcome by the emotion and the sheer depth of whats in front of you   something i find super intriguing about this one in specific is how it really dives into kylo and reys force relationship and how they can see each other touch each other feel surroundings etc without actually being there it explores the connection they have and while it leaves a lot up to speculation its still really cool since we havent seen anything like it in past films   and oh my gosh the lightsaber battle between rey and kylo when theyre on the death star the sound design the animation the choreography the timing of everything its so well done i am a sucker for the throne room fight but this is a close second its truly amazing to watch and to hear like how do you not see kylo ren and just gasp at how awesome he is the way he holds his lightsaber upside down or the way he walks through a wave hes a really cool villain and this movie did a terrific job actually showing him off in ways the 2 prior to tros didnt  the third act of star wars the rise of skywalker is what really made this film so enjoyable its non stop action filled with tears laughter awestruck staring and so many different emotions and how does one not tear up at but theres more of us poe theres more of us  tears every single time   well in my personal opinion this movie did not fail as it went on i do believe that the second act was a little bit boring but thats almost impossible to avoid when your opening scene is as crazy as this one and the entire third act is entertaining as ever the story falters a little bit but why focus on the minor details just sit back and enjoy the scale of whats unfolding before your eyes whats not to like  i could pick apart every single moment of this film and say what i love and what i hate about it like honestly this review could be longer than the movie script and i would still have more to say i believe this is one of the most wrongly hated episodes of the star wars saga as this one brings so much to the table you just have to give it a chance and really try to enjoy it because honestly its great
Feb 22 2022,neutral,bad film but most of the fault is because rian johnson in ep8 did a mess and forced jj abrams to close a trilogy very fast and with a lore and a lot of characters broken and left distorced could have been very good i personally hated the idea of the return of palpatine so boring and unoriginal
Feb 22 2022,negative,all the mistakes made in the last jedi made a successful resolution impossible for this movie  however it invents a whole new round of mistakes and implausible plot contrivances a waste of time and money
Feb 21 2022,negative,i went to the cinema hoping for a satisfactory finale to the star wars saga which would reverse the rot that had set in since disney took over the franchise  it didnt take long for my tentative expectations to be dashed and then completely destroyed as i watched star wars be replaced with boring nonsensical corporate junk this movie is the epitome of everything that is wrong with hollywood at the moment everyone involved with writing and producing this movie should be sacked and disney should start again at the end of episode vi or sell the franchise to a company who can produce movies with genuine creativity depth and respect
Feb 21 2022,negative,an abysmal end to an abysmal trilogy void of understanding or nuance of what came before jj abrams cobbled together a story because he had to and because the last jedi did nearly irreparable damage to the franchise  hopefully this movie and trilogy can be forgotten soon
Feb 19 2022,negative,dire end to the saga a mess from start to finish and dont start me on resurrection of the emperor
Feb 18 2022,negative,this movie spends two and a half hours telling the audience whats going on without adding any weight to anything its a mess and its an awful end to the skywalker saga
Feb 18 2022,negative,wow this was a pretty disappointing story they need to remake this in a couple years and forget about it like the first several hulk movies
Feb 17 2022,neutral,meh its better than the last jedi but nothing more
Feb 12 2022,positive,great when im watching it disappointing when i thinking about it after
Feb 12 2022,negative,thats not star wars thats disney a waste of lifetime and rey was is and never will be a skywalker
Feb 10 2022,positive,this film is ok the plot doesnt have sense hux kill billions of people and now you say hkm is a spy and the end is terrible the death of kylo was unnecessary
Feb 9 2022,negative,this film and this trilogy in general were so bad that i cannot in good conscience consider them cannon kathleen kennedy rian johnson and jj abrams should feel very bad for their abysmal performance they had no coherent vision for this trilogy other than to destroy anything linked to the prequel trilogy they were so bad that even mark hamil and george lucas did not like them also wokeism ruins everything
Feb 8 2022,positive,everything that was going wrong about reys origin story in the last jedi was fixed in this beautiful redemption arc for ben solo the only people complaining are the ones who do not appreciate change from the set ways of ivvvi and the critics because just look at the audience rating   the story of leia and han and their lost child is perhaps my favourite of all maybe because i related more to ben than i did to anakin not that hes not the greatest above all the simplistic storytelling of yet another rebellion built on hope and that hope breaking through a heart frozen over is why i came out of the cinema in tears  star wars isnt only lightsabers star fighters  and grunts the reason why its so unique from other outer space scifi is the inclusion of heartfelt bonds   and whats more heartbreaking than the story of a little lost boy throwing tantrums with a cracked kyber crystal growing into a simple good boy sweater and learning to let the light in
Feb 8 2022,negative,the star wars universe was once a unique and artistic explosion now gentrified to generic money making dribble
Feb 8 2022,negative,how this movies audience score is not only better than the last jedi but also fresh at 86 is the most backwards thing ive ever seen this is easily the worst entry in a franchise as big as star wars as i have ever seen its so noncomittal so lazy so downright stupid that i cant even put to words how this actually ruined all the good that came before it the only redeeming quality of this movie is ben solo adam driver does a great job with what hes been given and luckily it was enough to keep me mildly invested in the story man i wish this werent such a terrible conclusion to such a beloved franchise shouldve had duel of the fates instead at least that one sounds like it took some risks and didnt spend half the movie trying to retcon what happened in the last jedi the more i think about the movie and the more actual good star wars projects that release the more my disdain for this movie rears its ugly head i hate this i hate it here
Feb 5 2022,negative,a truly terrible story it looks nice though
Feb 4 2022,positive,i was relieved this movie had less of the adolescent temper tantrums seen in the previous one the vfx was fun as usual and visually appealing though i did wish there was a bit more depth i kept wishing for a bit more character development and as a star wars fan of course even more epic use of the force i still love the 3 classics the most and i guess those movies really set a high bar that most of these newer sw films have not quite matched
Feb 2 2022,negative,if you want to watch a movie where jj abrams retcons the last jedi and make anakin skywalkers entire character journey through the prequels and original trilogy feel like a waste of time this is the movie for you the last jedi might not have been great but it allowed the last movie of the sequels to be something different in the end what we got was an extremely bland darth vader story a terrible copy of avengers endgame climax moment and no matter what anyone says basically 0 character development this final film personified the sequel trilogies whole idea of if you want to understand and like the character journey go buy the extra disney stuff at the end of the day rise of skywalker fails as a star wars in a trilogy which fails as a star wars trilogy i only feel sorry for the actors in this movie who ended up with 1 dimensional characters to play last of all sorry rian johnson
Feb 1 2022,positive,absolutely loved this movie watched it 9 times in the cinema and would definitely do it again thats star wars to me daisy ridley is a true gift to this world
Jan 30 2022,positive,i liked it satisfying ending great as always kylo ren very good action and cinematography
Jan 29 2022,negative,i felt nothing coming out of the theatre except for utter frustration regardless of your opinions on the last jedi its its sequel and as such should pick up what was set up in the previous installment of the saga you cant just ignore and retcon what you dont like it simply does not work like that this undid everything the last jedi had risked it all to accomplish making that movie worse retroactively and forced recycled plots and characters down our throats in a cheap attempt at feeling familiar but heyvisual effects were great ill get some pretty screenshots for my computer desktop i guess
Jan 29 2022,negative,what was supposed to be the grand finale of a trilogy of trilogies turned out to be arguably the worst star wars movie in terms of plot and message giving it a full star because the baggage from 7  8 especially 8 and the death of carrie fisher really made it very difficult to tell a good story and tie things up while at it
Jan 28 2022,positive,an epic ending for the star wars saga especially for the final batlte although it isnt perfect i enjoyed it
Jan 28 2022,neutral,really disappointing conclusion to the sequel trilogy bringing back palpatine was a big mistake
Jan 28 2022,positive,honestly i can understand the hate on this one it surely has its flaws but it does bring together amazing vfx and a somewhat coherent story the survival of palpatine has been legends lore forever and is now introduced into official canon  give it a watch and relax it can be very good if you let it
Jan 28 2022,negative,i went into this in the theaters with fairly low expectations but remember it failing to meet even those a couple of years later i decided to give it another shot wondering if maybe i had been too hard on it unfortunately i liked it even less this time while there are some moments of artistry in rise of skywalker these good bits are so heavily undercut by the films persistent failings that they lose what allure they might otherwise hold  the plot of the film makes no sense its a treasure hunt to find the emperors hiding place but the steps are incredibly contrived and leave me with a thousand questions everything seems haphazard and poorly thought out the writers made sure they put in a few set ups for later events but these set ups feel contrived themselves and only after the pay off did i understand why they were even in the movie   i also found the decision to bring back palpatine to be an extremely weak idea if youre going to crib ideas from the old comics not necessarily a bad idea kotor ii did it well why would you take them from dark empire of all things surely there must have been less stupid ideas to repurpose even worse start of spoilers i really hated their decision to make rey the granddaughter of palpatine it just feels lazy and lacking in creativity there have been tons of heroes in star wars who dont descend from some powerful bloodline having her the daughter of nobodies was a great way to send the message that anyone can be a hero making her a palpatine just felt like a cheap gimmick to introduce a theme of generational conflict into reys life which we didnt need since we already had that with kylo ren   i was also disappointed that they chose to have ben die bad guy turns good and sacrifices himself isnt a terrible trope but its kind of bare minimum for a redemption arc im sure a good writer could have done something more interesting if any effort had been put into the story it would have been so much more interesting if ben had to live with his history of mass murder and work to atone for it instead he gets off easy one good act and then oblivion boring    finally i thought it was a very bad look to mostly cut rose out of the movie in her final conscious scene in the last jedi she declares her love for finn then in rise of skywalker they just write her out of most of the movie and have finn seemingly end up with some random character they introduce in this movie who has no bearing on the plot end of spoilers what is this supposed to say that you cant have an interracial relationship in star wars or that disney is caving to the backlash by some fans against rose neither is a good look as it makes it seem like disney is either antimiscegenation or is siding with the mob that launched racist and sexist attacks against kelly marie tran   overall rise of skywalker was just a boring mess i know the other films have plenty of plot holes and contrivances too but not on this level not even close and i certainly wasnt so bored while watching them as to have time to analyze how contrived and disjointed everything was while i didnt think the prequels were good movies i would be more inclined to watch those again than rise of skywalker what an embarrassing end to the series
Jan 25 2022,negative,absolutely incompetent the only amusing thing about this film is that it is basically a middle finger to rian johnson  what an absolute disastrous way to end a trilogy for a beloved franchise that means so much to so many people kathleen kennedys management of the star wars ip is proof that her rise to position was on the shoulders of better people and has no ability to help produce a coherent series or property that people want to watch for entertainment  here is hope to her quietly being sidelined to make room for more competent people with a love for the property and are more interested in telling a story than a message
Jan 24 2022,neutral,it gets very boring and most of the ideas this movie has are already ending before we get to the second half
Jan 23 2022,positive,pretty good finale to the saga
Jan 21 2022,positive,this was pretty good i was not a fan of the trilogy about anakin but these about rey are actually good this was a great end to the star wars saga and i like it not the best but ok
Jan 21 2022,negative,it was a shit movie but i cant really blame jj abrams rian johnson left him nothing to work with
Jan 19 2022,negative,i love star wars movies and that was drivel even worse than the prequels its the only star wars movie i could not bring myself to watch a second time
Jan 19 2022,negative,horrible movie the dilute the mystic feel of the force by playing who has my lightsaber tag no real character development characters are not really interesting no real storytried to bring the big guns out with the emperor but failed the whole film is boring out of place and real mess
Jan 19 2022,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever seen in my life what did disney do with our beloved saga i didnt like te prequels but next to this ones they are a work of art
Jan 19 2022,positive,if star wars is your favorite restaurant this movie is the burger not a daring choice not going to win any james beard awards but its satisfying fun and hearty there are a lot of maguffins a few plotholes and some things that dont work but so much of it does work theres a ton of heart and emotion and strong performances and the movie is fun theres a bit too many daggers and talismans and wayfinders just like what you see in marvel with a magic box or a universe glove or a timetraveling duracell battery you can poke a hole in any of this if thats your goal avoid the toxic hyperbolic opinions and enjoy this trilogy for what it is a good time all these reviews saying this or that killed the franchise lol this trilogy made 45 billion dollars go to disney watch the mandalorian have fun star wars is fun 
Jan 18 2022,negative,well made and acted but a huge letdown they needed a game plan for these 3 films when they started have jj and rian working together from the beginning it would have made it all cohesive
Jan 18 2022,negative,awful writing does a disservice to the movies that came before this whole trilogy may as well not exist but this movie is by far the worst of the 3 i would much rather they stuck with the plot setup by last jedi it looks good has decent action but none of the other characters feel useful its the rey show again kylo has a revelation and never says another word the entire movie what a waste
Jan 17 2022,positive,no matter what people say even if the overall story is a confused mess that lacks some interest the rise of skywalker still has the action and amazement we know and love from star wars and for that its a pretty decent watch
Jan 17 2022,negative,for anyone who was excited about the fact that emperor was being brought back for this film they must have been pretty disappointed to realize it was just a cheap and meaningless gesture to sell more movie tickets  the entire sequel trilogy should have followed the popular shadows of the empire book series from the 1990s instead of this trash  jj abrams should go back to making crappy horror films
Jan 17 2022,negative,this is the worst star wars movie they were lazy with the villain and did not deliver for star wars fans
Jan 16 2022,positive,as usual with these newer movies visually stunning but lacking in compelling storytelling while nowhere near as good as star wars best films ros is still a decent ending to the skywalker saga despite what some might say this is still better than the prequels
Jan 16 2022,positive,i understand the critics and the distaste for the film but i enjoyed this film i felt satisfied with how the trilogy was ended
Jan 14 2022,negative,spoilers ahead in my opinion the worst sequel it basically completely destroyed the story that had been building up and palpatine just came out of the blue
Jan 14 2022,positive,imagine asking a space monk like luke to be more violent tell me you dont understand star wars canon without telling me
Jan 14 2022,negative,terribly written with so much laziness in the script the writers use convenience too much to attempt to stretch out the movie to the 2hour mark rey is such a terrible lead in this movie the ending where she claims to be a skywalker is horrible as there is zero explanation as to why she claims that and lastly the fan service there is so much terrible fan service in this movie that is meant to get the fans engaged and hyped but it all backfires
Jan 12 2022,positive,this movie is awesome i loved this movie so much i hate star wars but when i went to go see this movie with my mother my hate for star wars ended and i became a star wars fan
Jan 6 2022,negative,genuinely insulting cash grab that cant even do fan service right the cast is good but theyre given nothing whatsoever to work with   on a scale 1100 this film is a 0
Jan 5 2022,positive,the only thing i really dig about this movie is the visual effects thats the only thing i was impressed about the plot line is too farfetched and just not entertaining enough i know the world is about to be taken over by the dark side but suddenly spoilers kylo ren steps over to the light side and helps rey to defeat the emporer  just not the way i would choose to end the skywalker saga but nevertheless i would recommend it because of the amazing visual effects i am more pleased by the series nowadays like the mandalorian or the book of boba fett
Jan 4 2022,positive,it has stupid moments but its overall good though all of the shitty elements only happened because toxic fans who cyberbullied the creators online
Jan 3 2022,negative,probably the worst of all star wars movies
Jan 2 2022,negative,worst movie in the franchise
Dec 31 2021,negative,story sucks character development sucks movie sucks they fly now
Dec 31 2021,positive,an acceptable closing  not much to work with after the last jedi so this is about as good as can be expected without a complete doover
Dec 31 2021,negative,a poor attempt at a star wars movie
Dec 31 2021,negative,cool video gameor was it a movie i couldnt tell mindless junk without any of the soul of what made star warsstar wars
Dec 30 2021,positive,while a bit too rushed and predictable its overall a fun and satisfying finale to the skywalker saga
Dec 29 2021,positive,was better than the last jedi but not a bit improvement
Dec 29 2021,negative,that is not star wars  more like expensive fanfiction
Dec 29 2021,negative,terrible end to a terrible trilogy
Dec 29 2021,negative,one star is better than the last jedi 12 star  but seriously they gave it their best shot to ruin the franchise
Dec 28 2021,neutral,it was a decent movie the movie was not a good ending to the skywalker saga
Dec 28 2021,negative,no just no dont like this one 
Dec 28 2021,neutral,there are some things disney should not be part of this is one example they are not one with the force
Dec 28 2021,negative,too little too late too rushed too confusing too unbelievable  oh and to quote han from the first of the disney trilogy thats not how the force works its not magic you cant just do anything then say a wizard did it
Dec 27 2021,negative,this is a sad demise of a franshise
Dec 26 2021,negative,thex never had a plan for that shit
Dec 26 2021,negative,i was rating last jedi as the worst star wars movie but than ive seen this one and for sure this one is the worst starwars movie nice cgi pretty good surround mix visually good as expected with empty characters nonsense empty talks unexplained baseless storyline which they couldnt explain in 7 hours trilogy a character that can do everything easily without training or knowledge new popped out jedi abilities etc and all other bs makes you watch this one only once
Dec 26 2021,positive,definitely not the worst certainly not the best but star wars 9 packs enough of everything and like avengers endgame it does whatever it takes to conclude a much beloved saga and serve as a good summer blockbuster extravaganza
Dec 25 2021,neutral,this movie tried its hardest to make up for the previous the last jedi did it fail not really i mean it wasnt worse  it tried to fix things but ended up making it messier to be honest short of everyone waking up and pretending that the previous movie was a dream there wasnt much they could do to fix this one  it did get back on track and follow the normal starwars formula but when you have to spend half you movie trying to make up for the previous one then it was always going to fail  spoiler also trying to rely on a previously killed villain like the emperor to be the main bad person again doesnt sit right it cheapens the original and prequel trilogy storylines not to mention retcons to point of nonsense  overall it tried to clean up a monumental mess and it just smeared it around a bit i wouldnt recommend anyone watching the last jedi so by that logic i wouldnt recommend anyone watch this one either  unless you already did in which case probably watch this one definitely watch the mandolorian
Dec 23 2021,negative,its better than tlj but its just not a good star wars movie
Dec 23 2021,negative,if youre born 1979 upwards just skip this film the set pieces are boring because the main characters are so wooden and without heart trying to re live the big liners from the original this is crate material
Dec 22 2021,negative,with all the bad word of mouth reviews from friends i waited for a disney trial to finally watch this and make my own mind up  my verdict is disney corporate political meddling has removed every ounce of entertainment from this installment terribly dull script wooden acting and quite frankly watching two guys following rey around like fathomless lap dogs was just embarrassing the force has left this franchise at light speed and i will not be returning anytime soon its understandable therefore that disney has indefinitely shelved the next installment in the hope we will have forgotten what a mess they have made  now on to the rottentomatoes user ratings which have now become so laughably unreliable in favour of studios you are best just asking a friend these days so you are not disappointed and out of pocket pretty much every new studio release from disney now has a 7080 user rating and many of them are well below average on the surface the rise of skywalker has a higher user rating than the prior the force awakens which is just absurd yet the critics rating are polar opposites 52 for rise of skywalker vs 93 for force awakens at the time of writing definitely something very fishy is going on with the rise of skywalker user ratings and indeed all of disney movie user ratings  if in doubt ask a friend or wait for a disney trial
Dec 22 2021,positive,critics dont know what they are talking about this is a great movie
Dec 20 2021,negative,just really bad completely destroyed the conclusion to the original trilogy bringing back darth sidious made darth vaders sacrifice completely pointless another massive fleet of ships that came out of nowhere
Dec 19 2021,positive,critics review show how little they know about star wars compared to the fans the fact last jedi is 91 is ridiculous  this film aint great but it sure isnt last jedi
Dec 19 2021,negative,panicked attempt at finishing all the storylines while also retconning almost all of episode 8 entirely while also trying to engage fans with tons and tons of weird and illogical fanfiction
Dec 18 2021,neutral,made no sense in the context of the star wars universe
Dec 17 2021,negative,the movie has several callbacks and fun cameos to previous star wars films sprinkled throughout however i think that it suffers from a plot that is more focused on mcguffins than character choices and development it attempts to introduce new characters into the story but they only take away from screen time that would have helped build up already established characters the third act of this film tries to deliver a fan servicing climax however it does not feel deserved because of the buildup to that moment and the stakes are not entirely felt i was not emotionally invested in what happened most of all i thought that the reintroduction of the main antagonist was entirely sudden and out of place with the direction that the trilogy had been moving in perhaps despite the mixed reception of the last jedi this film would have felt like more of a conclusion to a trilogy if it had worked on building on and improving elements from the second film this being said i think that out of the three sequel films this one did the best job of honoring legacy characters and is sure to satisfy many star wars fans
Dec 14 2021,positive,a good enough ending for the skywalker saga it could have been better but not terrible
Dec 13 2021,positive,although it was better than the last jedi the rise of skywalker opened and left quite a few plot holes that seem like they may not ever get resolved seeing as the trilogy ended along with the sudden return of emperor palpatine after all this time with a very lackluster explanation this movie left a lot more to be desired from fans and with all the open plot holes that were created left some wondering if well ever get them resolved various mixed opinions on how this trilogy ended
Dec 10 2021,negative,really great disney took this awesome story and made trash out of it id rather watch lucas episode 2 lol
Dec 10 2021,negative,i believed that ep 8 was the worst movie in the skywalker saga until i rewatched ep 9 a couple of times the complete  utter disregard for canon  the star wars universe well galaxy really is on full display in this atrocity the issues in this installment know no bounds
Dec 6 2021,negative,this film is offensively bad the promise and potential of tfa has been hideously squandered more and more as this trilogy has gone on this film the final nail in the coffin disrespects the source material with possibly the worst writing ive ever seen in a film of this scale and budget it is irredeemably bad it is fraught with contrivances contradictions senselessness and unearned payoffs disney cannibalized and surgically disavowed some of the most beloved fictional characters in cinema history this is worse than tlj at least tlj was internally consistent despite the bathos and the character assassination of luke skywalker and infantile political grandstanding tros is utterly forgettable even though the cast was comprised of strong actors and talented filmmakers they couldnt save this writing from itself
Dec 6 2021,negative,example of poor story telling forced story with next to no character development extreme forcefeeding of political correctness lack of any of the depth of the original star wars that has been plaguing all of the disneymade star wars
Dec 5 2021,negative,objectively bad awful script nonsensical plot  characters with little to no depth and multiple attempts to solicit emotion while removing all stakes see chewbacca and c3po death   a prime example of what happens when a movie is created by a corporate committee rather than passion for a good story   you cant just slap star wars on a movie to make it good i feel bad for the actors who had to work so hard with such crap material
Dec 5 2021,negative,very disappointing for the finale of the trilogy of the sequel series and seems to negate the chosen one storyline of the prequeloriginal trilogy
Dec 1 2021,negative,such a disservice to the skywalker saga completely negates the character arc of anakin skywalker his rise his fall and his ultimate redemption by killing palpatine and bringing balance the sequels destroyed the developed characters of the original trilogy such as luke and leia and replaced it with underdeveloped shallow characters like rey and finn there was a way to do this and destroying everything we loved about star wars was not the route
Dec 1 2021,neutral,had to watch it witch my brother the making is really great but otherwise its just not my thing really
Nov 30 2021,positive,all of the characters youve come to know and to love and a few new additions  i thought it was well handled in bringing back some of the characters from the star wars movies of the 70s  i was caught up in the excitement of the battles the ongoing fight of dark and light so the movie moved quickly for me  i really enjoyed the ending it was a fitting end to the series
Nov 28 2021,neutral,easily the worst of the bunch including 2 of the prequels what were they thinking leave it to jj abrams to fly both star wars and star trek into the ground
Nov 27 2021,negative,mary sue is all of your favourite jedi  so you must love her
Nov 26 2021,negative,this movie is a huge pile of  it is nostalgia bait bring old characters and trying to have its endgame moment and it failed it makes up things at it goes and i honestly think that the last jedi is a bit better just a bit anyways please dont watch this movie if you dont want star wars to be ruined for you just stick to the original trilogy
Nov 26 2021,positive,it was good but not great endgame was a better conclusion than the rise of skywalker but the rise of skywalker is still a decent start wars flick
Nov 25 2021,negative,i wish we could have seen the middle entry of the trilogy abrams opened with episode vii as it stands while this movie does what it can to return to form its nostalgic trip down memory lane rings hollow without context unearned heroism meets unearned villainy meets unearned redemption in this slapdash first second and third installment in a hasty fourth star wars trilogy after the last jedi decided to deny any intriguing answers to the questions posed by its predecessor little can be said about this film except that it just isnt very good to no fault of its own had the last jedi honored any of what came before this finale could have been so much more than the hasty inarticulate mess it turned out to be 
Nov 23 2021,positive,this is a milquetoast film in the saga but its effects are superior  there is no possible way this movie could have met expectations but despite that has a great cast
Nov 23 2021,negative,disney sucked the soul out of star wars
Nov 23 2021,negative,i fell asleep to the most spectacular finale to the greatest franchise of all timeoh im sorry formally greatest franchise the payoff and conclusion was pretty horrific daisy has been wasted ever since the force awakens and its too bad if we had film makers who actually listened to the fans this could have been great shame
Nov 23 2021,positive,im a star wars nerd at heart so i really loved this movie and imax was amazing
Nov 22 2021,negative,its bad like really bad
Nov 22 2021,positive,rating 810 88100  i dont care what people or critics say this is the best star wars film to me and it should be looked upon as the 3rd or 4th best by overall consensus  theres some problems but eh this film is what solidified this saga for me at first the highest i rated one of the films was a 76 for empire strikes back granted i was torn about my ratings from the get go but this film is what really awakened my true feelings  empire went from a 76 to a 79 and then after this film an 87 this film barely beating it at an 8810   i mean i know it might change later just like it has been but for now i feel confident enough about my ratings and reviews which is a first ever since i started this saga   the star wars saga went from a good franchise to being one of my fav universesfranchises in film history  it gripped the force around me and now i love it and the force is with me this is the way
Nov 21 2021,negative,this movie is just one miguffin after another that totally undermines the original star wars trilogy by bringing the emperor back to life also the killing off and reviving other characters lowers the stakes
Nov 21 2021,negative,nah they need to start this over make it all a weird force fever dream that rey or luke had as a crappy potential future and do everything to make it not happen
Nov 21 2021,negative,the only good part of this movie was not the ending but when it ended
Nov 20 2021,negative,a real nadir for the star wars franchise for older fans like myself this film and trilogy has basically killed off star wars for me and for many others absolutely awful the worst of the three films and that is saying something
Nov 19 2021,negative,its hard to even encapsulate my thoughts in words because im not even sure what i witnessed like watching a person in a wheelchair topple down a flight of stairs i want to do anything to help and yet i can only sit back and watch aghast knowing that theres only suffering left   this is immensely sad it becomes comedic in a deeply mournful way it feels impossible to make a mockery of something with such a powerful legacy such as star wars but rise of skywalker somehow exceeded all hopelessly low expectations to be an absolute travesty of filmmaking   ive heard that this was an attempt to reset from the mistakes made in the last jedi and yet the entire runtime of the film is filled with more mistakes nothing of which resolves or absolves the previous poor filmmaking and all which only makes the situation worse than it already was its as if abrams gave up before he began attempting to juggle far more than he knew he could dumping his entire juggling act on the floor shrugging and walking away even though he was paid to entertain  the first part of this film is exhausting the nonsense jumpcutting from scene to scene at quite literally lightspeed is so disorienting it was so hard to wrap my mind about even what the general plot or objectives were as it bounced between conversation and action spectacle only when lando calrissian makes an obligatory cameo that i was somehow drawn out of my drunken stupor and realized that i was actually watching a beloved series near and dear to my heart   and then i saw that series so bastardized that it was hard not to sit back and mock the entire thing jedi ghosts have super powers rey also has healing superpowers wowee is that palpatine whats he doing there look at all those sith in coliseums why are they there who knows   its just nonsense to think of all the controversy there was when the new trilogy was originally debuting and the entire star wars canon had to be reset just to make it make sense knowing this is where it all ended up its almost a joke that the lore needed to be reconstituted at all this series stomps on everything you love and acts happy about it and youre meant to feel joyful that everything you love has been destroyed truly and completely youre meant to like this  this is most certainly one of the worst films i have seen in a very long time my disappointment is immense
Nov 19 2021,positive,good final battle of one side spaceships and the other side lightsaber is very boring and without emotion rey is the worst character of the saga
Nov 18 2021,positive,was really good wish things would have ended differently
Nov 17 2021,negative,no clue how you enjoy this movie as a star wars fan or a movie fan lazy plot holes ruined star wars content pre2016 just awful ending so many terrible decisions i could go on forever but not wasting my time mauler sums it up pretty well on yt
Nov 16 2021,negative,this was a rough movie to watch  amazing and shocking that so much money and time was spent and this is what came out  genuinely feel bad for the actors who are attached to this garbage  it probably made a lot of money and i am sure there are fans of this but for me it was truly terrible  i dont understand how the star wars cartoon  video game stuff can tell a better story than a big production movie  i fell asleep a couple times and just couldnt even focus on this because it was such a mess of a movie  best thing about this movie was hearing my nephew who also fell asleep during the movie say he woke up to the part with the fake darth vader  that was funny
Nov 15 2021,negative,its the counterpart for the last jedi here we have an amazing star wars film but an awful movie in general
Nov 15 2021,negative,after waiting almost 2 years to watch the film i was not disappointed it was as horrible as i had expected this film continues the lack of character and plot development from the first two disney sequel trilogy films   the only things i enjoyed in the film were john williams musical score and seeing lando han and luke and the opening crawl seeing leia was bittersweet since she died before the completion of the film
Nov 15 2021,positive,the worst moment in star wars history somehow palpatine returned  what a cringe   while you trailer trashies were bashing the last jedi for trying to be different and for showing some racehorses being beaten and calling it political they responded with this mess for you thanks boomers somehow palapatine returned  give me a break the last jedi is citizen kane compared to this honestly  the ending scene isnt that bad but the rest is a real shame and a mess had you people stopped complaining this movie would have been alot better
Nov 15 2021,negative,absolutely abismal jumps here and there between decent ideas connecting them with such poor and pointless choices that looks like a 10yearold was calling the shots at disney
Nov 14 2021,negative,literally no homage to any of the content before 2016 what a lack of respect towards george lucas you can have the budget the good actors and still drop the ball palpatine got the average villain simple overpower harry potter walk down on voldemort treatment no epic memorable light saber scenes lukes one awesome hallway scene in the mandalorian series is better than any scene in the entire recent trilogy including way better than anything disney did with luke in the last 2 films lets use a montage of all the old actors and and cast or a montage of old clips a thank you george lucas nothing
Nov 10 2021,positive,an amazing end to the saga with an epic climax and great character development
Nov 10 2021,negative,this just continued the fact that disney destroyed star wars  wasnt much of a story and did nothing with the characters  and sorry but rey was not a good character especially for the majority of the audience
Nov 9 2021,negative,just as we thought it couldnt get any worse after a great deal of suffering from watching the last jedi jj has to come back and try to fix this trilogy an impossible task id say and id be correct this movie is a mess with major plotholes and it seems like it satisfied the fans i dont get that maybe the positive reaction stems from the aftershock of having to watch rian johnsons attempt at butchering the whole franchise but this movie seriously lacks the star wars charm which george lucas gave us with his film the reason why the force awakens is held higher than the two later instalments into this sequel trilogy is because that movie has the star wars charm and the nostalgic feeling and hype around watching star wars again got to us all there is serious potential wasted in this sequel trilogy jj played it safe rian ruined everything and this is the attempted cleanup this is a sad attempt disney maybe you should try to bring in a george lucas or a dave filoni in a supervising role or something both of them know how to handle this franchise george seems to be more than happy to help and dave filoni is already your employee disney you failed yet again and yet again you held all the right cards but chose to play the wrong ones instead
Nov 9 2021,positive,the end story did not work but it was a well done movie and i enjoyed watching it the visuals and action were great
Nov 9 2021,positive,i love all the star wars films and this is my favorite
Nov 9 2021,negative,watched it high and it was great the sounds and colors were entertaining and pretty to look at  watched it sober and i wanna cry lazy writing and a dumb story somehow palpatine returned
Nov 8 2021,negative,wasnt horrible but very far from good     shouldve done more in regards to anakins character
Nov 8 2021,negative,star wars  star boredom its now for kids i never did crack a smile at any of the jokes it has now evolved into a character rediculous movie thus its two star rating
Nov 7 2021,negative,rise of skywalker had very lazy and weak writing if you are a star wars fan you had to have noticed how horrible the world building was the visuals were amazing but in this day and age that is a given with a high budget movie rey was overpowered the music was good but never felt right for the moment and the reylo kiss felt like it had almost no build up star wars has so much potential it is a shame it was all wasted on this
Nov 7 2021,positive,given how 8 ruined the trilogy this movie tied it up amazingly well hope they redo 79 some day though to fix the dozens of plot mistakes
Nov 7 2021,negative,the worst of the disney star wars films and thats saying something
Nov 7 2021,negative,it was like watching somebody else play a computer game as they directed the character from zone c to zone b to pick up the key to open the door in zone a the only difference being that as this was a film i knew i was never going to get a turn and that sucked hard
Nov 6 2021,negative,as every star wars fan knows it was the vain attempt to save the sequel trilogy from the desecration affected on it by the last jedi and to some extent by the much better the force awakens visually stunning of course convoluted and terrible plot
Nov 6 2021,negative,so dispointed the franchises ened this way
Nov 6 2021,negative,the conclusion of this trilogy is very messy and basically sets up its own story and concludes it without much context its almost as if they were trying to redo the whole trilogy in this one movie rather than actually go off of what happened in the previous two films overall it makes it seem like disney just made the sequel trilogy with the intention to sell toys and make money rather than to actually add a meaningful story to the star wars saga
Nov 6 2021,positive,a fun throwback to the serials that inspired star wars not without its flaws but endeavours to conclude a saga 42 years in the making despite its predecessor cutting it off at the knees
Nov 4 2021,negative,the most disrespectful finale to the original star wars franchise imaginable
Nov 4 2021,negative,this movie honestly ruined everything post 2010 the characters are extremely inconsistent poor plot horrible battles overall a shit movie i cant emphasize how much i hate this movie
Nov 2 2021,negative,ive waited years to review it hoping my mind would change over time but im still just stunned that all of star wars wrapped up with this monstrosity
Nov 1 2021,positive,pretty much the same as all of the recent installments of star wars  enjoyable enough though not the seminal cinematic moments of old
Oct 29 2021,positive,i prefer original trilogy this movie try too hard they should not have killed han
Oct 29 2021,negative,jjs latest outing is all spectacle and no substance true he was given an unenviable task on the back of the bucket of puke that is the last jedi but the greatest failing in this movie is the lack of respect shown to the collective intelligence of the audience the star wars universe is not the marvel or transformers universe disney would do well to remember that
Oct 29 2021,positive,star wars the rise of skywalker is a good ending to the skywalker saga a lot of the film is good and even some of it is amazing but there are a couple of things that just didnt work for me the fan service is very strong the pacing is rushed in many places and the final battle does not feel earned but this film does feel like star wars concludes leias journey in a respectful way and concludes this saga not in pieces this film is definitely not the best but it is a blast that may leave you with a tiny sour taste with the ending
Oct 28 2021,negative,just hot garbage  having no attempt at plot character development or even fun the only thing going for this giant product placement of a movie was nostalgia yet they continue the trend from tfa and that other one with the purple haired admiral of ruining everything that made the old star wars movies watchable
Oct 27 2021,neutral,should have been split into 2 parts just a bad and slapped together retelling of dark empire
Oct 27 2021,positive,though not a perfect film it is better than the tlj and concludes the saga beautifully
Oct 26 2021,negative,i just cant waited until all the hype died down to actually watch it it is horrendous
Oct 26 2021,negative,on the bright side i dont care about this shit any more
Oct 23 2021,negative,ive found it unwatchable ive tried and failed 3 times to watch this movie without getting up or falling asleep and failed just another confusing hodgepodge of bits of a script thrown  together that makes no sense to the overall epic storyline and concepts that just come off as stupid with episode 7 being a revamp of episode 4 it definitely feels like the epic ended at 6 with return of the jedi
Oct 23 2021,negative,why did they bring back palpatine  no way this is canon so many plotholes its impossible to believe that force ghosts can interact with the real world and palpatine survived a nuclear explosion in space  i like a few things i feel a little better than holdo manoeuvres are said to be nearly impossible and the chewie got a medal which made me happy its always nice to see mark hamils face even if his character was stuck in a rusty blender and raped for some dollar but i like him  but this film is just jj taking a fat dump on tlj which rian johnson writing totally deserved but in the process neglecting his own film and just let it combust and explode like some sort of garbage firework  graphics were cool but i dont care
Oct 22 2021,negative,if you saw the last two movies this should come as no surprise  nothing disney and nothing jj abrams is ever going to be good
Oct 21 2021,negative,if you like cgi you will like this movie that is the only good thing about this movie
Oct 20 2021,negative,star wars died in the last movie this movie is a dead corpse rotting in disneyland
Oct 18 2021,negative,judged as an amalgamation of different departments doing their absolute best to try and fix the issues with the last jedi its hard not to feel bad for a lot of the people involved in this production and i feel compelled to commend them for all their hard work the performances music set design special effects costuming and so on all look sound and are pretty much universally goodtofantastic in this movie however  rise of skywalker is before it is anything else an embarrassment of a film so desperate to cash in on nostalgia that it never once takes a single risk with not just its own story but the franchise that this disaster of a trilogy was meant to reinvigorate nearly every single aspect of the plot from the most important beats down to the most mundane ones is an utter failure  i understand that many people felt burned by tlj i do even though im one of its defenders im well aware that it was going to be difficult to follow up as there was no way disney could or should have tried to make another anti star wars star wars film that said this wasnt the way to do it the end result is genuinely the worst time ive ever had watching anything star wars when i wasnt bored i was angry
Oct 18 2021,positive,a decent attempt to rescue the trilogy after its abominable predecessor  it was set up for failure so doing as much as it did to redeem the series deserves kudos  the movie itself is a bit rushed trying to please the fans by wrapping up most of the major plotlines and characters but no way around that for the last in a 9 movie series
Oct 16 2021,neutral,remember in the early 2000s when there were a bunch of amateur filmmakers making star wars fanfilms  you know stuff that absolutely was not cannon sometimes had pretty decent special effects and fight choreography but didnt really tell much of a coherent story or did things that dont really fit into the star wars universe but were entertaining enough to watch in their own little bubble   thats this movie  its a really high budget feature length star wars fanfilm  it has the lightsaber fights  it has the music  it has the sound effects and visuals  but its made by people who really dont know much about star wars and just want a flimsy excuse to film a few lightsaber fights and space battles  if you look at it in that light rather than the final crowning piece of the star wars saga its still a very very dumb movie but it can still be entertaining at times if youre imagining john daisy adam and oscar are just super fans making this cinematic fan fiction in their basement  its an absolutely terrible star wars movie  its a pretty okay star wars fan film
Oct 15 2021,negative,utter trash the worst movie of the entire franchise
Oct 11 2021,negative,the whole movie was a huge disappointment i may be done with new writers and star wars filoni is no better btw i said it
Oct 10 2021,negative,this is what happens when you dont have a plan and hire the guy who wrote batman v superman to cowrite your script
Oct 7 2021,positive,it was like watching school children playing starwars on a playground fighting over which character was the best and arguing over who could do what only with a giant cg budget  dumb but its heart was in the right place
Oct 5 2021,negative,competes with attack of the clones for the title of worst star wars movie
Oct 5 2021,neutral,unfortunately a majority of this movies run time is spent fixing the last jedis mistakes it is a definite improvement over that film but still leaves alot to be desired compared to the original and even prequel trilogies i admit it was pretty cool that they brought palpatine back but i can honestly say the best part about this movie is the fact that it is the end of disneys awful sequel trilogy
Oct 4 2021,negative,absolute nonsensical garbage i complained about the movie more than i watched it simply because of how stupid many things about it are
Oct 1 2021,negative,if you want to have a film that builds its whole existence on fan service plotholes and pretty pictures youve come to the right place also the movie has the wrong name  it was actually called star wars the retcon of fanservice  the one star for it because it has 23 cool scenes the rest is for the trash can  the first time i cry after my money after watching a star wars movie
Sep 27 2021,negative,this film has not aged well at all 2 years later its unwatchable i couldnt finish it for a second time i thought it may have been all the drama surrounding this at the time but no its worse than it was before i cant believe that they wasted it all
Sep 25 2021,positive,it was a good movie but not a good end to this trilogy couldve been so much more but still worth a watch if youre a star wars fan
Sep 25 2021,negative,one of the most shoddily written movies i have ever had the displeasure of watching
Sep 25 2021,negative,leagues better than the last jedi but still dumb this film is obviously just a cash grab and displays no heart george lucas is laughing all the way to the bank god bless you george you sweet sweet man
Sep 23 2021,positive,despite a great lack of creativity star wars rise of skywalker is an adventure with a big heart for fans 810
Sep 22 2021,negative,its fine on the surface but messy and chaotic within what should be a grand farewell feels way too rushed and underdeveloped not a god awful finish but even game of thrones knew how to wrap up better than this movie
Sep 18 2021,positive,it was everything i wanted and more long live the saga
Sep 15 2021,neutral,i like it its got that classic star wars vibe and you can simply absorb the adventures in the end of the saga its no good movie but as a star wars movie it delivers at least fine
Sep 14 2021,positive,it tried to be a face washing after the bad decisions on episode 8 but even the best direction couldnt do something understandable 610
Sep 13 2021,positive,i felt aawwesome in the theater
Sep 9 2021,negative,worse than the last jedi
Sep 6 2021,negative,not as bad as the last jedi and there are some well done set pieces but it is incoherent and full of holes its impossible to reach exogal without a sith wayfinder until every other ship in the galaxy arrives more hopelessly inept bad guys planet killing star destroyers but dont worry you only need to shoot at the big gun and they blow up build a super fleet but only have a single navigation beacon it goes on i suppose given the complete turkey that was tlj this trilogy was beyond saving but it was still hugely disappointing
Sep 5 2021,negative,jj abrams and kathleen kennedys final star wars abortion flaccid lifeless and only worth it for john williams final film score there is zero passion for anything in this it is pure godless disney product
Sep 5 2021,positive,it is a movie that is once again a controversial film but for me everything about this movie works the story the action the characters everything palpatines return although it definitely wasnt the plan since the beginning it worked for me perfectly it spoke to my childhood and the movie also used palpatine to give rey a great end to her story and closed everything together perfectly thanks to all of that this movie was a fantastic end to the skywalker saga and a great watch its in my top 5 and the only thing stopping it from making it is in the top 3 was that at the end they did finn dirty as his journey doesnt have a satisfying ending and this was not the plan from the beginning it felt rushed and quite sudden if they had had teases to build up to this occasion it would have made the movie much betterstill a fantastic watch and a great end to the skywalker saga
Sep 4 2021,negative,1050 a horrible and tragic way to end the saga 
Sep 1 2021,negative,i wished that this movie had changed its title from rise of skywalker to duel of the fates and the fact that the tv spots has featured the theme duel of the fates itself and not in the movie is disappointing the prequels had more backstories and  adventures than this rubbish kylo ren never traveled to darth vaders castle in the movie and did not encounter the webbish bog he never got a new mask and rey was too emotional and obsessed with redeeming ren rey was suppose to have a dual bladed blue lightsaber and wearing all black like luke skywalker from rotj but instead wore her white robes this movie was terrible prequels are outstanding whereas the sequel trilogy is considered garbage for me 25 stars
Aug 30 2021,neutral,this trilogy got out of hand unfortunately the main takeaway from this was that abrams solely came back to screw over johnson and just do his random own thing just like johnson had done to abrams vision in the previous installment the force awakens set us up to believe that we were in store for some fantastic star wars movies and that was far from the case messy boring and unnecessary story and the character representation really missed the mark
Aug 30 2021,negative,this movie was simply an apology for the abysmal disaster that is last jedi in a word this movie is lazy with no original content resurrecting the emperor because they couldnt come up with anything new rey is still the mary sue never able to fail at anything one big yawn
Aug 29 2021,negative,after the tlj i said it could not get any worse but i refused to see it in the theater i decided to watch all 3 sequel movies on disney to see if i would change my mind seeing them together this movie was a mess at least rian johnson was trying to insult or intelligence i guess they had no choice
Aug 28 2021,positive,star wars the rise of skywalker  b 88 a great finale to a trilogy i actually love definitely had its fair sure of headscratching moments but it ended the trilogy off in a good way and really did some good fan service i love kylo rens ark and think he is one of the best things star wars has ever had as part of its franchise the final battle was epic and some of the character decisions were awesome to see good film
Aug 26 2021,negative,the amount of contradictions and just blatant disregard for previous lore is baffling and how does the star destroyers not know which way is up  terrible movie a slap in the face of every diehard star wars fan
Aug 26 2021,positive,i walked out of the theater saying  now that was a star wars movie  its not the greatest story line in the world and its not the story we all wanted but it was exciting fun the funny bits are funny and it made for a great movie going experience
Aug 25 2021,positive,it was a good movie but they pulled stuff outa their ass for this one
Aug 25 2021,positive,it wasnt a perfect or even great ending but it was a good ending
Aug 23 2021,negative,in this movie perfection girl completes her quest to easily defeat every one in her way ignoring all rules and lore set up in the star wars universe the pilot and comic relief stormtrooper accompany her as everything you fell in love with about star wars is ruined right before your eyes but hey its better than the last jedi
Aug 21 2021,negative,better than the last jedi but when you have spaceships which cant tell which way is up is things are far beyond saving tlj and tros confirmed the sequel trilogy could not top the george lucass prequel trilogy the prequels are a cohesive connected story existing and respecting the universe of star wars  in all fairness when tlj ended i said whats left to tell do i even care whats to come in episode 9 nope tros is not completely jjs fault he actually tried but in end he was not the right choice even in the beginning of tfa its on record a lot of the material in the final cut was made by disney and lucasfilm without jj knowing ie the kiss however jj is not great at concluding stories and solving his own mysteries lets not forget chris terrio the screenwriter who also brought us messy overbloated poorly written scripts like batman v superman justice league and now tros all three films based on weak scripts which have to be extremely long and complex just to make sense the pacing and editing of tros is horrendous loaded with pissing contest moments between two polar opposite directors jj and rian desperate attempts to appear like there was a roadmap in the beginning when clearly there wasnt a side note the battle and fight scenes in entire sequel trilogy are awful how is it possible star wars which has always been known to have great battle and lightsaber fight sequences can go three movies without a single good battle rogue one not only accomplished this but its one of the best in all of star wars battles in the st are simply show up and fight no strategies no side objectives extremely short cutting away to nonstop sequences the final battle in tros is easiest the worst in all of star wars forced lacking in creative imagination how often do we get spaceships that cant tell which way is up the sequel trilogy is copy and paste of the original trilogy and undoing the sacrifice of the key character vaders redemption of killing the emperor are undone and handed over to rey consider this the sequel trilogy made the ot obsolete sadly you could watch the prequels skip the ot watch tfa skip tlj and watch tros the actions and outcomes from luke and anakin in the ot are no longer necessary thanks to perfect rey its all been boiling down to her the solos are gone the skywalkers are dead a palpatine remains and won thank you disney for officially killing star wars what we got was a trilogy of great trailer looking shots
Aug 20 2021,negative,my least favourite entry in the series and an utter disrespect to star wars fans
Aug 19 2021,neutral,only slightly better than the last jedi this still has frustrating characters and a storyline so dumb it seems jar jar binks made it this star wars adventure is only worth it if youre drunk
Aug 15 2021,positive,the final in star wars is epic and is very underrated
Aug 13 2021,negative,im a reasonably solid star wars fan i mean i dont put jedi as my official religion on government forms or anything like that but i do own all the movies on dvd and a few items of merch but i found myself on my phone halfway through rise of skywalker which speaks volumes about what i thought of this movie fyi  i was watching it in my own home cinema so no one was disturbed star wars the rise of skywalker should was a chance to make up for the failings of the force awakens and the last jedi instead we took a backwards step with an almost comical imitation of a star wars movie that crossed the line from nostalgic nod to the past into shameful copy the storyline didnt make any sense and lacked any real emotional intelligence it felt like they were  making it up as they went along the resolution of the relationship between rey and ben was anticlimatic and given many people had guessed wrongly that those two characters were at least distantly related the relationship seemed awkward a la the kissing scene between princess leia and luke in empire strikes back good luck getting me to pay to see any more star wars movies disney thats six stinkers in a row i just hope that if you make any more films the force is with you
Aug 10 2021,negative,i have tried to watch this movie several times but i cant get through the scene when palpetine comes back and the whole thing behind that its just so  i dont know whats going on he find some thing and find the sith lord in a abandoned old place with alot of stroboscopes in it i almost catch epilepsy then i have to turn of its to bad i am a sci fi nerd otherwise and love star wars
Aug 10 2021,negative,jj abrams returns with another blockbuster film with high cgi and no other good qualities rey i am your grandfather may go down as the worst twist in film history not much else to say would rewatch the last jedi after this any day unless i was in the mood to watch a poorly puttogether terribly written terrible plotted utter disappointment of a film frick you jj 210
Aug 9 2021,negative,thoroughly ordinary not at all cohesive with the previous movies clearly not at all thought out some good characters but no room for them to grow amongst all the jj abrams boom noises explosions and running around fetch quests star wars franchise dies with a whimper not a bang
Aug 9 2021,negative,a disappointing end to a multidecade long story
Aug 8 2021,negative,given how bad the last one was this couldnt get any worse but lets face it disney messed up
Aug 8 2021,negative,when i first watched attack of the clones i thought it was the worst star wars media i would ever see i was wrong
Aug 5 2021,positive,better than the last
Aug 5 2021,negative,its clear that disney had no vision for the trilogy so in the epic finale they threw as much fan service as possible to try and win over everyone the story is utter nonsense and pretty much every characters potential in the force awakens was ruined here time restraints little direction and way too much fan service destroyed the ending of the saga
Aug 4 2021,negative,a movie that continues the bad habit of being less and less star wars with a new formula that went wrong with a boring plot that pales in comparison to the classics a forced conclusion and
Aug 2 2021,positive,i know the plot is stupid and full of flaws but for some reason i still love this movie i dont know why
Aug 1 2021,negative,terrible film throws main antagonist in with no background or explanation this is the worst trilogy in history
Jul 31 2021,negative,a nonsensical disappointment with amateurish writing that relies almost exclusive on macguffins and deus ex machinas to move forward and what may possible be the single dumbest scene in all history of this franchise which is really saying something
Jul 30 2021,negative,one of the worst star wars movies ever made  pros the great character development set by kylo ren and his turn to the force cons everything
Jul 30 2021,negative,mary sue character kill or diminish loved characters contradicts the lore in various parts
Jul 30 2021,positive,last jedi messed with this one
Jul 30 2021,positive,good enough for me  the wifey
Jul 30 2021,negative,wasted potential with illogical conclusions  wiped away the good of the old without bringing anything new of value
Jul 30 2021,positive,it ruins george lucas creation destroying anakin skywalkers redemption story and adding force healing and a storyline with holes in it as well as not utilising finn well enough who couldve become a really interesting character in the sequel movies
Jul 29 2021,negative,its bad the skywalker saga ends not by a skywalker just someone that comes out of nowhere then stills the name after
Jul 28 2021,negative,what a horrible ending to the most legendary saga in movie history i wanted to scream so badly when they used that wayfinding knife also who thought introducing force healing in the last episode would be a good idea
Jul 28 2021,negative,jj tries to save the mess caused by the last jedi by retconning many troublesome plot lines from the last jedi but cant pull it off the result is an incoherent nonsensical jumble with little consistency with the two movies before it its lack of originality weak character arcs and contrived plot devices are fatal flaws its crystal clear by now that disney had no plan or vision for the trilogy at the start and this crucial mistake is felt most strongly in this film
Jul 26 2021,negative,disney really ruined this series a one time watcher nothing special watch the clone wars series instead by lucasarts
Jul 26 2021,negative,awful attempt at finishing one of the greatest franchises of all time do not waste your time unless you want to see some cool special effects
Jul 26 2021,negative,bringing back palpatine was just stupid if cloning is on the table lukes hand from empire could have been used to bring back luke
Jul 26 2021,negative,no continuity no plot destroyed what star wars was all about the only thing worse than this movie is the last jedi thanks ryan johnson for trying to destroy our loved characters
Jul 26 2021,negative,i still can not watch this franchise killer all the way through thats how bad it is give it a few years and disney will start doing horrible star wars reboots ally he characters in the new trilogy are wooden and horrible and i could care less if they all died i  the movies
Jul 26 2021,negative,it is a mary sue movie sequel that reflects how decadent and culture less this society has become
Jul 25 2021,negative,is better to consider it as a fan made movie written by a 7 year old kid that really doesnt understand the concept of character development and story continuity
Jul 24 2021,negative,it finished that nontrilogy nightmare that wasnt really a trilogy except for the same stupid new characters ruining all three movies  these disney skywalker movies went nowhere and they were not really about the skywalker family  they were disneys attempt to ruin george lucass characters legacy  i also didnt need the social engineering awkwardness at the end with the kiss
Jul 24 2021,positive,it was too bad that it ended like this it was visually beautiful the story just fizzled and had some lazy attempts at ending the lucas characters
Jul 24 2021,negative,where did it all go wrong for the sequel trilogy this movie is just pure fan service with no depth no character arcs no chemistry thats realistic or fun to watch and one of the biggest let downs in cinema history with palpatines return palpatine was one of the highlights of the prequels and to see him just be used as a cash grab is cringe inducing kylo rens turn to the light side was completely out of left field rey was still a mary sue with no development from the force awakens and everybody else was just there on the side lines with nothing important to do its a true shame too if they just let 1 director make the entire sequel trilogy with no major input from the studio it couldve turned out amazing but instead we got a half backed mess of a trilogy that dont feel connected in the slightest
Jul 24 2021,negative,well that was disappointing
Jul 24 2021,negative,just a mess consisting of retcon after retcon the story has too many unanswered questions and no clear direction how this has such a high audience score is beyond mind boggling this movie does nothing to respect the skywalker legacy
Jul 24 2021,negative,after a massive dump of a previous film this remains the only sw film i have not seen in the theaters  tons of problems with this film  some major plot inconsistencies technological nonsensicalness and lack of originality   apparently they were rewriting right up until deadline  a few can be excused due to logistics after fishers death but overall this shows that there was no real plan for the trilogy    i found myself genuinely hoping for an end credit reveal that all the disney sw films were actually fictional holos watched by the main characters in the expanded universe
Jul 24 2021,negative,blasphemous trash poor writing and terribly executed kathy kennedys sequel trilogy has zero respect for the franchise that george lucas created  cultivated over the course of four decades after killing han and luke in the previous installments they finished episode 9 by killing off leia to purge all original trilogy fans some of the new characters even got similar treatment especially john boyega who fans really hoped to see a stromtrooper turn jedi but nah lucasfilm went with the mary sue role instead  the writers clearly were not star wars fans because they dont even understand how the force works the force cant teleport things sorry this is not my star wars this film was blasphemy and pure trash
Jul 24 2021,negative,i suppose its a decent wrap up for what they already had going this far into the new trilogy i felt like the build up to the return of palpatine wasnt very wellexecuted neither was the build up to the reveal of reys true lineage   i was also very disappointed with the way finns character was shaped up throughout the trilogy and this movie wasnt any different some of the subtleties such as for his abilities were perhaps too subtle as opposed to rey or kylo being more inyourface all in all i just wasnt impressed
Jul 23 2021,negative,my goodness what a mess the whole trilogy is a disaster and could well be the end of an once beloved and respected franchise alas all good things
Jul 23 2021,negative,this movie is an embarrassment to the franchise largely nonsensical this movie does a good job at dragging an amazing legacy into the mud the failed storytelling shows that the writers did not have a plan when making a series of movies you should have a solid grasp of where the story will go this one did not appear to even have a rough outline
Jul 23 2021,neutral,some great action and visually amazing  but thats about it  a ton of missed opportunities  rey should have actually accidentally killed chewie  would have made for an unforgettable scene  but they chickened out
Jul 23 2021,negative,a return of the jedi remake a terrible ending for a terrible trilogy
Jul 22 2021,negative,skip to the end to see palps get his mojo back for a few minutes theres very little else worth seeing because youve seen it all before decades ago when fx were hand crafted
Jul 21 2021,negative,it was really bad i cant stress enough how awful it was
Jul 21 2021,negative,worst plot ever it is lazy and takes the audience for dummies
Jul 20 2021,positive,its not a bad film but its the finale of the star wars trilogy of trilogies and it just wasnt good enough the reykylo ren kiss was just an awful idea after the build up in fact ren was a weak adversary for rey and the reversion to brining in palatine as the big bad was just boring all pantomime cackles from a static body the down plying of john boyegas fin was a massive missed opportunity his more subtle approach was missed and fin was effectively written out of the trilogy as he did nothing of real importance to move the story on the whole crashed death star in a weirdly rough sea with big waves which appear for no apparent reason and never hit any of the protagonists fighting was just boring it is a shame because it has ruined the franchise for me and made me feel like a grown up at 67 and i didnt want that i had had big expectations after the interim offering rogue one knocked my socks off
Jul 18 2021,negative,clean up crew to aisle 3 jj does his best to salvage the absolute abortion that was the last jedi
Jul 18 2021,negative,i have never seen a more messy plot from star wars films everything is halfassed and they just randomly make up things as they go
Jul 17 2021,negative,has been 2 years seen if watch this thing and until this day i have ptsd every time someone talks or mention this movie
Jul 16 2021,negative,one of the most terrible star wars movies in history the prequels were 10x better than what this put up on the screen if it purpose was to tare up the fanbase it did its job not a movie that i expected from people safe guarding georges legacy
Jul 14 2021,negative,the writers must have been high when writing the script and not the good high where you get outofthebox ideas but the bad high where you just get lazy and wanna eat junk food had to watch it over several days  this is how unbearably boring and uninteresting this movei is dont waste your time with it
Jul 13 2021,negative,terrible politically motivated nonsense that doesnt add to the original trilogy but utterly undermines it
Jul 13 2021,positive,an excellent conclusion to the trilogy and the entire skywalker saga  a adventure with action and mystery and love all in a classic star wars movie
Jul 12 2021,negative,well it was hard to follow up on the absolute sshow called tlj jj really didnt have much to work with so of course its a mess but bringing in palps and making rey his granddaughter and how she identified as a skywalker in the end that was a lot of bad choises good things well at least jj try to entertain his audience unlike the massive troll rian
Jul 11 2021,neutral,i would agree with the general consensus that the sequel trilogy lacks creative imaginationrise of skywalker runs out of steam for me
Jul 10 2021,negative,i bought gold class tickets to see the force awakens i bought regular tickets to see the last jedi i watched the rise of skywalker on tv and quickly deleted it off my dvr kathleen kennedy and disney the franchise killers ps all the skywalkers died by the end sadly along with this franchise   
Jul 9 2021,positive,the trilogy was sabotaged by tlj so i feel sorry for the makers of this movie but disney are the custodians of this franchise and its unforgivable what the final trilogy gives long term fans george lucas would not have allowed this to happen
Jul 7 2021,negative,this movie is the worst movie of the skywalker saga it rises above the stupidity of the two previous movies and gets a new world record for worst movie ever the only reasons im giving this film half a star is for visual effects john williams and the fact i cant give 0 stars theres too much trash in this movie to write down so ill just say that bringing palpatine back was the dumbest thing to do it erases the point of vaders sacrifice and ruins the og trilogy honestly i excepted more from jj abrams
Jul 6 2021,positive,star wars episode ix is the first movie i learnt of with my senses and knowledge of star wars intact just before this movie was coming i watched all the previous movies so that i could catch up before this movie came i wasnt born until the phantom menace i didnt know anything about the other movies since i used to think star wars is only a cartoon then when the force awakens came i had my board exams going on and the last jedi was getting so much hate i thought star wars is just another franchise being done to death like jurassic park or the matrix so overall saying this is the first star wars movie that i knew how to react on when it released and that was definitely not a good reaction so first of all my problem is with how convenient the plot twists are how on earth are the plot twists done so badly that there doesnt seem to be anything at stake rey and friends are getting sucked in sand the animal inside is friendly c3pos memory gets formatted r2d2 restores it they dont know where to go rey just holds her knife and compares it with the surroundings and finds her way and no im not even getting to the dozen things that happened when she had to defeat palpatine nothing matters in this movie for that matter what happened to rey becoming evil what happened to the rebels on the planet where c3pos memory was formatted they were never brought up again the movie completely massacred everything that star wars stands for i think the problem with all the sequel movies is that they are pandering to a much much younger generation anything that could have been a little too mature was probably thrown out of the window by mickey mouse because then how will the little girls from middle east have rey dolls if she did something mature like luke and anakin palpatine came back to life only so that rey could smash him again and show how strong and smart she is ben solo died only because he was trying to save rey for some reason even though he has jedi powers so he could have just moved her out of the path no culture lifestyle important character backstory  nothing happened in here it was just picking up on the disaster that episode viii was and the worst part in the entire movie was when rey took or rather should i say stole the skywalker surname what even was that scene the way luke and leia were standing in the sky they looked like her parents the second worst for me would be the rey and ben kissing scene i dont know how to say this but rey has a very sisterlike look to her why would ben ever do that but of course not everything is bad about star wars episode ix  the rise of palpatine like i said before it has a really awesome cgi probably the best in the entire star wars franchise the cinematography was also very good the background score added to the intensity and the best part  its the last movie of the sequel trilogy finally this thing ended we dont have to watch any more of rey palpatine anymore im glad ive watched every single star wars movie now so i have been able to catch up with the trend and now i can talk to anyone about star wars whenever the topic comes up
Jul 5 2021,positive,not great but not as insufferable as the last jedi some cool new force power ideas and the jokes were less cringe the plot did meander and drag on a bit probably could have shaved 20 minutes off and i usually like long movies there is a little bit of hope for star wars outside of the mandalorian just a little
Jul 5 2021,negative,i was very disappointed with the poor story and the way that the characters were portrayed
Jul 5 2021,negative,this movie was yet another horrible star wars movie with no good characters an uninteresting basic story and still no villains worth fighting
Jul 5 2021,negative,who is the chosen one again
Jul 5 2021,negative,the only level of consistency in this trilogy is the outstanding special effects other than that this film does everything in its power to crap on rian johnson and the infamous the last jedi it really is a waste to end the skywalker story on such a messy note easily my least favorite star wars film
Jul 3 2021,negative,horrible mess illogical cmovie level story ashamed that i have watched this george you were ought to bring balance to the force not leave it in darkness
Jul 3 2021,negative,incoherent end to an incoherent trilogy
Jul 2 2021,neutral,loved the character of rey and kylo but the lack of planning waster their character ark hated that they give in to the fans and even though it does not make sense they did it just to please the fans this film is disappointing
Jul 1 2021,positive,this was the best movie of the new three but that isnt saying much kylo rens internal struggle feels fake and almost tongue in cheek rey leaves something to be desired and the completely sudden comeback of palpatine with no explanation feels like a reach so much could have been done to make this a better movie small details that would have added only meer minutes to the total run time overall disappointing
Jul 1 2021,positive,not the best film but the best ending they could make of the trilogy
Jun 27 2021,positive,just as awesome and incredible as force awakens with daisy ridley at her best and having an extremely strong and epic finale to end of the sequel trilogy of star wars
Jun 22 2021,negative,lazy screenwriting palpatine seriously extreme pacing issues dropped plots and macguffins galore one is even lifted straight from the goonies its clear they had no plan for this film other than to stuff in as many side characters as possible in order to maximize toy profits the main cast give it their all but are given absolute drivel to work with all in all each film in this trilogy is more disappointing than the last and that is no easy feat following the last jedi   dear jj   stay far away from any other existing franchises you have have done more than enough damage   sincerely  everybody
Jun 21 2021,negative,didnt palpatine take years to force lightning but nah rey can do it cause angerey
Jun 21 2021,negative,finally got around to seeing this after the train wreck of the last jedi im shocked the audience score is 86 this movie is a disgrace to george lucas there was zero cohesion between this film and the previous 2 it feels like a bad marvel movie even if i let everything wrong with this movie slide i can not accept the ending maybe some liked it but the movie  and saga for that matter ends in the most cheesy backstabbing way possible its laughable out of the literally limitless possibilities abrams chooses to retcon everything and end with that its just not right 110
Jun 19 2021,negative,watching this movie is frustrating for several reasons related to the too high pace speed of the cuts which doesnt allow the watcher to absorb and understand what they have just watched but also to a narrative level bringing more questions than answers in a movie which should be the conclusion of a trilogy that in this manner clearly shows the lack of an overall plan regarding the sequel since the beginning
Jun 19 2021,negative,a deeply disappointing conclusion to the skywalker saga rise of skywalker is the product of a studio with no sense of direction a huge budget and production conflicts the only positive aspects are the impressive visuals acting and score  the film falters in the writing with a clumsy attempt at damage control from the previous film while offering hardly anything of substance to continue and resolve the story the storyline is filled with plot conveniences plot holes clichés and tropes from other sci fi films as well as recycled beats from previous superior star wars films the weight of delivering a satisfying ending to decades of storytelling loses star wars trademark magic and is instead a cold corporate carcass of cinema that is unlikely to please fans though may provide enough spectacle to entertain general audiences 410
Jun 16 2021,negative,confusing mess but that follows jjs patterns who really cares anymore
Jun 13 2021,negative,the absolute worst star wars film
Jun 13 2021,positive,the film is amazing well built with a good script but it misses a lot in its ending with rey being palpatine it kind of ends his whole journey
Jun 12 2021,positive,its basically two films rolled into one and suffers because of it also it doesnt bridge the previous films together and leaves the trilogy feeling lopsided there are some moronic sequences and mcguffins everywhere i could go on all day about the problems this film has yet i was pretty entertained while watching it
Jun 10 2021,positive,it seemed rushed and not enough story this and the other two in this trilogy fell flat and didnt give a full star wars feel the feeling was there just not fulfilling enough for star wars in my opinion   there was a nice twist but seemed kind of cheap and redone from darth maul this trilogy seemed like a current game where the rest of the story is in the dlc that hasnt come out yet
Jun 9 2021,negative,for my opinion and anyone elses about this movie was so disappointed the worst thing about this film is the ending when a lady asked her name and rey chose her last name skywalker shes not really related to luke or leia and also palpatine returns i thought hes dead and death star 2 got destructed already i hate it how palpatine gets another clone of himself thats ridiculous how on earth that he can make a duplicate of himself overall this movie is completely trash and it doesnt make sense at all it upset to me how i feel on this situation  
Jun 8 2021,negative,i did not like the concept the script total ignorance of the lore the decisions the director made the cast the play good cgi thou if you have no clue what jedi sith are about you are going to like this
Jun 8 2021,positive,if there was ever a movie that was doomed to fail itd be this one the follow up film to everyones favorite star wars movie the last jedi has an  incredibly difficult time fixing the mess that rian johnson created this being the case i think jj abrams as flawed of a directer as he might be should be commended a lot more for his work here i think he did a good enough job with what he had especially with how he integrated leia after carrie fishers death you can tell he treated the characters with respect and thats a win in my book although the movie falters from some bad jokes every now and then i think the humor is handled much better here thanks to characters like c3po do and of course the one and only babu frik also the fight scenes were so much better in this one the two lightsaber fights were actually really great and creative in theyre execution although nothing compared to the prequels or originals the new planets that were introduced were also really cool and it was nice to see the death star wreckage now the scenes that i really loved were leias sacrifice bens memory of han lukes talk with rey and  the voices of all the jedi speaking to rey they shouldve actually been shown as force ghosts but we cant have everything i guess some stuff that bothered me were palpatines return barely explained and a bit goofy honestly and anakin not showing up at all as a force ghost in the end this movie is just ok i enjoy it but its definitely far from being a great movie it presents some truly awesome ideas but sadly doesnt have enough time to really flesh them out another disappointing star wars movie but hey at least it wasnt all bad
Jun 7 2021,negative,poor trilogy its pretty evident that disney had no plan coming into this trilogy it sucks because you can see what disney can do with a plan like in mandolorian instead were stuck with this steaming pile of poop
Jun 6 2021,positive,not what we expected nor completely what we deserved or wanted  doesnt deal with a slew of plot holes and other issues but then again neither did the first prequel  leave it at its star wars and it freaking rocks
Jun 4 2021,positive,its not as good as the others but overall pretty good
Jun 1 2021,positive,it was much better then the last jedi but it was rushed and limited by the hold the last jedi dug should have been  split into two films all the films should have had a planned out line also
May 29 2021,negative,the rise of skywalker is the worst star wars movie ever created it may have been more entertaining in terms of graphics and fighting than previous star wars movies but it all comes down to one massive mistake by the writers and producers the return of daddy palp is an utter disgrace to the star wars saga and should never have been allowed to make it past the first round table discussion for the movie george lucas himself stated that star wars is all about anakin skywalker and his rise and fall as the chosen one the return of palpatine ruins anakin and his story which is complete incompetency from the writers the introduction of rey as a skywalker only drags anakin and lukes legacies through the mud even more
May 27 2021,negative,this movie is more entertaining to make fun of than it is to watch thats not a good thing i dont understand why disney would give control to people who continue to be incompetent
May 26 2021,positive,i dont like that people hate this movie its not a terrible movie it was a good way to finish an amazing franchise it was a definitely a step up from the last jedi critics were very wrong about that movie
May 26 2021,negative,the rise of skywalker is what you get when large corporate interests relatively new business daddy disney are paired with a lack of intestinal fortitude required to make anything that can be rightfully called art rian johnson offered a fresh departure from the admittedly beloved tropes that defined star wars cannon in the 40 intervening years between a new hope and the last jedi pennypinching roibeholden executives caved to narrowminded changefearing and disproportionality loud audiences and destroyed any chance of a worthwhile entry into the cannon instead we got the rise of skywalker
May 26 2021,negative,firstly the audience score is not genuine somethings at play here the movie is a mess it tries hard to do some damage control but with what he has done or had tried to do jj abrams proves he is part of the disaster that is now the disney star wars franchise
May 26 2021,positive,in my opinion star wars the rise of skywalker is by far the best star wars film out there with a ton of new characters and some old ones too watching this movie over and over never gets boring theres a lot of humor and exciting action scenes i also love kylo rens new look  its not a perfect film but it has enough oomph to get you through it without getting bored a great movie for any star wars fan
May 25 2021,negative,if i could give it lower i would honestly like its not even all the bad stuff it does with the star wars universe and lore its just a bad plot with bad writing perfect way to end a bad trilogy feel bad for fins character could have been developed so much more they fly now lol who actually came up with this star wars has been so marvelised its painful
May 25 2021,neutral,probably my least favorite star wars movie since attack of the clones
May 24 2021,positive,overhated redeems from the last jedi and is really good especially the call backs
May 21 2021,negative,i do not understand the disney execs why would you put so much pressure on yourselves to advance lucas story line of the previous 6 installments instead move on to a different timeline make a stamp in the universe all your own my god this series is so forced pun horribly intendedin so many different confusing directions just a sad contribution that sours the entire series itself
May 20 2021,negative,its a shameless cash grab a super safe joyride of emotions to please fans because not enough people appreciated what the last jedi built up palpatine died in return of the jedi and everyone seems to not care that hes in rise of skywalker everyone who mindlessly rates this 5 stars makes me sick
May 18 2021,positive,star wars rise of skywalker  610 saw star wars episode 9 during the holidays and totally forgot to post the review rise of skywalker is a decent but underwhelming end to a trilogy that started off strong with force awakens jj abrams returns to direct the finale and though he is able to make a way to a resolution after the way the last jedi ended he sadly has to resort to bringing back an old villain in palpatine palpatine is no where to be heard or seen in the previous two films so his reveal as the mastermind is extremely confusing and underwhelming rey and her comrades are fighting for the universe while kylo ren is still hell bent on winning for the dark side though this battle should create a lot of spectacular sequences for the finale rise kind of feels a little flat in terms of excitement the action sequences look cool and are grand but theyre missing something it almost feels like things just happen for the sake of the story to end kylo gets a nice end to his story arc while the twist with reys lineage just feels unwanted if she ended up being a nobody and still saved the universe it would have super poignant and meaningful it would have given the meaning of may the force be with you a lot more depth but with the twist it just didnt sit well daisy ridley does deliver a great performance though and its cool to see how she delivers in her final performance in that character as for the films other technical departments it scores in production and music john williams delivers yet another wonderful soundtrack and it will sad and tough to know that this will be his last star wars film all in all rise of skywalker works but plays it safe a little too much hopefully when the new series starts up they will opt for a more challenging storyline that doesnt focus on familiarity
May 17 2021,negative,this is not a bad movie its quite an enjoyable one to be honest but i cant rate it as one because of what it represents  the force awakens was fun but it was kind of a rehash of a new hope but the last jedi was not just a fun movie but it also took the series in a new direction  but because star wars fans hate anything new disney got cold feet with this one and just did return of the jedi again the leaked duel of the fates script was so so much better than this rehash but star wars fans would have pulled it to pieces
May 15 2021,neutral,theres a handful of inspired moments but the rise of skywalker fails to deliver a satisfying end to the sequel trilogy due to its leaps in logic overstuffed narrative and scatterbrained direction that undoes a lot of the last jedis plot
May 14 2021,positive,this film is a mixed bag for me i was thinking i would hate it but i enjoyed it more than i thought but it doesnt really play well after multiple viewings a lot of pressure fell on jj abrams to end this on a good note and the pressure shows as he again copies plot lines and ideas from previous movies if disney wants to do any more star wars movies i hope they move away from the ideas that ruined episodes viii and ix
May 12 2021,negative,i like how the review from rotten tomatoes calls this a fan focus devotion when in actuality its more of a star wars greatest hits than anything else soullessness is in this films blood
May 12 2021,negative,a sad ending for a sad saga terrible acting no ideas whatsoever special effects are not enough to honor star wars i will thrash this last 3 movies as if they never happened
May 10 2021,negative,jj abrams truly could not have made a worse star wars movie if he tried
May 8 2021,negative,ok is it visually pleasing yes and am i a gay starved for representation also yes idk maybe if i was high id like the movie more
May 7 2021,negative,terrible movie by a director that doesnt watch or like the original material movie is so fast paced and devoid of anything meaningful the logical loopholes and plotholes are so bad that you will cringe all the way its the sad ending of a horrible saga ruining the past along with its future  its a movie for people who doesnt like star wars not good movies and hates logic do no watch unless you are a bland human with nothing real in your life
May 7 2021,negative,though it might not necessarily be the worst star wars movie by conventional film standards its the worst in terms of what it means to the overarching saga the choices made here were truly awful with each story beat undoing some fascinating development that had been planted in episode viii
May 6 2021,negative,thank god its all over
May 5 2021,positive,while i do think this movie plays it a little too safe in places and makes a few weird choices it is a very fun film that i greatly enjoy
May 5 2021,positive,67510 jj abrams insistence using hte original trilogy as inspiration and direction for his own work is disappointingly apparent finishing the series and following an incredible middle installment with a comparatively shallow hohum finale you know how it goes  the galaxy is brought to life by glorious special effects pulsepounding action a great score and awesome performances from the cast but alas abrams cant rise to the artistic challenge issued by episode viii director rian johnson to end the series with daring rather he seeks to simultaneously placate both the rabid devotees of the franchise who cant handle any deviation from their own expectations and casual film goers who may have no expectations at all by bringing back previously dead and everpopular arch villains and undoing some of the twists that made viii so great it feels focusedgrouped into mild tepidity offering little more than fan service and nostalgia in an attempt to hurt no ones feelings while getting as many butts in the seats as possible there are some wonderful character moments particularly between the po and finn who have found a wavelength that makes there friendship feel like brotherhood and between rey and kylo who build on their connection from the previous film that ends their characters arcs in a predictable but still pretty satisfying fashion excepting a final forced moment between the two that made me throw my hands in disgust this probably wont be the final star wars film or trilogy 15 years from now some young film student who saw these movies in theaters will be the next talent to reintroduce us to a galaxy far far away i hope she or he chooses to follow after johnsons example rather than abrams
May 4 2021,negative,efforts on behalf of every one of the actors earn this movie two stars they all did an incredible job breathing life into their characters who were unfortunately wasted in this lazy rehash of the original series what a shame to reach the end amid a recycled  storyline missed opportunities to expand the universe and just so many deadend plot lines that add nothing  its a heartbreakingly disappointing finish to a series that had so much potential but this is a story that will never end and we can all hope for redemption in the future
May 4 2021,negative,there are so many plot holes in this movie that it is swiss cheese  nothing about this movie should have ever been made  the fact that anyone thought this was a good movie is mind blowing
May 4 2021,negative,honesty one of the worest sequels i think ive ever seen after like maybe twenty mintuines i coundt watch this anymore a complete boring no imagation no story film that makes no sense whats so ever
May 1 2021,negative,absolutely disappointing movie with overload of cliches the movie never should have happened
May 1 2021,negative,clearly from the beginning when seeing this trilogy it was seen that there was never planning to tell us the events after the return of the jedi and it is again a remake of the originals and this time of episode vi seeing this installment there was never any evolution in the plot and with each installment of this trilogy it was only seen to want to tell the same thing that was seen in the originals empire  first order rebels  resistance a new hope  a new hope overthrow a dictatorship  overthrow a dictatorship i reiterate there was no evolution this trilogy should never have existed the skywalker saga ended in episode vi the return of the jedi
Apr 29 2021,positive,much better than the last jedi but felt like it tried to cram too much in
Apr 29 2021,negative,ugh just ugh disney buying up film studios is the death of creativity lucasfilm marvel studios just ugh that company exists to ruin everything we love
Apr 28 2021,positive,a welcome return after the last jedi moved the goalposts for the worst
Apr 27 2021,negative,mary sue ruins star wars gg
Apr 26 2021,negative,there was no reason to bring palatine back this choice alone ruined many opportunities for kylo ren to step up but the movie keeps him muzzled there were also several scenes that made no sense the link between rey and ren the magical disappearing act ren not dropping the lightsaber after trying to give it to his vision of his father but throwing it into the ocean forever cementing him as a manbaby
Apr 26 2021,neutral,movie was rushed didnt follow the lore had a few good moments but not that great
Apr 26 2021,negative,i have no words to say how bad this movie overall preformed in comparisson to the originals this is a huge insult millions of dollars wasted for this
Apr 26 2021,negative,this was hard to watch
Apr 25 2021,negative,i dont think they could have done worse
Apr 25 2021,positive,works to retcon all the things that made ep 8 so awful basically as a standalone film this movie is a neat whatif but still doesnt quite fit asis into the canon star wars universe established in ep 16   overall 35 if youre going to watch the sequels watch 7 skip 8 entirely and watch this one
Apr 24 2021,positive,a lot of fun not the best movie ever but enjoyable
Apr 24 2021,negative,disney cant make a decent star wars movie but somehow theyre able to make masterpieces like the mandalorian and clone wars season 7 the rise of skywalker is like a drunk gymnast and just absolutely misses the landing by bringing back palpatine it is destroying this movie and return of the jedi and vaders sacrifice
Apr 23 2021,neutral,the rise of skywalker has many moments of glory but theyre hampered by uninspired underwhelming direction and a fundamental misunderstanding of what the sequel trilogy had been working towards 
Apr 23 2021,negative,to many reveals stories to connect and plotholes it just tried to redo a lot of the og sw some good effects and there it ends the rest is just kinda meh just hope this is removed from canon bec palp was killed by luke to become a powerful jedi you need training unless you are some random grand daughter of palpatine then i guess you will become stronger than everyone else
Apr 22 2021,positive,the story is a little messy and some caracthers dont get enough development but here is a lot to enjoy from this conclusion tho the sequel trilogy apart from the story the action sequences are great and beautifull with characters that we love
Apr 21 2021,positive,this film is a fast and too safe version of what a finale should be it hits all of the right beats but fails to do anything original and feels predictable however it is still an enjoyable experience that any star wars fan would enjoy this film feels as if it was actively trying to ignore the previous movie the shorter runtime tells me the abrams was trying to get this film done with the old college try despite the sith tracker being one of the most obvious plot devices i had ever seen the film uses the characters well enough for it to sort of work
Apr 20 2021,negative,i truly do not understand how this has so many good reviews and the fact that the only reason people like this movie is that its just pointless bland cgi mush with terrible writing and nothing but petty swipes at nostalgia it pales in comparison to the beauty of the last jedi
Apr 19 2021,negative,i cant believe theres actually a stars movie this bad this movie is a mess a huge mess there is so many plot holes in this film i dont recommend this movie dont waste your time on this god awful movie
Apr 18 2021,negative,what a waste of time 23 hours of my life that i will  never get back jj abrams proves to the world how he can single handedly destroy the whole beloved franchise with this final instalment recycled storylines scenes and characters together with a two dimensional heroine at the centre of it all makes this abomination truly awful and one to miss
Apr 17 2021,negative,jj took a big crap on ryans vision and the franchise as a whole its a descrace that this movies score is as high as it is
Apr 17 2021,negative,as a lifelong star wars enthusiast i was deeply appalled by this film it wasnt just bad it was insulting the emporer was thrown down a shaft which resulted in a massive explosion not to mention the entire death star later exploded yet somehow he survived in secrecy for 30 years on a barren planet manufacturing countless world killing star destroyers even the most misguided fan fiction couldnt have recreated something so abysmal worse than the plot the entire movie was just seemingly random scenes slapped together constantly jumping around also light speed skipping not a terrible concept but moronic execution   all in all just a terrible movie and a massive disservice to star wars fans my only hope is that favreau  filoni will erase this timeline
Apr 17 2021,negative,it was eh i mean what can i expect off of disney oh well
Apr 17 2021,negative,somehow palpatine is back awesome backstory cool what a bunch of shit really somehow palpatine is back wow
Apr 16 2021,positive,despite the toxic fandom this movie is amazing incredible sound design acting production design character creation etc not to mention a fast paced ride of emotions and excitement on par with the force awakens
Apr 11 2021,positive,i loved the movie and thought that star wars had a great continuing 
Apr 11 2021,negative,a very silly disjointed mess of a movie but i was expecting nothing less from such a series that had long ago gone off the rails people blame george lucas for making bad decisions with his franchise but now it is disneys problem while this was not as terrible to me as the last jedi there is simply nothing to recommend here except pretty graphics which is simply a given with any movie approaching this mammoth budget looking back at the trilogy these characters are not compelling or interesting they copied characters wed already gotten but missed their soul and essence i could have lived without the annoying kylo ren this movie is supposed to wrap up the trilogy but almost flat out admits the previous two films didnt need to even exist go back and watch the originals or even watch the prequels and tell me im wrong here star wars become popular because it had good characters interesting stories that evoked a larger mythos and felt familiar while also exploring cool ideas these are just cranked out messes and it doesnt help when the people in charge sabotage each other and act like the fans are the enemy
Apr 11 2021,negative,one of the most disrespectful and immature movies i have ever weathered abysmal and atrocious
Apr 10 2021,neutral,the build up to this film had the movie doomed from the beginning the characters feel like they have no chemistry has all characters really havent spent enough time with each other this movie does start off extremely well feeling like an original movie however it hits a point where i feel i should be invested and on the edge of my seat however i felt bored waiting for my next scene this movie doesnt follow instep of any of the other movies and you walk out of the theatre asking questions that you should know the answer to for the greatest movie franchise of all time its very disappointing
Apr 8 2021,negative,this is a train wreck the first half of the film is a bad cringe episode of the amazing race they do nothing but go on a hunt for mcguffins after that its just a boss fight with a man who died 30 years ago and the most twodimensional overpowered hero in the saga if i had to choose between rewatching this film and cutting off my own arms i would be no good in a mexican wave
Apr 6 2021,negative,there were some mildly entertaining moments but the filmmakers completely trashed anakins sacrifice in episode 6 rey still has no character development and they minimized rose
Apr 6 2021,positive,not an awful movie just quite innaccurate it has some well done scenes and isnt exactly bad though it wasnt what many were looking for
Apr 5 2021,negative,hopeless and heartless a depressing ending to the saga
Apr 3 2021,positive,the conclusion of the skywalker saga was really good i dont care what the toxic fans say rey is a skywalker
Apr 2 2021,positive,too many rehashed themes and plot conveniences i know that is somewhat expected from a stars film but these was not much of the feel good cinematics or jaw dropping action that make it work
Apr 2 2021,negative,really really bad story but the acting cgi and sets make it a decent time
Apr 1 2021,negative,horrible trainwreck doesnt feel like star wars at all
Apr 1 2021,negative,its entertaining but also really bad
Apr 1 2021,negative,this is not only the worst star wars its probably the worst movie ever made this film discover new depth of mediocrity the only positive point about this scam is that the destroying of the star wars saga and spirit is definitely over at least we hope so  ps leia was never a jedi
Apr 1 2021,negative,i have been a lifelong star wars fan  it was the vehicle through which i made one of my first groups of friends in elementary school it continued to deliver exciting content through the prequels and spin offs as i grew up and through the first two new sequels episode vii and viii it continued to deliver for me as a fan  i passed down my love of this to my children too  i share that because the abject disappointment that rise of skywalker gave me was so unsettling  the underdeveloped story the lack of character development the shameless and childish and poorly executed attempts to retcon themes and plots from the last jedii had a very hard time following the movie in theatres when i saw it and in the several times i have attempted to rewatch it since it was released i cant even get through to the end before turning it off  as an educator i see a film like this and cannot help but wonder aloud why this kind of failure is acceptable in the entertainment industry  our trio of new heroes  rey finn and poe  they instantly vanished into obscurity after this movie flopped so badly  for decades characters like luke skywalker obiwan kanobi and darth vader  they have served as philosophical archetypes that provide meaning and significance in life and storytelling  far beyond just the entertainment on the big screen  what lessons do our trio of new heroes teach us now  through the force awakens and the last jedi lessons existed and were debated among fans and nonfans alike  after rise of skywalker  none of it matters because emperor palpatine returned oh and reys heritage is revealed and oh they defeat the emperor and the sith somehow and now rey is a skywalker with a yellow lightsaber  there was no deeply seeded foreshadowing for any of this  instead we got an ongoing chain of irrelevant side characters that ultimately ended up being irrelevant  maz dj rose bb9e the knights of ren ochi zorii bliss i had to actually look up her name because she was such a random insert character jannah not to mention forcing leia into rise of skywalker  i actually created an account on rotten tomatoes solely for the purpose of expressing my dissatisfaction with this movie  it is not subject to debate that this movie is good or not  it is objectively a poor final product  sure it was visually beautiful in moments but only visually  the story and characters were poorly executed and delivered a huge disservice to true life long fans of this franchise  now all we can do is hope someone will come along and rerelease a different directors cut of this film that actually makes sense  rey finn poe and others deserve it too
Apr 1 2021,negative,just terrible rey is an irritating prescience adam driver is this movies only saving grace as he is brilliant
Apr 1 2021,negative,i literally cant even type all the things about this movie that are atrocious it was almost as bad as episode 8 the ending is literally romeo and juliet rey and kylo take turns dying after kissing each other theres 10000 other things i could go into but its not worth it the movie is horrendous
Apr 1 2021,negative,a very boring and sterile film disneys main star wars trilogy suffers from the marvel syndrome instead of trying to be more serious like the original trilogy as well as the revenge of the sith it ends up being a poor mans guardians of the galaxy there are moments where i thought i was watching an inferior version of endgame rather than star wars this movie is very boring as well  the only great star wars movies from the disney era include rogue one amazing and solo
Mar 31 2021,negative,had to watch it twice i kept falling asleep the first time
Mar 29 2021,neutral,meh it wasnt that bad it definitely wasnt a mess like tlj but it could have been done a lot better
Mar 29 2021,negative,its an improvement from the last jedi but so is a pile of garbage this is a desperate attempt to write the wrongs of the sequel trilogy while it does shine at times the undeniable betrayal of the last jedi hardly makes any star wars film worth watching
Mar 27 2021,negative,things happen the movie  better than the previous one tho and it looks cool sometimes to
Mar 27 2021,negative,this film has no substance except for fan service it contradicts itself and knowledge we already know from the rest of the series and has no place in the saga we call star wars  i would gladly watch attack of the clones over this
Mar 27 2021,negative,the worst attempt of trying to milk the last dried utters of the franchise for all they have since the last jedi its also the most nonsensical movie ever created
Mar 26 2021,positive,funny original  sweet farewell to luke and his twin sister leia plus han solo and kylo ren
Mar 26 2021,negative,literally even the cast admitted that this movie was written at the last minute anyone who watches this can feel the vibe that this movie is made just for the sake of finishing disneys sequel the story is horrendous disney is so out of material they have to recycle old stuff they even had poe saying somehow palpatine is back this line alone reflects how crappy this sequel finale is but if you look at the bright side finally the disneys sequel is finished and we dont have to see any more of this poorlywritten and commercial star wars crap
Mar 25 2021,negative,the worst i saw from star wars
Mar 25 2021,neutral,the rise of skywalker cleans up the mess the last jedi made but fails to give any of its characters a satisfying arc and retcons the previous films in the process
Mar 24 2021,neutral,everything is wrong with this movie missed the idea of being jedi
Mar 24 2021,negative,i find this movie so boring and pointless
Mar 24 2021,negative,this tried to apologize for the last jedi but the damage was done this doesnt help anakin and luke are now failures and now we have a palpatine saga you know since a palpatine won   you gotta be sick to think this good
Mar 23 2021,positive,everything but ray really wasnt that bad god she gets me so angry terrible character should have been finn guys a beauty
Mar 23 2021,negative,absolutly insulting for fans disney wanted to say we all had to fuck off
Mar 22 2021,positive,okay movie fixed a lot of the last jedis problems which is always a win and i like rey and kylo much more in this film however it still lacks which i do not blame jj for at this point but could have been better wish they brought george back for this final film but not a terrible finally for the franchise couldve been better
Mar 22 2021,negative,the moment they ripped off endgame was when i realized i wasnt watching a star wars movie
Mar 21 2021,negative,i feel bad for jj abrams he had to clean up rian johnsons mess and this movie was the result it wasnt as much a movie as it was a cleanup attempt
Mar 21 2021,negative,a very bad movie but better than the previous ones  pure rubbish that only insults fans and all that is star wars
Mar 21 2021,negative,what is this it looks like a movie made in parts that they have not been able to put together it is a frankensteins monster it is nonsense with tricks that come out of the sleeve and you have to believe it
Mar 21 2021,negative,a lackluster and bloated finale to what was once the greatest saga of all time  the hope and emotional climax  that we were given at the end of the last jedi is no where to be found here
Mar 20 2021,positive,the best star wars sequel
Mar 20 2021,positive,the last entry to the skywalker saga had a bunch of flaws mostly because of jj abrams choice to bring back emperor palpatine it resulted in a very fastpaced mess but it had a lot of great moments i can never get tired of seeing ian mcdiarmid play palpatine the rise of skywalker is overall an enjoyable fastpaced space adventure film but with a very weak story
Mar 20 2021,negative,terrible writing terrible ending of a saga
Mar 20 2021,positive,great wrap up to the skywalker saga  so much fan service  babu frik is one of my favorite characters of all time  i have it as my 4th favorite star wars movie and enjoyed every second of it brought on every emotion as a star wars movie should will definitely miss these movies and these characters overall gave it a 91100  go see for yourself
Mar 20 2021,negative,there are elements in this film that i enjoyed however there is so much that just didnt work from the opening of the movie to crazy amounts of continuity errors never has a trilogy of movies not worked a trilogy at least eps 13 46 work as a collection of movies disneys attempt to rewrite star wars whilst clinging on what makes it nostalgic was a bad move episode 9 is a mess and not even a hot mess the ending is well end game
Mar 20 2021,positive,messy but sooooo stylish fun and emotional
Mar 20 2021,negative,worst star wars movie just horrible
Mar 20 2021,positive,a good example of how critics take themselves too seriously when it comes to star wars trust the force and opinions of the fans ros feels like a true star wars film peppered with nostalgia and the jedi fighting ive been waiting for
Mar 20 2021,neutral,this is the worst of the complete saga for any true fan it is an insult to more than 30 years of legacy beloved characters abrams tried to hard to tie all loose ends coming up with new jedi stuff that are hardly accepted by the fandom bringing back palpatine where again when no one ever asked for his come back and less by this terrible clone way it was a clear mistake from the start
Mar 20 2021,positive,it doesnt succeed as a movie very well messy plot and dead end plot points and some stuff was very rushed however it succeeds very well as a star wars movie def couldve been better especially if they delayed the movie by a year to give a lot more time but then it wouldve been delayed by covid they also totally couldve split the movie in 2 as to really give more time for the characters especially since the first 2 movies had no time jump the best thing about the last jedi was that it wasnt riddled with nostalgia but that doesnt mean everything nostalgic was bad there were some truthfully stunning scenes in this film and it really shows as being the last time the skywalker family would have the spotlight truthfully amazing movie and at minimum is very entertaining which is the 1 job a star wars movie has and it more than did its job split into 2 parts or given an extra year for production or both would really have saved the final story in the skywalker saga doesnt mean it was so bad absolutely with revisiting because there is so much to enjoy
Mar 19 2021,negative,star wars is dead because of disney and kathleen
Mar 19 2021,negative,another boring star wars movie
Mar 19 2021,negative,this film gets everything about star wars wrong and destroys the legacy of episodes 16
Mar 18 2021,negative,i dont usually review films publicly however this film recently had an article about some last star wars apologists the overall flow or new hope redesign for the audience mock the star wars world by going against everything ever done before and then the last goes so far into a literal monster and cult  movie and essentially is cutting off the head of the franchise and burying it with the hopes and dreams of millions   nothing was earned and twenty people at random could reimagine this entire new 3 part franchise and plan out better the adventurous and cheap nature of the originals is gone and until people start getting better quality material thats not poisoned or lampooned by corporate to make it as universal as possible this is what you will get every time resting on laurels they did not come close to what it could have been
Mar 18 2021,negative,it was exciting at first but when the dust settled the realization of what they had done to the past storylines kylo renbens redemption rey taking on the skywalker namesmacks my head and the hokey palpatine is back just left me disappointed in more ways than one
Mar 17 2021,negative,the rise of skywalker is a really fun movie in fact a lot of action and adventure kids will love this movie however adults will certainly roll their eyes a few times with the very obvious flaws in the script for this film the construction of its narrative and the characters that appear to have been created by a 4yearold child
Mar 17 2021,negative,the movie was not good because it follows a story line that was ended by george lucas in episode 6 overall bad movie dont watch it
Mar 16 2021,negative,i have never hated a movie as much as i hate this one the first 2 sequels left me unimpressed but without spoiling anything this movie actively dismantles the story told by the original trilogy this movie should not exist
Mar 15 2021,negative,only good thing about whole sequels is kylo ren
Mar 14 2021,positive,a satisfying end to the skywalker saga  the rise of skywalker was a total improvement over the last jedi and brought back fun and actionpacked adventure  even though jj abrams played it safe and predictable the rise of skywalker is a solid final film
Mar 14 2021,negative,pace is unbearable story line is congested just entirely too ambitious and ready to serve you expect steak but get an old school tv dinner i lived for sw as a kid but cant rewatch this one its jacked
Mar 13 2021,positive,really wellmade and full of action drama and unexpected parts
Mar 13 2021,positive,great star wars movie in its own right
Mar 12 2021,positive,i genuinely really like this movie its definitely not the best star wars movie in my books but its still great i dont know if i just absolutely love star wars but this movie was great im not ashamed to say that some scenes made me cry lol overall great movie not the best but great
Mar 12 2021,positive,for anyone who hated the last jedi rest assured jj abrams gave you a worthy conclusion to this trilogy this is on par with the force awakens if not better at times a wonderfully dark film that paces well as the longest star wars at 2 hours and 21 minutes for everything that has been written about this new trilogy over the years while i was never a big fan of it and i wont miss these characters as much as other characters from the past i hope this is indeed the end of the cannon if disney wants to do spinoffs or movies with new characters thats fine i think over the course of the last 40 years this cows been milked dry
Mar 11 2021,negative,after the poor writing jarring comedy plot holes lack of understanding of the force character assassinations throwaway deaths and astonishingly stupid ending meant the last jedi tlj had summited the mountain of awful it seems like jj abrams said hold my beer and created the rise of skywalker to show he can outdumb rian johnson without breaking a sweat
Mar 9 2021,positive,meh  it could of been worst
Mar 8 2021,negative,what a mess an awful end to a trilogy that should have never been made
Mar 7 2021,negative,cant say much that hasnt been said before an average attempt to salvage what was a broken trilogy the failures a too long to list heres hoping the whole trilogy will eventually be decanonized unfortunately even that will never resolve the missed opportunity of having those original characters on screen together a mistake of abrams own making in any case no one will be interested in these movies or these characters in a decade let alone 50 years from now
Mar 7 2021,negative,terrible with so many plot holes not as bad as last jedi but not far off it
Mar 5 2021,negative,what can i say darth vaders sacrifice was completely trashed there was no worldbuilding or imagination and the characters were hardly developed the acting was pretty good though and the special effects were great nobody gives enough credit to any of the behind the scenes i also did not like how they minimized rose tico i thought she was the best thing to come out of the last jedi
Mar 3 2021,negative,this is rotten crap jj abrams has to go in prison for this very poorly scripted fastpaced movie that keeps going forward no emotion such a bad ending to the star wars franchise palpatine coming back was confusing and dumb the cgi is pretty horrible in my eyes  not the worst  overall im proud that i didnt watch this at cinema skip this movie and the entire sequel trilogi  20152019  and you wont miss anything another ruined franchise
Mar 3 2021,negative,it was just awful gave up watching
Feb 28 2021,positive,its not what i wanted but i can appreciate it for what it is
Feb 28 2021,negative,its quite a surprise to see disney be so lazy with a franchise as big as star wars they the plot contradicts itself the characters remained undeveloped and palpatines return was a joke the worst installment in the entire saga
Feb 27 2021,negative,the writing is terrible to say the least nearly every character goes back twenty steps if they went one ahead in tlj jj tried to cancel rian johnsons work in the previous movie creating holes as big as the xystons and making the saga end in one of the worst ways possible
Feb 26 2021,positive,daisy ridley and adam driver do their best but its not enough to save this movie
Feb 25 2021,positive,an honourable end to the saga the way they brough palpatine back but didnt undo anything done in the original was key the explanation of snoke was weak and needed more background to how palpatine was reys grandfather but the return of lando makes this film worth the watch
Feb 25 2021,negative,terrible writing awful characters
Feb 24 2021,negative,the plot has so many holes and completely illogical turns that you simply stop caring about what happens after fifteen minutes on top of that the main characters are hollow and onedimensional with no character arch whatsoever a comparison with the game of thrones finale comes close to hand but at least games of thrones had some good acting all the way to the disappointing end which is more than you can say about the rise of skywalker with the exception of adam driver
Feb 23 2021,negative,the second part already was bad for a star wars movie the third part just confirmed certain suspicions i already had concerning the character arcs dialogues are still poor plot armor remains character arcs are just built on outdated ideas and principles that are wrong in many ways they not only dont fit into the overall star wars idea they are also outdated in terms of our modern culture its like they tried to write a pirates of the carribean story in the 1980s
Feb 23 2021,negative,perhaps the worst movie ever made
Feb 23 2021,negative,its sad to see that a movie called the rise of skywalker is the downfall of starwars and an insult to many long lasting fans
Feb 22 2021,positive,it felt rushed at times but was ultimately a satisfying end to the skywalker saga
Feb 21 2021,negative,they were riding space horses on top of star destroyers  rey is still the strongest and has no rival  more fake jedi powers that help the writers move the plot along  just a terrible movie dont bother stick with the first six dont watch these three is you really love star wars
Feb 21 2021,negative,this movie is just a random series of compltely unexplained objectives and events so the characters have something to do for example suddenly they really need this one dagger that youve never heard of so they get it but then they cant read it without doing this thing with c3po which youve never heard of so they go do that its nonstop nonsense that isnt even consisten with itself but some massive plot holes that destroy the credibility of the entire series if it had any left at this point
Feb 20 2021,positive,it is rare that one movie makes me like two others much less  those two being the force awakens and the last jedi star wars purists can say what they want but the real issue for me was seeing that there was no plan for these movies from the start that being said it was an entertaining watch
Feb 20 2021,negative,the pacing was awful the plot was awful and far too contrived tlj gave this movie a tough handicap but this film did nothing to help itself or save the trilogy
Feb 18 2021,negative,very poor film with more holes than plot more original trilogy characters sacrificed in an attempt to win fan approval  truly terrible film please disney learn the lessen and have people involved that love the saga and ditch the sequel trilogy still not sure what the point of the sequel trilogy was  was there a central plot character development a new story arc linking to the original films oh no just a vehicle to make money
Feb 18 2021,negative,somehow palpatine is back ok thats just lazy writing at its finest
Feb 17 2021,negative,this movie is and slaps the face of everyone that loves star wars
Feb 17 2021,negative,this movie is heart breakingly bad so bad that it not only ruined the already questionably sequel trilogy but all of star wars for me thats right this film is so awful that it makes the original star wars unwatchable by association how you ask  start with the premise emperor palpatine is randomly back from the dead for unexplained reasons this immediately ruins the first order as villains turning them from interesting neofascists to puppets of the emperor it also ruins the arc of return of the jedi and vaders sacrifice  the emperor has somehow built himself a fleet of thousands of star destroyers on a random planet with no industrial capacity this continues the sequel trilogys complete disinterest in creating a vaguely plausible universe the entire new republic was in one star system space ships do stern chases until they run out of fuel a fringe political splinter group can build a bigger weapon than a centralized government but takes it to new levels yes epic requires suspension of disbelief but it requires its own internal logic and world building you need to be able to imagine beyond the conflict on the screen  it only goes downhill from here lando gets a cameo but no characterization smoke gets handwaved kylo gets redeemed everything interesting set up in the previous two movies is tossed aside
Feb 16 2021,negative,this movie looked great as did all the sequel trilogy but my god was it laughably awful
Feb 16 2021,negative,only reason it got half a star was because i cant give 0 actually deserves a negative 5 min see w
Feb 16 2021,positive,beautifully crafted visuals serviceable action and some heartfelt moments barely make up for the mishandled plot and questionable dialogue
Feb 15 2021,negative,absolutely abysmally boring plot and horrific pacing nothing in the plot is earned and every event felt like plot device with no substance the entire film relied on pure fan service to drive the plot forward and completely failed in almost every way jj abrams proves himself to be talentless and never takes any sort of risks in this film force power invented in this film are straight up disgrace to the legacy  truly abysmal film and i hope jj abrams never returns again to make another soulless and forgettable cash grab
Feb 15 2021,positive,overall i like this movie there was a lot of action throughout the movie the movie was engaging and easy to watch i like how the special effects were not overly done it was very surprising to see what happens to leia and c3po it definitely marked the end of an era not to mention the progressional growth of rey throughout the movie taking the story in a different direction i hope that chewbacca continues to be that one character that ties the new stories back to the original trilogies
Feb 12 2021,negative,very bad a lot more worse than the prequels
Feb 6 2021,positive,a film made with all the heart for fans and a true star wars adventure for those who want to start following the franchise 
Feb 3 2021,negative,everything about this movie sucks trying to fix the mess that the last jedi left and failing even more so dont waste your time its good we now have a real star wars story the mandalorian created by real directors and producers that care about it and not just about money
Feb 3 2021,negative,jar jar interests me more than rey
Feb 1 2021,positive,perfect movie this movie is action filled there are references to old movies and shows and more its absolutely fantastic palpatines return is done so well and rey saying shes  a skywalker is a perfect end to the saga
Jan 31 2021,negative,i enjoy any goodentertaining movie this was badboring but i watched to end for any redeemable qualities  tros  not part of the sequel triology  if it is then it is the worst of trilogy  whole star wars saga  actual title v title it should have been   star wars sequal trilogy v star wars new generation  sw tfa v the estranged skywalkerlost jedi pros decent reboot new characters kylo ren  sw tlj v the dark skywalkerthe redeemable skywalker pros new sw concepts character developmentarcs  kylorenrey dyad force  sw tros v the last skywalkerthe end of skywalkers pros 1 for visuals actors  crew did decent job with rubbish everything else  story screenplay directing  editing i hated the last 30 minutes only saving grace of whole movie was kyloben arc the blue lightsaber at last  all his fight scenes  this trilogy only works if you think of them as life of kylo renjourney of solo
Jan 29 2021,positive,it was an exciting end to the saga but it suffered from a lack of adventure and imagination the movies dedication to its fans was a nice move sadly nobody ever understands the true beauty of saying goodbye by dedicating a masterpiece to its longtime viewers
Jan 26 2021,negative,dear lord this was a mess beyond belief  i have a fanboy since the first movie   a bigger fan after the second movie slight more fanatical after the return of the jedi ewoks took me down a notch  the next three prequels were so so with some hits and some misses  episode 7 and 8 i can deal with even if it seems to be a rehash with variations  but episode 9 caused a bigger disturbance in the force than the destruction of alderaan   i actually sighed and say gimme a break several times throughout the movie  can this movie be taken out of the star wars canon  please    even so i still love the sw universe
Jan 14 2021,positive,great film as with all films go see and make up your own mind  visually stunning conclusion to the skywalker saga 
Jan 13 2021,negative,the worst of the sequel trilogy nothing made sense jj tried to reverse the last jedi but created a mess a lot of fan service but nothing had any impact several fake deaths and unlogical elements terrible movie
Jan 11 2021,negative,so luke wants to find the way finder then just gives up also this movie completely makes return of the jedi a waste of time how is ray so overpowered so fast with so little training what a convoluted mess i hope in the future they make this movie an alternative timeline
Jan 7 2021,negative,this movie was an attempt to salvage the previous two in the sequel series still not good though
Dec 31 2020,negative,garbage  total disrespect towards every aspect of the lore of the sw fandom
Dec 31 2020,negative,complete manure disney absolutely destroyed the greatest ip in history
Dec 31 2020,positive,pros great performances from ridley and driver genuine heart in its filmmaking respect for what was appealing about star wars from the beginning loveable aliens and droids fantastic score fantastic climax no shock deaths an uplifting message about what defines a person and a satisfyinglyhopeful and happy ending  cons boyega is somewhat underutilized somewhat uneven pacing retconning of promising plot points from the previous film and lightsaber duels feel too short
Dec 31 2020,positive,i thought it was an action packed fast paced story well told as an ending to the saga  although sad to see it end  the end was fitting  daisy ridley and adam driver performances were fantastic  ive watched this over and over and like the other episodes will watch it again and again
Dec 30 2020,positive,perfect ending to the saga i loved the movie in addition to containing so many exciting moments the film manages to remind you of the real star wars
Dec 30 2020,neutral,this was one huge missed opportunity if jj could let go of the original star wars trilogy and actually write something creative and new for once in his life then maybe this movie wouldnt have been such a mess bringing back the emperor from the dead seriously i get that people hated last jedi but at least rian tried to do something unique build off of it but instead jj just denied it and contradicted it the film was a lazy sloppy disappointment   ps if you are going to give rey a new light saber either have her use it or dont have it at all dick
Dec 30 2020,negative,50 plot holes seemingly no respect for the established story had low expectations still disappointed
Dec 30 2020,neutral,disappointing storyline
Dec 30 2020,negative,an underwhelming chapter to end the skywalker saga full of subplots and its too illogical ways to course correct the franchise really dragged this movie down
Dec 29 2020,negative,who in the world in the audience gave this good review to be 86 now i know rt is a paid platform this makes no sense this movie was horrible and im not even a big sw fan but i know enough about it to know this storyline is way off its origin
Dec 29 2020,neutral,i could tell they just made things up while making this movie whats next your going to tell me obi wan has a son who lives in naboo i expected better since this is the closure of the skywalker saga
Dec 29 2020,negative,if youve just watched the first 6 starwars movies dont bother to watch the sequels disney really fucked up on them but their spinoffs are great the skywalker saga ended when revenge of the sith was released and its a shame to call the sequels a part of the same storyline
Dec 29 2020,negative,much of the film featured a convoluted plot with rushed storytelling a disappointing way for the saga to end the writers seem more interested in showing off what they think looks cool fan service instead of crafting a thoughtful and engaging story
Dec 29 2020,negative,horrible dishonours the original real star wars
Dec 29 2020,positive,although the movie is not without quirks flaws and plot holes the cinematography themes and overarching story of the rise of skywalker make it a solid star wars outing with a great conclusion for the sequel trilogy and all 9 star wars episodic films
Dec 29 2020,negative,ok palpatine being back like totally negates anakins arc its like the filmmakers got scared with the audience response of the last jedi and were doing damage control but the plot of the way finder the dyad of the force  what all nonplots crammed into this im just done
Dec 29 2020,positive,not much to do after the disaster of the previous still lacks creativity and coherence
Dec 29 2020,negative,emotions are not for sharing  pablo hidalgo  lucasfilm story group
Dec 29 2020,negative,this movie is at least twice as bad as the last one my review for the last one  i hate this movie with a passion its so idiotic it makes the prequels seem good it honestly hurts to watch it so yeah not good
Dec 28 2020,negative,the rise of skywalker more like the rise of failure
Dec 28 2020,negative,as a movie id give it 510 but as a star wars movie 110 also nice job at freezing the audience score
Dec 28 2020,negative,this movie is a fireworks show in other words you can watch and enjoy what is happening on screen but if you think about it for even a second it all falls apart so much time is spent undoing the last jedi that it never develops its own story even though i did not like the last jedi i dont think spending a movie undoing it was necessary it copies endgame blatantly but with none of the emotional impact plot points are left completely unexplained and in trying to please everyone they pleased no one
Dec 28 2020,negative,this film was awful so mary sue palpatine calls herself rey skywalker at the end  the emperor wins the skywalker family all dead  what a mess
Dec 28 2020,negative,this movie is just a disgrace to the star wars franchise sure ok there was a good part of the movie at the end its called the credits check it out oh and at the start the part where star wars goes on screen and the music starts playing the text scroll was terrible though
Dec 28 2020,negative,horrible   spoiler     essentially makes all 9 movies about palpatine ruins the original 3
Dec 21 2020,negative,this movie is an excellent example of how to make a bad movie i still have a hard time believing this is really something that costs hundreds of millions of dollars with all that money they apparently neglected to hire one star wars fan to tell them it was awful none of the plot made any sense the special effects were average for any basic movie nowadays the directing was nothing like the actual star wars movies as it lacked the juxtaposition demonstrated in the real movies darth sidious just explains the plot instead of having real lines i am not sure who thought it was awesome to attack a ship with space horses it was the stupidest part of any star wars movie i mean wow space horses it was hard to top force ghosts interacting with things but they did these people are stupid stop destroying star wars please
Dec 21 2020,negative,its overall average although despite the flashy action and rushed story i was still bored enough to do the dishes halfway through entirely forgettable like the rest of the new trilogy
Dec 18 2020,negative,it is sad to see how the star wars story got treated with so much disrespect so little planning and so little originality this is the worst film of the low quality fan fiction with ridiculously high budgetcontinuation to george lucas original triology i wont watch it again and regret watching it after the disappointment of the first two disneystar wars film
Dec 14 2020,positive,the most underrated movie ever
Dec 13 2020,positive,loved it to bits i do get why its hated but i thought it was a fun action film with a amazing twist not the best star wars film not by a long shot but i still loved it
Dec 9 2020,positive,this was honestly the best movie of the sequel trilogy and a very great closer to the skywalker saga jj abrams finally got this trilogy right back on track after the last jedis plot holes almost sent this franchise right down the toilet it had finality fastpaced action great messages and some nice dialogue this to me is the star wars that i know and absolutely love 
Dec 9 2020,positive,this film was ok they were obviously trying to do to much in suck little time the film feels very rushed at times the acting is great but the story plot wholes kinda make it hard to appreciate the great performances and great action scenes speaking of action this is one of the best of the entire saga i love kylos arc over the last 3 films reys arc could have been done a little better with her being the main protagonist i felt as if jj abrams saw what rian johnson did with  the last jedi and tried to fix it but it was already to little to late overall descent star wars film but with it being the finale i along with all star wars fans expected better
Dec 1 2020,negative,nothing make sense the story is stupid at best and the cuts will make you eyes bleed
Nov 30 2020,negative,i thought that this movie is definitely the worst in the star wars saga it only gets a star because the effects and action were great but everything else was a disaster
Nov 30 2020,positive,a fitting finale to the star wars series one of the best star wars movies of the new production up there with rogue one
Nov 29 2020,positive,personally i didnt find it as troubling as the last jedi but seeing this was the conclusion of 42 years worth of movies and storytelling it really needed to be either 2 movies or 3 hours long
Nov 27 2020,negative,a poorly planned end to a poorly planned trilogy
Nov 26 2020,negative,the most awful and horrible star wars movie  not even solo was this disappointing disgusting i hate you daisy ridley and wish you everything bad in life jj abrams ill never forgive you you truly crapped in the sw franchise with this scum
Nov 26 2020,positive,8th time watching this adam driver doesnt get old
Nov 26 2020,negative,half a star is a generous amount of stars given this film was an absolute abomination to this saga sith lord emperor palpatine should have eliminated every character introduced during this terrible trilogy i think that the monkeys repairing rens helmet could have come up with a better film than this joe biden himself could have stuttered out a more complete movie than this garbage i wish that babu could free my memory from this disgrace of a trilogy as he did with c3po the only part of this entire trilogy i found entertaining is when kylo ren died bb8 is technologically impaired and it is unable to even open simple doorways or passages the insignificant droid had to be carried up a small hill to survive disney you have failed me for the last timedarth vader my disappointments immeasurable and my day is ruined ps finn is useless
Nov 25 2020,negative,the big finale to the skywalker saga and we dont even get a big lightsaber fight at the end it relies on the holy trinity from the original trilogy to be great however when two of them have been killed off and with carrie fisher dying in real life theres nothing really you can do with them poe gets an unoriginal and dull back story finn is their too i think rey is a good character but the sudden romance that was never built up was pointless and was there really no better ideas than to make her a palpitine the movie just feels like a wasted opportunity
Nov 23 2020,positive,how can i stop watching this   amazing  realy amazing
Nov 23 2020,negative,god awful so many garbage plot devices and a pulls none of this movie made sense this entire trilogy as a whole was pointless i only pray we never see episode ten
Nov 22 2020,negative,ive been a star wars fan since i was a kid and this movie the rise of skywalker was a mess never have i been so unbelievably frustrated while watching a movie in the theater i honestly dont know where to begin first off this easily could have been made into two or three fairly decent films but unfortunately this movie was rushed from beginning to end important plot revelations were sloppily thrown into the script without any setup from the previous two films in the trilogy the sheer amount of retcons shoved down the audiences throat to appease those who disliked the last jedi which i also didnt enjoy were mind boggling and im not even going to talk about the insulting amount of inyourface fan service moments which despite their efforts did not make me care in the slightest about what was going on i felt nothing there were a few redeeming qualities for example the visual effects were stunning and the acting was pretty good there were a few jokes here and there that brought a chuckle out of me but overall the rise of skywalker was so forgettable that its honestly hard to write this review right now and i watched it like a month ago
Nov 22 2020,negative,they should have called it star wars the rise of deus ex machina  there is a single redeeming quality to this movie well maybe two  the first is the line poe dameron spice runner runner of spice  the second is that the yellow lightsaber is cool  but everything else is so inconceivably horrendous that you just have to wonder why jj abrams would do this to us  the force awakens was a sign of the death of star wars movies and this is the final nail in the coffin
Nov 19 2020,positive,the ending of this movie franchise was like tying a shoe you tied the laces but you ended up with a knot around your ankles it provided us with the sheer example of a lack of energy as well as proving over and over again that you have to have forty eyes to spot the millisecond homosexuality in the background the directors are cowards
Nov 17 2020,negative,this movie just like the rest of the new ones didnt make any sense whatsoever i truly understand now when daisy ridley said in an interview that the writers had no idea who was going to be the big bad in the last episode since they killed off snoke in the previous movie palpatine coming back made zero sense since there wasnt any buildup in the previous movies whatsoever and him being beaten by a mary sue character that didnt have any character development at all she acquired all her jedi powers and mastering the lightsaber in such a short time with any shortcomings unlike the previous main characters so palpatine being defeated so easily is just ridiculous sad that the writers didnt know what they were doing at all and turned an interesting character like rey into one of the worst ever made
Nov 16 2020,positive,i grew up with the originals and have to say i dont get what the critics have a problem with this was a really fun exciting and satisfying star wars film maybe a tad rushed could have stood to at 3045 minutes to its runtime but otherwise great tieins with the original trilogy great send off for han and leia luke makes a fun appearance and rey gets to fulfill her destiny my kids were in tears afterward if that tells you anything
Nov 16 2020,negative,star wars is my favorite movie franchise but this movie has plot holes and gives abilities that are not consistent with the rest of the franchise or even with itself i did not think that characters actions made sense there was hardly any character development and the whole movie felt like it was full of irritating and predictable plot twists but no real substance
Nov 16 2020,negative,the only good thing about this movie was palpatine the worst thing was the force power of pulling a lightsaber out of thin air sucks and ruins it for me
Nov 15 2020,negative,as an action film it was just okay and the pacing was all over the place and feels like it was made for the tik tok generation attention spans   as a star wars film its horribly disappointing
Nov 12 2020,negative,horrendous the entire trilogy is shambles its extremely obvious the entire movie is fan service made but it fails in that aspect as well it destroyed the meaning of the movies that came before it only to sell quick seats in the theater  technically the pacing is a mess its like trying to cram 3 movies into one the characters have no meaning and palpatines return is cringe at best  go watch the mandalorian instead and save time
Nov 12 2020,negative,this film is unwatchable and is evidence of a lack of direction from lucasfilm it is clear that there was not a distinguishable outline for the film much less the trilogy
Nov 12 2020,negative,it took me 3 times to finally finish watching it this movie is such a lame why did they choose abrams  he made so many bad movies how could it be any different i dont mind if anyone liked it but there is absolutly no chance i ll watch 78 and 9 ever again 
Nov 12 2020,negative,its like jj and his cowriter didnt even have an ounce of creativity to spare with higher up executive politics and a fan base of unapologetic nerds they had to appease i dont blame them for not following through with rians vision for the next star wars movie and cramming so much of what jj wanted to do in episode eight in to this movie and once again they basically copy pasting the whole movie from the return of the jedi which was such a cop out and the constant pandering to the audiance was not earned
Nov 11 2020,positive,i will admit i give it a 5 stars because of the filmography and the acting however i would give it a 4 and a half due to the story outcome and plot
Nov 11 2020,negative,this film is entirely nonsensical but i dont think ive laughed this much in a while not at the jokes or anything just the sheer unadulterated chaos that was jj abrams trying to fix this abomination of a story
Nov 10 2020,negative,please this movie is horrible it ruined pretty much everything that made star wars amazing they shouldnt have made this star wars ended with episode 6
Nov 10 2020,negative,the utter balls disney had to release this film is amazing  this film is a mess  a big mess there are only two things i like about this film is the cgi and the cinematography i remember i was  about 10 when the force awakens came out and that was the first star wars film i ever saw and after that i became a star was fanatic until solo came out and i lost interest  not saying solo is a bad film its jet kind of dull than the others and when i saw this in theaters when it came out it was like i was watching the 2013 oldboy and it was so unimaginative yesterday i watched it again to see the problems and the things it did right firstly their are scenes that drag on for way way to long and it was very annoying the plot is the exact same as episode 6 the score is fine the editing is ok and the sound is decent the good things are the cinematography and the cgi the film has a lot of nice shots in the film especially the use of color and the cg well its a star wars film their are a lot of unnecessary stuff and unnecessary characters over all this film shows that disney needs to stop this nonsense and die this film is a 4610  ps if their is a hell this film is going their
Nov 9 2020,positive,this movie is a perfect conclusion for all the skywalker saga in the star wars universe  the first part place a lot of situation and the second part finish all of them with a lof of emotions  the ending is very powerfull and the visuals are greats  the characters are well played by the actors and its always to watch this movie again and again 12 times for me xd one of the best star wars movie of course but he have some defaults which create a difference or speed between tfa and tlj but that change nothing about the movie which is like tlj a masterpiece of the galaxie far far away
Nov 9 2020,negative,the story was trash and leia died for no reason and jedi can heal people for some reason and that would have been useful many times in the past and the end fight scene sucked i wanted all the jedi spirits to help the rebellion defeat the dark side but no all we got was shit
Nov 8 2020,negative,an absolutely disjointed storyline leaves the audience frustrated up until a baffling twist at the end character story archs are left unresolved and some of the most interesting stories are introduced in the last half of the movie and left out of the spotlight
Nov 8 2020,negative,i was almost bored to death by this disney just erase this from canon
Nov 7 2020,positive,this movie was a disaster and an adventure at the same time it had some stupid plots like palpatine returning the newest trilogy feels more about the rebels than the jedi
Nov 6 2020,negative,pathetic no other words ruins what theyve already destroyed in so many ways i watched this movie 3 years after release having wish i just never did being such a huge fan
Nov 4 2020,positive,a great ending to the star wars skywalker saga a better ending than resident evil the final chapter
Nov 4 2020,positive,and the disney star wars ended with that with lots of spinoff in the makings   it is better than the prequels  but in my opinion not as good as the originals
Nov 3 2020,positive,good movie if you were born right before the digitally mastered episodes 46 in the 1990s you would definitely want to make watching the last trilogy of star wars as part of the bucket list yes there are plotholes in the movie but they summed up of what happened in previous star wars movies in my perspective to the best of their ability my life is mainly complete now
Nov 3 2020,negative,unfortunately terrible a terrible waste of potential and excitement a chaotic mess of contrived plot devices forced coincidences fetch quests and fakeout deaths disappointing and unstructured
Nov 2 2020,negative,the new saga ends with a fast paced mess of a film this film is all over the place characters are introduced and never used the action feels too planned and the story is just thrown together the acting is great but everything down to the editing is so fast paced it feels more like a recap than an actual story the finale of the movie is set to be a massive battle and is just horribly executed there isnt any stakes and a lot feels like fan service they had potential with this new trilogy and as the movies went on they just decided to just run with whatever they got sadly this is a messy way to end something so beloved
Nov 2 2020,negative,this movie ruins star wars cannon beyond belief the force healing ability destroyed anakins sacrifice luke gets treated like a pathetic loser who gets beat by everyone finn has no character at all he is just the goofball rebel who shouts rey like 60 of the movie when the movie is set up as a come to terms with who you are and rey just disregards that and just takes the name skywalker because palpatine is evil wtf is that take the name of the family whose legacy you just ruined lets just hope that the next star wars movie i either way in the future or way in the past god forbid another sequel trilogy based on this crap
Nov 2 2020,negative,another boring disaster its way worse than the prequels boring and uninspiring
Nov 1 2020,negative,what happens when you make a film that gives a certain segment of the star wars fan base what they want you get a rotten tomato that must immediately go straight into the garbage compacter
Oct 31 2020,negative,lack of relying on classic famous star wars characters constantly defying established star wars lore character arc development is abandoned constantly trying to constantly pull emotional gimmicks creates ridiculous seemingly invincible villains and then needs to create ridiculous seemingly invincible heroes big budget does not mean quality
Oct 30 2020,negative,absurdly horrible  its not impossible to get me to like a new star wars movie i really like rogue one but it just needs to make sense and have a purpose i would venture to say that jj abrams is one of the worst directors out there and worse than rian awful awful
Oct 30 2020,negative,trash the plot is ridiculous lots of the scenes dont make sense a disgrace to george lucas creation
Oct 30 2020,neutral,the movie was fine but i saw some red flags  1 palpatine coming back to life is what i hate the most about this movie im okay with the force beating out balance and have if to be restored again but palpatine should stayed dead and let someone else be the main bad guy of star wars  2 the ending is basically a rip off of independence day a message of hope helps  unite people to fight agents an invasion force and the weak spot on their ships is under the bell canons  3 destroying a planet we barley know seriously why destroy kijimi when they could destroy a planet like mon cala or chandrila or maybe coruscantlothal or kashyyyk
Oct 30 2020,negative,wasnt a fan old films were better
Oct 29 2020,negative,my god was this movie dissapointing the skywalker saga and star wars is a very very loved franchise and it deserved so much more as an ending disney completely ignored the source material the name anakin isnt mentioned once in the entire trilogy btw and the directors couldnt agree on their ideas we had no explanation as to why palpatine came back and for all we know he could come back anytime the dialogue is childish and cringey too and to be honest the only thing saving this movie from getting half star from me is the soundtrack other than that awful movie i do not recommend
Oct 28 2020,positive,this movie revisited the star wars we all grew up with wellexecuted and choreographed action scenes a house of cards built around the cast a soundtrack that immerses you and a thrill ride of nostalgia
Oct 26 2020,negative,as incredible as it might be star wars defines a whole universe to explore but this film is just a repetition of the first trilogys drama disappointing
Oct 26 2020,negative,the rise of skywalker is a disappointing ending of a trilogy that doesnt connect anything and goes nowhere and to a saga that deserved better rian johnsons work was so much better but disney gave in critics that occurred to empire strikes back too and this film happened sad
Oct 25 2020,negative,although this film has some of the best scenes of the entire saga luke raising the xwing bendemption leia its the weakest star wars film of all time it retconned so much of what was established in the last jedi and bringing back the emperor just cheapens the chosen one prophecy and thereby episodes i6  although ian mcdiarmid was absolutely phenomenal and frightning as hell i just wish they had stuck with colin trevorrows duel of the fates
Oct 25 2020,positive,honestly enjoyed it not as bad as people say i liked how it was wrapped up satisfying
Oct 25 2020,positive,entertaining but a very standard end to the skywalker saga wouldve worked better split into two movies
Oct 23 2020,positive,i found this movie to be a bit of a mess if i am honest tlj was totally not what jj abrams would have took star wars and so he spent most of the movie retconning the plot points it was a welcome return for ian mcdiarmids darth sidious but also felt forced and contrived the whole rey is his granddaughter also made zero sense there was also the question of exactly who snoke was was he controlled by palpatine by the force was he his own person and if so how could he be force sensitive if he was made in a lab again very muddled and clumsy story telling it was better than tlj though
Oct 22 2020,positive,the rise of skywalker is what you get when you try and please everybody
Oct 21 2020,positive,perfect ending to the saga
Oct 21 2020,negative,awful id rather watch prequels at least those movies made me laugh this trilogy did the opposite it pisses me off
Oct 20 2020,positive,i dont care what other people say this movie was good a lot happened it wasnt a great end to a 9 film saga but it was a good end to the trilogy
Oct 20 2020,negative,the one thing that i respect about this film is its originality in plot which is truly the only good thing that can be said about this film its a fun movie if you completely disregard the legalistics and the logic of the whole plot which for me personally is impossible to do the main example of this is palpatine that he cloned snoke and that he conveniently had a fleet of star destroyers under an ocean of ice which were all equipped with hundreds of red stormtroopers and pilots all of this completely contradicts everything that the sequels were building up to and seriously how on earth were all of those final order people in star destroyers under the ice ocean suppose to still be alive after 20 years so if your somehow able to look past the incomprehensible plot you might enjoy it but i just like to pretend this movie never happened and is a truly dreadful 410 film
Oct 18 2020,positive,being a star wars fan and see this eh kinda predictable to see rey real identity but other than that worth it
Oct 17 2020,negative,im upset that zero stars is not an option if george lucas were already passed hed be spinning in his grave so i cant even imagine the living equivalent
Oct 16 2020,negative,badly ridden badly paced mess that had characters with no character arch and were badly i didnt either like that movie was made to be one big scavenger hunt with no consequences and destruction of the stakes and achievements of the original trilogy sparkles of nostalgia were not merely enough to  save this to be fair it wasnt easiest job to pick up the pieces of the destruction that the last jedi caused but in many cases this movie just made it worse
Oct 15 2020,neutral,i mean its decent not an abomination like last jedi but they didnt do the one things fans wanted anakin as a force ghost the voice wasnt enough
Oct 14 2020,negative,poorly written incoherent schizophrenic and trashes decades of star wars lore  a dumpster fire of a movie that i wish had never been created
Oct 13 2020,negative,i sat through the movie and everything felt off it took me a while to piece together why yes its star wars yes it has some amazing visuals but its an overall flop the writing and editing offf its rotten a stunning lack of depth shallow characters with little to no development and their motivations in any meaningful way are nonexistent im baffled sometimes as how writers actually get their job do they not need to interview or prove they can write star wars for me is only 6 episodes long
Oct 12 2020,negative,an absolute missed opportunity to perhaps to make this whole trilogy work and make sense unfortunately its a mess i dont blame jj for everything it seems a lot of issues were forced rather than nice storytelling
Oct 11 2020,negative,this movie utilizes nostalgia well has one or two really touching scenes and has pacing fast enough so that the movie isnt boring  but the plot is nonsensical and the script is awful the ending is pointless and redundant and it does not add anything good to the franchise
Oct 9 2020,negative,shit that expels shit
Oct 7 2020,positive,the extreme lack of creativity in replacing a previously dead character compromises the experience in addition to taking all the credit from luke and darth vader which is a shame as the first half of the film is very cool with good action scenes and very entertaining but overall its fun
Oct 5 2020,positive,best one of star wurs
Oct 4 2020,positive,a grand piece of art delivering a beautifully heart wrenching yet satisfying end to a great saga while preserving all of its brilliant mannerisms that we have come to love from star wars
Oct 3 2020,negative,people that died obvious deaths are back to life people can reach out and touch you from 1000 miles away only by thinking about it people can drain power from others like a nintendo game but also can magically heal others by shear willdisney and abrams do not have ideas this is a lazy rehashers idea of brilliance
Sep 29 2020,positive,after the hideous previous film this is a difficult climb from down the barrel not perfect at all but less annoying than expected
Sep 29 2020,neutral,kinda weird also this whole resurrection of palpatine is farfetched
Sep 28 2020,positive,yes this movie has plot holes and conveniences yes its really unimaginative in areas tlj and tfa werent imaginative as well though tbh so i dont get that criticism but i thought this was a really satisfying end to the star wars saga the acting is obviously impressive with driver ridley and mcdiarmid being standouts the visual effects and sound design is amazing the score despite being the weakest of the 9 movies is still great i love the interactions with rey poe and finn i love reys struggle with the dark side and contrary to popular belief i liked rey as a palpatine and it tied well with her struggle of the dark kylo rens struggle with the light is also cool and his reunion with han is beautiful leia was implemented much more than i thought even though carrie fisher sadly died and her death scene was really emotional the hearing of the jedi voices was incredible and the action sequences are phenomneal particularly the final battle and lightsaber duel its just an entertaining time and i like all the callbacks to previous movies it truly feels like an emotional finale  theres things i didnt like though finn is given such little to do the knights of ren are sadly wasted palpatine coming back is really lazy but since i love the character it didnt bother me too much and the story is quite predictable and safe but i dont care what any of the haters say this is an incredible movie and as someone who despised the last jedi it was a joy seeing this movie shit on it a
Sep 28 2020,negative, the pacing is terrible at it feels like the mantra of the director was lets throw in everything plus a kitchen sink even if it makes little sense  absolutely delirious film that is a plot device in itself  the worst star wars film by a hefty margin
Sep 26 2020,negative,lazy and unoriginal a huge disappointment to an otherwise promising trilogy
Sep 25 2020,positive,it was great to go back to movies and see this movie  my first star wars move was return of the jedi in 2nd grade my son 21 yo wanted to see it too  it was great time and still a great movie 
Sep 24 2020,negative,different characters different scenes but story line and plot similar to the originals fairly disappointed
Sep 23 2020,negative,it was balanced but failed to provide the originality that the two previous trilogies have given us disney should have been more avantgardist rather than being fan pleasing
Sep 23 2020,negative,the viewing left me disenfranchised
Sep 22 2020,negative,a most offencive action agaist star wars fandom an affront to our inteligence
Sep 22 2020,positive,this review contains spoilers     ok so lets get this started im going to be up front with you all this was one of my most anticipated movies of the year as i enjoyed the last two yes i enjoyed the last jedi unlike a lot of other people  i thought it was a interesting direction and cinematically  beautiful like force awakens  however i am extremely mixed on this movie there was a lot i liked and a lot i didnt  ill start with the positive great performances all around the film is shot and effects and are all beautiful and the story has some good elements like theirs a scene in which force healing is used to heal a light saber wound and theres a scene where ray is seeing something and heres the voice of all the jedi and the light sabre battles are outstanding   amongst many other cool things like mental force battles  the films comes across to me as somewhat satisfying and other parts of it not so much   the film kinda drags itself out in places what i assumed would be an epic end light sabre battle was not and much shorter than i expected  the emperors return was not as explained as i would like as good as it was to see one of the most iconic characters back i expected more behind it some characters conclusion like huxnfelt so rushed to get it over with   over all its a well made film with great performances battles and effects and maybe would of worked somewhat better as a second part to a middle instalment if you take away the last half hour as opposed to the final of a saga consisting of 8 main films and 2 spin offs  now its not secret star wars has a ridiculous toxic fan base that never seem to be satisfied and that made its way in to this movie  its fells more like a fan made  thing as opposed doing its own thing fans were annoyed to hell by how similar the force awakens was to a new hope and hated rains direction because it didnt meet their fan theorys of finding out who rays parents were amongs other things or some that liked the idea of raylo and or kylo redemption    this film drivers on those front so much so its nothing but a fan service conclusion however they stil leaves me with no doubt that fans will stil complain about something i simply expected a lot more as a final entry
Sep 22 2020,positive,lots of nostalgia and tying up of loose plot threads kind of a popcorn movie but a really fun finale to the skywalker saga
Sep 21 2020,negative,it was so bad i literally thought it was a joke you can spend years talking about how bad this movie is and not even discuss the whole thing
Sep 21 2020,negative,you know i didnt see this in theaters i havent bought the dvdbluray and i dont have disney i didnt really want to see how disney would fck up the lore anymore  so last night me and some friends decided to see it through another friends disney account  god this movie isnt very good the pacing is all over the lore is broken here and there deus ex machinas irrelevant characters irrelevant plotpoints leaps of faith in terms of the fanbase and of course the ending i wont spoil anything but i dont like this  its a bad movie but its not horrible i watched it all the way through without wanting to walk away or turn it off so it gets points for that
Sep 20 2020,positive,one of the best films of all time a great end to the saga which i hope comes back and am sad is over but it was amazing those critic reviews are idiots and have brains the size of an ant
Sep 20 2020,neutral,i mean after the mess that was tlj its pretty hard to make a movie after that so it wasnt too terrible bringing back palpatine and making him reys grandfather is just lazy writing
Sep 20 2020,negative,poorly written movie made to milk out the last juice the star wars franchise had to offer
Sep 19 2020,negative,disappointing ending to a mediocre reboot
Sep 19 2020,negative,what a pice of crap i honestly cant not watch any of these movies any more i am going back to watching the ot like if you said i will pay you 1 million dollars to re watch this stuff i honestly do not think i could
Sep 19 2020,positive,i dont know why people hate this movie but from me this is amazing movie and also from me the story is good the visual effects is epic and the ending is perfect
Sep 18 2020,neutral,i never got the whole star wars thing after this movie i still dont and whats more i dont understand the controversy surrounding the last three movies
Sep 18 2020,positive,im not a star wars junkie but i thought this movie was a lot of fun
Sep 18 2020,negative,they had no idea what story they were telling just quick try and slap something together so we can finish this thing off and get as much cash as possible before people figure out how hollow and shallow this thing is
Sep 17 2020,positive,a nice way to wind up the saga not too keen on some of the political correct stuff but hey thats hollywood
Sep 16 2020,negative,train wreck  ruined everything good about star wars  a nonexisting no relevance plot that took away from all the victories and sacrifices of the original trilogy characters  how is it possible to ruin the best movie franchise of all time
Sep 15 2020,negative,very random ill be very vague finn seemingly does nothing palpatine somehow has survived being tossed from a great height the initial explosion and then the death star being blown up characters are continuously believed to have died and then ahha it was a trick cheaply brings them back a second later and then theres finn trying to tell rey something all throughout the movie other characters mention it but it never got resolved and then finally after all this time the ability to bring someone back from the death like darth plaguies the wise is seen yay but it kills them if you have the memory span of 3 seconds the plot might make sense its filled with plot holes does not make sense canonically and in my opinion a waste of time now if youre like me youd have been so focused on the fast pacing that it seems only reasonably bad just wait sit back and wait think about it enjoy
Sep 15 2020,positive,amazing i thought that the last jedi was good bury the first half was kinda boring but this so so good and lives up to the star wars name highly recommend watching
Sep 15 2020,negative,lets start with the positives some of the problems i had with the last jedi they did fix such as some of the characters being completely unlikable and the last jedi being slow but there is one problem it seems like jj abrams wanted to do the reverse of tlj but went way too overboard in the process there is no reason why palpatine should be there as it makes vaders death pointless instead of the movie being slow it feels completely rushed and a lot of the parts do not go together let me just say that i was a kid when the prequels came out and watched the original trilogy at an early age and as a kid i could understand why luke had to find yoda or why anakin turned to the dark side im in my 20s now and i dont understand some of the parts in the last two films also despite kylo ren and finn being my two favorite characters in the sequel trilogy they got very little screen time in both this and tlj and i have no clue why its a two stars because its not the worst movie ever made keep in mind that the star wars holiday special exists its just a major disappointment for what is advertised as the end of a trilogy
Sep 15 2020,negative,not the best star wars movie but not the worst rogue one is the best new one this one is second place to the worst one last jedi
Sep 15 2020,positive,i think this is the movie that we are all have been waiting for it completes the sequel trilogy opening the holes on why rey has this starting powerful character or the other fans may say the mary sue character
Sep 15 2020,negative,none of the directors writers or producers of the sequel trilogy understand star wars in the least there is no real consistency and this film proves it
Sep 14 2020,negative,this movie got two stars from me for the visual effect alone the rest is imo pure garbage that doesnt make sense and worse in many ways makes the previous movies make less senseo especially when it comes to the force what it is and what it can do  close to following many other moviegoers out the door but i felt like i had to see it through to have an opinion
Sep 14 2020,positive,obviously not as good as the others but entertaining and gives you chills and memories c
Sep 13 2020,negative,while marginally better than 7 or 8 that isnt saying anything the story is just as convoluted and still has some level of weird parallel motives to the original series movie in this case 6 doesnt work just makes the already bad story more incoherent completely lacks any logic or realism no amount of suspension of disbelief can correct for everything in the story is only there because the story demands it not because it can be explained sometimes these are ridiculous ex machina moments one after the other at other times all inuniverse rules are suspended even those just established in order to make a scene or special effect still not good on that front either most of the time though
Sep 13 2020,negative,skip it its a cold shower for star wars enthusiasm
Sep 12 2020,negative,waste of time rey is overpowered and is better at handeling the force then every other jedi ever trained combined after just a short training is able to destroy palpatine without breaking a sweat while palpatine can use force lightning to destroy starfleets wgile when turning his full attention to rey it has the effect of a toy
Sep 11 2020,negative,difficult to follow too many tired tropes  nothing about it made much sense  it was like a series of video game fetch quests  not impressed
Sep 11 2020,negative,why cant i give zero stars a half star is more than this movie deserves terrible sad they ruined the saga
Sep 10 2020,negative,it does feel like there was some effort in trying to fix this trilogys plot but it was simply not enough this third movie should feel like a rush of excitement after two movies of epic build up but it isnt it has some good isolated plot ideas however this movie simply does not bind the trilogy together for example there are some serious inconsistencies around the whole dyad in the force concept versus what was first said in episode 8 about rey and kylos connection   star wars continues to be cool in this last trilogy just because of the laser swords in space idea other than that this trilogy is just a mediocrely executed story with a nonsensical plot which makes it frustrating to watch
Sep 10 2020,positive,meh characters are all boring apart from finn who got very little screen time
Sep 10 2020,negative,this movie was a mess
Sep 10 2020,negative,this was a mess shows no planning and no ability of execution even at a rudimentary level of story telling the best way to watch these sequel films has become to take them in ironically who is this audience that likes this nonsense seems they all have the same comments too lol
Sep 10 2020,negative,too much fan service unoriginal music and an extreme oversaturation of emperor palpatine there is too much emptiness and flair here
Sep 9 2020,negative,made the skywalker story completely irrelevant way to go disney
Sep 9 2020,positive,tons of money does resulted in great cgi and quite entertaining screenplay however the story is full of holes with the main character wearing full armor all the way through
Sep 9 2020,negative,shame on you disney shame 
Sep 8 2020,negative,urgh so so so many clichés so many inconsistencies the ren mask the joke about it the death or leia the scene with lando and janna id love to put the blame on disney but the star wars stories arent bad at all but 789 was just a bad idea
Sep 8 2020,negative,its a spineless animal its a paragraph where every sentence starts with then its a ungratifying conclusion and its mindnumbingly boring with all its emptiness and nonsense left and right happenings the rise of skywalker is a frustratingly stale film where an epic conclusion was promised and will likely not go down as the satisfying finale forty years in the making
Sep 7 2020,negative,i cant give this movie a passing grade it was the first time i had left a theater legit angry there are a lot of very cool visuals in the movie but from what was set up in the previous 8 films this movie made absolutely 0 sense the problem with disney making the star wars movie is they keep trying to make everything bigger make the force powers more powerful make the emperor be able to blow entire fleets up with his hands some people will absolutely love it because it is a very cool looking but they are sacrificing story for visuals   i felt this and the previous movie the last jedi completely forgot to develop characters of poe and finn what the series was trying to do was recreate the magic of the big 3 from the original series luke leia and han and also give each of the original big 3 their own send out it just landed flat in my eyes but i do give credit to the actors they all were incredibly good but my problem comes with the script this movie felt like a course correction from the last jedi 510
Sep 7 2020,negative,this is a joke for the fan is orrible movie
Sep 6 2020,positive,guy i dont understand the criticism so many people didnt like the movie hes great and incredibly epic one of the best movies ive ever seen
Sep 6 2020,neutral,after the let down of the last one this is amazing although i saw it on its release i forgot about and havent wanted to rewatch  it was a scramble to get the fans back its star wars so i liked it
Sep 6 2020,positive,the action was good but the plot could have been better
Sep 5 2020,negative,its september 2020 and im still not over how bad this movie was as something that was marketed as the finale to the entire skywalker saga this did not succeed in that promise there were so many things from a story and character perspective that just did not make any sense and its a real shame how rush this felt even the editing seemed off among other things   what held promise as a story that showed that anybody even a nobody could become a jedi we once again get hit with the fact that yes your bloodline matters and is the only way youll be of any importance being attached to an important bloodline is the only acceptable way to explain how you can be so powerful rather than just the fact that you are   this movie catered to the worst desires of the toxic side of the fandom of the original trilogy dudebros and you cannot convince me otherwise
Sep 5 2020,negative,a joke of a movie like the whole disney trilogy the movie is not just poorly written it actually manages to ruin the ot and the pt entirely absolutely no respect for the work of george lucas
Sep 5 2020,negative,a total disappointment to the end of what turned out to be a very average story
Sep 5 2020,negative,palpatine coming back to life really couldnt come up with something better no creativity or passion went into these last three films highly disappointed
Sep 4 2020,negative,i would insult whoever was guilty of this crime against something so beloved for millions of people but after several months of its release i could only feel disappointed and sad they destroyed something we loved for selfish reasons dont be fooled by their reach to nostalgia with old characters vibrant explosions or of a conclusion to the sequel of the original trilogy we deserved something much better the actors deserved much better the saga deserved much better old and new fans deserved much better  so this is how star wars dies with thunderous applause
Sep 3 2020,neutral,meh the movies was not good if you watched every other star wars movie you can understand that this movie makes absolutely no sense there are lots of things that are terrible but these are the worst  spoilers alert  1 palpatine wants to die in the revenge of the sith we know the palpatine is the sith with the goal of living forever  he spent decades and decades to find a way to live forever but in this movie he makes something that is totally opposite he wants rey to kill him so she can become empress and all the sith will live in her blah blah that is not what the original idea of emperor palpatine is not  2 force healing of all the things in the franchise i think the idea of healing through the force is the worst thing ever jesus how illogical it is lets go to the revenge of the sith once again  anakin skywalker is having nightmares showing his wife padme dying during the childbirth which makes anakin turn to the dark side well with the rise of skywalkers logic anakin could simply remain jedi and be padme during the childbirth and if something goes wrong he could simply put his hand on her and revive her  thats absolutely not cool it makes no sense looking at the prequels  3 reylo i know that there are lots of people who are rey and kylo ren shippers but it also makes no sense kylo ren is a murderer who killed his father and also almost killed his mother he was also about to kill rey  and rey fell in love with him with a murderer  4 leias death for no reason yeah this is one of the worst things in the movie why did leia die no one even touched her she was not too old she wasnt ill so when rey stabbed kylo in his belly leia said beennn and died for what why  of course rey calling herself skywalker and burying anakins lightsaber in the sand are also some of the worst things in the movie
Sep 2 2020,positive,i love the fast paced action in this movie the nostalgia was great and really is one of my favorite star wars movies
Sep 2 2020,positive,overall good conclusion with lots of fan service did its best to reorient the trilogy after the last jedi however the lack of a cohesive well thought out story for the sequel trilogy hampered this films ability to excel given the vast irrelevance of the second film in the trilogy this film could have done with taking more time to explain some plot points nonetheless excellent acting special effects music and pretty solid plot and characters make this entry in the skywalker saga likely to satisfy fans expectations but not exceed them
Sep 1 2020,positive,im not mad im just sort of disappointed i have some problems with this i didnt like how palpatine was even in this movie it felt more like oh here you go heres a character you remember and hes back even though it makes 0 sense what made it worse was palpatine being reys grandfather like im sorry that took me out i dont need everyone in the star wars universe to relate to each other if it makes no sense to the overall plot rey from knowhere is better than rey palpatine you didnt have to relate her she had her own arc throughout these movies now the movie does have a lot of great moments but also moments that feel recycled from other movies im sorry but the final battle is literally a copy of the main climax sequence from avengers endgame and its rough that the same studio disney just let both marvel and star wars recycle that same emotionally impactful moment but like it didnt do much to me and marvel did it better this movie felt like an obligation after the fan outcry from the last jedi they tried to make up the arc and fix certain things that just didnt feel cohesive throughout the trilogy this trilogy was not planned properly instead of making one cohesive story throughout three movies it just felt like they created the script for each one based off opinions on twitter and that kinda sucked now the kiss between kylo and rey took me out of the movie completely that was so cringe now the movie itself was fun even though a lot of elements took me out of the movie is it a bad movie no it isnt a bad movie at all but i felt like i couldve rated this higher if the plot elements were more cohesive leas death didnt feel earned or emotionally impactful enough although i do understand they didnt have much to work with given the death of carrie  but it just felt like they tried to undo everything from the last jedi and ultimately it just didnt feel planned out at all the genuine conclusion was fine though i just didnt like the pacing and the overall writing in this for the most part they needed one cohesive story across 3 movies not adjusting everything based off of fan backlash the jedi be with me moment was the best part of the whole movie and it felt like endgame planted that scene in disneys head with the avengers coming out of the portals something just felt very off about this movie to me but it isnt bad 35
Aug 31 2020,negative, warning this movie contains massive spoilers this movie sucks im not going to sugar coat it but it flat out sucks yes it has some good moments but you should if reading this just watch the movie for yourself because many people will probably like this movie but for me i officially hate star wars last jedi sucks and now rise of rey skywalker sucks i cant with star wars and this movie made no sense and was all over the place
Aug 30 2020,positive,was it a good movie  sequel  and a great end to the skywalker saga  i say yes  absolutely yes  however many people critic it for some things they dont like in the movie  but i understand because i felt the same  example  the story is too fast  but i get that  lucas have lots of things to show  he could easily lengthen the movie to 3 hours  which is okay because we all love a star wars movie that is long  we want to enjoy the story  but past is the past  and i will say it again  yes absolutely yes 
Aug 30 2020,positive,yeah i could say that i dont know what if they did good
Aug 30 2020,negative,absolute garbage that destroys the original sw universe furthermore
Aug 30 2020,positive,fantastic ending to the skywalker saga
Aug 30 2020,positive,this was like a bad idea for the mess tlj was the series has been severely damaged id give it less of a score but there was an attempt to fix the disaster that was tlj
Aug 29 2020,negative,too much movie rolled into too short a time and feels disjointed perhaps because of the previous unmentionable mess in the saga lots of plot inconsistencies to finish off frankly the most disappointing of the star wars trilogies i left wishing that maybe disney had tackled subplots in star wars like rogue one first before taking on the sequel to the original and frankly excellent in my opinion trilogy  so they could have laid out a coherent plan for the last three movies perhaps producing something that at least felt like a trilogy which developed its plots and characters it would have been nice to see some service in developing its heroines heros and villains so we could identify with them in some way instead they come off as wooden and even the characters from the original movies feel unrealistic off their arc and thrown in purely for fan service not sure how disney is going to make a comeback after this
Aug 29 2020,negative,the worst star wars movie ever disney just ruined whole star wars so much potential wasted so much money wasted star wars was better without it
Aug 27 2020,neutral,so full of cliche and poorly paced like the hobbit in space 
Aug 27 2020,positive,i really enjoyed the kylo ren movies although i think they were lacking some general plot development  this movie was probably the best one of the lot things were happening the entire movie no downtime so no time to get bored the pointless characters are glossed over quickly and most of the movie sticks with the main players rey and kylo ren exchange life force calling the force baby thats coming in the sequel and beat up an old man its good stuff   some things to look forward to lots of ghosts rey randomly changes her name kylo ren randomly changes his name they pull a random villain out of a hat so theres someone to kill at the end and theres plenty of fighting in a variety of locations kylo ren keeps darth vaders head on his spaceship possibly in his bedroom rey has magical healing powers they fight in a cool shipwreck thats still in the ocean  and of course there is a space battle at the end 8 stars for constant action and magical spirit bonds minus 3 stars for not explaining who the old man is or ever bringing him up in the other movies
Aug 27 2020,positive,jj did his best of what he had a bit of a mess but there could have been worse endings
Aug 26 2020,positive,this was a great conclusion to the best movie series of all time it was truly epic and a major improvement over star wars the last jedi great film
Aug 25 2020,negative,a bandaid for a huge open wound disappointing upside down full of nonsense simplyheartbreaking for the true star wars fans out there
Aug 25 2020,negative,when a movies climax evokes a feeling of what thats it you know something went really wrong to be clear i enjoyed the force awakens at the time and disliked the last jedi the quarrel between jj and rian johnson fans has nothing to do with my dislike of rise of skywalker  the entire movie felt like i was watching a summary everything was rushed through scenes and choices that should have had time to develop were rushed along with contrivances just to keep us moving from one set to the next palpatine returns but is criminally wasted to this day i dont understand what the point of bringing him back was just to die effortlessly  this movie suffers from the same problems as the other movies theres only the barest of continuity and very little opportunity for the characters to develop and grow the entire structure of this movie felt like a fanfiction from rushed narrative to having the producers new totally original character take down the big bad of a previous story months of frantic work and reshoots and this was the best that lucasfilm could come up with utterly disappointing
Aug 25 2020,positive,very satisfying addition to star wars series
Aug 22 2020,negative,things happen without explaination and often for no apparent reasons other than the plot to happen bending all logic with force well at least it looks and sounds nice
Aug 22 2020,neutral,it has a bad premise and the action is too similar too similar to avengers endgame but the performances are good and the cgi  is still solid
Aug 21 2020,positive,amazing movie especially the end where rey says and i am all of the jedi first of all it gives you avengers endgame vibes and second it is just such an epic moment the reason why its 45 stars not 5 is because of the title i really did not like how rey just named her self skywalker and because that scene is all the way at the end audiences dont know what they mean by rise of skywalker i would prefer a name like the endgame or fall of the order but overall a great end to the saga
Aug 21 2020,negative,pretty awful as star wars movies go  plot holes a lot of story having to fix plot holes from the last one some where in this muddled mess of the film there is a kernel of a good story but poor execution and deux ex machina liberally sprinkled everywhere breaks the movie  waste of talent as the acting was pretty good with the pretty shoddy material they had
Aug 20 2020,negative,terrible conclusion to what was a shocking trilogy of films
Aug 19 2020,positive,pretty fun classic star wars entertainment  didnt have the guts to take the kinds of risks that the last jedi took but still an entertaining well made movie that delivered a solid space adventure romp 
Aug 18 2020,negative,not a good moving as cpg gray said its like drinking water when your not thirsty
Aug 18 2020,positive,loved it tell george lucas to keep his hands off star wars his dream was amazing he just doesnt have the talent to bring it to life
Aug 18 2020,neutral,star wars the rise of skywalker is the most underwhelming star wars movie since attack of the clones and just as predictable as revenge of the sith now before i go into ranting about all of this movies issues ill first state the good it has and what i liked about it 1 ben solo is the only character in this movie that has a real arc finally turning to the good side and finally excepting who he is 2 the pacing in this movie is surprisingly good 3 the visual effects are still on the same level as tfa and tlj 4 the movie still manages to be enjoyable despite all of its flaws and had some cool scenes in it like the desert scene with rey flipping in the air and taking down bens ship now here is all of the bad the missed opportunities and the why 1 first of all palpatine just why the last jedi gave us some very deep and intriguing stuff to think about these sequels are about creating something new and letting go of the past so why did they even need to bring palpatine back 2 nobody has an arc in this movie other than ben solo try and remember the arcs in this movie other than his you cant everyone got an arc in the last jedi even rose got an arc in that movie and everyone hates her but no one not even rey learns anything or grows into a different person everyone stays the same  3 leias death is very rushed and doesnt make any sense so she could use the force to fly through space in the last jedi but has to die in order to say one word to her son this is just one example of this movie being inconsistent with the rules that the previous movies set up  4 the knights of ren seem really cool they look like real bad asses but we only see them in action in one scene and thats it hopefully we see more of them somewhere else but it was a huge opportunity that was sadly missed  5 there was just way too much humor in this movie it seemed like every other line an actor says is trying to be funny or crack a witty joke and its just too much i know that in the last jedi there was also some unnecessary humor but its at least tamed compared to how much is in this movie  6 poe and finns chemistry and entire relationship is just so weird in this movie poe is literally so caught up in finns business everywhere they go in the other movies it was just a bro friendship that was fine and cool but in this movie its portraying them as if they are gay for each other i know it sounds a little ridiculous but they just seemed off in this movie it was also really cringeworthy to see them on screen together the lines that they say to each other are so cringeworthy to hear and that actually goes back to the humor part that i thought was bad  7 the force rules in this movie are so freaking inconsistent and out of place that i dont even know what the rules are anymore but its really not only with this movie its with the prequels and in some parts of the sequels too but anyway my first question lies with finn and rey in the last jedi it is said that the force can basically be with anyone and everyone since reys parents were nobody and she is a pretty powerful jedi then they use that for finn in this movie since he was able to locate rey and found out which ship had the signal at the end but the movie also contradicts this by saying that rey was a palpatine and by saying that rey is a palpatine it basically says that only jedisith can use the force so which is it movie is the force with everyone or is it with jedisith only or do you have to have midichlorians in your cells my second question then lies with ben solo and leia first of all ben dies by turning into a ghost like a jedi would but i thought he was a sith lord with good intentions the movie makes it seem like he was a jedi all along but with bad intentions but this is not him and also why does leia not turn into a ghost as soon as she dies why does she turn into a ghost only when ben does this makes absolutely no sense to me and this movie officially made me clueless on what the force is and its rules  8 whatever finn wanted to say to rey is never answered and is actually hilarious that it never was answered but not in a good way  9 this movie is basically anti the last jedi when it doesnt need to be this movie could have been such an amazing and solid trilogy if it wasnt for the fear of the creators worrying about criticism from star wars fans because of the last jedi the last jedi sets this movie up perfectly for whatever it wanted to be and it somehow manages to be underwhelming and unexciting apparently they had a completely different movie planned out which honestly looked nothing like this movie in fact looking at the concept art for that movie it looked so freaking cool and so much better  10 this is probably my biggest problem with the movie this movie has no risks at all nobody dies and therefore it felt like there were no stakes they took the star wars saying nobody is ever really gone too literally it would have been really emotional and heartbreaking to see our old heroes and comic reliefs finally go but nope its okay theyre never gonna die dont worry guys this is the finale of the skywalker saga this is the one movie out of the entire saga that should have taken the most risks this caused the movie to be super underwhelming and overall disappointing  honestly if i had the power to redo any movie ever i would choose this movie and then tell lucasfilm to hire colin trevorrow to do his thing with his own srcipt just reading some of the things he had planned makes me so disappointed in what this movie could have been also the kiss in the end was so unneeded wtf
Aug 18 2020,negative,this was the worst movie i ever saw i loved the last jedi when i was watching this at the cinema i felt ashamed to be a sw fan they took the criticism of the previous movie that came from the unappreciative haters and wanted to fix all of that was criticised so this is nothing more than a mea culpa makes me want to vomit such a shame cause reys journey was so inspiring but it felt like they threw her character in the trash the writing is awful i havent watched any star wars since i saw this
Aug 17 2020,positive,the fact that there was no road map for this story is now 100 clear
Aug 16 2020,negative,absolutely terrible the last scene of the movie is basically an insult to the whole skywalker family
Aug 15 2020,positive,the visuals as usual for a star wars film are great  there are a few moments where i even feel for kylo ren  but unfortunately the last couple of films especially last jedi has soured me on the whole plotline and cast  my biggest emotional reactions were when cast members seemed to be dead and then came back and i was all like f  i also feel bad for abrams who tried really hard to add fan service and stuff a serviceable plot line into the movie  unfortunately after doinking around for two films trying to wrap it up in one felt really rushed  and the whole thing with the emperor on the sith world with a star destroyer fleet all lined up like henderson field  battleship row felt forced and over the top and a bit lacking in imagination  still better than last jedi where dreams go to die
Aug 13 2020,negative,i dont understand how so many people like this movie putting aside the massive plot holes bland characters and uncompelling story this movie has utterly destroyed the original trilogy anakin didnt find the good within himself and kill the emperor luke didnt succeed in freeing galaxy and ending the greatest evil in existence no the creditor that goes to rey skywalker palpatine the most bland protagonist we never wanted a marie sue with no growth or development whatsoever whose character ark could only be drawn with a disappearing ink palpatine never died our heros never succeeded this movie has stolen away their growth and accomplishment when i watch this movie when i see what it does i cant help but feel that they must absolutely hate this ip this saga deserved so much better i would give this movie negative stars if i could
Aug 11 2020,positive,feelgood deeply emotional end to the saga
Aug 10 2020,negative,its crap its crap its crap its crap its crap its crap its crap
Aug 10 2020,negative,the movie is weak on its own but as a conclusion to the trilogy and to the saga  it is just a shame it is unimaginative and boring nothing new the desire of filmakers to play safe absolutely destroyed the potential of the sequels to bring smth worthy to star wars the dialogues seem to be written by a 5year old and the pacing is terrible bringing palpantine jedi spirits and stupid reveal of reys parentage all in the second part of the last movie makes tros an absolute mess
Aug 10 2020,positive,best star wars movie
Aug 9 2020,negative,cringy plot and sloppy storyline
Aug 9 2020,negative,the main factor in this movie is luck they are going from a to b with luck and have luck to find old actor and have luck again killed someone no lucky it was a different ship and so on worst was space horses on a spacecraft and no she is not a skywalker she is a palpatine i hope they really decanonize these movies they are not canon for me and never will be
Aug 8 2020,negative,it is trashhhhhhhhhh
Aug 7 2020,positive,there was really cool action and stunts that i liked this is a really good movie
Aug 7 2020,negative,back to safezone the last jedi is the best starwar ever nothing new in this episode
Aug 7 2020,negative,full of plot holes  a star wars movie should be better  from being a massive ot fan i now have no interest in ever watching any star wars movies again the end of a boring and unnecessary trilogy
Aug 6 2020,positive,a fitting ending to a film franchise
Aug 5 2020,positive,im a big starters fan the movie lives up to the starwars nam
Aug 4 2020,negative,i cant believe the score on this movie is so high the story writing for the last chapter of the skywalker saga is so painfully bad i dont blame disney for wanting to erase these movies from the canon this movie is only good for a few fleeting moments of fan service while you scream silently is this the best they could do internally
Aug 4 2020,negative,movie was so fast paced and didnt make sense so many contradicting things when you take into account the other movies lots of plot conveniences and nonsense
Aug 2 2020,negative,this is what you get when you dont plan a trilogy and have to put it all together in one movie a rush sloppy mass
Aug 2 2020,negative,a humiliating end to the skywalker saga
Aug 2 2020,negative,a humiliating end to the skywalker saga
Aug 2 2020,neutral,im not against the new trilogy im not the last jedi is one of my favorite star wars movies actually but this movie bites off more than it can chew  by a lot actually it adds twenty new unnecessary characters nothing in the final third feels earned what you were allowed to say about the last jedi that it evenly divided fans you cant say about this one id recommend it nonetheless the thing is this is the kind of movie you have to form your own opinions about if this review was rotten all the way id still recommend it its essential it has a little outofplace but funny humor and a cool little avengers moment
Aug 2 2020,negative,this movie couldnt be anymore of a confusing mess if it tried wtf happened here
Aug 1 2020,negative,worst movie i haver ever seen with a lot of cliché and useless especial effects no sense in all the movie and the new saga
Aug 1 2020,positive,the movie demonstrated multiple symbols that she conclusions to storylines that were played throughout the star wars saga the conclusion of the star wars saga could have been done in no better way as a standalone film this would not make much sense since the storylines are continued from the older films when watched as the final episode in the saga this film will make much more sense and bring tears to the eyes of true star wars fans i 110 recommend concluding your star wars marathon with this it will definitely make it worth while
Aug 1 2020,positive,some might say this movie is too similar to other star wars movies some might say its not imaginative enough but i actually liked the movie yes it was at times similar to older star wars movies but to me it had enough twists and surprises to also make it stand out from other movies
Jul 31 2020,positive,this final star wars episode  has a heavy load wrapping the whole saga up in feature length and unfortunately packs too much in to make this a thoroughly enjoyable scifi adventure however along its convoluted way there are lots of sets of breathtaking visual appeal
Jul 31 2020,negative,its like the people doing this movie had no knowledge of the star wars saga the only reason to see this mess is to learn how to not ruin a beloved and loved story its almost as if the creator knew that they where doing when they destroyed everything i loved with this horrible mess
Jul 31 2020,positive,i loved the rise of skywalker but it seriously does not deserve a 51 rating its better than both the phantom menace and attack of the clones
Jul 31 2020,negative,huge fan of star wars this film was real bad close to garbage the story the script the lines what were they thinking level of hope has become childish and a joke characters were still absolute shit hate no despise what disney has done to the franchise the old era needs to return and fix what this has become glory to the empire
Jul 29 2020,negative,id rate this higher if it werent part of a trilogy let alone star wars i dont expect every movie to be internally consistent but this movie ignores the last jedi and the ot it ignores itself half the time too inserting something that happens with 0 pay off later lets add another thing and never develop the ones we have  oh and palpatine returned because jj cares more about spectacle than substance im sad that we never got a sequel to the last jedi i had fun because im able to look past failure and enjoy work where people put it in the spectacle was fun but its definitely not what i wanted  why is this rated so high
Jul 27 2020,negative,the story of this movie is just extremely stupid and ridiculous a real disgrace to the original trilogy
Jul 27 2020,negative,this makes the prequels seem like the best saga ever
Jul 26 2020,negative,what a travesty an incoherent and unintelligent mess
Jul 26 2020,negative,disney must have paid to have positive reviews put on this site you can make videos longer than the movie itself simply talking about the gigantic plot holes awkward pacing and terrible writing it doesnt even main continuity with its own previous 2 movies only reason it got the extra half star was because of the visual effect
Jul 26 2020,negative,complete crap story line was terrible on a star wars bright side  i loved the mandalorian
Jul 26 2020,positive,i loved it until the lazy ending so much potential wasted
Jul 25 2020,negative,of all the movies ive ever seen in my life this is one of the worst  its just so bad words cannot describe  86 viewer score clearly does not include any bad reviews this is top ten worst movies that made any money  straight garbage i feel bad for every actor in this mistake
Jul 25 2020,positive,ok this movie was nothing short of good but not great after a bunch of forgettable films the rise of skywalker is actually decent enough to give us a reason to care for characters like rey and co jj abrams and the writers for this film do do diligence giving us a backstory for the protagonist while including some roots to the originals the saga is wrapped up in this film as it should be but leaves somewhat of a long lasting sour taste in your mouth knowing how good these sequels should have been yet how poorly they were executed
Jul 24 2020,neutral,its been said that jj abrams makes movies for the shareholders  if thats the case welcome to the board meeting to end all board meetings  no one ever said that pleasing everyone would be easy but with the rise of skywalker the director pretty much nails it  that is to say this film much ballyhooed as the final chapter in the ninepart fortytwoyearrunning skywalker saga   is aside from everything else and the kitchen sink an entirely deliberately innocuously agreeable film  as the galaxy reels from the realization that the thoughtdead shriveled and perpetually cackling sith lord emperor palpatine ian mcdiarmid is back and up to his old tricks the chronically displaced heroine rey daisy ridley is deep into her jedi training on a new woodsy obstacle course planet  kylo ren the great adam driver the new supreme leader of the first order and evil son of han solo and leia organa has set about looking for palpatine all the while also looking to continue his dark side seduction of rey  in the course of disneys star wars sequel trilogy the downright weird relationship of these two characters has taken center stage  it all comes to a glowing lightsaberclashing head with the rise of skywalker with both ridley and driver giving this resolution their devoted all
Jul 24 2020,negative,this is the first star wars movie that i was actually unable to sit all the way through in one go it is a narrative clusterfumble and the pacing is terrible half of the movie is focused on retconning the last movie leaving no time to develop any sort of coherent plot and everything in this movie is supposed to take place within an arbitrary 16 hour timeframe give me a break
Jul 24 2020,positive,it may be flawed but that doesnt mean its not fun to watch
Jul 22 2020,positive,spectacular movie with the indepth philosophy that can allow us to learn so many lessons applied for our profession and life
Jul 22 2020,neutral,yes i went ahead and ended up watching this after declaring the star wars franchise dead from the last entry which was complete shit maybe the best one of the new trilogy meh only because it wraps everything up in a not totally horrible way theres still a lot of silly stupid crap here just not as much as in the last jedi rey flips around like a ninja turtle a lot in this to the point where its just damn comical same ol final showdown between the two sides in a not so epic space battle like all the rest and with the same ol predictable finish theres other lame stuff that i cant be bothered to recall at the moment so take this two and a half star rating with a grain of salt at least there wont be any more new star wars for a while stop milking this cash cow disney its done
Jul 22 2020,neutral,510 its really really really bad pity for all the hard work gone into the fx and the original world building
Jul 22 2020,negative,a truly disappointing end to a franchise that had potential  this film is overstuffed with story arcs that should have been spread over two films or a longer 3 hours star wars epic adam driver and daisy ridley are the only highlights in this movie
Jul 22 2020,negative,this one was somehow even worse i dont have the energy to get into it right now but my god can we go back to the prequel days please
Jul 21 2020,negative,worst movie in the skywalker saga by far takes a flamethrower to everything we loved about the originals renders kylo impotent and makes rey an overpowered force demigod worst of all its entirely derivative counting on fanservice and expensive cgi to win over fans and to some extent it worked
Jul 21 2020,negative,probably the worst mainstream movie in the last two decades
Jul 20 2020,negative,this is an awful movie palpatines return without a doubt makes it so that the victory at the end of return of the jedi and vaders sacrifice were completely pointless jj abrams has no imagination whatsoever he couldnt think of anything better than bringing back the emperor really this movie is just a nonsensical plot surrounding palpatine we have to find the thing to find the thing to find palpatine it is so fastpaced you dont have time to think and realize how stupid and nonsensical the plot is  the ending is so overthetop with a huge space battle and flashy special effects instead of making you feel excited or emotionally touched the movie makes you feel exhausted and sick of star wars also the fan service is way too much in this one  i can only say a few positive things about the movie the visuals and use of practical effects are great the dynamic between rey and kylo ren is good it is a competent film regarding dialogue and acting but story is a very important aspect to me when it comes to star wars movies not only does this movie have a messy plot it ruins the story arc of the original six films   this movie disrespects george lucas legacy and the legacy of the original trilogy it is a disappointing conclusion to the franchise
Jul 20 2020,positive,fantastic easily one of the best of the series almost a love story but just as with luke and anakin it wasnt in the cards to last
Jul 20 2020,negative,this movie is beyond horrific it doesnt even make sense ive watched all the star wars movies and it doesnt even compare to the older ones please dont waste your time watching this movie its worst than xmen dark phoenix at least thats tolerable
Jul 19 2020,negative,very very very bad movie
Jul 18 2020,positive,the reboots were subpar and disney botched the first couple of episodes   this one finally put it all together and made it worth following along   well done
Jul 18 2020,negative,if i could give this less stars i would its been like 2 years and i still think about this movie with pure unfiltered rage in my heart
Jul 17 2020,negative,it was terrible at best you dont need to be a long time sw fan to see the flaws abuse of plot devices plot holes poor dialogs inconsistent character development there are problems in virtually every single scene i have no idea how they managed to produce such a bad movie  visuals are impressive although i find the editing is often disturbing it pains me to be so negative about it but its just such a shame
Jul 17 2020,negative,fast paced frantic motion without an once of thought the effects were good individual shots were amazing the story was a insane disjointed fetch quest and the characters were wasted dont watch it if your going to think about it but probably  fine if you just want to turn your brain off while you watch something pretty if you dont have to pay for it
Jul 16 2020,negative,i dont have much to say thats positive about this movie   you wanna know if itll entertain   disney and millions of bucks of jj  youll get moneys worth of entertainment but i cant guarantee youll like it at every moment
Jul 16 2020,negative,a very disappointing finale to the well loved star wars saga its an absolute mess listen to the critics
Jul 16 2020,positive,everything here was either a huge hit or a huge miss for me thankfully though it managed to entertain me and even make me feel emotions though technically the weakest of the trilogy i think that it works the exact same way as return of the jedi if you just accept it on its own term it can be really fun much like the force awakens
Jul 15 2020,negative,it pains me that this exists illogical narrative mess every sin in cinema   star wars is a legendary franchise but disney made a movie so awful thats going to take several years to recover from
Jul 14 2020,negative,the cinematic equivalent of season 8 of got a complete rushed mess attempts to wrap up way too many storylines and ends up being completely unsatisfying a totally forgettable shambles
Jul 13 2020,positive,not the best storytelling but entertaining and sentimental if you enjoy the star wars saga
Jul 13 2020,negative,last trilogy is even worse than 2nd trilogy of star wars in pretty much everything episode 1 were made for little childrens and second were just a lot of cgi leaving history behind 3rd episode were quite good ill admit original ones are masterpieces and then we have this trilogy force awakens were pretty good i even got really excited about all this new history and i couldnt wait to see more but ryan jhonson made the worse sw movie ive ever seen destroyed the most iconic character of the franchise and with him a lot of the stablishment of what the force were what were it used for and pretty much everything related with the main plot of the 2 first storys i really hated the last jedi this one is a little bit better for me but has some big fails 1st the force is not something u have as jedi is something around u so makes not sense to absorb the force from another person and the life with it since when can u teleport objects with force and all the fanservice with all those imperial ships worthless who made them who pilot them if u need a device to get there noone in the whole universe realized all the materials and people working in such a big project the whole movie is a nonsense like riding horses over a destructor in the space with or without atmosphere  so this is my ratting a 0
Jul 12 2020,negative,i think there is only one way to move on rey has to wake up and realize this all was just a dream
Jul 12 2020,positive,started with a vilain that wasnt one and was defeat on every occasion he was faced before  a underling message that confused and self righteous to the point of insult  an unlikable main character overbearing support character that undermined the journey of the mains characters  a wish to spit on everything that had any meaning before  a destruction of the balance and tension with  hero are moron  can only be saved cause ennemy are weak  stupid and a creeping extension of the boundary the setting had set all of that granted the trilogie starting distrust and hate from of a big portion of the fans me included but they managed to somewhat turn that around at least for me which is an exploit in itself  the film is not really good cinema that a given   scene that can be pretty obscure if you are not rationally putting them in context  a tendency to over explain  a tendency to use brutish approach where subtle one would have been better  not subtle reference and the general pacing that is way to fast probably due to the work of repairing what was made in episode 2 but and that a big but the film is trying so hard to please and deal with the hand that was dealt that its commendable   it create a vilain when nothing was given  it try to give motivation to the main character than can progress in their story now that support character are not taking the screen  i would says that every criticism about how the story was not properly transmitted had an attempt to be addressed in this movie even if in a childish way  in the end they pushed rey from a despicable character that annoyed me to no end by its mere presence to a good meh shes okay  this is not a master piece  far from it but that still impressive  7510
Jul 11 2020,negative,movie of convenience answer to any problem along the way the hero has zero burden and makes for laughable story on a positive note it is aesthetically pleasing last jedi was awful and this movie tries to work around it but the end result is 2 12 hours of convenience and plot armor 
Jul 11 2020,negative,campy and repetitive any attempt at humor or decent dialogue missed the mark
Jul 11 2020,negative,slight improvement on the last car crash but not much it feels rushed and incoherent and just a shambolic mess from what used to be a great franchise its sad to see the demise of star wars and this disney trilogy has truly been atrocious from start to finish this was a total cringe fest
Jul 11 2020,negative,wow what a waste of my time this franchise has gone to the dogs or space horseswtf
Jul 10 2020,positive,i am a huge fan of the star wars sequel trilogy and i was not disappointed by this one it has what i felt was the perfect ending to the skywalker saga nicely wrapping up all the previous eight films into one actionpacked conclusion
Jul 10 2020,positive,past the first 25 minutes truly enjoyed it 35 for uneven performance and disgustingly bad pacing in the first act
Jul 9 2020,negative,i thought that it was way too fastpaced nothing is really explained and the battle of exegol was just weak everythings just confusing and theres a lot of plot convenience what i would have liked to see would be that rey dies and therefore jedi die out not every saga needs a happy ending and i think it would be appropriate for star wars because the jedi have not always been amazing also it would pretty much prevent the sith from returning so yeah what a disappointing end to an incredible saga
Jul 9 2020,negative,i dont even know where to begin this movie was marketed as the last movie in the skywalker trilogy but ended up being a palpatine movie that had nothing to do with the skywalkers yes leia was in the movie and i love that they kept her in the movie after she passed away but what she said and did in this movie just made no sense and even though i didnt like his character the movie and possibly this trilogy was more about kyloben than anyone else so if anything movie should have been the rise of solo with rey taking on his name not lukesleias name since neither really had much to do with her unless theres a book about leia raising and training rey that i havent been forced to buy yet so fill in all the missing story pieces
Jul 9 2020,negative,totally boring im a star wars fan and i just went on my tablet instead  what i do find particularly frustrating in the new franchise is how no tension whatsoever is put into the lightsaber scenes  it used to mean death or escape for one of the characters theyre out that much theyre just glowing sticks now
Jul 9 2020,negative,star wars universe is completely dead my condolences
Jul 9 2020,negative,fails at basic storytelling opens up more plot holes by reviving palpatine and making him reys grandfather how silly
Jul 8 2020,negative,i wanted to like this movie i wanted to give it at least four stars however due to the quality of this horrific film i find this the absolute worst that the star wars franchise has to offer the script is atrocious the plot is laughable and shallow and it treated the universe with no respect the two good things i can possibly think of are daisy ridleys acting and and i guess just daisy ridley
Jul 8 2020,positive,honestly there is no way to put the crazy star wars fanbase at ease i fully believe this was a strong third act for the trilogy however this film does an awful job at tying up loose ends and unfinished plot lines if only it had followed suit with the last jedi more closely you should not make a trilogy that can be changed based on what the audience wants to see fully this movie is full of fanservice and nods to the good ol days so many flaws but also so many expectations you really cant hope to be made happy by this finale to the star wars saga disney wanted something fresh but it seems as though it was rotten from the start
Jul 8 2020,negative,if i had known how terrible the movie was and how it was going to leave me feeling i would have told my husband that we were going to see jumanji the next level instead at least i would have left the movie satisfied and excited for the next movie instead of feeling gutted and zero interest in future star wars projects
Jul 7 2020,positive,a fun movie that does the job but some of the plot points are forced
Jul 6 2020,negative,i loved all of the actors the story and the movie tho omg what a piece of garbage when ever something bad happens it is undone a second later i just wish it was shorter no suspense at all to old for this i am
Jul 6 2020,negative,this shouldnt be canon it is a total mess and good soldiers follow orders
Jul 6 2020,positive,great movie that saves the st from the abyss some decissions are doubtful but after tlj this one was way more than could have been expected
Jul 6 2020,negative,i waited a long time to see this movie because i was afraid of what i had heard those fears came true it felt rushed poor story poor characters one star for the visuals this felt like a money grab to me as a star wars fan i am disappointed
Jul 5 2020,negative,the fact that they wasted the opportunity in this trilogy of having leia luke han and lando plus all the non human characters all together in the same scene will always break my heart they never had an outline for the trilogy this is movie is a mess created to make fans that disliked the last jedi happy studio heads shouldnt interfere with the creative decisions in a movie they are not story tellers its movie made to fix problems in the previous 2 movies rather than to tell a great story
Jul 5 2020,positive,this might not be the best conclusion not as great as endgame but all i can say that they put much effort to this with the characters and it was great to see lando again the last living character of the franchise
Jul 5 2020,neutral,not as bad as the prequels but its close theres great performance but the movie feels unfocused shouldve stayed with one plot
Jul 4 2020,negative,what a waste of the sequel trilogy the third movie trying to give three movies a direction
Jul 4 2020,negative,the movies is filled with plot holes palpatine being alive is dumb rey naming herself a skywalker is dumber and it totally makes anakin the real chosen one seem like a leftoff from a more civilized age the lucas age they should put dave filoni in charge so we would not get crap like this ps they have been flying since the clone wars
Jul 4 2020,positive,rise of skywalker is a decent movie although it is not a great movie but i still like it better than the prequel trilogy where this movie came short was they tried to unwind everything in the last jedi and it felt too much like a fan service personally i liked the last jedi and i think rise of skywalker would have been much better
Jul 3 2020,negative,the only good thing in the movie was oscar isaac as poe dameron 
Jul 3 2020,negative,that was sloppy i waited to watch this one the only star wars movie i havent watched in theaters i might add because i heard bad things i wanted to let those bad things settle before i watched it come at it with a fresh perspective  it didnt help it was sloppy very lazy its a beautiful looking movie it just felt rushed lazy thing would just happen with little to no explanation hey heres this thing that you now have to accept as fact sorry no explanation for it or anything   rey felt more akin to a super mutant from the marvel universe than she did a jedi speaking of marvel anyone notice the blatant rip off of avengers endgame the part where oh hey we are fighting this battle alone and losing oh wait just in the nick of time here comes everyone to save us and help us win other movies have done that trope before endgame but the way it was shot in this movie was almost a blatant rip off instead of super heroes coming out of dr strange portals it was ships coming out of light speed jumps   give me a break
Jul 3 2020,negative,after the disaster of the last jedi jj tried to mash up everything possible to save it and failed misserably unfortunately it is just a horrible horrible chance wasted with this whole sequel trilogy
Jul 3 2020,negative,i waited a long time to watch this i am a huge star wars fan but was a bit overwhelmed by the response to this film i finally sat down and i think i gave it a fair chance i really really tried to keep an open mind but it just felt like every time i looked past some ridiculous new lore or detail that was stuffed in another popped up this movie was simply ridiculous it would make more sense if this was its own stand alone trilogy separate from the rest of the star wars films as the whole reykylo storyline was really difficult to watch as someone who absorbed every bit of star wars media for most of my life i might even like this trilogy a tiny bit if it wasnt called star wars at all episode vii was just okay viii made no sense but was just barely watchable ix is just unforgivable extremely disappointing im not sure if i am a star wars fan any more and seriously doubt i will ever spend any money on the franchise ever again ps the 1 star is for lando flying the millennium falcon his presence and dialogue as he flew were the only part of this film which reminded me of star wars
Jul 3 2020,negative,this was so bad bad script bad plot poor character development  just skip it
Jul 2 2020,positive,pretty good an enjoyable mess but definitely not the best star wars has to offer
Jul 2 2020,positive,yes this movie panders to star wars fans yes it feels uneven the pacing is often very rushed i wasnt an overall fan of the last jedi although i liked some of it i think this movie beats the prequel mess and last jedi by far  we old folks who actually remember the thrill of seeing the first movies at the theater have to keep in mind that we do have to let the past die we have to pass the baton losing leia in real life made things even more high stakes jj abrams and disney are not george lucas and nobody can truly fill those shoes however jj is extremely gifted and did his very best honoring leia and dealing with 42 years of unbelievably worldchanging source material that has sadly been convoluted over the years but who of us can say we too havent like luke han and even our beloved princess leia become something far different than we hoped 42 years ago
Jul 1 2020,positive,given the fact the last jedi shouldve been a movie straight to disney chanel how childish it was jj gave me hope and discard the trash he was left with to create an amazing ending to the trilogy 
Jul 1 2020,negative,its apparent that there was no plan for this trilogy was better than last jedi but still awful notmystarwars
Jul 1 2020,negative,this movie left me feeling extremely disappointed the entire trilogy had a make it up as we go along mindset around it and therefore it is not surprising that this ending was so hectic and rushed many moments in this film contradicted those in the original films in a way that ruptured the flow of the 9 movies in this series various characters did not receive the endings that they deserved and incomplete story arcs left viewers hanging which ultimately caused the rise of skywalker to be possibly the worst star wars movie to date
Jun 30 2020,negative,i actually liked the first two movies in the sequel trilogy but this one is just bad all on its own some of the dialogue in this movie is so bad finn and poe do almost nothing in this movie the final battle is underwhelming and palpatine coming back to life was just idiotic overall this movie was absolutely disappointing as both an ending to the sequel trilogy and the socalled skywalker saga
Jun 30 2020,negative,this is a terrible movie so terrible that there is nothing to say i cant understand that people like this shit there is nothing good there except the visual and everything nothing else a terrible script terrible characters a terrible production and the actors in general did not try and the problem is that this is the canon of the star wars universe
Jun 29 2020,positive,the course correction from the last jedi was not as jarring as others make it seem but pacing did have to compensate for lost time at the start scenes seemed purposeful and attempted to revive some force awakens threads which were aggressively cut by the last jedi ben solo and rey were given their chances to shine but finn and poe didnt have as much to do they did not have very meaningful roles in the last jedi either accordingly ben and rey achieved more closure than finn and poe i would have liked more force sensitive characters leias force powers were given some very important context han returned for some closure overall this movie had an unnecessarily difficult task and it did a fairly decent job i would appreciate a fan edit that trims the trilogy together much of the last jedi could be left out the last jedi had some good ideas but ultimately the dueling vision of abrams and johnson were just not compatible
Jun 29 2020,negative,the story didnt make any more sense than the rest of the new trilogy and felt like a slap in the face as a star wars fan even ignoring the old star wars universe which was declared noncanon by disney the plot broke its own lore presented within this movie alone great visuals wasted on poor writing
Jun 29 2020,positive,the tricky thing with jj abrams is that he knows where to go and never been influenced by the others
Jun 27 2020,negative,without a doubt this movie is a steaming pile of sht  no story  no anything of any interest how anyone making this film thought the script was worth the effort to commit to film is beyond me i loved the og trilogy easily the worst of the 9 films can i have my money back
Jun 26 2020,positive,great watch will watch again and can recommend  now for the original fans of the space wizards i can understand that this isnt their cup of tea anymore the pacing of the originals was slow and dramatic with small things being revolutionary and this lots and more to the same computer powered fast paced cinematic magic  for everyone the pacing is a little all over the place and the importance of locations vary wildly the movie itself is oddly long and rushed almost they they were going to split it into multiple movies but decided it had to be one movie  that all said none of that particularly matters to me we have great characters on an epic adventure against a indomitable foe with really good development mostly the actors all know their characters well the effects are great and it looks good  that said the big climax is kind of nonsense there is a sloppy reveal a weak redemption a shoddy premise and just an odd choice of final moments  the 79 trilogy is definitely flawed and it wouldnt be anything without 46 probably fine without 13 but 79 is probably what im going to rewatch and all those numbers show what this should be a series a series of movies maybe but there are a rich number of stories here that dont deserved to be rushed or forgotten
Jun 26 2020,positive,its really underrated and has amazing pace en vfx and sfx my fav star wars movie
Jun 26 2020,negative,a clusterfk dumpster fire ending to a misguided inhuman trainwreck that profanes one of the great cultural mythologies of our time
Jun 25 2020,negative,id honestly give this movie 1 star if it didnt have lightsaber sounds  i literally laughed out loud the first time kylo force called rey and when the spy was killed and when kylo threw his weapon into the ocean  i mean the movie looked really pretty and had a bunch of halfbaked remakes of old scenes and there was plenty of finn yelling random characters names but the movie just wasnt good other than the objectively incredible cgi unfortunately the story telling was equally as objectively bad as the cgi was objectively good  there just wasnt anything organic about how the movie came together it was all contrived   anywho 1 star movie but 1 extra star for lightsaber sounds
Jun 24 2020,negative,terrible yet again i really hope they re do these movies i didnt even waste my money going to the theater this time
Jun 24 2020,negative,the rise of skywalker is a bloated and convoluted mess of a movie that should have never been released into theaters jj is not creative in any way shape or form and gives us another copy of the ot tfa was a copy of a new hope tlj gave us something new but jj didnt know how to handle kylo ren being the main villain and instead he brought back a preexisting character whos deaths meaningful there is nothing new or creative in this movie   this movie will satisfy a few types of people 1 if you are a casual viewer who just wants to have fun 2 if you hate the last jedi and want everything set up in it to be undone but if you care about a movie having  good story and character development and whatnot you will hate it just as much as i did  ill only cover a few things because i dont want this to be too long  i just want to start off by saying that this movie is only meant to satisfy fans who hated the last jedi jj refused to take on the challenge of making things that people didnt like in tlj better but instead he just undid everything and replaced it with something that will satisfy the man children who couldnt handle that tlj did something they werent expecting people wanted rey to be the descendant of some powerful force user so now she is a palatine people wanted rey finn and poe to have more time together so the first half of the movie is wasted on them going on a video game adventure quest to find a map people didnt like rose so she is written out people dont like how a female told a man what to do in tlj so no more of that this entire movie is just a retcon of the last jedi its a pile of fan service that is tied together through an awful story  the editing in this movie is honestly embarrassing and im sorry but the acting isnt great there are so many moments where the characters react in the completely wrong way it feels like the actors were reacting to something different but then the editors didnt have a clip of the actors reacting to what they were supposed to be reacting to and they just through in another clip in which the characters say something vaguely similar to what they should have said and call it done when they think chewbacca explodes finn says no in a way that you would hay if you had just lost the ball in a football game he should have emotion because he thinks his friend just blew up and died but nope  the visuals are not creative its all stuff weve seen before and nothing new in tlj we got crait where the surface was covered in salt and underneath was red it was a beautiful and creative visual this movie has nothing we get another desert planet a planet with houses that look like they could be on earth where it snows a planet with grass and an ocean and a planet that is just dark nothing is creative  the first half of the film is fun to watch but the pacing is horrible its wasting time that should have been spent covering the massive amount of ground they had to and the plot is very generic and has nothing new to offer the entire first half feels like something you would watch in a star wars kids tv shows rather than the final movie in a franchise   finn does nothing in this movie in tfa he learns to be a loyal friend in tlj he learns to fight for a larger cause in tros he yells rey a lot he has no arc whatsoever at the end he gets force powers as a plot convenience so he can tell them which ship is the main ship its ridiculous how he can tell you out of 500 star destroyers which one is the main ship by using the force but on pasano he cant use the force to tell the difference between two transports when somebody he loves is on one  the second half of this movie is horrible its worse than anybody could imagine i dont even know where to begin because it was so miserable and exhausting first palpatine is back jj just undid anakins redemption anakin was turned to the dark side by palpatine then turned back to the light by luke to ensure that he was good again he gave his life to defeat palatine and destroy the dark   rey being a palatine is the single worst thing to happen in this movie rey being moody is important for a multitude of reasons one her counterpart is a skywalker he has this massive legacy he has to carry on his shoulders and he feels so much pressure and stress about it rey is the opposite her weakness is that she has no legacy she has no lineage also rey being a nobody is a reminder that anybody can be with the force you dont need to have a parent with the force because it can manifest in anybody then jj retcons this by making rey a palpatine   i had fun watching the first half even though the pacing was awful and it was riddled with plot conveniences plot holes and retcons but the second half is unforgivably bad im shocked to my core that people actually enjoy this mess
Jun 24 2020,negative,this is embarrassingly bad full of plot holes nonexistent character arcs exposition in what is possibly the greatest franchise of all time and with unlimited money available it staggers belief that theyve messed up the key basics of storytelling the writer and director should be ashamed of themselves
Jun 24 2020,negative,lost for words on how bad this is
Jun 24 2020,positive,considering the mess he was left to deal with from episode 8 jj abrams did a fantastic job in repairing the trilogy and in fact it was better than expected for me i had serious doubts about the story after the last jedi ruined one of the great heros of cinema in luke skywalker ive been a fan since 1977 and this is one of the strongest episodes made since the original trilogy the force is strong with this one
Jun 23 2020,positive,it could be better i defenitly loved it
Jun 23 2020,negative,this is a great example of how to destroy a great story how yo insult a 5 decade fan base this movie is crap
Jun 23 2020,positive,lacks imagination so many story lines going on and such rapid changes the whole thing is a dumpsterfire mess hard to have any emotional involvement in these characters at one point i feel like im rooting for the dark side to just consume this series and call it a day george lucas bottled lightening twice and since then its been uneventful so another shootemup scifi romp barely good enough to watch not good enough to care about
Jun 22 2020,negative,somehow worse than the last jedi
Jun 22 2020,negative,it was entertaining but it wasnt star wars
Jun 22 2020,negative,the film is full of pointless macguffin hunting as well as contrived plot points overall a poorly written film and a terrible ending to the saga
Jun 22 2020,positive,i am surprised its better than the last jedi
Jun 22 2020,positive,considering the circumstances jj did an excellent job at creating a final installment for the star wars saga and bringing it to a satisfying end
Jun 22 2020,negative,wayyyyyyy better than the last jedi but still not a good star wars movie  if youre a casual it is a decent enough watch  if you actually care about star wars you can see how lazyyyyy and below average this film was  again it feels like the writers directors have never seen a star wars film  characters are very poorly developed in all 3 movies not necessarily this films fault and there are scenes that are totally inconsistent w star wars canon  but the reylo lovehate thing is decent enough for a casual watch
Jun 22 2020,negative,im a huge sw fan this movie made no sensethe entire plot was cut and pasted together with a nostalgic shoutout every 5 minutes oh wait its another death star the ending sucked toopoof vanish group hugwtf is that the actors performancesridley driver isaac boyega even though they totally did boyegas character a disserviceare the only things that actually redeem the movie at all did lucasor even filonilook at this thing before it was released ugh
Jun 21 2020,positive,another unimpressive movie in a long line of unimpressive movies how are they in the precise position for the skyline to match so perfectly with the dagger why would leia have to die just to communicate with her son using the force seriously youre bringing rei back to life after you just killed her 2 minutes ago horrific writing the only redeeming feature is the clear effort that the fx team put into this movie they did 10 times to work the writers did and where was the director did he not read the script theres like a 100 holes in this plot but go ahead and watch it just so you can say to yourself that youre never gonna watch another starwars movie for as long as you live after this
Jun 21 2020,neutral,mediocre is the best thing i can say about this movie
Jun 21 2020,negative,what is wrong with you people this is nothing but a lazy plothole filled over the place story lacking piece of shit  this is genuinely the worse movie ive ever seen
Jun 20 2020,positive,this is inarguably the greatest film of all time the beautiful ending to an amazing 42 year long saga dont believe any of the stupid critics saying this movie is bad its a masterpiece trust the audience scores not the critics
Jun 20 2020,negative,difficult to measure my disappointment with rise messy convoluted plot with previouslyunheard of characters popping in and out without impact or development despite the script clearly expecting me to care i didnt the retconning of last jedi sticks out like a lightsaber in a dark room huge plot holes you could drive a star destroyer through  you know the ones in an area of space nobody could get to built by who exactly  messy is the word i keep coming back to so contrived and annoying that i just couldnt feel my way into it  every few minutes something pulled me out of the story by being overblown underdeveloped or overlycomplicated often at the same time and hux seriously were meant to buy that  stars for ian mcdiarmid being generally wonderful again and the effects being predictably breathtaking in places but its not enough to save it this is a poor film
Jun 20 2020,positive,the rise of skywalker is a mess i would lay a lot of the blame on the last jedi jj abrams did what he could but it isnt enough i had a good time with rise but its an awful end for the saga the fact that anakin skywalker wasnt in this movie except for small voice cameo is just mind blowing this film for me doesnt conclude the skywalker saga but rather the disappointing sequel trilogy
Jun 20 2020,negative,wow this movie really put the last nail in star wars coffin
Jun 20 2020,positive,a great conclusion to the best movie series ever it was truly epic and a major improvement over the last jedi
Jun 19 2020,positive,this movie is amazing the old critics that keep reviewing new movies that they dont understand is chaos because some movies that they review they say are bad but are great like this one rey as a person grows finn is still amazing and this will always be one of the greatest star wars movies ever made  c3po is still a great droid and they really show his sweet side in this star wars movie even though disney kinda messed up with the first 2 this one comes back strong
Jun 19 2020,neutral,the expectation must have been too great  i had seen some negative comments so i was ready to accept a certain level of disappointment yet i was still hoping enough to go see the film on the very first day it opened both to satisfy my curiosity and to prevent seeing some spoilery stuff on the web before seeing the film  george lucas star wars has been part of my genetic makeup as a film lover ever since i saw the original in the theaters in 1977 when i was 12 years old i liked movies before but this started a lifelong passion with cinema first in sciencefiction and then a much broader spectrum as i grew older while i loved the first two star wars movies i was however never a fan of return of the jedi and positively detested the prequels which i have never dared to revisit after my initial viewing at the theater still i was excited yet cautious in 2015 when a concluding trilogy was brought forth by disney  it is an ambitious and scary endeavor to find a satisfactory conclusion to a saga started 42 years ago i can understand why director jj abrams who had earned a bad reputation with handling endings after his lackluster denouement to his popular series lost finds this task challenging however he has an undeniable talent with rebooting movie series like he demonstrated with mission impossible iii almost strangled out of existence by the excesses of john woo star trek and of course star wars episode vii  the force awakens  with star wars episode ix  the rise of skywalker  abrams creates a film that suffers the same faults that plagued force awakens a desire to please the status quo that creates a succession of scenes that are strongly reminiscent of fanfavorites moments in the previous series trying to capture the lightning of the original trilogy while in the force awakens abrams managed to circumvent that sense of déja vu with a strong cast that married adroitly members of the classic cast with charming new characters and a streamlined script by lawrence kasdan and abrams himself that managed to make the audience care about those characters and their tribulations  in rise however we are assaulted with so much action that the characters have little much to do than react and we are left in the end with the impression that the only ones who have a chance to emote or grow through the story are rey daisy ridley and kylo ren adam driver they are in fact given the chance to stare at each other with intensity and duel many times in the film in often gorgeous setpieces the conclusion of their complex relationship wont be a surprise to many although the big reveal of reys origins may be surprising not great just surprising  the score by john williams is appropriately composed of a string of greatest hits which is a pleasure to hear but accentuates the sense of déja vu the will to offer the fans what they want creates awkward moments when characters show up or situation occurs just for the sake of fan service such scenes end up being maudlin more than anything with a floundering sense of false sentimentality there are moments in the film manufactured to elicit an emotional response and i am the perfect target for such moments i am a complete crybaby at movies i will get choked up and tear up extremely easily yet here the only moment i did was at the very beginning of the film  in anticipation as the lights went out and i felt a surge of excitement in the capacity crowd in the theater  i am one of those who actually enjoyed the previous chapter the last jedi where i felt that director rian johnson took chances and went into very interesting directions even putting in a bit of a political statement after having watched abrams last effort i have to confirm that johnsons film was a much better film and had stunningly emotional moments laura derns sacrifice mark hamills last moments that finds no equal in this last installment  probably the most telling moment from the projection was the complete silence from the crowd as the end credits appeared onscreen after probably my favorite scene of the film which beautifully caps the series with a nostalgic twist no applause from a crowd that had shown great enthusiasm at the start of the showing just stunned silence  still the film moves along briskly and the special effects are impressive but as a conclusion to a flawed yet beloved saga this final chapter fails sadly to actually rise to the occasion pun shamefully and fully intended  ps is it just me or is the force way more powerful in the new movies than in the past must be all that midichlorian in the water
Jun 18 2020,positive,i am a huge fan of all the star wars movies this one is no exception i believe the storyline is great as well as the sound and visuals kept me excited from start to finish
Jun 18 2020,positive,the rise of skywalker was not what i expected for the last movie in the star wars saga it was not the best way to rap up the whole saga but it was an excellent movie nonetheless it had an avengers endgame kind of twist to it and we got to see many old and new faces the editing was superb and the producers put a lot of effort into certain scenes that made up the movie
Jun 18 2020,negative,horrible movie george lucas said he flat out hate it this movie and the last jedi thanks disney for buying a amazing franchise and then ruining it disney you killed it star wars will never be the same
Jun 18 2020,positive,well by far the best of the new trilogy despite gaping plot holes and new interpretations of how the force works good fun and worth a watch but my nerdier side did react to some of the scenes
Jun 17 2020,positive,a must watch very impressed with jj abrams work
Jun 17 2020,positive,star wars the rise of skywalker deserves some credit and certainly more than the force awakens does it has gripping fight scenes some eerie moments and many  visually stunning frames however the plot was full of holes there were scenes so dumb that i literally caught myself laughing out loud in the theater and the premise of a doomsday device was one i had already seen in star wars three times before somehow fourteen years and an entire trilogy after the last movie of the prequel series we find ourselves in a universe that is relatively unchanged despite j j abrams additions
Jun 17 2020,negative,upside of this movie  it is better than the totally abysmal the last jedi but that really isnt hard considering that the last jedi is among the worst movies i ever saw thats the only good thing about the rise of skywalker for me though and surely doesnt mean that it is in any way good the story totally makes no sense and is full of plotholes the way they killed off leia was even more stupid than how they killed off luke in the previous movie apart from that there was lots of action but little to no story i doubt i will ever watch this movie again id rather just watch the old movies and read some of the older novels i know many fans didnt like the expanded universe much but honestly it was so much better than what disney gave us in recent years i really hope disney doesnt do another star wars trilogy  they already ruined star wars enough  but i guess that is wishful thinking
Jun 17 2020,positive,meh i expected more from jj we miss lawrence kasdan
Jun 16 2020,negative,this movie was beyond disappointing for me its as if its creator thinks we are too stupid to look past the cool flashing lights and images to see that there is absolutely no story its oh lets go look over here for this thing then over here for this then over here for this now lets kill reys magic grandpa i am a huge fan of almost every star wars media ever put out but this movie and the two before are pure crap
Jun 16 2020,negative,never seen so many hamfisted moments had a laugh or two but a majority of my time was spent rolling my eyes
Jun 16 2020,positive,rise of skywalker is the most star warsy star wars movie since return of the jedi i guess not everybody is looking for that in a star wars movie based on critic reviews for skywalker and the bewildering last jedi i hated it but this one checked all the right boxes for me its a tad convoluted but still a super fun trip through the galaxy that surprisingly elicited more emotions from me in the theater than any film i can recall in a long while yay star wars
Jun 15 2020,negative,what can i say that hasnt already been said really its just so sad to see what disney has done to star wars this movie was basically a joke to me i saw it for free at a work party so at least i didnt lose money but i did lose time which is move valuable i missed the first 20 minutes or so apparently they dont show previews when its a rented out theater and i found myself constantly checking my watch wondering how much longer the movie would run i came in with the lowest of expectations after the train wreck that was the last jedi and this movie showed me they hadnt been lowered nearly enough that kathleen kennedy has a job still just shows that this world is not just
Jun 15 2020,negative,as i like to call it the rise of the crystal skullwalker was the dumbest most grandiose betrayal of a film saga in history the three prequels were better told as stories which is really saying something dumb dumb dumb
Jun 15 2020,negative,this movie constantly trys to redeem the sequel trilogy but whenever it gets close it sacrifices story for a visual  this also leads to lazy writing like when they claim the holdo maneuver is one and a million while attempting to fix the last jedis failures but backtracks and uses it at the end because it looks cool  the ships not being able to leave the planet is also lazy writing due to the explanation being they dont know which way is up  this lazy writing is mostly caused by the directors want for them to have more stakes then return of the jedi but he also wants there to be a way for the good guys to win  this also causes him to drag in a giant fleet at the end with the explanation of lando asked even though no one came to their aid when they needed help just a year earlier  ultimately this movie relies to much on fan service and cool visuals but fails to bring anything of substance to the table
Jun 14 2020,negative,it felt like a child wrote the ending based on things they remembered from other films didnt follow the last film and had so many plot holes in the film it was akin to lace also the characters in the films had relatively unexplained changes of heart
Jun 13 2020,negative,watching whole last 3 movies was so cringe that i literally feel bad its the most senseless boring shit ever full of sentimental pictures and etc
Jun 13 2020,positive,the effects where cool and with cool action 
Jun 13 2020,positive,its a good movie not as bad as you hear in the internet
Jun 13 2020,positive,a thrilling end to the sequel trilogy that delivers classic star wars as well as a fitting tribute to the 9 episode saga  like all films in the series before it the visuals and cinematography were simply stunning a consistent strong point in star wars  john williams delivers once again a fantastic score that hits all the right notes  fans of star wars will not be disappointed
Jun 12 2020,negative,its not bad its worse
Jun 12 2020,negative,me the last jedi will be the worst star wars film ever jj you overestimate my power
Jun 11 2020,positive,star wars rise of sky review 710  pros  star wars nostalgia  ben solos arc  jj did the best he could with what he was given in the last jedi  cons  destroys anakins entire character meaning from the previous 6 films  felt like they didnt have a full plan for 3 films
Jun 11 2020,negative,good cinematography cgi special effects sound design score and performances  worst screenplay ever filmed  absolutely inept and embarrassing writing  shockingly so  they didnt have a story to tell and it was obvious it broke my heart because there are so many wonderful writers and directors with stories to tell who understand the craft and who understand writing for characters instead of plot  absolutely nonsensical plot from beginning to end as if the script was a 2nd grade writing project  every character was wasted because jj and chris terrio had no interest in taking on the challenge  at least the last jedi dared to be a film with a coherent story  characters constantly expositing plot is not a story and it is unfathomable to me that these guys were allowed to write this screenplay  zero craft
Jun 11 2020,neutral,as a star wars movie this is really disappointing  final rating c
Jun 10 2020,positive,this film is being unfairly slammed  daisy ridleys performance is amazing some great stuff here and none of the cringes associated with the prequel trilogy
Jun 10 2020,positive,well story is reeeealy idiot dont blame the movie but i like the movie itself
Jun 10 2020,negative,the 3rd worst star wars movie to date and with a bad ending still the first watch i passed a good time
Jun 10 2020,negative,i dont think this movie is as bad as some people says it was definitely the best theater experience compared to the rest of the trilogy although when you think about it the plot makes no sense at all palpatine returning and getting killed the way he is killed is a terrible idea not only because undermines the whole ot and anakins redemption but also because it makes him look like a dumb idiot who cant stop shooting lightning until half of his face is melted the protagonists dynamic between each other is decent although individually the characters are not compelling at all rey is not a memorable hero poe is the same character as in tfa and finn is just there yelling and playing with space horses as inclusive as this movies are supposed to be the writers are too cowards to romantically pair the only two characters that have some sort of chemistry in the whole trilogy finn and poe instead they find a female romantic interest for both of them kylo and rey kissing in the end is as funny as dumb he was literally hitler a few hours before that but hey he is good now the whole wayfinder search was boring as hell and ultimately pointless as kylo just smashes the damn thing the attempt to put leia in the movie by using unused footage from tfa is passable at best and the whole concept behind the palpatines fleet is just awful the fact that the ships dont know which way is up still irritates me and i dont understand why did they think that making them all capable of destroying entire planets was a good thing even with all these terrible mistakes there are some aspects of the movie that are decent the music is good as always the visuals are stunning the movie in general is pretty entertaining and the lightsaber duel even though is nowhere as good as the ones in the prequels is decent oh and babu frik is incredibly cute
Jun 10 2020,positive,dont get me wrong this movie had some major problems but to rate it a 1 or 2 is idiotic the acting is good the directing is good the fx are good the music is good the script isnt very good the pacing is not good but it is far from a bad movie the biggest problem with the movie is there is too much going on movies that are 1 or 2 stars are movies like burt wobderstone tremors a cold day in hell bright attack of the clones and independence day resurgence sites like this where people rate good movies as s just show that not everyone should have a voice
Jun 9 2020,negative,when you set out to create a further trilogy to one of the worlds most beloved franchises perhaps a rough storyboard is in order it is clear that did not occur here this movie is nonsensical garbage and has irreparably damaged my interest in starwars
Jun 9 2020,negative,rise of skywalker feels like a fanfic writing by a 9 yo it was the scene where chewie almost died onl for it to be revealed he was on another ship that i knew this was gonna be a bad movie this was supposed to be the grand finale to an even grander saga and it just fell flat
Jun 9 2020,negative,its a star wars fan fic that does nothing bold and is more cute than it is touching
Jun 8 2020,negative,another movie ruined by jj abrams lack of direction and loss of interest in the story
Jun 8 2020,neutral,my score rating means that i half loved it and half hated it at first i thought it was the greatest film in the world but over time watching it over and over again i realized that this film has a lot of problems and was very rushed from what ive seen but although it does have some interesting moments palpatine  coming back was my favorite and so was when we called herself a skywalker at the end to honor the actual skywalkers but of course as i said this film is very rushed and feels overwhelming to process kathleen kennedy and disney completely screwed over this movie but its not just them i believe this movie was terrible because of ryan johnsons the last jedi after watching that movie and over again i also realize that there was things in there that i hated like luke becoming the asshole that gives up and then in the end hes all ok im back now but im dying its just bullshit and theres so many other things that im not gonna get into right now i really want the jj cut to happen time will only tell if that will actually happen but if youre star wars fan who was completely disappointed with this movie but also loved some things about it its so fun to watch
Jun 8 2020,negative,the half star goes to look of the film that was very crisp and spectacular  the plot was trash the dialogue was cheesy and the characters unfinished  rey is confused fin is made to look soft as twinkie filling poe is the han solo of the film but lack charisma comedic timing and common sense kylo kylo kylo this is some bs how can he be the bad guy for 2 movies and then be reys love interest for thirty seconds hes killed his father indirectly killed his mom killed her allies and friends so lets makeout they teased fin and rey together since the force awakens but then just drop that story arch to the wayside poe gets a love interest who we never see  the emperor as a villain was a joke how can your villain spend the whole film hooked on a life support machine how did the emperor hide and build all those ships how where the rebels able to rally that many ships at the end so many plot holes not enough time talent and money to fill them  peace
Jun 8 2020,positive,well done after last jedii was so dismayed disgusted and disappointedthat i chose not to see this one in the theatre i just finally decided to watch it on demand and it was quite good jj resurrected this from the ashes of the utterly awful last jedi a very good film with a lot of muchneeded call backs to true star wars form for us true fans thank goodness
Jun 7 2020,neutral,star wars episode ix the rise of skywalker oh boy were in for a good one the rise of skywalker is the conclusion the nine part skywalker saga that george lucas began in 1977s star warsa true fan doesnt call it a new hope the part about it being concluding was the best part of this movie the worst part about this movie well the actual plot story and characters they werent handled very well ok maybe general hux was handledalmost well lets just admit it the rey and kylo kiss came out of nowhere but still it did a pretty good job with all the payoff fanservice and action sequences overall it wasnt the best way to end the skywalker saga but it definitely wasnt the worst way but it still pales in comparison to the other conclusion of a years long saga made by a studio owned by disney that was released in 2019 you know which movie im talking about
Jun 6 2020,negative,i saw a new hope when it released in 1977 as a child i found it wonderous and inspiring i remember leaving the theater and looking up at the night sky imagining xwings flying around in some faroff galaxy what made star wars so incredible and me a lifelong fan was the simple heros journey and struggle with good vs evil multidimensional characters you could love or hate and movie magic that sparked the imagination while were all painfully aware of how lucas blew it with episodes 13 disneys 69 were just as bad and in some ways worse this series and rise of skywalker in particular represent the worst of star wars the characters are flat and uninspiring the story is a boring convoluted mess of politics and morally ambiguous ideology and the heros journey has become a punchline of political correctness now that this main story arc has come to an inglorious death star like ending i implore disney to get back to what made star wars the cultural and cinematic phenomenon it once was fortunately offerings such as rogue one solo and the mandalorian give longtime fans like me a new hope
Jun 6 2020,positive,compared to the previous episodes the rise of skywalker is probably one of the most carefully handled film of the sequel trilogy with an addition of iconic scenes and characters
Jun 6 2020,negative,absolute poo  i wish i could give this 0 stars
Jun 6 2020,negative,is your brand getting stale is the market saturated is the fandom fatigued jj it hell leave it looking like rome after the vandals visited on holiday get some spaceships and fly them around get some people with laser guns to run around get some people to wave their hands and make things flying around slap a star wars label on it and bobs your uncle it had its moments but like the last one pretty much not until the last 20 minutes or so wanna watch some thing good go check out dr horribles singalong blog want to watch a good star wars film try rogue one or the first one which was actually the fourth one this turkey is better than the holiday special but not quite as good as the battle for endor
Jun 5 2020,positive,this movie clearly shows disney has not planned the trilogy it deviates from last jedi although i loved last jedi it was rushed deviated although the visual effects are outstandingperformance by the lead actors was good there were many unanswered questions but this movie has not talked about itpalpatine return was unnecessary  the fight sequence was good but not great although the last jedi between kylo ren and rey with palpatine was amazing it would be amazing if they didnt bring back palpatine and made kylo ren the lead antagonist this would have been a perfect end to the trilogy
Jun 5 2020,positive,actually not bad really not bad  but the previous movie fucked the plot a bit 
Jun 5 2020,negative,the backgrounds costumes and action scenes were amazing the lines seemed so cheesy and recycled from the old glory days especially the zoom ins on lando  they abused the technique too much poe is a wannabe han rey is a wannabe luke the only original character is flynn but hes way too self righteous to be taken seriously as a character hes more of an npc
Jun 5 2020,positive,i was not a huge fan of the force awakens and i super hated the last jedi which forestalled me seeing the rise of skywalker until now  its a shame the first 2 in the newer series crushed the goodwill out of so many of the fans because this is the only proper and amazing movie in the series  rise of skywalker is essentially everything i had hoped for a sw movie to be since disney took over  it so perfectly nailed what i wanted that i am actually sad that the series with the cast will not be continuing now  well done to jj abrams et al on this last and best entry  really good  if you are like me and on the fence or just checked out after the first two films please consider watching this one if only to make up for the previous films in the series with an amazing final act
Jun 4 2020,negative,it really sucks it sucks everytime i see it
Jun 4 2020,positive,for those of us who enjoy every j j abrams film who also see him as one of the great story tellers of our time as tolkien and lewis me and my family enjoyed every moment of rise of skywalker for those of us walking in the way there was not one but if confusion simply awe inspiring eye4runeye
Jun 4 2020,negative,what have they done
Jun 4 2020,positive,i dont understand all the hate me and my entire family absolutely loved it and were all big star wars fans
Jun 4 2020,negative,i have just watched 18 hours and 41 minutes of film just to catch up and watch this movie and it definitely wasnt worth the time the movie looked great ill give them that the animation looked realistic that one scene of young luke and leia skywalker fighting kind of through me off the ending was bad spoilers if you think you can stomach through this rey dies kylo ren heals her they kiss and then kylo ren immediately dies what was jj abrams thinking as somebody that has not until now has never seen any star wars movies barely remembers any of the many minor events from this movie along with the other 8 movies and just found it ridiculous
Jun 3 2020,negative,the level of absurdity surpassed my limit
Jun 3 2020,positive,it was just ok not amazing or anything
Jun 3 2020,negative,just an embarrassment to such a beloved franchise and ending so poorly
Jun 3 2020,neutral,the worst star wars movie ever made the plot is not good and some of the choices were only made to extend this ridiculous and poorly written story the beginning feels like a video game so many quests uninteresting and boring the 3rd act should be the biggest and most epic final battle of all time but the execution lacked in emotion and action the kiss was very uncomfortable and cringey there was never this romantic connection between rey and ben that this movie so desperately wants us to believe in the rest was just an ok star wars adventure nothing more
Jun 2 2020,negative,lile a lot of people i have been a fan since childhood but this movie is just friggin moronic almost as bad a conclusion to a great series as got
Jun 2 2020,positive,i liked the movie a lot although the plot twists were lazy i enjoyed it beautiful end to the saga
Jun 1 2020,positive,in the final chapter of the skywalker saga jj abrams tries to course correct from plot decisions made in the last jedi and while the film may lack originality abrams still delivers a nostalgic scifi adventure with superb performances and some spectacular action  specifically a watersoaked lightsaber battle between kylo ren and rey at the remains of the death star
May 31 2020,positive,star wars the rise of skywalker a grand and delightful finale of the beloved decades old saga that stays in its comfort zone for the better good
May 31 2020,negative,the movie wasnt terrible but it certainly wasnt great either they spent way too much time in the two previous films tearing down all our heroes and then realized they had made a mistake so they tried to prop them all back up it didnt work sorry you burned that bridge with the last jedi and with all the social media attacks on the fans that didnt like what you did to their heroes i mean when you have stars and film makers attacking the fans youve lost the narrative even marvel hasnt learned that lesson but it is disney so i guess its to be expected
May 30 2020,positive,better than episode 8
May 30 2020,positive,i did not hate this at all they tied up all the loose ends and plenty of fun action sequences sure it was clunky but arent all star wars movies solid concept solid execution
May 30 2020,negative,this was the worst out of the new saga character choices were dubious all round do you take the quick kill or the hard kill whyyyy and how many  times can you hijak an empire destoryer really no chemistry between charachters made me crinje the whole time story line was robotic why did they even bother
May 30 2020,negative,just a waste of time and money i cant believe how badly they ruined this franchise
May 30 2020,positive,much better than i thought it would be and largely due to the performances ridley and driver are again amazing and i nearly welled up over the scene with carrie fisher
May 30 2020,negative,awful attempt at finishing one of the greatest franchises of all time do not waste your time unless you want to see some cool special effects
May 29 2020,negative,its not the size of the threat or consequence if the heros lose that make you care its your emotional investment in it you can find thousands of movies that have very small scale problems with small scale consequences if the heros fail that can still bring you into the stroy and make you seriously care just look at love stories  if the couple doesnt get together and fall in love in the grand scheme of things it doesnt matter but it can still bring you to tears the rise of skywalker is centered around 1000 deathstars and wow what a surprise that no one cared and the fans werent invested in it
May 29 2020,negative,the best thing about this film is that it signals the end of the current trilogy that started off great and got progressively worse
May 29 2020,negative,i went into the movie with a lot of questions but when i left i had more questions than i did answers
May 29 2020,negative,it was kinda just boring like rays character arc failed in my opinion it was nothing new or that i hadnt seen before
May 29 2020,negative,ruins the whole main star wars arc  this movie ruins all of star wars
May 28 2020,negative,lame stale lacks presence short on acting talent and is just old appearing
May 28 2020,positive,i totally enjoyed the movie i think it was an amazing way to end the skywalker saga and you could totally feel the star wars energy during the movie the character development of rey and ben was brilliant and emotionally complex and you can tell it is a more poetical version of the previous movies
May 27 2020,negative,good visual very visual so much visual story  confusing is it a new trilogy or stand alone  i wish i was 16y again to feel less confuse seriously i only watch it for the visual after seeing it twice really cool
May 27 2020,positive,a fitting end to the skywalker saga i thoroughly enjoyed it plenty of adventure action emotion and surprises along the way  the references to every aspect of star wars on the big and small screen was a nice touch  i do feel there were some missed opportunites like the knights of ren but as a lifelong star wars fan i loved it overall
May 27 2020,negative,screws over all the original movies
May 27 2020,positive,good movie  entertaining i really like palpatine returns but actually that could be better
May 26 2020,negative,the movie was poorly thought out and clearly only focused on pleasing the generation that grew up with the first trilogy at the expense of the storylines of the new characters the newly introduced characters like finn rose and poa could have had much better stories and well thought out backgrounds and motivations they should have had a more concentrated bad guy because kylo was clearly conflicted since the beginning of the trilogy and then bringing in palpatine had no correlation to the new generation it seems they had no plan to actually give the characters purpose they just wanted to tie up there stories and they didnt do it in a good way
May 26 2020,negative,bummer it appears that the plan to remake the original star wars trilogy despite the lucasfilm contract of sale explicitly prohibiting alteration of the lucas era films was carried out working so hard to get a callback shot of chewie in chains  member that like every story post buyout its big on flash and low on substance like scavenging every idea in these new films was picked up because the creative individual who collaborated to build the star wars universe left it behind criminally unimaginative
May 26 2020,negative,the overall feeling through the whole movie is that too many things are happening too fast and for no reason the relationship with the new characters introduced in this movie looks forced and fake because they didnt spend time in developing them it seems like the wanted to undo everything set on the last jedi and ran out of time to tell the story straight sadly a huge let down for any fan of the series and just a bad movie
May 26 2020,negative,i series of badly put together scenes with awful acting i finally decided to see it downloaded i didnt even bother to go to the cinema and i was not disappointed it was as bad as expected  watch the animated series instead much better stories and fights and for some reason they make sense i have rewatched them several times not sure i will do with this sequal trilogie
May 26 2020,positive,it was really really good many people feel it was rushed and that things were not explained properly and there is truth in that on the other hand it is such a treat that i think it would be a disservice to oneself to scrutinize how they found a sith knife or how exactly how that helped them find a wayfinder sure i would sometimes have preferred something more plausible but these are just story telling apparatus that doesnt detract from the real joy of the overall experience
May 25 2020,negative,this movie was awful it breaks so many inuniverse laws and destroys the lore not to mention the pacing is awful just going from action set piece to action set piece as well as the lazy writing they bring back palpatine ruining the chosen one prophecy and dont even bother to explain how the amount of plot holes and continuity errors are countless the lightsaber fight is also extremely underwhelming it has no music no emotional value and treats lightsabers like medieval battle axes weighing hundreds of pounds absolutely awful it tries to cram way too much stuff into one movie and the ending is just unbelievable the amount of frustration that comes from the line rey says at the end is unimaginable unless youve seen the movie of course this movie is a disgrace to star wars and an insult to film making
May 25 2020,neutral,a weak way to end this newer trilogy its a lazy film that will barely keep your attention the worst of the star wars franchise to date first and only viewing  5102020
May 25 2020,negative,worst movie since phantom menace
May 25 2020,negative,emporer palpatine coming back completely negates the entire skywalker trilogy anakin skywalkers arc from episode 1 to 3 was him slowly being manipulated by palpatine until he eventually palpatine turned him and anakin had no will to turn on his master in 45 he learns that he has a son and this almost transforms his mind to thinking that he doesnt need the emporer anymore in 6 he overcomes his fear and  kills  the emprorer thus completing his massive 6 movie arc and this sees the prophecy of the chosen one fulfilled he finally brings balance to the force now with palpatine back none of that matters another thing was the completely rushed pace of the movie there is also a lot of lazy editing and plot holes the size of a galaxy another thing is the terrible lazy writing and the use of something called a  maguffin  a maguffin is an object that solely exist to advance the plot and is something that terrible writers use when they have no other way to advance said plot in this movie the maguffin is the sith way finder which serves no other purpose than to advance the plot through the finding of these objects another huge thing that annoys me about this movie is how they tried to copy the pivotal moment in avengers endgame at the end of this movie in endgame thanos says  i am inevitable  and then iron man says  and i am iron man  and then snaps blowing away thanos and saving the day in ros palpatine says  i am all the sith  and then rey says  and i am all the jedi blowing him away and saving the day the main thing about this movie that still absolutely pisses me off is how at the end she calls herself skywalker how fucking dare you call yourself a name that you have not earned the entire movie everyone is preaching how you shouldnt be afraid of who you really are and then rey decides to hide it all behind a fake name that is respected throughout the galaxy all in all this is a complete failure as a movie and as a peice in the star wars trilogy i encourage anyone who is reading this to watch the original trilogy and revenge if the sith in the prequel trilogy if you want to know what compelling stories and plots look like in a star wars movie i would never recommend any true star wars fan watch this movie im not actually sure who likes this movie
May 25 2020,positive,my first viewing of this movie was that it was okay  the last jedi had done so much damage to the star wars franchise that no single movie could undo that mess within only a couple hours  but abrams did the best he could and found a way to make it all work  the death of carrie fisher seriously affected the development of this movie and it shows in the storyline which seems nonsensical on many levels  upon my second viewing i started seeing more of this movie start to shine  critics scoff at the socalled fan service  but theres a difference between mocking fan service and showing respect on established canon  i appreciated seeing people like wedge make this movie  ultimately this third trilogy fails to conclude the skywalker story arc because the last jedi had removed the setup from the force awakens forcing abrams to rush the trilogy conclusion into 2 hours rather than the summed 78 hours for a trilogy  but even though the third trilogy didnt elevate the franchise 2 of the 3 movies were enjoyable  but i do wish there was another movie with rey at the forefront  i feel they couldve done more with her  and please bring back more dynamic lightsaber fights  the sword action of this trilogy was so lumbering  the last act near the very end began to have that faster dynamic action that was reminiscent of the prequel trilogy
May 25 2020,negative,man they really took it seriously when we asked could they can make it any worse than the last jedi its bad its really bad first star wars ive fallen asleep while watching it
May 25 2020,negative,lost continuity with the prior movie but more fun than the last movie that is the worst of all of the series so meh
May 24 2020,positive,the main problem for the rise of skywalker and for jj abrams in the writerdirectors chair is that it has to recorrect the course that the previous film set undo as many mistakes as possible and somehow tie up everything and everyones stories from the previous eight films thats a tall order maybe an impossible one inevitably it feels messy and disconnected not leaving anywhere near enough time to cover everything and deliver a focused effort   the newest trilogy as a whole is arguably a disappointing affair that just went wrong in too many places nevertheless considering all of the above abrams has done an admirable job with the final film that shouldnt be too disappointing at least for casual fans that is to say there are a lot of epic scenes that utilise a lot of the best things about the star wars universe and just as importantly some great character development in the right direction
May 24 2020,negative,maybe if you are the new caretakers for a much loved franchise and youre adding a final trilogy you might think of planning a full coherent storyline that is respectful to everything before it and is a trilogy worthy on its own merits disappointing
May 24 2020,negative,the longawaited installment to finally end this train wreck of a trilogy and boy this does not help in the slightest quick side note i totally didnt pay to see uncut gems and then sneak in to see star wars as a protest against disney and not wanting to give them my hardearned money the marketing itself as the end of a ninepart saga with jj abrams himself stated in multiple interviews but more feel like its the merciful end to this jumbled mess of a trilogy that lost it stride as soon as the last jedi was released and immediately became controversial among the fan base and mainstream hollywood critics praising the film to no end when i first saw tlj in theaters despite the issues i had with it on the spot i had a blast but after a few days critical thinking it made less and less the flaws became more apparent and more kept popping up and the humor was not only childish but inter fears with scenes that could have added great dramatic tension now fan backlash for questionable decisions is nothing new in this franchise dating back to the holiday special the sequels and prequels but the backlash to this film and how it was handled left a fatal rift not just between critics and audiences but in the fan base itself because whenever its brought up its like bringing up politics in the middle of a holiday dinner  table with some very opinionated inlaws it almost always boils down to shouting matches namecalling animosity between each other and in the process ruin everyone elses a good time  now for the movie itself as it is every bit as disappointing as the leaks made it out to be and it feels like it was hacked together by constant reshoots reedits test screening and rushed lastminute ideas that were given no thought or time to develop naturally in the story for example its obvious to any star wars fan even if they only watch the theatrically released movies  that the emperors return makes absolutely no sense in the context of this trilogy story as his story clearly ended in 1983 with return of the jedi along with anakins redemption and the skywalker saga with the prequels love em or hate em are there just add some more lore and background to the galaxy  at large and how there was always a much bigger game at play but with this movie not one of them gives me a hint of whats going on in the galaxy at large why did the new republics stop pursuing ex imperials why werent they prepared for another potential conflict if it arises why are they so incompetent and why should i root for them defeat the first order and now the final order speaking of which i could get a grasp that they just wanna return the empire to its former glory but these villains are a far cry from the original even the droid army was more intimidating then these guys because at least they didnt fall for some dumb yo mama prank calls in fact the more i think about the film it could plot holes the movie  as just thinking  about it makes less and less sense writingwise the only good thing about is that the new main characters are finally all together going in adventures and even have a few decent and wellacted scenes together when theyre not being told to read forced marvel humor even then it was still too little too late as their dynamic should have been built upon throughout the trilogy and had nowhere near the camaraderie of han luke and leia on a technical level it is stunning to look at the vfx and practical effects are something to be appreciated and kudos to the make and prosthetics department for all the neat looking alien  designs but for a film  of this magnitude this should be an automatic given with its more than 250million budget back by the biggest film studio in hollywood and has the best artistdesigners and vfx technology in the business at the click of a button or phone  call away too bad it couldnt save the dodgy editing poor choice of shots and clumsily choreographed lightsaber duels as its ether medium closeups or extreme wide an awkward balance of either to close or too far yes im making the bold statement that these are the worst duels in the history of the franchise being an indie filmmaker watched several small budget projects and been on multiple film sets ive seen experience so much more being done with so much less all because they have an undying passion to tell the story they want to tell without having to abide by mainstream norms overall i know im gonna have quite the debate with a few friends  who for some reason loves these films and i do wish i saw this with a bigger group of people to talk to right afterward i did have a few good conversations with some strangers as i was walking out and i give star wars episode xi the rise of skywalker a 310
May 23 2020,negative,ive never wanted to walk out of a movie more badly than this one it literally goes back in time to ruin the other trilogies
May 23 2020,positive,so much better than the previous episode jj abrams was always against it having to undo the mess made by tlj he has done a good job and rectified a lot of the issues created previous the film is enjoyable and brings a fitting end to the skywalker saga and was really well done how they made use of the unused film of carrie fisher
May 23 2020,negative,worse film by far it destroy all the precuels and the originals
May 23 2020,negative,easily the worst of the three new star wars movies episode 69 the other two were just as god awful
May 23 2020,negative,whats to stop palpatine from being cloned again
May 23 2020,positive,the visuals are fantastic and the cast is amazing and it brought a fitting end to the skywalker saga
May 23 2020,negative,this movie was just a picked up of disney trying to please the fan with reference of the good old movies and an old predictable disney movie at almost every moment of the movie i could predict what was gonna appen also the logic was totaly gone i am not a big fan of the star wars trilogy but even myself was asking questions about the force and other jedi and sith things that i knew was just an shitty explantion for the movie to continue and to justify the actions
May 23 2020,negative,nope complete horse aht where to start what a mess when the 6 legged horses hit the screen i was outta there
May 22 2020,negative,it was all over the place and it made no sense a stain on the star wars saga
May 22 2020,negative,this is what happens when you do storytelling by committee and dont lay out clearly the overall story arc for the trilogy at the beginning and adhere to it there are plenty of plot holes and headshaking moments to go around from going to a planet to find a wayfinder and discovering a magical knife that will lead them to it completely by accident to being in just the right spot on another planet when they discover the knife is also a locator for said wayfinder to jumping in and out of hyperspace with reckless abandon still remember han solos advice to luke jumping through hyperspace aint like dustin crops boy it requires precise calculations to the ridiculously stupid and unexplained rescueresurrection of palpatine after return of the jedi to the forced kiss between kylo and rey to kylos miraculous recovery after being thrown over a seemingly bottomless chasm to yet another death starstarkillerplanet exploder weapon to yet another ridiculously simple flaw in said weapon and so on  i dont know how a group of adults using that term loosely here sat in a reading room for this and did not see the gaping holes in the plots and the complete disregard for suspension of disbelief which is necessary for any movie to be compelling i sat through this painfully aware that i was sitting in a theater being forced crap that made no sense and ultimately stared blankly at the screen to watch the moving pixels only because i made the commitment to finish this sad trilogy if the characters turned and stared at the camera for laughs it would not have been any less disrupting to my suspension of disbelief than the poor storytelling and flashing and noise at the end  on a positive note this is at least mildly more entertaining than the last jedi due to abrams better treatment of humor and better story pacing to be fair a lot of stuff happens during this 25 hour film but its always better when things happen for a reason and so much of this movie happens for no real reason other than to sell toys or compensate for the damage done by tlj as visually stunning as it is the movie is just a horrible example of storytelling and ultimately i walked away from this trilogy in the star wars franchise painfully aware that it is a franchise and that none of the new characters are especially likeable not even rey who rightfully earned the title of mary sue due to her inexplicable ability to master jedi skills that took luke skywalker years and much effort to developall because of her blood line rey poe and finn are all very shallow forgettable characters who emote but dont convey real struggle or desire and achieve greatness almost by entitlement poe magically maneuvers spaceships impossibly fast around targets and never misses rey goes from picking up lukes light saber to being a saber fighting master over what a few months she never changes her outfit once throughout the whole trilogy and finn he occasionally shoots and blows up a tie fighter and shouts whoa when he does and through luck manages to avoid his own death at least a few times as i said completely shallow and forgettable characters  so glad this is over like one feels after watching a loved one suffer a long illnesssad but relieved
May 22 2020,positive,much better than the last jedi  still could have been better
May 22 2020,negative,in an overly complicated and unfortunate story arch there are moments to celebrate that have the adventurous spirit of star wars however primarily the villain plot point is a mass disservice to all the previous saga episodes the conclusion of this movie dissipates the conclusion of the original trilogy and unfortunately ruins said outcome the themes visuals score etc are spot on but the actual plot is a horrid mark on the amazing sage as a whole the previous episode left us with so much promise of a bright expansive future for star wars while this depressed that notion it is convoluted and ridiculous enough to pull one away from the story while watching and question if they are watching star wars or an excessive parody
May 21 2020,negative,so disjointed and everywhere the pacing is breakneck and for good reason too because if it was a little slower youd have to time to think about how ridiculous everything thats happening is such a shame they didnt plan out the production of these movies better this was a failure of leadership and planning
May 21 2020,negative,a film that puts fan pleasing higher than quality nobody wanted chewie to get that goddamn medal 30 years later
May 21 2020,negative,complete and utter nonsense shouldnt even be considered cannon
May 21 2020,neutral,its not trash but its definitely the worst movie of the trilogy its disappointing because the first two movies were good even if they hadnt so much connection between them and this last one could do a good job and make the other ones have meaning but it just looks like a solo movie moreover even if you analyze it as a solo movie its not a good movie a star wars fan may have felt shame with this movie but i think its not a waste of time for those who watched the 2 previous movies
May 21 2020,positive,i really enjoyed the movie and how it kept you on a ride like while i was watching i thought the movie was going to go one way and went in a different but also really good moving way obviously this is just my opinion you should watch it for yourself and see what you think
May 21 2020,negative,absolute garbage the laziest cash grab fitting end to the recycled nonsense we have been subjected to again and again
May 20 2020,negative,the rise of skywalker did his best to redo the plot of the return of the jedi which gave an unoriginal boring and inconsistent with the rest of the trilogy movie  at the end of this movie we find the galaxy in the exact same state it was after episode vi and we reached this point by breaking a lot established lore along the way  how ironic that a movie about a limitless universe had to be given a plot so repetitive and predictable
May 20 2020,positive,great music by john williams
May 20 2020,negative,i barely understood the plot uninteresting jumbled and draws too much on what came before
May 20 2020,negative,i didnt like it when i saw it in theaters but had a much bigger revelation when it came out on disney and my friend and i watched it again like the prequels or the room we like watching bad movies to make fun of them but to my absolute amazement it wasnt even fun to laugh at it was so incredibly boring that i just found myself dosing off with nothing to say the only fun we had was yelling rey every time finn did the whole thing is just so empty i remember watching tlj and hating the part where luke drinks the milk i remember just like ew gross but now im like at least that scene makes me feel something tros makes me feel nothing its such an empty shell of a movie that i might as well be a toddler staring at a spinning mobile and some flashing lights  and why does everyone keep blaming jj but never bring up chris terrio why did anyone think that bringing the writer of batman v superman and justice league would somehow be a good idea
May 20 2020,negative,what a sour way to end the sequel trilogy from the start of this film it should be glaringly obvious to the viewer that there was no conversation as to how the sequels should be laid out before they were made each installation was the respective creatives winging it with minimal effort to even reference the story that had come before it the rise of skywalker is the peak of this trend as the film itself seems to be a desperate search for some kind of conclusive end to the sequel trilogy and star wars as a whole but given how lack luster ham fisted and tone deaf this grand finale was from start to end for me at least the saga ends on endor
May 20 2020,negative,a rushed thoughtless end to what was the most disappointing trilogy in star wars history riddled with plot holes untied story arcs and ridiculous mcguffins it did one great thing united those who loved the prequels with those who didnt in confirming which trilogy was the worst
May 20 2020,neutral,the film fine it was beautifully made and the actors did a pretty good job but the story never drew me in and it was quite confusing especially after watching the last jedi i enjoyed it but would not want to watch it again
May 20 2020,negative,the movie was actual trash   i hate all the new star wars movies that disney makes  rough one and solo were good movies but holly crap the sequels are disgusting
May 20 2020,negative,they couldnt defeat palpatine on the previous movies because they only used one lightsaber the trick was using two
May 20 2020,negative,despite the good acting the writing was the opposite not only did they reverse all the feats of the original trilogy characters but it also proved useless and nonsensical to the rest of the subpar sequel trilogy the editing of the movie gave it a ridiculously fast pace the entire movie attempts to catch up for lost time from tlj a lot of time is spent reversing a lot of the strange decisions made in tlj too which could have been a refreshing change for the sequel trilogy but the change was pulled off so lazily the reinsertion of palpatine was just a bad decision on the writing teams part it makes little to no sense in the presequel canon overall the sequel trilogy proves to be completely detached from the rest of the skywalker story line and this final nail in the coffin just solidified my disdain for the trilogy music is great and the saber duel is pretty good many plot holes too
May 20 2020,negative,what a waste all the potential to take the story and finish it in a meaningful way was destroyed by apathetic writing bizarre narrative choices that flew over the head of most movie watchers and annoyed diehard lore fans and the inability to create anything of substance or joy
May 20 2020,negative,the audience score of 86 is not accurate for how many people have rated this movie terribly its also been at 86 for months now with no change despite thousands of new reviews coming in rt locked their score for some reason this movie is terrible and disney should be ashamed of the sequel trilogy as a whole
May 20 2020,negative,an insult to the fans
May 20 2020,negative,not only is this movie objectively bad but it actively undermines the story told by the original trilogy 
May 20 2020,positive,the amazing and epic finale of the skywalker star wars saga disney put together a great film that pleases fans of star wars and the general public alike while not as critically or deep like the last jedi or the empire strikes back the rise of skywalker truly captured the star wars spirit and you can tell by how much of a fan jj abrams is for the star wars universe daisy ridleys journey as rey finally gets the well deserved ending she struggled for throughout the films adam drivers performance as kylo ren again was one of the best on screen and without any words can sell his characters performance c3po having a larger role was great too and the new alien characters were fantastic landos return was amazing mark hamill killed it as a force ghost and the use of carrie fisher was bittersweet as the final chance we will see princess leia again john boyega as finn is a bit underdeveloped but still glad to see the ending is as epic and reminiscent of the celebration at the end of the return of the jedi reys final scene was truly earned and i am so glad of her new name that she worked so hard for
May 20 2020,negative,well im finally writing a review because i didnt care to see rise of skywalker in theaters anything that followed the storyline of the last jedi was going to be garbage anyway but aside from that ros suffers from lack of continuity to the previous trilogies like tlj there are so many things that happen in ros where its like well why didnt this character do that move in episode whatever to avoid this problem or defeat that enemy and there are way too many coincidences as well getting into specifics would just take too long here im not saying the original trilogy doesnt have flaws and the prequel trilogy is loaded with cringey moments but can largely be fixed with good editing but at least the pt maintained decent continuity and honored the ot the entire sequel trilogy was a jumbled up mess of rehashes breaking continuity and disgracing the original characters that made star wars so popular in the first place and bringing the emperor back to life thats just bad desperate writing the one good thing about ros is finally seeing some interaction between rey finn and poe all together but its far too late for it to mean anything now that really should have begun in the force awakens tfa started off okay despite doing the a new hope storyline ripoff but as soon as they broke continuity by having rey go from nothing to a super force goddess in the space of a couple days in tfa i knew the st was in serious trouble and then tlj was far worse than anything i could have imagined ros wasnt as bad as tlj but it was pathetic and sad to watch nothing against the actors or production crew but the writing of the entire st is garbage i guess they were in a rush to try and make money fast rather than give more polishing to preproduction to create something truly great make tons more money off of it and have fans be excited for more now star wars is nothing to get excited about well the new star wars anyway its the biggest cinematic failure in history but the old star wars is still wonderful after 40 years but disney is so rich they probably dont care
May 20 2020,negative,the rise of skywalker was a mindless cash grab going against not only the last jedi but against the whole of the saga previously multiple continuity and lore errors a nonsensical plot and an ending that did not spark any genuine emotion just a representation of the lifeless corpse that is the sequel trilogy
May 19 2020,positive,five star excellent   a film which should unite the fans base after the last film split it in two  a fast paced film which brings a touching sense of nostalgia  to the true  star wars fans  the best film in the trilogy for sure
May 19 2020,negative,i finally bit the bullet and watched it on disney it was so much worse than i feared and my expectations were already low quite possibly this is the most creatively barren film ever to appear on movie screens in wide release it is one thing to play it safe with the most expensive film franchise acquisition in the history of cinema but it is quite another to wilfully reduce it to a theme park ride without even attempting to fool the audience into believing that they are actually witnessing a story unfolding on a screen
May 19 2020,negative,another embarrassment the last jedi was worse but my hopes for the trilogy to be redeemed by this movie was crushed terrible movie
May 19 2020,negative,i couldnt keep up watching it was like sitting in a 3 hour classroom of flat earth heart breaking
May 19 2020,negative,too interested in appeasing the worst critics of the last jedi  not at all interested in good storytelling
May 19 2020,negative,really missed the mark for what it couldve been so many missed opportunities for them to wrap up the saga in a satisfying manner and leave minimal plot points without conclusions
May 19 2020,positive,one of the best starwars movies i really enjoyed it
May 19 2020,negative,didnt represent the jedi order didnt represent luke sky walker the way he should have been the whole 3 movies were a disaster force awakens was good left off well then the last jedi and it went straight to the bottom very disappointed
May 19 2020,neutral,wow frankly i dont know what to say when i went to the cinema to see the rise of skywalker on december 21st i was excited i had appreciated the first two films of the sequel trilogy and i expected not to be disappointed but i already had doubts about how they would made to bring palpatine back into the saga after he had died by falling into the death star reactor which had subsequently exploded this to emphasize that he had died disintegrated the film begins with the phrase the dead speak and this statement combined with the phrase that says palpatine the dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural is the only explanation for the return of the emperor this is the first plot hole but its a huge plot hole in the first 6 minutes the film has already shown us three settings united by an insufficient montage but made with the help of excellent visual effects the film goes too fast 2h 20m of which 8 minutes of credits are not enough for the skywalker saga finale going forward we discover that leia is training rey in the meantime the resistance has the confirmation that palpatine has returned now i have a question why did palpatine announce his return wouldnt a surprise attack with his new fleet have been smarter previously kylo had joined palpatine who had proposed to give him his fleet in exchange for reys death another question arises why does kylo accept the first order already has a very powerful fleet in that situation he could not have accepted and killed palpatine after various events rey finn poe chewbacca and c3po reach pasaana here we are introduced to a new jedi power the ability to heal wounds through the force this is another plot hole where rey learned to use this power we dont know at this point the editing of the film finally becomes acceptable in the previous chase scene on pasaana he had hit rock bottom at this point the movie cannot make a choice chewbacca dies but it turns out that he is not dead zorii a new character first wants to kill poe and five minutes later asks him to run away with her and when he refuses she gives him the most important thing that has a pass for the first order landing areas finally the c3po memory is erased but then r2d2 reinstalls it at this point rey meets kylo ren who tells her that she is palpatines grandson this is fan service the writers took a random fan theory and chose it rey was made palpatines grandson to destroy the work of rian johnson who had made her the daughter of anyone important a choice that i had appreciated speaking of destroying rian johnsons work do you know why palpatine returned because snoke died and therefore kylo ren could not be made the main villain among other things at the beginning of the film we discover that palpatine created snoke as he did is not explained to us at this point the film improves there is a good duel between kylo and rey a father and son scene between han solo and kylo and the longawaited final battle however before we get to the final confrontation we have a scene between rey and luke in which luke reveals to rey that he and leia had always known that she was a palpatine why didnt they tell her before afterwards we fight on exegol here we have to thank john williams and his always wonderful soundtracks and visual effects as they make the ending more epic than it really is at this point we find out that palpatine had no precise plan first he told kylo to kill rey then when rey comes to him palpatine changes his mind and asks rey to kill him in order to become the new sith empress finally when rey refuses and ben comes to help her palpatine discovers that he can absorb the vital energy from the two and uses it to come back to life and attack the resistance fleet with lightning since when can it be done in the end rey manages to kill palpatine with the help of all the other jedi and i appreciate this the film then ends on tatooine where rey buries the swords of luke and leia and assumes the surname of skywalker to many this thing has bothered me not or at least not particularly in the final however in addition to the force ghosts of luke and leia i would have liked to have seen those of anakin and ben too the truth is that in this film palpatine should never have come back not only because he was dead but also because he would have canceled the sacrifice of anakin in this film the main villain should have been kylo ren
May 19 2020,positive,it was pretty good very rushed it was hard to follow along because of all the questions and more the previous 2 had created and was kind of fan service still it was better than the last jedi but i think anything is really better than the last jedi i dont think it quite lived up to be the epic finale it was made up to be the visuals were good and there were some good parts but either than that pretty okay
May 19 2020,negative,trashy from start to finish terrible choices that undo any good that was set up before like beating a dead horse way too busy and really just uninspired fanservice
May 19 2020,positive,its good  id recommended it
May 19 2020,negative,who thought it was a good idea to bring palpatine back
May 19 2020,negative,this is not star wars this is corporate disney trying to make profit and turn a beloved legacy into mcu merchandise this movie is the worst and erases everything that star wars lore was
May 19 2020,negative,spoilers at first i did like this movie however the more i think about it the more disappointed i am this is kind of an entertaining film its a bit rushed but that doesnt bother me too much the problem here is the writing everything that has been done in the first 6 movies is erased palpatines return makes anakinvaders redemption arc pointless also luke skywalkers efforts to put an end to the empire is now pointless just so some new disney character can get some credit which pushes me to dislike rey more and more force healing rey and ben use force healing in some rather major ways which removes any sense of danger from star wars and also pokes quite a few holes in 16 why didnt obi wan use healing to save his master why didnt anakin use healing to save padme why didnt luke use healing to save vader the list goes on now apart from the major plot holes created lets talk about characters same as the last jedi finn is now useless and serves no purpose to the story hes just there to scream rrreeeeeyyyyy poe does get some development here but his character is still somewhat forgettable rey is still dull and boring unnecessarily powerful and not relatable however kylo renben is actually cool in this movie and is now as powerful as he should have been in the first place apart from that force pulling ship and healing that was dumb this movie does do a little for luke leia han and lando the only reason i would somewhat like this movie is kyloben and everything else is just bad
May 19 2020,negative,absoulute trash at every cross road they came across when it came to resolving plotlines they decided to avoid the road at all and throw themselves of a cliff the whole movie not only goes lightspeed plotwise but i could swear at dome points it felt like they literally sped it up the whole thing could have been less awful if at least they did the ending right instead of having a 2 second bossfight and an incestuos kissing scene between characters that no one wanted together
May 18 2020,positive,i am a lifelong star wars fan with the struggle between the force awakens and last jedi this movie ended up being meh palpatine returning was a high note but he never reached his potential certain points in the movie had us cheering and yelling no but they were few and far between seeing billy dee williams come back was a delight albeit brief kylo rens arc had its best moments at the end making us wish for more reys arc fell flat allinall they could have done better clone wars and the mandalorian gave us much better endings
May 18 2020,negative,what a piece of garbage this was somehow worse than last jedi
May 18 2020,positive,certainly the best of the three not great not terrible its more fan focused this time which is fair give the people what they want its rushed very rushed i cant get everything there was nothing that made me really angry here at least but its nowhere near the original trilogy or even the other starwars media such as the clone wars tv show ect music is fantastic as always  its meh
May 18 2020,positive,its a good state wars movie its definitely unlike anything we come to expect  i recommend watching it with an unbiased broad view towards disney star wars instead of comparing kit to previous installments
May 18 2020,negative,a quite unsatisfying end to a giant inconsistent mess of a trilogy
May 18 2020,positive,considering the crap of tlj and the vacuous a new hope copy that was tfa  i kind of loved it ridiculous stuff at the end though and ridiculous closer
May 18 2020,negative,rise of skywalker ruins previously established star wars canon the idea of force healing ruins the whole plot of the prequels bringing palpatine back was a weak idea and it yet again proves that jj abrams cant come up with an original idea
May 18 2020,negative,disney ruined this franchise they used bringing back the emperor as another way to get fans in the theater and grab cash quick jj just read the star wars legend books and threw it in the rise of skywalker
May 17 2020,negative,it was ok when watching it in theaters but when rewatching it i realized its pretty boring and the plot sucks  a lot  also they brought back palpatine ruining the 1000yearold prophecy of the chosen one
May 17 2020,negative,the somewhat entertaining tragedy of poor writing and bad choices
May 17 2020,negative,that was the biggest puddle of dog diarrhea ive ever seen i could eat a bowl of alphabet soup and crap out a better story than that garbage
May 17 2020,negative,horrible horrible horrible movie and especially acting
May 17 2020,negative,what a mess all the potential three movies and only one thats coherent this one is better than the second in this trilogy but thats faint praise just more ridiculous things slapped together and no sympathetic characters so no earned emotions i felt much more emotion watching lego batman than through this entire trilogy 
May 17 2020,negative,nice story elements but there was absolutely zero flow to the film everytime i got interested in the plot there was an abrupt scene change  this like the movie was directed by a squirrel
May 17 2020,negative,movie is entertaining but its a lot of bullshit made up on the spot acting like it was planned from the start but really wasnt a lot of people give this movie a pass because it was trying to fix the last jedi and a lot of people actually like this movie because it fixed the last jedi andor ripped on it but i think this movie and this trilogy couldve been great if they didnt try to please everyone had a plan from the start and actually owned up to what they made instead of making a movie to fix the last jedi and in the process rip on it at the same time best way to describe this movie is a dumpster fire whenever i think of this movie and the sequels as a whole i just get disappointed and sad
May 17 2020,negative,rubbish  yet still better than the last two
May 17 2020,negative,more plot holes than ships that magically appear at the end of the movie   absolutely garbage fan service from start to finish giva meesa jar jar over this
May 17 2020,positive,the movie has some plot holes however the emotional impact and the overall entertainment value makes your forget about it as you watch its an epic adventure and conclusion to the skywalker saga i will miss these characters greatly
May 16 2020,negative,this movie sucked first of all the diologue was terrible it made it sound like a mix between a disney show like austin and ally and an snl comedy special disney is trying to remake the hype the original trilogy got by remaking han solo as poe damon and kilo ren as darth vader and rey as luke  in addition the most famous droids in the galaxy both r2 and c3po had little to no showtime and hardly a place to add to this they remade the feud darth maul and obi wan had as the feud luke and kilo had in addition they add in all these stupid little character that have no real importance to the story line rose finn in conclusion this show sucked
May 16 2020,negative,a poorly paced movie of story vomit that i am just hoping will become legends so i can forget that it ever happened
May 16 2020,negative,the saga ended with return of the jedi
May 16 2020,negative,the lack of character development plotholes plotarmor and the luck of the main cast in every situation is just amazing the good thing is i wont look forward to new star wars content what an utter disapointment
May 16 2020,negative,i cant believe how bad the jj abrams star wars movies have been  thank god they are over
May 16 2020,negative,yes the film is visually appealing but the enjoyment stops there  as a 90s kid i was brought up on the ot and experienced the pt in my youth both were fantastic  the story arcs were well thought out and the character development was shown really well in lucass star wars  this film however just feels cheap and comes across as a last ditch effort to finalize and make sense of the disney trilogy  bringing palpatine back  his return to the franchise makes darth vaders sacrifice completely worthless it undermines the entire arc of anakin skywalker being the chosen one and bringing balance to the force  more force powers  disney forgets that when they introduce something new that it affects everything past and present some of the main issues found in the ot and pt could have been easily rectified using these force abilities that theyve just made up disney had potential with the sequels however after the huge mishandling of the tlj which split the fan base the tros plays it safe with a bland quest like story and uninspiring ending to franchise  for gods sake please leave kotor and the old republic alone
May 15 2020,negative,disneys commercialism ruined the end of the masterpiece series
May 15 2020,positive,so much better than the last jedi feels like a true sequel to the force awakens
May 15 2020,negative,rise of skywalker serves up heavy doses of fan service which ultimately fall flat because they lack the emotional resonance of the films they reference the film jumps quickly from one jawdropping visual to the next hoping the audience wont notice it is taking moments it has not earnednot logically not emotionally   to cite just a couple of many possible examples reys overcome of the villain it didnt require a heros journey to overcome a flaw just a second lightsaber finn poe and rey embracing at the end we must believe there is an intense bond there because there was witty banter in the first act and hey they look like they might be crying  in the end rise of skywalker is cotton candya powerful sensory stimulation but not filling
May 15 2020,positive,great film made up for the last one and saves the trilogy
May 15 2020,negative,awful a poor end to a struggling trilogy
May 15 2020,negative,ugh that nearly sums up my reaction to this film the only reason it gets a full star is because the 8th was worse that is this movies only saving grace i know that a lot of the bad story character development and premises can be tracked back to the previous shit show but that doesnt mean this movie didnt suck it was a chore to watch i literally just wanted to keep skipping ahead because i didnt care what was happening it is not an engaging or entertaining movie i wont rewatch even a minute of it on youtube or while sitting down to marathon star wars it is that bad save your money andor time and rewatch the good star wars moviesugh
May 15 2020,negative,spoiler alert   at the end of the movie when rei kills palpatine jar jar binks should have come from the shadows behind the throne yousa thought he was da sif lord but noo ita was meesa and proceed to butcher rei  kylo instead of getting out of the hole slinks back down after seeing the horrific sight  rebels lose set up for next movie w jar jar binks as main villian  ende
May 15 2020,neutral,its flashy and fun to watch but by the end its too convoluted with plot holes too many things are vaguely unexplained or not at all so many things feel un earned due to lazy writing
May 14 2020,positive,i was pleasantly surprised at how well the rise of skywalker handled leah and her part in the saga despite carrie fisher  passing away over a year before principal photography began on the movie  i am glad they built scenes around footage they had previously filmed of her in character and were able to complete her story that way  the movie did seem to jump and fly at times too quickly and in a seemingly random way but after having seen it twice the movie did a very good job of tying up lose ends and carrying the observer through the entire saga to its conclusion    i did not like the last jedi at first but after going back and watching it probably about 3 times my attitude has changed and i do like it   i love the way luke shows up towards the end to stand up even if he was a type of telepathic holographic form against the 1st order and allow the rebel alliance to escape certain destruction at the hands of the empire  i loved the way yoda showed up and worked  luke through the problems he had with handling the force and how his fears were probably the one thing most effective in holding him back from his potential   the conflict and yet connection between kylo and rey was very interesting and i knew it would play a big part in the rise of skywalker as it did  this is also what luke had to convey to rey as he appeared to her in rise of skywalker that she had to turn lose of her fears  she had to realize that she was not alone  every jedi that ever lived was alive in her now  she had much more power and capability than she ever imagined  she was up to the challenge  if you like star wars as i do   if you liked all of the first three and at least tolerated the prequil trilogy of phantom menace attack of the clones and revenge of the syth  and if you had any appreciation at all for the force awakens and the last jedi i believe you will appreciate this film   it is not perfect but it does a great job of wrapping things up  one of my favorite things about this film is that they made a part for one of the greatest musical composer conductors and score writers in history john williams in the movie  there is a little shot of john williams as a repair tech working on a set that included an artifact drawn from every film he has scored and that has been nominated for an academy award  this included jaws star wars schindlers list home alone the patriot fiddler on the roof memoirs of a geisha indiana jones and the last crusade saving private ryan   it was a real treat to see him in the movie now as an actor even though the above referenced music covers a period of over 60 years and his age is over 90 years old  this movie gets two thumbs up from me  i enjoyed it and would recommend it to any star wars fan
May 14 2020,neutral,1st it must be said it was impossible to delivery a quality ending after tlj as expected ros failed to close out the skywalker trilogy in an enjoyable way after a promising start with tfa this movie had potential but ultimately found itself catch inbetween trying to walk back some of the more questionable decisions from episode 8 while at the same time advancing the current story that level of ambition was far too much for a 25hr film in the end it didnt do enough to retcon episode 8 and didnt leave enough screen time to tell a competent story which was the worst case scenario
May 14 2020,neutral,the whole movie feels like its riding off of past movie themes instead of creating something new when it does attempt to create something new it dumps the information into the movie without any past explanation of evidence of it existing before this movie even with that in mind the movie still has amazing action sequences and effects that fill the movie with eye pleasing scenes
May 14 2020,negative,watched it 3 times hoping that somehow somewhere i would find some redeeming quality in this moviebut it doesnt exist  this movie is terrible but i guess it is a fitting end to the dumpster fire that was the trilogy headed by kathleen kennedy rian johnson and jj abrams  for that reason alone i give it a half star  otherwise it deserves no star
May 14 2020,positive,decent movie considering it had to wipe out all the sht of the last jedi
May 14 2020,negative,a visual and narrative trainwreck this film was the featurelength cinematic equivalent of losing my religion
May 13 2020,negative,this movie ruins star wars luckily i can look past this trilogy and watch the original 6 films in peace however this film implements trash writing and garbage storytelling to convey what seems like a 16 year olds fan fiction brought to life with millions of disney dollars palpatines return after ep 6 fundamentally destroys nearly 30 years of star wars character development and story to enjoy this movie is a sin  my rating bad
May 13 2020,negative,the overall result is nothing but pure fan service crap
May 13 2020,negative,jj abrams returns to conclude the entire skywalker saga and it went not good first lets get the positives away star wars episode 9 the rise of skywalker looks really beautiful the vfxs are amazing and the score the score is also amazing but what would you expect with john williams and then nothing else makes sense sure there is some good moments thrown in here and there but there are not many of them  and dont make me start on palpatine
May 12 2020,negative,rian gave jj nothing to work with so this was all retcon to try to bring back the fans johnson alienated  didnt work
May 12 2020,positive,dont care what others say i frickin love this movie
May 12 2020,negative,anti climax to the new trilogy with many unanswered questions on the story and characters tried watching again last week and found myself watching you tube videos halfway through just not worth watching full stop
May 12 2020,negative,wow this was bad it wasnt even so bad its funny it was just boring
May 12 2020,negative,the worst star wars film doesnt even feel like a franchise movie
May 12 2020,negative,if you are looking for a movie with little substance or weight cheap fanservice moments and dialogue overflowing with exposition then youll likely love the rise of skywalker  the ros blatantly retcons and undermines the message of the last jedi instead of continuing the narrative set before it the movie spends most of its time attempting to make a group of angry fans who would rather relive old moments happy than explore the endless possibilities of star wars stories  while visually stunning with moments that are fun and enjoyable the movie is mostly forgettable the facepaced nature of the movie has you jumping from one place to the next while using expositional narrative to carry its story  the character arcs also created by the force awakens and the last jedi are almost completely undone for example finn no longer cares about the rebellion but his concern is again only on rey and the possibilities of his story as an exstormtrooper are wasted similar things can be said for rey and po and characters of significant importance like rose are sidelined for the sake of appeasing fans  this movie had the potential to be a movie that could have been a groundbreaking conclusion to the skywalker saga instead jj abrams plays it safe and misses the opportunity ultimately that is why this film will fade from memory and will be overlooked by many in the future
May 12 2020,negative,thank you for ruining the star wars trilogy
May 11 2020,negative,from a technical point of view its an amazing action packed movie with intense sounds to great visuals thats all thats going for it  really its a difficult and messy story that doesnt explain much and concludes on probably the most dreary of notes thus resolving  well  not a whole lot there are more questions than answers making this probably the most disappointing of this new trilogy
May 11 2020,negative,they tried so hard to make it good and yet it doesnt show it was predictible and ridiculous at some parts the only thing i cant define yet is if this was worst than the last jedi
May 11 2020,negative,horrific plot   zero work was done on creating any meaningful character development by the end of the movie there was no reason to be attached to the characters and so the producers seemed to choose instead to amp up the xtreme xcitement to eleven by making more ships with bigger guns and bigger lightning and bigger lasers than ever before rather than by creating any sort of character we cared about  additionally the plot was painfully contrived deeply inconsistent and woefully pointless  this movie is loud and meaningless  shame on you kennedy you somehow made a worse piece of garbage than either of the two preceding dumpster fires
May 11 2020,negative,86  uf people did you watch the same movie that i watched crap crap crap
May 11 2020,negative,ill first say to abrams credit the prelude reveal in the title scroll illustrates exactly what youre in for lighting the exit sign for every fan and casual movie goer  incoherent action sequences and blaring fan service are the least of this movies  problems with rampant ex machina being some of its most egregious  it simply doesnt bother to tell a story it is supplemented content to tie up pesky plots and subplots patch together diverging narratives and retrofit a dramatic conclusion i wont start in on the unsolicited macguffins that serve as plot linchpins   the rise of skywalker is a masterclass in unnatural dialogue poorly developed characters shameless plot devices and flawed structure every film and screenwriting student has something to learn here and for that reason and that reason alone this movie justifies its existence
May 10 2020,positive,was a movie of contradiction was not a great ending to the saga the movie felt rushed the ending to the movie was okay i wish chewy or c3po actually died instead of magically surviving also they shouldnt have made the tie fighters into triangles that made no sense also the jokes werent that good also did the jj abrams lose his memory and forget what finn was going to tell rey in the end it just didnt up making a good movie
May 10 2020,negative,i went into it hearing all the bad reviewsand i think the worst part isi will probably forget most of this movie in the next day or two  i remember the prequels because there was something to remember butthis one nothing at all it wassorely lacking in many ways the end is unsatisfying the deaths in the moviethe emotional payouts arent there its justa movie that seems to me to be there for the name only  now the actors did good wont deny that but a good actor can only do so much with a script there were things that were left hanging andgiven my general overall detachment from this part of the star wars sagai wont be buying supplemental materials becausei dont care enough after watching all three movies and the ending to this one to actually find out the answers to my questions
May 10 2020,negative,rian johnson has made some great films but the last jedi sure isnt one of them in an attempt to fix what rian started abrams made some quick decisions and some strange and out of place plot choices to try and fix the problem it didnt quite work it wasnt his fault entirely i blame disney and rian for a wasted finale to the beloved franchise disney should have left abrams to continue his world building and stayed with the director that was so successful at the force awakens rian johnson just wasnt the right director for the job with the outlandish choices he made in the last jedi and as unfortunate as it is abramss rebound from that didnt work
May 10 2020,positive,i hate tlj with a passion glad jj was able to fix the mess rian left behind
May 10 2020,positive,the sequel trilogy will go down as a prime example of the importance of building a road map when you plan on having multiple movies tell a single story  its painfully obvious that they did not have one which makes for a somewhat frustrating finale  still the rise of skywalker manages to deliver an enjoyable actionpacked adventure that gives closure to this rollercoaster of a trilogy
May 10 2020,neutral,there was so much crammed into this that an unrelenting series of increasingly incredible coincidences were necessary to link things together and make the plot work never a good sign everyone just happens to find everything they need instantly exactly the right people randomly appear for no apparent reason at exactly the right time etc it actually had me laughing at how silly it all was the action sequences were mostly fast and cartoonish in that there was so much destruction but few of the good guys even got hurt whereas for the bad guys it was unrelenting carnage stormtroopers and first order ships were just there to get shot and blown up without ever accomplishing anything or even being a credible threat the emperors force lightning apparently now so amazing powerful that it can selectively target and cripple hundreds of goodguy ships scattered among the badguy ships once turned off had no lasting effect it doesnt even fry their electronics they just got shook up a bit despite some ships shown as being on fire they all magically get better again as soon as his attack stops like i said cartoonish it was so silly consequently its hard to care about any of the characters more like a computer game set to easy mode than a movie
May 10 2020,positive,very satisfying completion of an amazing journey
May 10 2020,negative,no story or plot whatsoever and makes a mockery of the franchise while undoing the former characters successes with lazy cheap writing thrown in
May 10 2020,negative,this is what happens when a z move has money behind it    plenty of explosion but the worst dialogue ive ever heard
May 10 2020,positive,a strange movie throughout which brought an unemotional mildly satisfying end to the disney trilogy considering the horrendous setbacks of episode 8 this movie was a decent attempt to cleanup the plot and wrap up the trilogy on the part of jj abrams it had many setbacks and many good visuals but somehow failed to evoke any emotion either positive or negative despite it being the current end to the star wars saga
May 10 2020,neutral,visually stunning and not as dreadful as the last jedi the rise of skywalker is still disappointing in both writing and acting  innumerable flaws in continuity and plausibility along with very uneven dialogue left me lukewarm at best
May 10 2020,negative,omg that was a big pieace of shit all the decisions of the characters were so annoying and stupid they have huge budget to make a fucking great movie but what they decide to do a piece of shit whit good efects
May 10 2020,negative,the short version  this film tried desperately to be what avengers endgame was and it failed miserably lacking the consequences heart and mystery that builds every star wars movie
May 10 2020,negative,a force awakens was a fun roller coaster that brought back a lot of what i loved about star wars the last jedi then pushed the story forward in an interesting way and showed that anyone anywhere could be special without having to be born into it unfortunately the rise of skywalker then backed down or reversed a lot of the interesting decisions rian johnson made and gives us a lot of fan service in the hopes of racking in lots and lots of money it made a billion worldwide so i guess it succeeded i disagree with a lot of the creative decisions in this movie including bringing back a clone of the emperor who died in return of the jedi  jj abrahms is great at reboots but fails to push things forward or give us something new which is why people had loved star wars and empire to begin with
May 10 2020,positive,best movie in the skywalker saga reykylo palpatine unbelievable incredible performances from daisy ridley adam driver and ian mcdermid ps beautiful use of leia in this movie and luke too go watch the rise of skywalker
May 9 2020,neutral,this movie is unexciting but the comedic sense to it saves this movie
May 9 2020,neutral,whilst several parts of the film appear to go out of their way to destroy the original star wars characters the second half acknowledges the existence of a better trilogy and offers a sufficient conclusion with better music
May 9 2020,negative,visually stunning as all modern stars wars movies are thanks disney but there are far too many plot holes to ignore in this failed attempt of a movie
May 9 2020,positive,an absolutely beautiful conclusion to the saga wow 
May 9 2020,positive,was disappointed in tlj but was pleasantly surprised by this film 
May 9 2020,negative,star warsthe rise of skywalker is the most convoluted star wars film that failed to end as a conclusive chapter to the skywalker saga
May 8 2020,negative,somehow its even worse than when i saw it at the movie theater somehow they introduced like 50 new powers palpating turned into the god of thunder and the skywalkers took plapatines side over their own kid makes no sense
May 8 2020,negative,a confusing nonsensical attempt to conclude a trilogy that was uninspired from the start its hard to even know where to begin the pacing was insanely quick to the point where they needed to speak exposition to progress the narrative all of the remaining previous accomplishments achieved by the pt and ot characters are undone mostly courtesy of revisionist history macguffin after macguffin this movie is driven forward by the quest for random artifacts that feel bizarre in the star wars universe characters arcs arent fleshed out in fact they reduce the characters back to their basic form except the mary sue who somehow becomes even more powerful than she was in the previous films  i question how this film made it past the writers room because of how incoherent it is but given the previous 2 films in the trilogy it seems to be consistent in quality garbage
May 8 2020,positive,the bestpaced installment of the skywalker saga is weighed down by unambitious and lackluster storytelling the most creative twists come when a character appears dead but in true disney fashion is still alive
May 8 2020,negative,from insane coincidences to the flagrant recycling of plot points  characters this cash grab nearly got me kicked out of an alamo theater for laughing too hard  amazing special effects great camera work mediocre acting all around and writing worse than an ed edd  eddy episode if you never knew what star wars was and watched it on mute you could enjoy it
May 8 2020,positive,a great way to end this 40year saga may the force be with you  always
May 8 2020,positive,rise of the skywalker has quite a few issues but it also has a lot of good things about it to see all of the characters fleshed out and finished with their story is heartwarming it really encaptures the feel of the old star wars movies with some satisfying character arcs one thing the movie does is abandon all of the stories that have been layed out by the previous two movies to go off in a different direction and there are a few continuity errors the first 3040 minutes gave me whiplash but i do really recommend to see the skywalker saga come to a close
May 8 2020,negative,didnt hit the nostalgia button everyone talks about saw familiar characters oh boy went no where just like the plot of almost any character redo of previous movies no explanations of anything that came about ex palapatine how rey skywalker no random massive fleet ok why did liea die so suddenly i could go on and on in short the visuals were awesome the story and character development were beyond sub par decent movie if youre not a fan of star wars horrible if you are find a new director
May 8 2020,negative,there is a bunch of sloppy mistakes like continuity errors and weird edits that individually would not be worth commenting in a comedy but they are so numerous it not only ruins the movie but the whole saga if you consider this part of star wars  like a date with a boring supermodel you get excited and it sounds like a good idea at first
May 8 2020,positive,my absolute favorite star wars movie now i cant stop watching it over and over what a satisfying way to end a series
May 8 2020,negative,terrible practically a fan fiction written by an 8 year old
May 8 2020,negative,it was the worst possible way to end this saga
May 8 2020,negative,krustytheklownsmokinggif  what the hell was that
May 7 2020,positive,this is an amazing conclusion to the skywalker saga
May 7 2020,positive,for almost the first two hours the show was very boring the ending did breath some life into the film but
May 7 2020,negative,very shit very very shit
May 7 2020,neutral,the first half wasnt bad at all the second half is a train wreck and a wildly unfit conclusion for now to the star wars saga this is poor writing and directing at its finest
May 7 2020,positive,loved it just need some better writing for poe
May 7 2020,negative,i loved both the force awakens and the last jedi contentious i know and had been really looking forward to the conclusion of this trilogy the first two films seemed to have managed the transition from beloved legacy characters from the original saga and the new cast  this final movie seemed well set up to focus on rey finn poe kylo ren etc and take the story in a completely new direction   for whatever reason from what i have read it was a reaction to criticism directed from fans towards the last jedi most of the ideas and themes set up in the last jedi are jettisoned in the rise of skywalker and instead of a progression this film regresses and gives us a star wars by numbers movie rehashing old themes and forcing in old characters who do not really advance the plot and would probably have been better placed in one of the previous instalments lando or not at all palpatine whilst the force awakens did basically follow the same structure as the original star wars films it managed to feel fresh  the inclusion of beloved characters worked as their connection to new characters was well constructed they advanced the plot gave the film a huge amount emotional centre and we had the promise of where the exciting new characters would take us   for me the rise of skywalker was completely inconsistent with the previous two films did not conclude the story arcs of any of the new characters to anything like a satisfactory conclusion and rendered the conflict between rey and kylo that had been well developed across two previous films a limp side note rather placing it centre stage where for me it should have been the reintroduction of palpatine was a huge disappointment made little sense and again for me ruined this film as well as tainting the conclusion of the original trilogy in return of the jedi   concluding a series as big as this is clearly no easy task and this film seems to have suffered hugely as the filmmakers lost their nerve backtracked on the groundwork set up in the previous instalment and instead produced a star wars by numbers film that left me cold
May 7 2020,positive,i am a huge star wars fan  i know this did not keep in full line with the trilogy but dont care i absolutely enjoyed this movie  full star wars through and through much better acting than the prequils of course what isnt  alf was better than those  5 stars well deserved
May 7 2020,positive,with the bad taste of the last jedi still lingering it took a little bit to get in to it but jj adams did a great job fixing the mistakes and made the movie enjoyable and restored star wars for me   seems like critics have no clue what people like
May 7 2020,negative,took a franchise that had already ended well opened it back up and added more unnecessary content
May 6 2020,positive,expertly crafted finale to the original star wars story lacking the fun and charisma of the early installments to does a decent job of wrapping thing up
May 6 2020,negative,horrible disappointment to allow abrams to direct this saga  i am really surprised that they didnt create a 3rd death star to blow up and instead opted to resurrect palpatine out of the blue instead   if ending a meal with the worst possible dessert in the world to leave the taste of lifelong disappointment in your mouth is how you want to remember the evening plug your nose and grab a spoon to gag on  my only hope is that someone some day who can tell a legitimate and coherent story will revisit the last couple of installments to do stat wars justice
May 6 2020,negative,honestly i felt bad for jj  he was effectively written into a corner by the last jedi  when the main bad guy is killed off prior to the final act it kind of makes it hard to worry about the good guys especially when the main good guy or girl doesnt seem to have any possible chance of losing anyway  it felt like mediocre fan fiction  while i appreciate the effort to try and fix what happened in the prior film it was too much shoved into a single film  maybe if jj had two more films he might have been able to make it work but even then i doubt it
May 6 2020,negative,film looks good and has some decent if predicatable set pieces talented people worked on these epics however it also has plot holes you can drive a star destroyer through and so many unanswered questions most importantly i just dont care about what happens to the characters even and this is heretical the original ones another franchise ruined in the pursuit of  a tear slides down my gradually aging face whatever happened to original storytelling and character development oh waitthat would mean taking some risks
May 6 2020,negative,jj and disney make a piece of banta shit shitty script shitty characters  shitty camera  good lord please make jj never make new movie in any universe i love
May 6 2020,negative,mildly entertaining and thats about all  for the end of a 9 part superseriesincredibly disappointed
May 6 2020,negative,wow this is how disney decided to end it to say it was disappointing would be an understatement to say it was a rotten stinking pile of garbage gets closer
May 6 2020,negative,spoiler alert  the first 30 minutes or so are kind of fun but once this thing gets rolling it falls apart quickly i can get past the fact that a lot of the themes and even characters are recycled if it serves the story but nothing is explained how did palpatine survive how does ben  kylo go from a destructive sociopath to all of a sudden being good again why would reys parents just leave her on a desert planet with no one of importance  concern to care for her who is palpatines son how did palpatine get a son what did finn want to tell rey that the movie made seem so important why did finn and rose break up what is a force diad what is the diforce how are people sometimes revived but sometimes die permanently so many more questions but if you like cool graphics lasers and maybe have never seen any star wars pre episode vii you may get some enjoyment out of this unfortunately for someone who has invested over 30 years in this franchise this is recycled garbage
May 6 2020,negative,absolute crap i can go on and on about lack of antagonistprotagonist development rational story good acting good fights and so on but in reality this movie closed out a trilogy of garbage   jj abrams said it best you just never really know but having a plan i have learnedin some cases the hard wayis the most critical thing because otherwise you dont know what youre setting up   watch it drunk otherwise its a real challenge and chore to get through in one sitting  if it was possible i would put negative stars
May 6 2020,negative,this is the second worst star wars movie only episode 8 was worse the story is terrible the acting is mostly terrible and the fight scenes are horrific its bad enough most of the characters are crappy knock offs of the original trilogy its amazing the with disney money and already tons of great potential story lines the made this shit trilogy
May 6 2020,positive,tros tries to fix last films mistakes with a satisfying ending but it is not enough to save this trilogy
May 6 2020,positive,i seriously dont get why this was so poorly rated wayyyy better than last jedi
May 6 2020,negative,overall the new star wars movies have been very good films very bad star wars  not this one this was a terrible film and downright offensive star wars i did not have high expectations but i did not think this was possible i dont think any piece of entertainment media has ever pissed me off as much as this dumpster fire
May 6 2020,positive,really enjoyed this movie there were a few corny bits but healthy dose of action drama adventure and scifi the set pieces were great the story was good the acting wonderful and so human the cgi was great the starfights were great we really cared about the characters and their welfare   solid movie definitely recommend
May 6 2020,positive,as a final installment in the skywalker saga i think that this wrapped up the narrative very well we followed our heroes the whole time and barely ever cut away from them the film was fastpaced lots of travel lots of character development moments and a kickass finale i think that is the best ending to this saga that we couldve gotten in my opinion
May 6 2020,positive,4 and a half the rise of skywalker is a mostly well constructed cute funny emotional scifi ride it has confusing moments and the action isnt necessarily too mind blowing like last jedi but at towards the end the final battle is where the visuals are really striking and the action is wild this movie is a bit easier to understand then other ones too i might love it the action and visuals are still fun throughout the film though with a stormtrooper surprise
May 6 2020,positive,it was pretty good but i felt the last jedi was better rogue one is still one of the best of the newer films the force awakens is the best among the new trilogy han solo had some great moments now my wife loved the rise of skywalker but for me it wasnt the best i was hoping for better
May 6 2020,positive,lots of fun to watch still not as good as the force awakens but it wraps up the saga nicely
May 6 2020,negative,return of the skywalker is a well crafted movie too bad the movie is nothing but a mash of fan service and is a knock off return of the jedi  the characters dont make any sense and theres no continuity from the last film  truly disappointed
May 6 2020,negative,from a connected trilogy and universe standpoint the movie reverts and takes an easy way out of a difficult situation appeasement is a terrible policy and one that ruins this movie however the film is still amazingly well made and beyond huge plot holes still has some really amazing individual scenes
May 6 2020,positive,its striking how the scores are contrasted in this movie themes i enjoyed  the prodigal son  ben solohan solo hope is worth fighting for and dying for skywalkers are those who give their life for others   i gave 5 because i know star wars if i hadnt seen some of the no movie story line it would be hard to understand how the emperor is still alive etc and would probably have given it 4 since the story would seem fragmented
May 5 2020,neutral,the script wouldnt have passed an entry level writing class technical aspects were good
May 5 2020,negative,the worst movie from the entire saga for shure
May 5 2020,positive,this film is amazing i mean there were problems here and there the plot was a little bit hitormiss but the characters the music the scenery it was an immersive experience that while significantly different to other star wars films still gave you a semblance of the same feeling
May 5 2020,positive,it couldve been better and i wouldve given it a higher rating if disney didnt cut hayden christensen scenes out of the movie overall its a decent movie but its a lot better than the last jedi i wish rey wasnt so powerful so fast while it takes other jedi years to train those are my only complaints this movie is decent
May 5 2020,negative,so boring i just wished to fast forward a star wars movie thats crazy but true so bad just bad
May 5 2020,negative,same plot gimmicks as other star wars movies
May 5 2020,negative,terrible the visuals were there but it honestly didnt feel like star wars the plot is all over the place and there was never a moment where it made sense watch the clone wars instead its better
May 5 2020,negative,unfortunately star wars is dead in terms of movies folks  whatever star wars was is gone and whatever this is isnt worth your time
May 5 2020,negative,what a mess the plot was just all over place force skypeteleport made even less sense and rey was basically a god at this point also she killed palpatine so why didnt he possess her why didnt palpatine take a suicide pill and then just hop into her body i dont even know if i can say its better than last jedi   finally how is this still at 86 i call shinanagans
May 5 2020,negative,come on are they even trying anymore
May 5 2020,positive,on the back of the bullshit that was the last jedi this film starts off very fast paced and with not much meat on the bones clearly chasing down and rectifying the errors of its predecessor  not a perfect film to start with but it was needed sadly when the last jedi holes have been plugged as much as can be the film finally starts to get some weight and really picks up really enjoyable film not perfect still a few flaws but more in line with the star wars universe and gives the story we all wanted following on from the force awakens
May 5 2020,negative,the movie spits in the face of anyone who cared enough to delve deep into the books or comics and have good understanding of the force suddenly the new trilogy changed the force to be wizardry with no explanation rules and limitations i could forgive anything else but that is destroying the main foundation of star wars also the and i am iron man ending made me cringe
May 5 2020,positive,loved it from start to finnish a amazing conclution to the star wars saga
May 5 2020,negative,terrible awful writing nothing but macguffins overacted adam driver and mark hamill were the only noncringey  actors full of plot holes i still have no idea what this trilogy was about it was that bad
May 5 2020,positive,a very messy film tons of plotholes and tons of things never even explained which in turn makes a lot of things they were trying to do feel unearned with all of that being said i was still entertained all the way through and a couple scenes were actually great to watch overall a forgetable below average film to waste the time
May 5 2020,negative,tens of thousands of star destroyers magically raised from underneath the surface of a planet complete with trained crew riding bothans in a charge against blaster fire on top of a star destroyer ren kissing kylo why nothing makes sense here its just nice scenery and drama that no one cares about does anyone read these scripts at all what are they paying bigelow for
May 5 2020,negative,the reason why i am giving rise of skywalker such a low rating is because it is so incredibly lack luster this movie follows an extremely formulaic plot it did not deliver a single challenging moment for the audience everything it did was nicely wrapped up in a neat little package the struggles that rey faces as a character are a copy and paste version of luke skywalkers except far far less convincing this movie had opportunities to be innovative but chose the easy path  the ending of a trilogy really needs something more than what we got here
May 5 2020,positive,i for one thought this movie was amazing i thought it tied up the story very well definitely a must see for fellow star wars fans now this is just my opinion i know some people havent cared for the past few ones i loved those ones too but i really thought it was a great movie and i think any fellow star wars lover should at least see it once definitely one of my favorite movies
May 5 2020,positive,i dont care what the toxic star wars prequels fanboys says about this movie i liked it it has a good ending of the saga great visual effects sound and some nostalgia the story is good but its not my favorite movie i think this movie fixes the last jedi mistakes and i appriciate it its my 3rd favorite star wars movie
May 5 2020,positive,the rise of skywalker does have its moments of epicness but some might say that the only satisfying part was that it ended
May 5 2020,negative,what a train wreck of an ending what the devil is going on with this instant disappearing crap it was lame in the previous movie and its lame here as well  a good movie wouldve had some tragedy such as rey dying and ben solo taking overlike its supposed to be nooooinstead we now have rey fake skywalker how lame and predictable i couldve slept through the whole movie and told you what happened at the end
May 5 2020,positive,star wars rise of skywalker 2019 i think i like this film better than force awakens but i think that this film proves to me that it is an unnecessary trilogy because basically the ending of the film was resolved in return of the jedi and they just retold a new hope return of the jedi with different characters i like the visual look of this film i thought the idea that c3p0 could not read sith was dumb i thought the fact that the sith language is just sith rather than another term was unoriginal and not convincing i thought it was bogus that c3p0 memory had to be wiped in order to be able to translate sith i did like having c3p0 with a wiped memory but i did not like that that aspect was not played around very much i was not convinced with the emperor having a hidden imperial fleet with star destroyers with planet destroying devices attached onboard i will admit that i did not feel as upset by this film as i was by force awakens or the last jedi i felt like the new characters were cool but they did not have enough to work with to get me invested i did thing the idea of hyper space jumping was dumb i was also not a fan of these new force powers that are in the film like ghost luke skywalker now able lift up an xwing out of the water emperor palpatine able to electrocute a rebel fleet in the sky by himself that was bogus and unconvincing i liked the world building but in some ways it felt smaller rather than bigger i liked some of the new introduced vehicles in this film this film did get me going really a lot because they went in directions that are completely unnecessary and bigger does not always mean better what got me was how many times ray ditches her friends in this film does not even tell her friends where she is going i thought the leia scenes were done okay i wish that we saw more of ghost luke and lando in this film to help with the plot we saw more of leia that lando calrissian or luke and that surprised me since the actors billy dee williams  mark hamill are still alive so i would have thought that a bigger role would have been give to them i thought that this film provided a proper resolution to leia  han solo i was glad that we did get one more scene with han solo to give that some resolution 
May 5 2020,positive,after 5 underwhelming prequals and sequels the writers finally write a good star wars movie i also mostly enjoyed the rogue one moviewhich was truer to the original franchise than 12378 ix was by far the best star wars movie that has been made in the last 2 decades
May 5 2020,negative,the ending was bad there was no bromance at all
May 5 2020,positive,since this series had disappointed me i the past i  was very apprehensive the movie was excellent with great special effects and storyline
May 5 2020,positive,a great conclusion to the skywalker story my only complaint is that i had to wait over over 20 years for the ending of the story to be told however it was worth the wait for it to be done right
May 5 2020,negative,force healing bad movie bad bad movie bad
May 5 2020,positive,the movie wasnt too bad however this is the worst trilogy in star wars
May 5 2020,positive,fitting ending reincorporating favorite lines and moments bringing many stories to a close
May 5 2020,negative,right from the title card i had to ask myself if this was written by a toddler the plot is convoluted and makes no sense at all why is there a giant fleet of planetdestroying starships remember palpatine the antagonist that luke and the rebels fought so hard to defeat yeah hes back just cuz like this movie together with the other 2 sequels has ruined star wars for me and completely spits in the face of the original trilogy and true star wars fans anyone who gave this movie more than 2 stars was a someone who doesnt care about star wars and just likes action b thinks trolls 2 is an epic cinematic masterpiece but thinks the lord of the rings was boring c paid by disney to write a good review i could go on forever about just how bad this film is and i strongly question how this made it to theatres maybe the test screenings were conducted with a live pidgeon audience whatever im done this movie sucks watch the clone wars and jj abrams only talent is ruining things with star in them
May 5 2020,positive,i gave it 4 stars cause its not the last jedi i believe  they wasted an opportunity  for instance being someone who was there when star wars first came out in 1977 and it was just called star wars not episode 4 the think that it attracted to me was the battles in space they could have made the last battle spectacular  but in the end it was just  okay but as far as the story it was pretty good yes answers were made but new questions as well i can give you a lot of flaws  a lot of what they did correct but i believe the important question is  was the ending worth it the answer is yes definitely yes
May 4 2020,negative,poorly made terrible flow to the storyabsolute dogshit
May 4 2020,negative,this movie made no sense ironically this movie is the opposite of avengers endgame both semifinales to huge disney franchises that came out in the same year while avengers endgame was slow at times it was so well done in terms of character development and action at the end however star wars rise of skywalker is a clusterfuck somehow worse than the last jedi the movie is filled with plot holes and rushed plot development i already found 10 huge plot holes within the first 5 minutes i would not recommend this film to anyone except for if you want to make fun at a movie what makes this film even worse is that the original directors script with concept art leaked and it looked amazing possibly could have even been the best star wars movie since the original trilogy which btw i am not a fanboy of the originals but this movie is terrible
May 4 2020,positive,so i liked more in the film that i didnt however i have some feedback  awesome parts  luke grabbing the light sabre hans solo returning to speak to kylo palpatine repeating old famous lines from the other trilogies kylo rens kiss with ray  negatives  i really felt that more could have been done for example when ray heard all the jedis voices why not put them all around her as force ghosts each giving her more power anakin obey etc all around her that would have been awesome i also felt that it was at some points spoon fed the original films didnt need to spell it out for you to understand overall was much better than the other disney films
May 4 2020,negative,i think the worst part about the disney trilogy is how much potential they had like the ideas of a stormtrooper turned rebel and han solo and leias son being a sith are fascinating but they just fucking ruined it by having a board room write the whole thing and turning it into pure shit
May 4 2020,negative,i will concede that this is not an easy film to make  however many of the decisions i felt were offensive  forcing new characters in that didnt matter new jedi powers expanding old plots and youre just left with an empty forgettable mess  like many of the remakes this too was a letdown
May 4 2020,negative,wow more star wars garbage it is just a poorly recapitulated story of the original which was great acting was mediocre the plot was tiresome and i hope we have seen the end of skywalkers  rey was a pitiful excuse for a jedi and kyloren was a lame sith  so far the only saving grace for star wars lately has been the mandalorian installment dont let jj abrams or rian johnson touch that one or else it might be ruined also
May 4 2020,negative,it felt like they fed an ai the scripts of the last 8 movies and told it to churn something out that would please everybody i really think there was a way to respect the decisions of the last movie while also creating something that more fans would have found satisfying and this movie definitely was not that the leaked trevrow script sounds like it would have definitely been a much more satisfying even if flawed conclusion to the skywalker saga then this trainwreck was i was really disappointed but at least i have the other movies and tv shows to fall back on and remind me why i fell in love with this series in the first place
May 4 2020,negative,there is no words that can express how awful this movie was the plot the ways they used the force the acting the graphics the battle scenes awful just pure awful everyone that participated in this movie should be ashamed and should have no right to make another movie
May 4 2020,negative,this movie can really only be described with one word garbage i didnt think the sequels could get any worse but somehow they managed it before rise of the skywalker i was sure the folks at disney were just throwing random crap together confident that the star wars brand would carry even the worst atrocities but at this point i can only assume theyre deliberately trying to destroy the star wars franchise for some reason
May 4 2020,negative,this is painful to watch
May 4 2020,positive,mediocre at best the characters were shallow and the story is ridden with plot holes
May 4 2020,positive,not to be mean or anything but why does this have a worse rating than the phantom menace
May 4 2020,positive,there no reason to hate the movie just because it might be the last movie you gotta like it or hated at the same time
May 4 2020,negative,i liked last two minutes of it to bad the rest of it was just bad 
May 4 2020,positive,ive just seen the movie as i was staying away from star wars since the last jedi i agree the first 2030 minutes are pretty jammed with plot and im glad to tell you the rest is nearly a masterpiece i wish they had a little more cash and time to polish every scene to its fullest that being said this movie made some really bold choices and is seriously respecting everything that came before it even the last jedi best one of the three gotta see it again with another boycotter thank you jj for a very good star wars movie
May 4 2020,neutral,there was a lot riding on this last instalment the story was crammed and nonsensical the script was meh but most importantly there are several points in this movie where some characters should just stay dead far too much resurrecting
May 4 2020,negative,absolutely terrible jumble mess of a movie with some good moments but overall just not good at all starts like a hot mess and ends with one of the craziest roller coaster of emotions that make you think they had no idea how to finish this movie leaves a bad taste in your mouth even with all the camels in it ugh
May 4 2020,neutral,a very disappointing unsatisfying end to the skywalker saga
May 3 2020,negative,despite a stronger story than its predecessor still a disappointing entry into the star wars legacy
May 3 2020,positive,better than the last jedi but too much was crammed in too little too late  no real character development and farcical repetition  great action scenes but its all been done before better in ep1 2 and 3
May 3 2020,positive,im in two minds about this movie  the first being im not a child anymore so maybe this isnt aimed at an adult audience and also you will never be able to better a new hope or the empire strikes back  one of the downsides is lando was brought it too late in this new triology and really he deserved to be brought in earlier on a positive the way leia was kept in the final instalment despite carrie fishers passing was handled very well
May 3 2020,positive,the movie was a good movie but it lacked a few major details in my opinion at the end of the movie when rey hears all of the past jedi voices you hear anakin skywalkers voice i was expecting more of anakin as he was the first skywalker to become a jedi we did see luke as a force ghost help rey but what about anakin if he where to ever show up as a force ghost i think the best time would of been just before rey defeats emperor palpatine now because anakin was once palpatines apprentice he knew he enough about palpatine that he could talk to rey and tell her to get up and they would defeat him together all the voices do end up giving rey enough strength and courage to defeat palpatine on her own but if anakin where there to help her the scene would of been much more powerful and stuck with the audience now i cant lie and say that all the past jedi voices telling her to find the lightget up and that she was not alone and they had her back wasnt good because it was again anakin would of made it more powerful because not only was he palpatines apprentice he was lukes father and to mention luke was reys master before he passed away the rise of skywalker really did link these last three movies together but if anakin was more than just a voice and was a force ghost i feel it would of linked all nine movies as he was the one to start all this it wasnt just anakin either it was also finn while finn and rey are sinking in the sand finn says he has something to tell rey now most people would be thinking it was i love you because they thought they were about to die but what if it was something different at the end of the movie finn can feel rey dying but only people with potential jedi powers can sense those things right because finn never told rey his secret it leaves the audience wondering if his secret was that he was a jedi all along and thats why he couldnt fulfill his duty as a stormtrooper beside anakin and finn the movie wasnt bad a few details here and there but i would recommend this movie to a star wars fan and see what they think these are just some of my opinions and what i thought could of been better star wars the rise of skywalker is a good movie it just had a few tweaks here and there that needed to be adjusted
May 3 2020,positive,cant go wrong with the newest star wars movie especially with jj abrams back on board all expectations are met with the only minor flaw being that its overwhelming amount of complex space politics can only be completely understood by the most hardcore fans of the franchise
May 2 2020,positive,this movie closes better than the third the saga at this point its difficult to be original and popular in the same time jj abrahms is a real entarteiner
May 2 2020,negative,the only character that i care about is kylo ren and i was looking forward to see his arc in this final skywalker saga butnothey killed the only remaining skywalker so someone else can be the one they wasted adam driver talent for this
May 2 2020,negative,who is to blame the one who wreck the ship motor or the one who crashed it 
May 2 2020,negative,first no one cares what the critics think except maybe their mothers but that just supporting their little person however in this case they are correct this movie was horrible i would say it ended the franchise as jjs reboot of star trek did to that franchise  but to be fair ryan did that the only way to see this movie is because well you wasted your life on the last two so screw it
May 2 2020,negative,im a big star wars fan  this is a bad movie  its corny nearly every second that rey and kylo ren arent on the screen  70 of this movie is cringing to corny lines by the other actors finn is the worsteverything the character says is stupid or cheesy and the acting is just bad  this movie was made for children or for people who like fast  furious  there is nothing good about itits just a giant waste of time and an embarassment for people who love the franchise  ill stick to the originals and rogue one and pretend none of these other childish garbage films were made
May 1 2020,negative,this film was better than tlj but lacks any sense of imagination and uniqueness as a story and a film jj spent more time retconning the events of tlj than actually telling a story this film is plagued by fan service ie giving chewie his medal for anh if you look as this film by itself it is a decent movie however if you look at this film in the trilogy and the saga than you start to see some patterns that occur overall the film is a disappointing end to the skywalker saga and you would be better off forgetting about this trilogy
May 1 2020,positive,great last chapter of the star wars saga
May 1 2020,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed this movie having seen the original in the theater when i was 14 i have been captivated with each additional movie i found this to be a fitting ending to the saga and will be thrilled to add it to my collection
Apr 30 2020,positive,a great way to end the series but sets up a lot of possibilities that do not follow thorugh
Apr 30 2020,negative,pointless left literally angry at what they did
Apr 30 2020,positive,really enjoyed this one
Apr 30 2020,negative,bringing back palpatine turns this film in a wrost film of star wars destroy all of was constructed in order films
Apr 30 2020,negative,a disappointing end game for a legendary series too many holes and lack of continuity a tragic end to what should have been an epic final the cinema i watched it at had an underwhelmed audience who drifted off in the latter half of the movie should have used the director writer from the mandalorian which was awesome
Apr 30 2020,negative,better than 8obviously but still a bad movie the humor is super cringey the writing is awful it again tries to feed off nostalgia the plot is super weak the visuals are amazing this movie spends half the time undoing what happened in 8 the other half is less than mediocre predictably there is no story arc or character arcs across this trilogy
Apr 29 2020,positive,after the abysmal film that was the last jedi i went into the rise of skywalker pessimistic but regardless i wanted to see the movie because i am a star wars fan and i wanted to give my honest opinion on it so after renting it on prime video and watching it to my surprise i loved the movie it was entertaining fastpaced and actionpacked most importantly it felt like i was watching a star wars movie it was back to being a space adventure movie about good vs evil the last jedi while a star wars movie felt more like a miserable nightmare rian johnson the director of the last jedi subverted expectations didnt answer any questions and disrespected the saga jj abrams came in and cleaned up the mess after the last jedi  we get our heroes back working together in rey poe finn c3p0 bb8 and chewie we learn about rey and why she is strong with the force we finally also get to see her train with leia it was also great to see rey have an internal struggle with figuring out who she is and where she fits in the galaxy it made her character seem more human kylo ren continues to be the best part of the sequel trilogy the scenes with him and rey are the best parts of the movie we also get more back story with poe and finn c3p0 and chewie also really get there moments to shine in the movie luke skywalker is back to being the optimistic mentor who respects his fathers lightsaber again i thought they did a great job of handling with leia after carrie fischer passed away seeing lando again was also a nice touch and the new characters that get introduced like zorri bliss babu frik jannah and general pryde are also really good additions to the story emperor palpatine was pretty cool as well a lot of his senses felt like something out of a horror movie the visual effects were outstanding especially in the space battle scenes the lightsaber fight scenes were intense as well i thought the movie had a nice and fitting conclusion to the trilogy    the only issues i had with the movie was the nights of ren were underutilized i would have like to see more of who they are and a bit of there origin there were some other minor issues here and there but it didnt stop me from liking the movie   overall i loved star wars the rise of skywalker it was nice to have jj abrams come in a finish what he started with the force awakens as someone who was personally disappointed with the last jedi rise of skywalker really helped patch things up for me i commend jj abrams for doing so you could even watch force awakens and rise of skywalker back to back while plucking out the last jedi completely this movie and the mandalorian have reinvigorated my faith in star wars i am looking forward to seeing what comes next   overall score 910
Apr 29 2020,positive,great movie with lots of awesome scenes the ending was weird though
Apr 29 2020,negative,only good character is kylo ren and his redemption arc was just a crappy rehash of vaders redemption
Apr 29 2020,negative,a onedimensional boring forgettable predictable cliche derivative formulaic mess meant to appeal to the lowest common denominator and get the highest box office value endgame actually put time effort and thought into their franchise but this feels more like game of thrones season 8 ridiculous pacing and a parody of its former self with the cringe comedy of the big bang theory and the manufactured drama of a soap opera i am baffled as to how professional writers were paid any amount of money to write this movie no memorable dialogue or reveals no compelling plot points and nothing of substance maybe the back and forth between rey and kylo was okay but thats it feel free to take a bathroom break at any point
Apr 29 2020,negative,no risks taken weak story and i mean weak it is even stupid at some points nearly as bad as the last jedi uninteresting characters and everything seems rushed you dont even get time to breathe or even try to understand the plot
Apr 29 2020,negative,the movie felt like they were trying to save the story from the garbage that rian johnson put it in
Apr 28 2020,negative,wow this movie is hilarious it doesnt quite scale the comedic heights of that chuckle inducing  masterpiece the last jedi but its still pretty funny never the less i would say its a little strange that disney would take arguably the greatest scifi movie franchise in history and turn it into a comedy franchise but few could argue that theyre not funny also very pretty the rise of palpatine is a comedy of epic coincidences that once again is stunning and brave in the way it has dealt with the franchise cannon and total disregard and seemingly hatred for any of the origional characters and massive passionate fan base  if i were to walk into my favourite steakhouse order and pay for a steak only to be told that no youre  wrong youre getting the fish then i would have to leave and never support that business again same here i walked into my favourite scifi franchise and paid for some great swashbuckling scifi adventure with gripping plots and characters i cared about at least twice now i have been sold a comedic turd vacant and soulless fool me once shame on you fool me twice still shame on you disney killed star wars rip
Apr 28 2020,negative,this film is a fitting example of how a billionaire corporate company can annihilate something that was something short of a masterpiece the original trilogy this film was an insult not just to the fans but to the universes creator george lucas he entrusted disney to continue what he sold in a hope that his films will go on only for his ideas and story to be completely shot down into flames casting him out of having any say in what was to happen to his own franchise they spent the majority of the film retconning every tiny mistake rian johnson created in the last jedi meaning the film felt more like damage control than an actual story being put in place the lightsaber battles were bland and had no emotional connection to the characters i felt the choreography wasnt great but was definitely an upgrade from the last jedis choreography one of the only redeeming qualities this film holds is the great score composed by john williams shame this was his last one the film was nice to look at at certain times this film manipulated the audience by using nostalgia from the previous films as a walking stick to get from start to the finishing line and god is it noticeable it completely derails character arcs such as finns and rey but most of all the prophecy of anakin skywalker watch the film at your own risk what a terrible way to end the saga it didnt land nor did it do the characters justice or its predecessor films this was awful
Apr 28 2020,positive,without rey its nothing but still not enough to make it worth the name star wars
Apr 28 2020,negative,terrible pacing ridiculous even for a science fictionfantasy plot retread of long dead emperor a massive secret fleet  who are the crew of this massive fleet youd think theyd show a commander no rays self discovery continues boringly just tiresome nonsense with some obligatory light saber fights bla bla bla
Apr 28 2020,negative,a very lacking experience with numerous plotholes the whole thing just redid everything the other two did wrong but worse every new character was just like phasma  does nothing then disappears the story was confusing and a lot happened that made no sense i cant really get into it without spoiling anything but the movie was quite lackluster  of course the cgi and special effects were great but for story the movie is a waste of time
Apr 28 2020,positive,we loved this movie if i could give it 10 stars i would
Apr 27 2020,negative,this movie was mediocre because of how things just didnt make sense
Apr 27 2020,negative,disgraceful conclusion to the skywalker saga
Apr 27 2020,negative,felt very forced it really felt like that they were forcing a new plot  as a longtime star wars fan i am very disappointed and on a new note where was hayden christensen 
Apr 27 2020,positive,it is far from the best sw movie but the acting is great it is very entertaining  it could have been an amazing movie but its to short runtime made it average
Apr 27 2020,negative,disney garbage for the canon will not be considered in the oven such a story this cancels all the first six episodes
Apr 27 2020,neutral,warning there are spoilers here  overall this movie was disappointing if it wasnt a star wars film i would have liked it but this just didnt follow a star wars logic im not saying all star wars films have to be the same but this just had so many plot holes that a regular star wars movie wouldnt have the story in general was just stupid and rushed if you know star wars you know that palpatine was killed by getting thrown off of the death star and somehow without explanation tros brought palpatine back bringing a dead character back is stupid and without explanation come on that was the biggest plot hole for me but there were many others in the last star wars film the last jedi which was even worse than tros our hero luke skywalker had passed away jedi can come back as force ghosts and luke did but heres the thing force ghosts cannot interact with the real world they can talk to certain people but they cannot use the force on real things in the real world anyway the ghost luke used the force to lift a ship out of the water for rey let me say that again the ghost luke used the force to lift a ship out of the water for rey in star wars that cannot be done it does not apply to star wars logic another thing i didnt like about tros was the unoriginality kylo ren was the antagonist but in the end he became good i wouldnt have a problem with that if it were original in the original star wars trilogy darth vader became good making kylo ren come to the light side was so cliche and unoriginal for me you can only do that with one character in this franchise and that character was darth vader my very last error i would like to talk about is simply the fact that things happened way too fast it was almost impossible to follow the story they just jumped right into it without any sort of development as much as i would like to go over more plot holes i will now go over what i did enjoy for all star wars movies the music is great i could say the same about tros john williams has once again done a good job another thing i liked was the action the one fight where rey fought kylo ren was probably one of my favorite parts of the whole movie there were plenty more good action scenes as well my overall review for this movie is 25 stars out of 5
Apr 27 2020,positive,its good   
Apr 27 2020,negative,terrible film in a terrible sequel series why did fans like this oh yeah blind nostalgia
Apr 27 2020,negative,i was disappointed in many aspects of this film i wasnt a fan of the new force that can teleport objects the entire series the new order had been likened to nzis from outfits to speeches to how they walked which would make kylo ren hitler  5 minutes after kylo reforms himself rey kisses him what if you value your time skip this film
Apr 26 2020,positive,all i can say is the critics got this one wrong this was actually good
Apr 26 2020,negative,better than the last one on most aspects but huge plot holes and filled with deus ex machina bland conversations and cheesy feel good actions that are quite ridiculous it relies almost only on nostalgia because of their incompetence of creating a credible star wars atmosphere sad  the best thing would be to pretend this new trilogy never existed
Apr 26 2020,positive,i loved it and i just cant understand this critic score at all i think this was an amazing movie and a heart touching and emotional end to trilogy if not saga
Apr 26 2020,positive,it was alright not the best better tho than the last jedi
Apr 25 2020,positive,this was the only sequel trilogy member i actually enjoyed the force awakens failed to excite me much while i frankly disliked the last jedi ill say its among my top 3 of the total 9 sitting at maybe 2 overall  it reeks of fan service but hey i am a fan
Apr 25 2020,positive,when watching the movie there was a lot happening to take in yes i feel the movie answered many questions and yes i also do feel the rise of skywalker ties in nicely with the force awakens therefore leaving out the last jedi which to me is great
Apr 25 2020,negative,boring boring boring boringneed i say more what shameful ending to an original masterpiece
Apr 24 2020,negative,made no sense horrible plot decisions when there were so many other good ways to go
Apr 24 2020,positive,not a perfect film but it exceeds in what its trying to do
Apr 24 2020,positive,my review of this movie may be controversial but i loved this movie i think i almost passed out from the action which i loved there was so much to answer and they answered all of it one downside was that they tried to fit too much in but that didnt hurt the movie too much it was just a masterpiece and a great way to end a saga going for 42 years
Apr 24 2020,negative,rushed and chaotic filled with plot holes and breaks what was previously stablished for its own nonsense benefit not trully planned nor a real star wars story
Apr 24 2020,positive,a fairly good movie but the problem with star wars is they kill so many people like it is all in a days work and on every planet they never use space suits which is ridiculous the movie was rushed and could have been a hour longer
Apr 24 2020,negative,its so sad so many childhood memories destroyed and it gets worst than that
Apr 24 2020,positive,i laughed through the first two hours it was like someone created a list of all the star wars characters and best moments instead of doing some serious writing and the producers accepted it after two hours the movie caught my attention like any good movie i would watch this again for the laughter snd the quality ending
Apr 23 2020,positive,i really liked it when rey was revealed to be a palpatine what i dont really like about the film is i feel like at the beginning when poe and the crew were lightspeed skipping i feel like that was a bit rushed but other than that i really liked the film good job guys
Apr 23 2020,negative,o my god disney completely  killed all of george lucass work and creativity from my point of view i wish i could have unwatched the trilogies that came after the death of darth vader
Apr 23 2020,negative,terrible just as the two movies before that one just like george lucas said there is nothing new just a boring collection of stuff stolen from the first three good movies
Apr 23 2020,neutral,that is not how the star wars sequel trilogy ends
Apr 23 2020,negative,this movie throws everything we that was abstablished out the window and saids ha no every single scene in this movie made me think that makes no sense and that stupid the characters in this become kinda boring to watch force healing is one of the stupidest thing added in this and this movie doesnt deserve to be called a star wars movie
Apr 23 2020,positive,i was hoping that for the end of the star wars saga the final chapter would have been spectacular but i was sadly disappointed in this filmafter all of the hype this film did not live up to the expectations of the final star wars film or the conclusion of the main star wars chapters    the movie was not terrible and i would recommend watching this film if you are a fan of star wars but it was disappointing how the final chapter was scripted particularly the storyline was not surprising whatsoever    i would give this 25 stars if not for the excellent acting by the cast and the fact that it is the final star wars film from the main storyline
Apr 22 2020,negative,jj you failed us you tried to please everyone and yet you pleased no one i am numb from this being the last star wars episode this gave me no hope palpatine won in the end all the skywalker s are dead
Apr 22 2020,negative,it was an awful film mainly because of the comedic film before it the last jedi  if the last jedi had followed what the force awakens set up then this might have been a good conclusion  bringing back palpatine was just desperate by disney and abrams  shockingly bad film  luke raises the x wing which he should have done in last jedi rey gets taught by leia etc etc very poor film  i do not recommend anyone to watch this  the force awakens and rogue one are the only decent disney star wars to watch  the building of the star destroyers was also desperate and they were built underground  they dont know the way up  anything that goes away from the earth they just rose up out of is up  they cant tell which way is up out there what an awful script awful story which followed on from the ruins of the last jedi  terrible film and terrible sequel after the force awakens
Apr 22 2020,negative,oh boy just terrible
Apr 22 2020,negative,i went to the theatre thinking to myself  well the last jedi was bad but maybe this last movie will have more action a better story an well  more star wars but honestly it barely felt like anybody thought about the plot or the characters the movie is full of moments that are made to make newborn babies laugh but if youre any older than two weeks its just taking you out of the story honestly its still better than the second one but even with all the action in the movie i just found it boring and uninteresting it just felt like i was watching a bad parody movie that was supposed to copy star wars it was just sad
Apr 22 2020,negative,not even so bad its funny its just bizarre this is nothing about pleasing hardcore fans and pissing off others it is just an out and out badly made film unwatchable
Apr 22 2020,negative,no wanted to like it i really did just no
Apr 22 2020,negative,was expecting it to be along the lines of rogue one but it really left a lot to be desired i do have to admit it was better than the last jedi not much but a little
Apr 21 2020,positive,i feel that since the force awakens the films havent been as good and sadly this film falls into that category emperor palpatine is one of my favourite star wars characters but i felt underwhelmed about his return i feel the previous films were so good why introduce old characters like emperor palpatine but what i really disliked was that rey is now a skywalker that bothered me
Apr 21 2020,negative,this is quite possibly literally the worst movie i have ever seen  every frame is an insult to cinema  every line is vacant every scene vacuous  the pacing challenges the best of human perception  one really needs multiple viewings to take in the full breadth of mediocrity on offer imagine batman 4ever but with 5x the budget and zero imagination and you just had a passing thought that is more cohesive that this movie  if all of the errors disappointment failure and unresolved potential of season 8 of game of thrones could be distilled into a single movie it would not be near as unsatisfying and distasteful as this movie  this movie is an insult to the human spirit  i put more effort into this bs review than the writers put into the script  i cant believe this movie was actually made  this is real  this fugin movie was actually filmed edited and realeased
Apr 21 2020,negative,the good people always win the bad people always lose also good people never die and also bad people always die but i dont get it why you kill the bad guy who came back to light damn i love that character come on break the rules make some different thats get more and more predictable
Apr 21 2020,positive,for a movie it was good as a fan though this is more that just any movie if a certain important main character hadnt been killed off at the end id give it a five
Apr 21 2020,negative,many of the issues with the rise of skywalker dont stem from actual problems with the film but more so abrams and company trying to retcon everything the previous director had done with the last jedi instead on focusing on making the literal last film in a saga and delivering on it this trilogys strong point was in its beginning with the force awakens and with a directorchange it feels so discombobulated i wont even get in to the fact of how disappointing the return of emperor palpatine is either
Apr 21 2020,negative,nothing like the original starwarsstory line all over the map
Apr 20 2020,negative,driver and ridley were reasonable the rest of the acting was questionable at best the script and plot were horrible cinematography and sound track were good but fell short of great overall a major disappointment for a movie i had high hopes for
Apr 20 2020,negative,where is the 88 of audience members that liked this movie this movie was so unoriginal i had hope that jj was gonna fix it if you saw return of the jedi you have seen this movie dont bother
Apr 20 2020,neutral,i dont love the star wars films the way some do i saw them as a child i enjoyed them and i bought a few related toys but they never retained the place in my affection they have for some with the 9film cycle now concluded with this film i look back and count a total of 3 decent films lets be honest 33 is not a great hit rate return of the jedi and the first two films in this latest trilogy this one takes all that was good about the previous episode and tramples all over it with bad storytelling a whole load of deus exmachina that reach the level of absurd and some decent performances struggling to make themselves heard above the din im kind of glad its all over to be honest
Apr 20 2020,positive,incredible theres a lot of people particularly online wholl try and put this trilogy down but theres no satisfying some people the people who worked on this film love and care about star wars and this film reflects that dont listen to the hate
Apr 20 2020,negative,im just going to pretend this last trilogy doesnt exist butchered it
Apr 20 2020,negative,oh my god it is official i hope to god i never see another star wars movie ever again in my life  sweet baby jesus this was bad from start to finish only the most desperate star wars fans would want to see this drivel  script direction acting dialogue story plot device and on and on and on was offensive to the senses  this is the equal to the godzilla movies where anyone who is not a pure zealot sees it for what it truly isrubbish and the star wars war boys will fight tooth and nail just to see anything of their god on film again  jj abrams just cant help but trash beloved well established film franchises this movie was rubbish
Apr 20 2020,positive,the movie is enjoyable but doesnt make sense to that what we saw in the last jedi there are also many things that would have been perfect in the movie these things were also shot by the crew but were cut out from the end product like anakin a focegohst oder a finnpoe kiss
Apr 19 2020,negative,so blah no risks just generic fanboy service i miss lucas he knew how to take risks and make something original
Apr 19 2020,negative,garbage in its purest form here disney reaches the culmination of the destruction of the first 6 films passing through the lining all the mythology of star wars throwing x the toilet the prophecy of the chosen one putting some insufferable protagonists with whom i am not capable to empathize despising r2d2 making rey more powerful than master yoda just by training for a few months making him win a palpatine in the end and to finish shitting everything seen until episode 6 taking the skywalker surname all this in broad strokes because if i start to make one more criticism my idle would spend the whole night
Apr 19 2020,negative,how does jj abrams still get to make movies i love star wars with all of my heart this was like fan fiction written by a group of school kids
Apr 19 2020,negative,it was awful to fast not logical dumb conversations realy dumb no explaining how palpatine came back and how he was able to create such a huge army in all it was dumb movie disney should ne ashamed and should sell the rights dir the movie disney destroys star wars with all the dumb stuff
Apr 19 2020,negative,the franchise has lost it focus
Apr 19 2020,positive,the time for craping on star wars is at an end sorry folks we just didnt get the series we hoped for  in the rise of skywalker we get a sincere attempt by those involved to give a disappointed fan base a solid final outing  as a fan i appreciate it however in the end the entire star wars saga comes down to the marvelous mysterious rey being manipulated into hating palpatine so she can join the dark side because she is spoiler familia  after all disney is a family company not only is she related to grampa palpatine who actually is a clone of her grandfather but she also is related to all the jedis who have come before her becausethe force its ridiculous its a bit derivative and played out but its wellacted the film looks great there are a lot of fun action scenes and its one last time to hear john williams expand his melodic universe  and disney just some advice next time use dave filoni and not katleen kennedy
Apr 18 2020,positive,better than last jedi and solo but way worse than rouge one and force awankens
Apr 18 2020,negative,not as bad as tlj at least its finally over
Apr 18 2020,positive,had some weird plot twists
Apr 17 2020,negative,worst pacing ever so many flaws after flaws after flaws with storytelling after watching all the movies and side movies and all animated shows this is the worst star wars movie ever made
Apr 17 2020,positive,great ending for the new trilogy i loved every minute of it star wars is alive
Apr 17 2020,positive,it had its moments but it story was very disappointing
Apr 17 2020,negative,this feels like a major step back from the previous film one devoid of creativity or passion
Apr 17 2020,positive,when i saw this movie i had to really think about how i felt about it its not bad but it couldve been way better characters couldve been explained better and the story couldve been explained better the plot is really messy and the acting is okay the humor is toned down a lot compared to the last jedi but overall i think this was a disappointing conclusion to the skywalker saga this trilogy could have been way better than it was and it is really disappointing the decisions that were made so its fine but could have been a lot better
Apr 16 2020,positive,i thought the acting and producing was brilliant highly recommend
Apr 16 2020,negative,rise of skywalker is amazing but you cant end the skywalker saga and do not say rey is a skywalker because she isnt shes actually the enemy of a skywalker a palpatine
Apr 16 2020,negative,if i could give 0 stars i would since i was a kid i have loved star wars from a new hope to revenge of the sith the newest trilogy while it is visually sufficient its a star wars movie the story line literally regurgitated the original ep 46 with one exception palpatine of course im talking about legends star wars since i dont recognize the new star wars its cannon where palps had hundreds of clones plus ben solo wasnt evil his older brother jacen solo was complicated story this movie leaves more questions than answers and was a complete waste of time to actual star wars fans its just a travesty over used cash grab and i regret watching this film
Apr 15 2020,positive,so ive seen and read numerous reviews by raging nerds who deny themselves fun because whatever star wars lore they bought into please do not let those reviews spoil your fun with the movie  sure there are some minor plotholes here but lets be frank  who the hell cares if you cant hyperspace skip in milennium falcon since the nerd culture is now mainstream it seems theres easily milions of people who care for such bs and yes i too was raised watching original star wars on vhs and yes i too despise the prequels that said i utterly enjoyed watching and rewatching the new trilogy including this one which made so many critics salty see the glass half full take the zen approach is my advice here the light side will help you overlook some minor loreheresies pointed out by sith possesed youtubers and just give in to the spectacle thats it now go and watch it
Apr 15 2020,positive,this did justice to the series i was entertained with the action characters and storyline all pretty well done
Apr 15 2020,positive,i thought the story was good but should have been great considering this was the end of the legendary skywalker arc or is it hmmm the way it ended leaves you hoping for a whole new skywalker arc the acting was average which diminished the quality of the film also by the end i really thought finn and the other cat were annoying thankfully daisy ridley saved the movie
Apr 15 2020,negative,rian was right dont make films for fans if you want to enjoy star wars rewatch the prequels jj had a tall order its not that he failed he never really had a chance to succeed disney was single handily the best and the worst thing to happen to the franchise
Apr 15 2020,positive,full disclosure i am 45 years old my mom and dad took me to my first movie at age 3 guess which movie star wars in 1977 it changed my life i am so happy with the direction that the franchise has gone episode 1 2 and 3 yeah i get it a little cheesy still loved each movie episodes 7 8 and 9 absolutely loved what jj did thank you sir would love a rey skywalker solo movie
Apr 15 2020,negative,id rather have spent the time doing something else it hard to keep watching a series that didnt go anyway but most of all it was even fun to watch was the 2nd best of new trilogy but of all the movies itd be 8th out of 9 of the rest of full series
Apr 15 2020,positive,great starwars fun i enjoyed the plot and character twists the jokes were good and story was great
Apr 15 2020,positive,i got so immersed into this movie that i at one point shed a tear i even laughed because i was so happy about things happening in the movie i have been pretty invested in star wars lore i am a big fan  this might be the best movie i have watched in years and i watch a lot of movies my advice make your room pitch dark bring some snacks put this movie on and enjoy  eat fresh
Apr 14 2020,neutral,its a very bland movie that doesnt know what it wants to be and has too many plots in one film but i enjoyed ian mcdiarmid back as palpatine and most of the acting was pretty good
Apr 14 2020,negative,j j abrams has failed with a poorlypaced oddlywritten the dialogue is comparable to that of the prequels ailing film the skywalker saga is over protagonists are unlikable palpatine has somehow managed to bore me i am quite convinced the initial script simply read insert deus ex machina here the film does feel like a preschooler playing with his older brothers star wars toys character arcs are nonexistent individuals once cunning such as mr sheeve are now moustachetwirling knuckleheads incompetent past belief half of the film revolves around our cast of protagonists working off the information of an imperial defector to find the palpaplanet there are far too few redeeming qualities unlike most abrams films ros is anything but visually pleasing random and unnecessary references are shoved in unnaturally the knights of ren are dumber than b1 battle droids lando magically show up on some desert planet at the perfect time overall this is the petty conclusion to a great series
Apr 14 2020,positive,jj abrams is a genius fantastic ending to an impossibly difficult multifaceted story great fun wonderfully acted incredibly cool visuals that jj abrams is known for as a huge star wars fan since the first movie came out in 1977 i think this is the best possible ending to the skywalker saga i couldve hoped for bravo jj abrams
Apr 14 2020,negative,this movie totally sucked didnt captivate me in the slightest bit all i could think about was going home after the movie having to pee and i was unable to pay attention to any of the movie it was just overall boring for whatever reason couldnt tell you anything about the story line
Apr 14 2020,positive,i really enjoyed rise of the skywalker yes it is probably like  marmite you ether love it or hate it 
Apr 14 2020,negative,to be honest the film was a let down it reminded me of a fetch quest in a video game get the not holorcorn to find the i wont spoil the rest but you see where im going with this the resurrection of what seemed like a completely destroyed death star form ep 6 was a flimsy choice at best the film ties up loose strings such as snoke but i didnt find them satisfying all and all id rather watch ep 1 with a plot that is leading somewhere
Apr 14 2020,negative,messy ending to a messy trilogy this whole trilogy was a lazy excuse for disney to make money on the nostalgia of fans and their children
Apr 14 2020,negative,not even remotely close to being as good as any lucas film
Apr 14 2020,positive,the screenplay was a little bit confused maybe the way the had to told the history into only two movies even thought is still a star wars wich is very hard to give a bad review just didnt like the way the use some tools in order to solve the whole story besides that considering the photo special effects and so you wont waste your time
Apr 14 2020,positive,this was a great way to end the franchise in the skywalker story and easter eggs from the very beginning calling back to the very first movie this was a fantastic end
Apr 14 2020,negative,a huge messnon existent dialogue zero character development flat storyi couldnt find anything good in this movie and i really tried
Apr 14 2020,negative,star wars the rise of skywalker was from my point of view wars very fast paste there were not a lot of twists and turns which makes movie not as entertaining as other movies of the trilogy because you can guess what will happen so easily and the film was not an original idea it was pretty much like the episode six over all it passes the time but it definetly was not a master piece
Apr 14 2020,negative,damn shame star wars the rise of skywalker shows an immense lack of imagination for the future of star wars in my opinion i was a big fan of the last jedi i thought it pushed the series into bold new directions and for a while there i was super excited for the future of the star wars franchise but none the less the rise of skywalker squanders that with an unfocused plot poor character choices dull scenes and bland execution the concluding chapter of the skywalker saga is only kept above the surface by great music performances and a likable cast new plotlines are suddenly introduced without much reason to be there muggufuns are brought in and abandoned characters pasts are revealed but they are either contradictory to the other two films or fail to be given an enough time to develop paced in seemingly a breakneck yet at the same time so boring its slow way you will either love the movie or hate it with not much in between a movie meant to reunite the fanbase only ended up dividing it more i could go on this film left me with a sense of lost hope for the franchise because everything that we had been building up too ended up being that the only way to defeat the emperor would be to use two lightsabers instead of one ah thats what we were missing this whole time if you are a star wars fan you have already made up your mind on it and if youre a casual audience member you wont end up caring all that much anyway
Apr 13 2020,positive,this movie was really amazing i loved this movie this is star wars it was a good movie was it perfect no was it great yes it had alot of fan service i really enjoyed it
Apr 13 2020,positive,ive always been a fan of star wars i loved every minute of this no idea why some people slated it brilliant
Apr 13 2020,positive,the final entry and conclusion to the epic star wars saga is a huge improvement from its predecessor but still doesnt live up to the episode that started the trilogy the rise of skywalker is riddled with familiar tropes and cliches which is surprising as its directed by j j abrams who directed the force awakens it seems his vision for the trilogy took a bad turn when rian johnson took the reins for the last jedi yet theres a lot to enjoy in the action sequences and nostalgic bits so its worth the time of you watched the first two movies
Apr 13 2020,negative,they shouldve focused on a better script rather than pushing up nostalgia down our throats
Apr 13 2020,positive,i thought it was pretty good the last one wasnt no surprise the critics are so far apart from the audience on both of these
Apr 13 2020,positive,this movie took a lot of heat when it came out but after re watching it i do like it a few plot jumps but given the fact that they had to wrap up the saga they did a good job   the acting was passionate and real  the special effects were outstanding and their ability to include unused carrie fisher footage in the film was a fabulous
Apr 13 2020,positive,really do not understand the hate for this movie i just do not get it i thought this was one of the best films of the franchise
Apr 13 2020,negative,a laughably bad finale for the skywalker sequel trilogy  jj abrams directed his space adventure movie star wars the rise of skywalker 2019 like it was his first movie by lifting shots and story beats from other classic movies all to attempt to recreate the magic that was a new hope the empire strikes back and return of the jedi boy abrams fails spectacularly alongside curiously incompetant producer kathleen kennedy calling the shots from the shadows like emperor palpatine just going back to palpatine because they had no new ideas was a warning sign of this colossal waste of 142 minutes abrams uninspired direction leaves much to be desired with the same old star wars ideas being tossed around by his unimaginative script whereas rian johnson disrespected star wars lore and concepts with the last jedi jj abrams worships star wars too much to try anything new at all  i will start out with the few positive takeaways i got from the rise of skywalker i like where this saga ends palpatine dead kylo redeemed rey independent with her own agency poe redeemed with a love interest and finn redeemed with a love interest its satisfying and respectful of star wars george lucas mark hamill carrie fisher and harrison ford the rey and kylo lightsaber duel is passionate and thrilling rey challenging kylos fighter in the desert is cool finn having faith in the force is nice and lastly its sweet of jj abrams to give mark hamill a proper sendoff as luke skywalker the jedi master instead of his horrendous character assassination from rian johnson in the last jedi michael kaplans costumes are neat i adore reys white jedi robes and kylos black garb for sure overall i liked these aspects at the very least  the problem is everything else the editing is unintelligible as you never know what is happening the movie starts off with no real establishment of where characters are or what their actual motivations are now after the last jedi a brief opening crawl is not nearly enough to engage you the cinematography has a few neat camera choices with a striking wide shot of rey inside the broken death star the seaside lightsaber duel or the a new hope homage with rey in the dual sunsets the issue is all the rest of the movie has this cheap cgi glow and overly cluttered mess on screen that you cannot follow anything  daisy ridley is charming and cool as rey skywalker giving it her all in these awful films she makes the whole movie watchable as daisy is likable and relatable as rey she effortlessly fits into this space scifi adventure with her impressive combat choreography ridley painstakingly learned and got fit for all while killing the dramatic acting adam driver is excellent as ben solo with endearing dramatic suspense while also being intimidating as the hulking sith behemoth kylo ren john boyega finally gets to act normally as the likable finn with naomi ackie as his new love interest jannah oscar isaac finally gets to act as the suave and charming poe dameron especially endearing alongside the ravishing and cool keri russell as zorii bliss i wish we saw more of russell  carrie fisher is good as general leia organa but a far cry from her legendary performances as princess leia she lost all her fire and warmth sadly rest in paradise carrie we all miss you mark hamill looks like he was relieved to get a nice moment with rey as the wise and kind luke skywalker harrison ford cameos with a tender not phoned in for once role alongside driver billy dee williams is surprisingly endearing and charismatic still as lando calrissian ian mcdiarmid remains phenomenal as emperor palpatine also known as darth sidious even anthony daniels is fun as c3p0 even though abrams focused more on the other droids  domhnall gleeson is brushed aside as general hux for a gag meanwhile the imposing and talented richard e grant gets little to do as allegiant general pryde lupita nyongo is wasted again as the ugly cgi creature maz kanata who is supposed to be an oracle of sorts i just wish they put lupita in star wars in space alien makeup instead kelly marie tran got to redeem herself for her horridly overacted awkward and cringe inducing performance from the last jedi as shes very natural and likable as rose tico in the rise of skywalker i adored seeing billie lourd cameo as lieutenant connix i actually wish she got a much larger role too much time is wasted on odd subplots ugly cgi monsters goofy alien puppets and ugly space battles instead of developing characters or telling an interesting story disney clearly couldnt care less  even john williams score sounded tired of star wars at this point he gets a cute little cameo though in all im just glad we are all done with this mediocre franchise that used to capture our imaginations the original trilogy will always be fun the prequel trilogy is still embarrassing and this sequel trilogy is a horrendous cash grab that recreated the previous films with no charm rest in peace star wars i had fun with you for a time
Apr 12 2020,negative,jumped the shark poor writing looks greatbut garbage
Apr 12 2020,positive,im not sure why everyone was so disappointed in this movie  from all the negative press i wasnt sure what to expect but i really liked it  i liked the struggle that the characters had to discover who they really were and the ending  sorry the series is ending
Apr 12 2020,positive,its a good way to end the saga some questionable parts but overall must see
Apr 12 2020,negative,lucasfilm and disney they have such money special effects and abilities but made such suc  there is no logic no explanation no character development no adequate idea this is just a guinness record how not to do
Apr 12 2020,negative,jj abramsdisneylucas totally dropped the ball on this one and have been doing damage control ever since  overlong disjointed lesson in how not to make a movie let alone end a series  instead of story and plot you got pointless kung fu scenes and journeys to no where and the dredging up of long dead characters that made no sense  the luke skywalker saga was done at the end of return of the jedi  the only reason for bring back the old cast members for this trilogy was to introduce the new cast  but jj abrams or disney or both seem to have last sight of that in their effort to utilized outtakes of the dead cary fisher instead of writing a real ending and paying for real  live actors  this movie is a train wreck from start to finish  and only serves to make you appreciate the excellent story telling of the last jedi more  thanks rian johnson
Apr 12 2020,neutral,5010  mediocrepassable  seen on 41220
Apr 12 2020,negative,i watched rise of skywalker on bluray again  and its even worse than i remember  endless meaningless side quests interminable arguments over accessing a robots hard drive characters regressing to flat onedimensional plot devices disney or jj abrams really thought the trio was the main draw of the sequel trilogy thats the only reason i can imagine for turning kylorenbensolo into a supporting player whose only purpose it to deliver clunky backstory then die and be forgotten
Apr 12 2020,negative,a disgrace this movie is incredibly dumb
Apr 12 2020,negative,disappointing finish to the most recent trilogy
Apr 12 2020,positive,thank you thank you thank you jj abrams the universe is again what it should be as the trash that was the last jedi fades from a bad memory into nothingness 
Apr 12 2020,negative,while i dont hate it as much as tlj tros is without a doubt the worst written star wars film bar none
Apr 12 2020,negative,this movie lacked heart and soul i used to really like abrams idk what happened its a bad movie and a bad sequel in a terrible trilogy it makes me so depressed when i brood about what disney johnson and abrams did to star wars 
Apr 12 2020,positive,loved it  most unique and exciting of the last three thought it was a great end to the skywalker legacy
Apr 12 2020,positive,i really dont understand why the critics hated this movie i think jj abram did the right things to make a truly star war movie instead of what he did with last jedi a good movie that please modern movie critics but departs from energy and dynamics of star wars a little bit i think people just need to chill if you dont like the movie maybe it is just that the movie is not for you  as a star war fan this is a great movie and a suitable ending for this story arc
Apr 12 2020,negative,having been a fan for 43 years and trying hard to like it this disjointed mess was the crowning achievement in laying star wars to rest by disney  the characters are two dimensional parodies its easier to pretend  this and the past 2 films didnt exist and preserve a childhood joyful memory
Apr 11 2020,negative,poor planning and writing from the first two films caused this to be the worst film in the new trilogy  its a turd  existing fans should watch it to judge for themselves but for all others it should be avoided  the plot is horrible and feels like you are watching a knock off of national treasure  the clues to track down the new threat from the empire dont make any sense  and why would the empire hide valuable military resources when they could have been used earlier  the force powers are also extremely exaggerated and several new abilities were created  the final showdown is very anticlimatic and you will laugh as rebels run across the top of star destroyers  given the length of the film you will be wishing for it to be over  they did wrap up the mystery of reys origins nicely but the journey was painful to watch
Apr 11 2020,negative,the last episode of the latest star wars trilogy was sooooooooo bad i cannot even give it one star not all the budget in the galaxy could have saved this movie i can write a trilogy about why it was so bad but lets summarize and say there was no story to tell none the movie keeps stealing from past glories which could be fine as it is the continuation from an old story but they just copypaste and it just looks like a counterfeit  copy of what this story used to be the bar scene at planet kijimi  and poes scene about an unpaid debt really  give me a break so check this movie if you are 9 years or younger plenty of kidfriendly scenesis disneys story after all the empire won
Apr 11 2020,positive,the movie was very well done after hearing all the criticism i expected less than what the movie was i get that many fans were butthurt because the story didnt go the way they wanted but get over it this was a great movie
Apr 11 2020,negative,the plot here is just incoherent jj abrams obviously had to do back flips to try and undo last jedi and ep 9 really suffers for it the room makes more sense logically i liked last jedi better and im probably in the minority ros has great looking set pieces a few good and funny moments and a few cool xwing and lightsaber fights but its a disappointment the characters in this trilogy have been ridiculously overpowered maybe in these 3 movies or in ep 9 it explains how they can just resurrect ppl via the force but i certainly couldnt tell you how based on this jumbled mess of a trilogy the worst thing is it could easily have been epic
Apr 11 2020,negative,such a bad episode i am a fan but seriously clearly could have been done better
Apr 11 2020,negative,too much story in one movie a bit silly story line especially on the revival of the emperor
Apr 11 2020,negative,the worst and cringiest ending to an amazing modern trilogy waste of 40  years of amazing character development just terrible
Apr 11 2020,negative,finally watched it online for free too much going on that its confusing and feels that it should of been a game not a movie it didnt connect well to the others episode 6 was a better end to the skywalker saga these sequelogy should of been planned better this is not the best of the skywalker saga there is no skywalker left rey isnt a skywalker and shell never be a skywalker a skywalker can be named by blood and she doesnt have the blood which means she has to marry to become a skywalker but do not say she is because she is definitely not reboot the sequelogy please
Apr 10 2020,negative,ill make it short and sweet the force is apparently broken and now you can do any and everything especially i best not give them any ideas
Apr 10 2020,negative,disappointing end to one of the greatest stories ever told this one was better than the last one just narrowly the first installment of the new trilogy skated by on nostalgia and a general thirst for new star wars unfortunately disneys acquisition proves this was all about money and pumping out as much star wars as quickly as possible with complete disregard for the property itself this and the last felt hastily written and sloppy it could just be that i grew up with vader and the original characters but i had a hard time believing or feeling like kylo or rey were so much stronger than their predecessors the original trilogy had 3 year breaks between movies both of these last two could have used at least an extra year especially after the last one had to be rewritten snoke felt like a total throw away and why they didnt take that opportunity to insert a more compelling already existing character from the expanded universe or whatever its called now is a missed opportunity it feels like snoke was being built for something else and then plans changed quickly so they killed him why rush one of the most legendary and beloved stories ever if it wasnt ready delay and rewrite people may be upset but is that worth ruining star wars over i suppose it is if youre only interested in money and could care less about ruining art i could go on and on about everything that didnt work but its easy enough to find those with a simple search they may as well have ended this by having jar jar being the mastermind behind everything studying the dark side and reemerging as darth jar jar killing everyone and flipping off the camera
Apr 10 2020,negative,such a terrible finish for the new trilogy  same old formula  a surprise real father revelation  bad guy gets redemption  rebels win  blah blah blah
Apr 10 2020,positive,never listen to the critics audience score only  excellent ending to this triology
Apr 10 2020,positive,it was entertaining
Apr 9 2020,negative,this movie took 0 risks  it utilized the original characters as background standins like a tree in a childs christmas play it introduced its main villain after 40 years in a text scroll anytime you thought someone died or sacrificed themselves they were brought back making almost every scene meaningless this by far is the worst star wars movie ever
Apr 9 2020,negative,spoilers i really felt like this film was made by someone with adhd this little review will be done the same way to honor it  those scenes in the first half went so fast with so much happening it became really hard to care at all about anything as there was no time to let anything breathe  cast chasing after a thing that doesnt really matter new supporting characters that are introduced that dont really matter either  stupid banter between finn and poe  rey continues being a mary sue  kylo ren was the best imo definite improvement to his character after tlj wish the writers were better to him  bringing back emperor palpatine  no other ideas than to bring back an old character and ruining return of the jedi  hux  pfft  overall plot absurd  constant reminder of other films though  ceasar from planet of the apes  sandworms of arrakis    oh and finn had something he wanted to tell rey  said so multiple times but never did  okay then  oh and hes force sensitive or something  maybe  hinted but went nowhere again  what was that stupid fight on horseback on top of star destoryers  force lightning that destroys entire ships sigh
Apr 9 2020,positive,i personally adore the movie despite the pacing writing choices and plot points in film but it ties everything together in a proper satisfying way to make a proper satisfying star wars finale i couldnt be more in love with this movie than ive ever been with episode 7  8 jj abrams you stick the landing
Apr 9 2020,positive,a very thrilling and fun conclusion to the sequel trilogy with some missteps along the way but still really enjoyable
Apr 9 2020,negative,if you thought the last jedi was badoh boy
Apr 9 2020,negative,this was unwatchable it took me three sittings just to finish it as i kept getting irritated by the awful acting and poor writing in this film
Apr 8 2020,positive,8610 i liked it i can see where the criticism of fan service comes from but who doesnt like a nice ending im also not a giant star wars nerd to begin with 
Apr 8 2020,positive,entertaining but not the conclusion i had hoped for after episode 7 and 8 both of which i loved pacing is kind of a mess and im not a huge fan of the palpatine stuff the bestmost redeeming part of this movie is kylo rens growth as a character as a film its okay but a bit disappointing im still hopeful for the rumored jj extended cut which might fix some of the pacing issues at least despite some of the story choices that i disagree with
Apr 8 2020,positive,best star wars fillm ever is as good as the orignal trilogy i love it it had a great ending for the saga
Apr 8 2020,negative,plot hole after plot hole that was somehow supposed to tie this whole trilogy together as generic as it gets for casual viewers 100 trivia pieces for fanatics who know the lore down to that star wars lego booklet from 1997
Apr 8 2020,negative,what should have been an epic finale to a 9part 40 year series is instead a half baked barely sensical nostalgia trip that runs out of gas far before its conclusion the screenwriters should have spent more time in the writing room and less time listening to the trolls 
Apr 8 2020,negative,absolutely deplorable
Apr 7 2020,positive,awesome ending to this saga i wish abrams would have done all three
Apr 7 2020,negative,one of the worst movies ever i guess the fault is from the last jedi since there wasnt much to do about it
Apr 7 2020,neutral,this is by far the star wars movie that has unsettled me most from all of the previous installments i consider myself a fairly big fan of star wars but this film seemed to break all of the rules set in the other movies fast paced and relentless i did not seem to have the time to enjoy moments that could have been taken advantage of in a much larger scale it is a fairly good way of ending the skywalker saga but it did not appeal to me
Apr 7 2020,positive,i really like this movie the reason why is that it felt like a star wars movie it contained the same themes weve come to expect from the original trilogy and i think thats a good thing i like the fact that it tried to undo the damage done by tlj tlj didnt feel like a star wars movie to me  it felt like the moody emo sister of a star wars movie apart from a really poor plot and overt virtuesignaling that was what was so jarring about tlj i see people complaining that this movie ruined the character arcs of tlj first apart from rey and kylo there werent any left after tlj i cared so little for the main characters in tlj that i thought id never want to see tros second ruining character arcs was tljs principal sin and trying to restore some of them was tross principal virtue   people can go two very different ways on the fan service that tros provides some say its cheap others will say it makes for an enjoyable ride im in the latter category lets assume there werent real problems with tfa and tlj this sort of allin allpresent ending movie is just the kind of movie id expect to finish off the skywalker storyline we all appreciated that about endgame probably because thats what weve come to expect from literature and movies that tieoff a big universe of plots and characters    was it the best star wars movie no did it contain some justso stories or a deus ex machina or three yes still i enjoyed it i liked seeing an end to the story of the skywalker family and its long arduous battle against the sith thats what this movie was it wasnt a story about poe finn rose and to some extent i can also say that it wasnt all about rey either thats what i wanted i wanted a skywalker movie i wouldnt expect the final installment of the harry potter franchise to be about ron or hermione nor would i want that
Apr 7 2020,negative,managed to be even worse than episode i only good thing is john williams music
Apr 7 2020,negative,easily the worst movie in the entire saga it entirely makes the last jedi unnecessary despite what the writers may think instead of spending time continuing the story from where the previous movie left the characters and developing them further this episode either ignores character arcs or outright changes them to make it worse theres no character development of any kind because the characters are constantly feeding the audience exposition in order to get to a finale that is exactly like the original trilogy finale this shouldnt be a surprise when a character is forcibly brought back only to be another characters method of redemption
Apr 7 2020,negative,there was no emotional impact the editing was shoddy and the interconnection between scenes held together roughly with duct tape there were so many plot holes involved due to trying to cover up the last jedi it was phenomenally criminaland simply put the entire skywalker saga the heart and soul of the star wars storyline and franchise was reduced to insignificant nothingness and wiped off the map a true disgrace   if you like fastpace storylines visually stunning scenes a lot of action and interesting cinematography then youre in for a treat if not dont waste your time
Apr 7 2020,positive,i thought this was a perfect end to the latest trilogy in the star wars saga full of non stop action and excitementit was a feast for the eyes as well as some heartfelt moments 
Apr 6 2020,negative,bad predictable story very poor or nonexistent character development bad guys that seem tacked on rather than central to the story good guys bad guys and seemingly unlimited resources that just appear out of nowhere surprise not a sad so called conclusion to a once great universe that really died with the release of the somehow worse ep viii such a sad sad waste
Apr 6 2020,negative,this movie feels like it was written for children where the plot moves the characters to progress the storyline instead the other way around  the logistics of the of the plot thread onm the final order makes no sense  only good thing about this movie is its oversized budget to make the movie visually appealing  the last scene of the movie kill the entire franchise
Apr 6 2020,positive,if you are expecting amazing action sequences and very good acting for a final farewell then you will be fully satisfied of this very entertaining film if you are looking to poke holes at all of the plot points then you wont enjoy the movie
Apr 6 2020,negative,the cinematic equivalent of taking a dump in your own fridge
Apr 6 2020,negative,look if you didnt want to make a star wars movie then dont make a star wars movie  theres plenty of other people who have better ideas
Apr 6 2020,negative,absolute rubbishworse trilogy so far
Apr 6 2020,negative,truly ruined george lucas legacy
Apr 6 2020,positive,a great arrangement of all the characters past present future in a combination of great action and violence
Apr 6 2020,negative,if you havent watch the original and prequel trilogy youll like it if you understand the star wars universe lore this movie broke all of it like the last jedi
Apr 5 2020,negative,i cant believe that disney dove into this trilogy without a plan tfa set up questions that still dont have answers tlj was trash and this movie is proof that they didnt have a plan going into this the pacing in this film is awful the lightsaber fights  forgettable and whatever lore and rules were left in the star wars universe utterly abandoned i remember when this universe had rules and i miss those days spoilers from here on out the plot of this movie was so convoluted and confusing it seems that the characters only progress because of luck too much stuff is in this movie for the 16 hour period of time and half of it is unnecessary why is lando in this movie why is poes power ranger girlfriend in this movie why is jannah in this movie these people are unneeded they clog up time that could be spent on fixing the pacing and answering questions so palpatine has returned in this movie with basically no explanation other than the dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilities some may consider to be unnatural palpatines return is a huge slap in the face to everyone who ever cared about star wars prequel fans and ot fans alike it was anakinsvaders destiny to throw palpatine down that bottomless pit and then the death star exploded with palpatine in it bringing him back ruins literally everything in those six movies anakin was supposed to be the chosen one and that was mentioned over and over in the prequels and the clone wars now its all pointless  and guess how palps is defeated rey deflects lightning into his face how are we supposed to believe hes dead when he survived all the previous things in all the other movies i was actually fine with this movie in the beginning even though the poe and finn in the falcon chase was utterly pointless because the movie wanted some action the point where the movie really went downhill was when lando showed up for no reason and disappeared and then the stormtroopers flew and we heard they fly now  why are they surprised c3po has seen a ton of stuff and finn used to be a stormtrooper for crying out loud they should know that jet packs exist for some reason our heroes fall into quicksand and fall into a cave beneath is that how gravity works now the moment that destroyed all the rules was when rey force healed the snakeworm it makes the movie feel like theres no stakes because the force can magically heal people now and resurrect them too as seen later heck in the phantom menace quigon died why didnt obiwan just force heal him and i dont understand why rey thought it was safe to attempt to heal it then it makes the way out of the quicksand for some reason rey goes into the desert and stands out there theres no reason for her to do this then kylo charges at her with his tie fightersilencer ship if he wants to kill her he should use his guns if he doesnt want to kill her then he shouldnt ram his tie fighter into her what is character motivation rey does an impossible flip and destroys his ship it explodes and tumbled and boy thats an explosion but both kylo ren and the ship both survive you heard me correctly kylo doesnt have a scratch but you could say the force but the ship was literally blown up on screen and you see it perfectly together later in the movie they destroy it on screen and then forget and its the same ship not a similar one because it has the way finder in it wth it looks like rey kills chewie but he doesnt die then later the gang gets on ochis ship which still works somehow to see the merchandise and the power ranger c3pos memory gets wiped but then is fine by the end of the movie because r2 had a replacement it feels like nobody is in danger there are so many stupid things in this movie the death star was completely annihilated in rotj but somehow there are still remains of it kylos helmet was completely destroyed in tlj but is easily fixed in this movie rey sails across a rough ocean and doesnt die finn says that he has something to tell rey but he never tells her hux is the spy but the motivation makes no sense luke acts like tlj never happened leias dialogue feels weird because shes dead and then when she dies in this movie its so strange they should have killed her last movie when rey and kylo finally team up against palpatine kylo has a blaster but then it magically disappears because this movie doesnt have an ounce of consistency the finale rips off endgame and you are left wondering why the bad guys dont just tilt the ships and how lando got so much backup palpatine doesnt say anything cool except quote prequel lines rey defeats him easily why should we care shes way more powerful than everyone she is literally shown levitating in this movie when she dies kylo revives her and then they kiss their relationship in these movies is so toxic and awful and everyone groaned then he dies he shouldve lived and rey shouldve died and the entire world wouldve been happier with that ending at the end rey buries anakins lightsaber in sand she calls herself rey skywalker and literally anything else wouldve been better so in conclusion what the hell i suppose this is slightly better than tlj but wow this movie is bad and a huge insult to fans 
Apr 5 2020,positive,because of my low expectations i was entertained the star wars universe is so absorbing after all but the return of the emperor etc that was such a bummer such lack of creativity they couldve made a better ending
Apr 5 2020,negative,great visuals without integrity a lot of things should not happen in the movie
Apr 5 2020,negative,lacked all the nuance of star wars
Apr 5 2020,negative,a few cool effects wrapped around a flat story and characters who exist solely as collections of quips
Apr 5 2020,positive,a perfect ending to the skywalker saga i absolutely loved it
Apr 5 2020,positive,in the previous movies scenes lingered and deepened so actors could work with what was happening and you could become part of the story this one skipped between scenes too much the ending also really bothered me what happened to a commemoration or a story telling of what happened at the end he was the partner significant character what happened to his essence where was the chat with luke han leia and ben etc it feels quite deflating finn also the previous movies really allowed the actor to shine he had little to work with and that was disappointing
Apr 4 2020,negative,well the production is done well but all the takebacks of the star wars galaxy is intelligence insulting oof terrible story does too much takingback and creating its own rules which is trust shattering to really be a respectable addition to the series when it couldve continued exploring and expanding the series while honoring whats been already established smh
Apr 4 2020,positive,this was a great movie great story great cast great sets and great action sequences the best of the newest 3 for sure it was nice to see the great nostalgic moments as well well executed
Apr 4 2020,negative,well as a star wars film this was awful nothing as bad as the last jedi but nothing as good as the last jedi a preety forgetable movie
Apr 4 2020,negative,i expected a lot more from a star wars movie  thoroughly disappointed waste of money as far as far as im concerned
Apr 4 2020,negative,very boring what a waste of time so predictable
Apr 4 2020,positive,bloody awesome had a bit of everything going for it
Apr 4 2020,positive,awesome so much better than the last one
Apr 4 2020,positive,jedi is obsoleted please bring yuuzhan vong in bring thrawn back 
Apr 4 2020,negative,the entire movie felt rushed with no clear idea of where it was going its definitely not worth buying this is the only time where it feels good knowing this was the last movie and no more garbage is to come
Apr 4 2020,negative,terrible steaming horse shit has more appeal
Apr 4 2020,positive,after the dumpster fire that was the last jedi i had little hope for this movie  its hard to maintain any tension in a trilogy when you kill off your primary antagonist in the second movie  so needless to say i was expecting this movie to be epicly bad  i was wrong  i knew that in order to salvage this franchise some mental gymnastics was in order and digging up a long dead character was it  it was my only complaint but to be honest i couldnt have thought of anything that would have done better  the tension was high and i even thought the good guys might lose  i have never been so glad to be wrong
Apr 4 2020,positive,the rise of skywalker had a lot of weight on its shoulders other than having to clean up the mess that was the last jedi the movie was pretty good for what it was it was a good fan service for all superfans of star wars but my biggest issue is i left wanting more out of the franchise i struggled with the fact that this movie ended a legendary series it was good but it wasnt enough
Apr 4 2020,negative,sooooooo bad just so bad it was bad enough to make me like the original series less
Apr 3 2020,positive,decent ending to a terrible trilogy
Apr 3 2020,negative,my god i dont even know where to start this movie is basically jj abrams having a petty fight with rian johnson this entire trilogy is just pathetic this movie is clearly the worst of the trilogy at least with last jedi it had a theme it wasnt all over the place and it had a vision it knew what it wanted to be it was just executed poorly the same cant be said for tros its just bland and an absolute mess
Apr 3 2020,positive,best sw of the last six cohesive enough to be enjoyed beautifully filmed and nicely acted even adam driver seems finally at ease as kylo ren
Apr 3 2020,neutral,weird somewhat cool totally unhinged
Apr 3 2020,negative,incredible special effects and amazing casting and set design worst plot ever the more you think about it the less it makes sense so far behind lucas original best to start with a 3 story treatment and  a narrative arc
Apr 3 2020,positive,i thought the final film as of now in the star wars saga was really good i thought they tied everything together really well i was surprised when i saw that they brought darth sidious and lando back i really liked the final scene when rey visited lukes childhood home from the original it was really nostalgic
Apr 3 2020,positive,the movie is not bad but not great either for a star wars film when compared to its predecessors and for a story to end a saga it is actually quite a let down
Apr 3 2020,negative,this was such a disappointing movie to me i grew up watch star wars while the fight scenes were awesome the story was garbage
Apr 3 2020,negative,that is absolutely the worst star wars film out of all 9
Apr 3 2020,positive,we need a perfect ending like endgame
Apr 3 2020,negative,this final chapter is like running over a kids beloved dog and then thinking you can make up for it by giving them an ice cream
Apr 3 2020,positive,jj did his best with what he was given thanks to tlj
Apr 3 2020,positive,not sure why the ratings are low it was a very good movie worth watching action was great acting was awesome
Apr 3 2020,positive,much better than i thought i find peace 
Apr 3 2020,negative,7 8 and 9 are an insult to everything that george lucas did 8 for example is being taught in film schools as an example of what not to do when making a film the plot of the three films is radically inconsistent
Apr 2 2020,negative,was this movie made in a huge hurry did they not have time to work out the script and dialogue so that everything people say doesnt sound stupid and how did the actors all downgrade in their acting abilities  this conclusive episode is such an incredible disappointment and it really feels like they just made a cheap story just because they knew theyre going to make buckets of money off of the movie and franchise regardless of how it turns out
Apr 2 2020,positive,a fun entry into the star wars universe
Apr 2 2020,positive,the movie should have been called star wars the rise of the dead dead characters keep coming back until skywalker is omnipotent i enjoyed the special effects and the action scenes
Apr 2 2020,negative,just one of the weakest star wars movies ever they could have had a way better plot then the one they came up with mostly i just feel no one tried their hardest definitely worse than cats that came out the same day at least that movie tried
Apr 2 2020,negative,the third instalment was always going to have a tough time i was hoping that they would have learned from their mistakes but i guess not turn your brain off and just get through it
Apr 2 2020,negative,whiskey tango foxtrot  they should have fired the screenwriters actually they should have made them pay for the cost of the entire production i want my money back
Apr 2 2020,negative,terrible unfortunately they tried desperately to fix what they screwed up with the last jedi im doing so they rushed to undo the sins of the past and instead it became a jumbled mess so disappointing more than anything it seemed like nothing was thought out no ideas were allowed to naturally unfold and characters made such unrealistic decisions gestures and conversations with other characters it was almost too corny even for a star wars film 
Apr 2 2020,negative,it was obvious the last 3 films werent written together as a trilogy i will not be watching anything from abrams kennedy or johnson and i hope they dont touch anymore beloved franchises  how ridiculously written that the emperor can strike down a whole fleet with just his powers  yoda is one of the strongest jedis and there is no way he can do anything close to what the emperor did in the rise of skywalker  the move felt too rushed and the force was not treated like anything close to the previous movies  too bad too since the actors and actresses did a good job for what they were given the directors and the screenwriting however were just so poor in understanding a big franchise  one wonders why disney picked these people anyone else even a new director probably could have done better
Apr 2 2020,positive,loved it saw it 3 times in the theater and forced myself to wait for the bluray so much better than tlj so relieved thanks jj wrapped up the saga very well even if many details went unexplained due to time constraints i would have preferred a longer movie or parts 1 and 2 but am very happy to have another sw movie to enjoy
Apr 1 2020,negative,im a big star wars fan ever since i was a kid and this movie just discredit the other films and it didnt make sense compared to the other films yes it had good action scenes but this was a forgettable movie
Apr 1 2020,negative,very disappointed  all the writing production quality actors trying to put 100 into a script that may have been okay for a b class movie at best that is all i can say took a great franchise with a huge fan base and ended an epic adventure that spanned decades with a  meh
Apr 1 2020,positive,this is in no way a perfect movie its also not a perfect star wars movie however this movie is way better than the last jedi the last jedi was an absolute disgrace made by a man who had zero respect for the original movies  anyway the rise of skywalker is a fun movie that wraps up the saga in a mostly satisfying way
Apr 1 2020,positive,the movie was amazing couldve been better but it was amazing
Apr 1 2020,positive,while it wouldve been extremely hard to be a worse movie than the last jedi this didnt do much to get me excited the lightsaber combat especially was lackluster they moved slow and with big movements i understand them doing that for episode 7 but they have supposedly been training and still rey and kylo suck at fighting the story in general was unimpressive and palpatine was only there to get people to spend money at the theater ive been a life long fan of star wars and it has pained me to see disney ruin it so completely
Mar 31 2020,negative,awfull terrible total waste of my time
Mar 31 2020,positive,very bland i found myself bored throughout the film trying to appease old star wars fans had its cool moments and nice visuals but in the end lacks a lot in my opinion the finale was entertaining and the only memorable moment altough it made me scratch my head in confusion because of the characters relation and interaction
Mar 31 2020,negative,script sucked what a disgrace to the star wars name
Mar 31 2020,negative,they were horrible even if i buy into that hans is killed by his son ok but mom who has the same powers as luke never feels what is going on inside her son  nor does his uncle luke has no credibility if we consider luke is the last jedi standing we would see as yoda did a progression of a prodigy to pass the torch or knowledge to instead we see an angry hobo  as my friend in england called him   just evaporate into dust again he does not appear even as a specter as his mentors did again not connecting the story lines he should have taken her light saber and shown his that should have had the sentinel yellow light it was not there the writes failed to make a connection of transference of power training  teaching of jedi philosophy to this new jedi a pissed off  scared sky walker just turns to dust suggest that the light was and is weaker than the darkness therefore the light is lost already that evil has more ways to with than the enlightened good just again loses contact look if you are trying to rip off the bile dont forget jesus made it clear just using his name of his fathers immediately cause the demons to be cast out and the light overwhelms and burns out the darkness so what are we left with hans is killed by his son mom and brother do  not feel how screwed up the kid is and he runs off to be a villain and somehow while dying gets his mothers soul which she could have shared with him while she was alive had she  trained studies or even worked with her brother to understand and master the powers she allegedly was born with to say bad dissapointed poor story telling  total garbage to this great saga is an  understatement
Mar 31 2020,negative,spoiler alert  the worst scenario ever everyone is happy almost nobody died and they even kissed each other even though the most powerful fleet consisted from maybe tousand destroyers was against some stuck of bad fighters
Mar 31 2020,negative,i felt that the writers and directors were not sure where to go with this story or the characters and so we got a over the top story ending and some boring character interactions  sadly i think that a lot of films end up like this with a lot at stake big budget and too many cooks in the kitchen
Mar 31 2020,positive,really great ending to the franchise
Mar 30 2020,positive,so the rey trilogy comes to an end fortunately we had some sparks from the nostalgic essence brought by george lucas first trilogy with the iconic characters such as luke han solo and our favorite droids but never fulfilled the rise of skywalker lacks a deeper unique story which mostly makes us feel like if we were watching the last jedi remake with a weird twist involving the new characters the special effects obviously have improved through the years making this movie visually richer but having that in mind this should make a world of difference for the producers story by making fans dive into a more original star wars movie
Mar 30 2020,negative,what can you say saw the original movies as a kid and they were great now its come down to this sw8 was terrible only watched this because my friend bought it for some reason and let me borrow it same continued stupid plot as 8 not going to discuss most of the plot but really the plot involving palpatine really i wont give this a 1 just to be a debbie downer good special effect and most of the actors hold the line its just the plot thats so far fetched that im surprised vader didnt show to kill everybody to save us all from any future movies of this franchise
Mar 30 2020,positive,honestly i thought i was very good more coherent than a lot of people say i liked how it corrected a lot of the rian johnson retcons i cant see why it has so many haters    the only issue i have with it is that its a star wars movie and its really all based in low altitude  lol
Mar 29 2020,positive,i enjoyed it both times i went to see it
Mar 29 2020,negative,i would give it zero stars if i could
Mar 29 2020,negative,holy fucking crap that was awful
Mar 29 2020,negative,worse than the last jedi the only reason that this gets a review is because of mark hamill
Mar 29 2020,neutral,disappointing movie i expected something better for the conclusion of this saga
Mar 29 2020,negative,i would say the movie is garbage but that would be too kind  it is aggressively nonsensical as if it were an experiment in how much preposterous bs could be shown in a theater before audiences rioted
Mar 29 2020,neutral,no amount of special effects can hide the fact that this is a retelling of return of the jedi with some empire strikes back thrown in for good measure its just not that original the story goes at such a fast pace with so much fullon action that you dont really get a chance to settle into the film if you are a star wars fan you will watch it and enjoy it but its no classic which would stand up on its own merit
Mar 29 2020,positive,as a stand alone film it isnt bad unfortunately it isnt really a stand alone film its the end of saga and sadly i dont know if anyone could have ended in a manner befitting the franchises impact on cinema nothing about it is bad but then again nothing about it is really all that stellar it makes the prequel nearly irrelevant
Mar 28 2020,positive,this movie was filled with nuggets of everything we love about this saga  rey was badass full of heart and her battles with kylo ren epic
Mar 28 2020,positive,rey is a shining example to young women everywhere to be the hero of your own story and not the side piece to somebody elses loved her and this trilogy
Mar 28 2020,negative,simply awful just like previous two one of the worst trilogies around
Mar 28 2020,positive,this is exactly the kind of movie that makes me wonder why anyone would listen to critics  awesome movie this coming from a lifetime born in 77 yeah same year massive fan  seems like these critics are so stuffed full of themselves that they cant appreciate a good star wars movie
Mar 28 2020,positive,action packed a great close to the skywalker saga and much better than some rather pedantic fans are saying  looking forward very much to the next saga
Mar 28 2020,positive,lazy storyline it was essentially a remake of return of the jedi  the visual effects were cool lame ending too
Mar 28 2020,negative,this movie was a complete pile of garbage disney has done a horrible job managing these new star wars films when they purchased star wars from george lucas star wars was like a goose capable of laying golden eggs if they had managed this film series correctly they would be putting out golden eggs for movies instead they killed the goose and are putting out crap like this film and the last jedi which has driven most of the fans away
Mar 28 2020,negative,there was ofc lots of horrible acting but that was no surprise a disappointment as a movie but also no surprise was all the throw backs it included it tried to sum up so much it crumpled under the weight i felt the rise of skywalker tried too hard to please everybody and thus ended up pleasing nobody well some idiots lol  the entire new series was not only made up of little original material but what was original was very predictable and practically painful to watch
Mar 28 2020,negative,what a wasted opportunity fanfic could do much better
Mar 28 2020,neutral,you know if you want a story just shy of the justice league movie on plot character development and overall direction with enough overdone effects work to surpass every star wars franchise combined then this is your movie overblown on its own ego so happy this saga is over
Mar 28 2020,negative,wasnt even funny bad just cringy bad
Mar 28 2020,negative,the story looked like a trainwreck  guess the good part is it finally over with
Mar 28 2020,positive,as a star wars fan i am excited to see the skywalker storyline come to an end and look forward to new adventures in the future
Mar 27 2020,negative,i had read the reviews and articles and decided not to go see this movie when it came out just finished watching this and wow just simply wow  not being versed as a screenwriter director producer or any of the hundreds of occupations needed to make this kind of movie i am honestly amazed at how something this bad got made as the final star wars movie of the whole saga  nothing makes sense in this movie the motives the arc the dialog the plotdevices none of it works   the only redeming things for me were the set designs and the sith throne room  this was a two hours and a half wasted
Mar 27 2020,positive,i liked but i would like to see the jj abrams cut of the film
Mar 27 2020,negative,this movie was poorly made and it shows it adds so much to the trilogy trying to smash everything into one movie which results in the jarringly fast pacing this feels like jj abrams just undid everything rian johnson did in the last jedi and then just remade the entire last two movies of the trilogy this is honestly more like a video game campaign story then a movie the reveal of palpatine being alive is so forced and so sudden the plot points are forced and the final battle is just a direct copy of avengers endgame i really feel like rose tico and finn were wasted characters and poe just turned into an asshole for some reason i did really like that scene when han solo confronts ben that was honestly beautiful i also liked babu frik an insane amount but besides that this movie is so dissapointing
Mar 27 2020,negative,rushed unfinished and with little if any thought behind the script
Mar 27 2020,negative,the worst star wars that they could produce no consistency no plot no suspense meaningless dialogue and pointless scenes it makes the prequels look descent
Mar 27 2020,positive,im one of the few that enjoyed the curve ball rian johnson threw with the last jedi although it would have been nice to see jj abrams make the occasional bold move in the rise of skywalker he unstitches and resews plot points from the predecessor the pacing in the first act feels rushed and could possibly be an entry in to the saga on its own however it serves as a perfect ending for the disney trilogy
Mar 27 2020,positive,the fact that insidious has a higher rating than this star wars movie tells you everything you need to know about how reviews often reflect peoples expectations more than the actual quality of a movie this addition to the franchise is decent and entertaining as one would expect from jj abrams that it is rated lower than one of the worst movies ever made  insidious  is beyond me but clearly reflected in the difference between the audience score and the reviewer score i would consider the audience rating when deciding whether to see this or not
Mar 27 2020,positive,so having finally gotten round to reviewing this it has gone down dramatically in score since first walking out of the cinema while as a single standalone star wars movie i would easily give it four maybe even four and a half stars after seeing it again and judging it against the rest of the sequal trilogy it has dipped substantially it is still a very enjoyable very well acted and made film with incredible action sequences and an uplifting ending however it is a jumbled mess of a movie trying to please the ones pissed off by its admittedly better predecessor tlj the worst of the three sequals just from a lack of wasted potential trying to damage control and shoehorn in as many cheep nostalgia references as possible to hide the disservice it does to any character that isnt rey or kylo but after all of the negativity props to the incredible performances of both daisy ridley and adam driver and for making it an overall sti fun movie
Mar 27 2020,negative,as far as a plot and script goes it feels like i was watching something a film student put together on the last sunday evening of the semester after spending the rest of the school year on a bender i didnt have enough time to get it done abrams essentially transformed all the efforts accomplishments and sacrifices of the previous films characters into an abyss of null and void they died and sacrificed for nothing watch my movie those were a waste of your time says jj if this was anything other than a star wars movie i would have walked out on it about half way through i really wish i never walked in on it special effects were great it shows how the craft has matured over the years thats it blown opportunities for character development arc or making a logical movie too much fanboy ingratiation while still leaving loose ends unfinished what a shame ive been a star wars fan since the 70s and have endured mostly subpar movies but i keep coming back because its a great universe of possibilities but for some reason no one has been able to get it right since the 80s this latest trilogy started without originality then it was blamed for becoming too original by all the fanboys now it fights to get back to mediocrity and recycling old sw nostalgia but settles on the absurd this is the worst star wars movie ever and i didnt like any of the green screen prequels but would gladly watch the phantom menace over this any day i might even watch the holiday special before watching this again i feel like i need to apologize to george lucas for saying anything bad about the prequels because they look like masterpieces compared to what this latest trilogy became the force wakes up was forgiven for being unoriginal but we were glad to have sw back last jedi was going in a new direction and that was ok as long as they could pull it all together there were still major problems with it but i was willing to go along if they could fit it into the arc of sw but no jj had to try to hit the reset button and work as a customer service rep trying to make the fanboys all happy by addressing every complaint right down to chewbacca getting his longdeserved medal which is beyond stupid our moans during the movie turned into laughter at the embarrassment of this steaming pile by the end why cant we get a good writerdirector for this franchise it will be the first sw movie i wont have in my personal collection
Mar 27 2020,negative,the fact that thus film has the audience score that it does is proof that society has absolutely no standards when it comes to entertainment   this film was flaming hot garbage a failed attempt at nostalgia and was as empty units storytelling as it was intellectually this film felt like a half baked mess that simply included throwbacks to the original trilogy simply for the sake of winning older fans over in the hopes that they would oversee how vapid the entire experience was   there is absolutely nothing memorable about the characters plot story mechanics or even the visuals it felt more like a desperate attempt to recapture return of the jedi than its own individual and unique film instead it caters to the low hanging fruit  if you enjoyed this then i can only assume your a simpleton and an idiot with the iq of an average houseplant yes youre entitled to your opinion but your opinion is wrong
Mar 26 2020,negative,twas brillig and the slithy toves is how begins a poem that makes more sense that this saga finale scenes are not setup and you are thrown around different destinations action and plot points causing massive confusion from the very beginning and in such a way you lose interest quickly and just want this to be over
Mar 26 2020,neutral,wow the more i think about this film the more i realize how horrible it actually was the more i think about this film the more i appreciate the last jedi when i originally went into this movie i had very low expectations because of the reviews i saw but after i had seen it for myself i was pretty impressed with that to say it has now been about three months since ive seen this movie and ive had time to digest it some more and i can confirm that my opinions about it have definitely changed sure there were a moments in there that were a nice nod to diehard fans but in all honesty those were the only good parts this movie was rushed and completely meant to retcon the events of the last jedi the character arcs were sloppy with the acception of ben solo the storyline was not well thought out a lot of characters and things were just crammed in there and we didnt have any context about them or have time to get any context about them i really could go on and on with the flaws of this movie but this review would be much longer i grew up having star wars be my 1 most favorite movie franchise but after this disaster of a trilogy that disney botched so horribly and ruined for a lot of diehard fans it no longer is im going to have to give that honor to the mcu considering their worst movie out of 23 of them was one that really wasnt all that bad thor the dark world honestly if you ask me i dont think it was that hard to develop a successful trilogy and a good conclusion to the legendary skywalker saga disney has done a tremendous job on movies in the past as everyone obviously knows theyve even created a theme park after their movies and i feel like with this trilogy they had one job just one job and they couldnt even get that right i guess well have to wait for the mandalorian or future star wars movies to do the trick although it didnt end how i wanted it to i do have to give credit to this franchise for basically being my entire childhood so star wars thank you for the memories weve had a lot of highs and lows but mostly highs and for that i am very grateful
Mar 26 2020,negative,spoilers this movie is a prime example of disney ruining everything they buy the rights to this movie makes no sense logically as a movie in general its too rushed and throws everything at your face in order to cram the crummy characters plot lines into the movie emperor palpatine felt thrown in because they killed off snoke in a stupid way in episode 8 rey being a descendant of palpatine was a decent twist but felt as if the writers just thought of it while writing the script of episode 9 because they didnt know in the last 2 movies as a star wars movie it is obvious that george lucas had  nothing to do with this movie it makes no sense in the star wars universe at all george lucas vision for his movies have been thrown in disneys trash can and i along with many others hate to see it i was optimistic with episode 7 which gave this disney trilogy a lot of potential but this movie along with episode 8 made me disregard disneys star wars movies as canon if you want to watch star wars watch episodes 16
Mar 26 2020,positive,im still wondering about some plot holes otherwise it was a fun watch
Mar 26 2020,negative,laughably bad who approved the script jeez absolutely terrible fan theories written by middle school kids could have been better
Mar 26 2020,positive,hilariously bad but also boring and everything was dumb so so dumb frustratingly dumb written terribly pacing is jarring the tone is wrong the comedy is cringe and the dialogue is awful also the stupid callbacks and unsubtle winks were lame graphics ranged from decent to outdated videogame the tension was manufactured and the characters were inconsistent palpy was enjoyable of course until he went out like a sucker it all lead up to a disappointing climax
Mar 26 2020,positive,repeat viewings definitely helped me appreciate this movie more  i loved force awakens and remember seeing last jedi and wondering why i didnt latch onto it  waiting two years to see luke pitch the lightsaber over the edge was a real letdown  this movie definitely tries to fix a lot of plot points i didnt care for in jedi  as a few reviews probably mentionthis would have worked better as two films  however if you dont think too hard about the logic of the story and sit back to enjoyits definitely a fun time  a lot of people my age who grew up with the original trilogy i was born in 77 give this round of movies a hard time  it wont ruin your childhoodand yeah its pretty clear disney didnt have a set game plan or one from  awakens to jedi but it comes to a close with some great effects and crowd pleasing battles  their are some obvious throw backs to keep viewers of the older films entertained and more than a few plot points you may pick apart  however if you want to sit back and see the new trilogy come to a decent closei think its done in a more than partially entertaining way  a fun timewish theyd do another one but we have mandalorian in the meantime
Mar 25 2020,negative,this sucked because it was just fanservice none of it made sense
Mar 25 2020,negative,this is terrible i am very sorry that disney ruined this story
Mar 25 2020,positive,this is definitely the best movie of the sequel trilogy i love this movie a lot i know that some of the critics arent a fan of this but i really do enjoyed this movie this movie helped me like the sequel trilogy even more i really like the story to this movie the main issue with this movie is that every star destroyer is a death star and that theres thousands of them which didnt make sense as much
Mar 25 2020,negative,terribly disjointed tons of contradiction with itself and the two previous films nice special effects but still garbage
Mar 25 2020,negative,star wars the rise of skywalker tries to please all sides of a divided fanbase but fails miserably at pleasing anyone its existence also begs the question of whether the sequel trilogy was needed at all
Mar 25 2020,positive,so star wars the rise of skywalker is here and everyone is hating on it but why well the movie does have its problems the story is messy and there are quite a few things to question while there are bad things there are also good things i personally thought the last jedi was okay but not great i think haters of the last jedi will probably enjoy this movie but last jedi lovers will hate this movie this conclusion to the skywalker saga may not be too satisfying but it is enjoyable final verdict 610
Mar 25 2020,negative,the last jedi well at least i hold the title of being the worst star wars film ever rise of skywalker hold my blue milk
Mar 25 2020,negative,it felt like the movie was going super fast one scene there at the base and then the next their flying in the millennium falconi dont see the point of even have rose tico as a character at all if you are going to give her such a small part in this film but giver her such a big part in the last movie
Mar 25 2020,negative,after this and the last one from the star wars saga i think the phantom menace has serious competition for the worst part în a movie franchise and dear disney even if you probably are the biggest player în movie industry you can t match the imagination and vision of lucastar wars is not for youfor me star wars ended before you made the new trilogy
Mar 25 2020,positive,my all time favorite star wars film ever
Mar 25 2020,negative,if it isnt destroying what the last jedi built up it is destroying star wars lore in general nothing makes sense nothing works and it could have worked but it was a fanfic of disaster
Mar 25 2020,negative,what a load of stinky cheese this movie is better suited for 58 year olds bad story bad fight choreography just overall mediocrity the only thing it had going for the movie was that it was kind of pretty special effects and some scenery what at your own peril
Mar 24 2020,negative,you expect way more for the last chapter of the prominent star wars but you end up with a bad written scenario a rushed one where apparently abrams is just doing his job it was a huge deception
Mar 24 2020,negative,was difficult to find something i didnt hate in every 5 minute block
Mar 24 2020,negative,very week story structure which doesnt even recognize the events of the mess the the last jedi was no consistency whatsoever with the story changing what we knew about the original trilogy with rey being the strongest jedi ever even though she trained mostly alone with godly powers the other main characters were almost useless and the villain made no sense wiping anakins sacrifice in the return of the jedi if you only watch this trilogy and didnt really care about thinking about what is happening it probably wont bother you that much and you will be able to enjoy the movie but for sw fans it is just a disappointment to resume from 1 to 10 story 3 a real mess the force is magic sent by god to the only person in the entire universe capable of healing deadly wounds even kylo ren died for saving rey side characters being there or not wouldnt change anything since palpatine could destroy everything with his lightning powers and rey for some reason was able to reflect it even though god damn darth vader died from it in order to kill palpatine which should be dead anyway visuals 9 only good part characters 2 dont know almost anything about them and what we know happens offscreen and we just have to accept that the 3 main characters are best friends just because  as a standalone movie for casual movie goers 6 its not a bad time for fans and as a part of not only a trilogy but a also a 9 movie story 2 its bad prequels were bad but at least the story was consistent the sequels and the rise of skywalker are just a mess
Mar 24 2020,positive,a very good end to the saga
Mar 24 2020,positive,good but the got the name of the pathfinder thingie got wrong its name is suppose to be a holocron
Mar 24 2020,negative,the worst ending possible for a great movie franchise this and endgame are both splitting images of each other and both of them suck
Mar 24 2020,negative,not only the worst star wars movie but quite possibly the worst movie i have ever seen the plot comes from nowhere in no way is there any link to the previous films in the trilogy and then the plot goes nowhere as well every reveal is hollow and evidently just aiming to tug at the low hanging balls of nostalgia bloated fan service mess than just isnt star wars
Mar 24 2020,positive,most enjoyable star wars movie from start to finish made for me rey saying she is a skywalker at the end was cringe but easy the most fun ive had with any of the star wars movies
Mar 24 2020,negative,this movie proved to me that the sequel trilogy is vastly inferior to the legends continuity because at least legends didnt betray their original source material
Mar 24 2020,negative,very very shallow good for kids small kids
Mar 24 2020,positive,while this movie was in no way perfect i felt it did everything it needed to perfectly  while im sure it had its share of plot holes it really did a great job of closing up some of the more serious holes created by the previous film and if youve made it this far in the franchise i think you owe it to yourself to give this one a watch  you never know till you try and this one made me a believer again
Mar 24 2020,positive,dispite the length this felt like the absolute shortest star wars film ive ever watched too much nostalgic moments and not enough of progression i guess the star wars weve come to know and love has been hashed way too much i look forward to a totally new direction
Mar 24 2020,positive,surprisingly star wars episode 9 the rise of skywalker ties up many loose ends and kind of repairs the sloppy horrible everything done by director rian johnson star wars 9 actually left me somewhat satisfied with the saga i hated star wars 8 very much i mean really hated it star wars 7 had several problems too but alas 9 actually left me not hating the series so much i wont give anything away but if you saw 8 and pretty muchhated everything star wars after seeing that pile of crap converted to film then you may actually be somewhat happy to see this film ill just leave it at that star wars 9 is worth seeing
Mar 24 2020,negative,stuped it was a waste of time it lacks everything that a star war movie should have
Mar 23 2020,positive,this movie is amazing
Mar 23 2020,negative,i guess new star wars films are not for me or maybe they are objectively boring
Mar 23 2020,neutral,star wars the rise of skywalker suffers from a frustrating lack of imagination but concludes this beloved saga with fanfocused devotion
Mar 23 2020,negative,man this was bad the worst of them all not even disappointed anymore it was expected
Mar 23 2020,positive,feels a bit rushed at points but is overall awesome
Mar 23 2020,positive,a satisfying thrilling and very exciting conclusion to a beloved saga not sure what else could have been done that would keep people happy its like when the last jedi came out loads of people whined about it so much and so its obvious that jj abrams tried you counteract that then he gets slayed for pandering to fans nostalgia we are truly living in a world where people just love to complain just enjoy the movie or dont  everyone these days thinks theyre a movie critic
Mar 23 2020,negative,well if it was a b series movie with plenty of money it should be great but all show inside has no sens in the saga look like a quick made movies with no scenario and so many insconstancy with the rest of the saga and the rules of the force and star wars universes not seing it keep the magic intact seing it makes you vomit i hope that disney never do such a disaster again
Mar 23 2020,negative,just one contrived sappy scene after another terribly predictable every seen feels telegraphed and forced
Mar 23 2020,negative,there was talk of fixing the damage tlj did to lukes character  instead we got a 2 mins in a cameo scene  this was not even a movie  just characters chasing mcguffins that lead to next mcguffin that finally leads to palpatine for last half hour  the ending was as bad as it gets tlj did more disrespect to star warsbut this was a way worse film star wars is permanently damaged
Mar 23 2020,negative,due to the lack of popper build ups the payoffs completely fall on their face rendering the entire thing emotionless  the plot is just a macguffin to find a macguffin to kill an evil guy that has no reason to even exist additionally many of the plot elements are just contrived often to no benefit  at least the trilogy is over
Mar 23 2020,negative,another garbage disney twist 
Mar 23 2020,positive,the better movie of the trilogy sure it was the same old formula and the twists were obvious but at least its over beyond that the cinematography and score were beautiful the acting  dialogue were much improved as well
Mar 23 2020,positive,entertaining but cheesy at times too many hinted at love triangles that wouldve been better left out 
Mar 23 2020,positive,possibly a bit too fast paced but an excellent conclusion honestly it has to have been hell trying to correct the massive blunder which was the last jedi
Mar 22 2020,negative,while the quality and graphics of this movie are spectacular the story not only falls flat to make you feel something but rather destroys itself even if you judge this movie as a stand alone you can find yourself pointing out so many issues on how the story progresses the movie fails in all fronts except design and graphical visuals every character action will leave you feeling annoyed or bored
Mar 22 2020,negative,the only interesting things in the movie are the vissual effects and the last battle
Mar 22 2020,negative,i truly hope the skywalker saga is dead this was the worst of the 3 after e6 its time to focus on stand alones or slightly overlapped stories
Mar 22 2020,negative,its not even a movie its a string of cliches
Mar 22 2020,negative,see i knew this would happen last jedi messed around with the formula so much that following in from it was never gonna be anything but a muddled mess r2d2 was massively underused and i think thats an embarrassment c3po got his moment s to shine finally though so happy for that the new characters i still dont care about at all classy way to deal with carrie fisher passing all in all daisy ridley is great but rey is still mostly boring and badly written and the emperor what on earth was all that about all in all im severely non shocked by how the movie turned out but still sad
Mar 22 2020,positive,this movie is over hated on sure some moments are a little bad the first act of the movie has a lot of pacing issues and it would have been better as a three hour cut despite the problems this is my favorite star wars movie  spoilers bringing palpatine back felt weird at first but it makes sense having him as the big bad the reylo kiss felt awkward and unnecessarily added the battle above exegol felt very epic
Mar 22 2020,negative,a result of a movie where at least half of it nothing important happened last jedi this movie felt rushed and stuffed full off scenes where no one plot point flowed into the next nevermind all the bits of the movie that were done for the sake of a twist or to be cinematic im generally good at enjoying even a movie thats been panned ignoring plots holes at times as well as hamhanded trope inclusion but this had me checking my watch several times we all know episodes viiix were created more to make money than to tell a story but last jedi and rise of skywalker made it obvious past the point of enjoyment
Mar 22 2020,positive,its not perfect but it definitely corrects some blunders made by the previous installment
Mar 22 2020,positive,my favourite movie of the skywalker saga visual effects were awesome nostalgia was incredible acting was great the end was beautiful in episode 1 anakin said that the problem with the galaxy is that no one helps each other here we saw that the galaxy finally fought together to defeat the evil beautiful movie
Mar 22 2020,positive,disney really dug their claws into this movie big decisions were made for no real reason other than to shock the audience star wars has changed so much over the years its unnerving reys character growth was stunted by her origin reveal while other characters were either reduced to minor roles or narratively ignored it was all flash and no bang
Mar 22 2020,negative,star wars episode 9 focuses heavily on bombastic action and exagerated fanservice instead of a compeling story and a coherent narrative which ultimately results in a dissapointing movie and the worst of the skywalker saga
Mar 22 2020,positive,it was alright but bring back palpatine was just stupid
Mar 22 2020,negative,first of all i want to make it clear that i am a star wars fan but of those who are not against the new stories i loved rebels rogue one is very good and they have only defended themselves although tabien is a little lazy  but this last trilogy is fatal and this last movie is abominable he leaves more questions than answers he says goodbye to so many wonderful characters and in such bad ways that they are sad  if i start to say everything that is wrong i honestly never end but lets talk about the most ridiculous armitage hux spy his reasons i dont want kylo ren to win  what ray she had enough of a little training to become almost a goddess of force who could have become empress  osea sidius had to learn for years and she just woke up one day and is the greatest thing that has happened to her by force she controls minds throws lightning bolts she has a super sixth jedi sense and she has healing powers she only needs to throw laser your eyes and freeze with your breath kylo ren osea how many times he was asked to be good suddenly he loses against ray his han appears that nobody tells us where he comes from or if he is not a ghost in the force but he appears and convinces him to become good so just 3 minutes and zaz is good says dad and throws his red saber  the emperor bone this dude is suddenly dying and what a coincidence two super powerful jedis arrive but that in front of a dying sith they cannot be more than insects and apart from what coincidence he can take life from them so he absorbs their energy and does everything powerful and begins to throw rays to the sky which is not the most surprising if not that with its rays it begins to destroy all of its enemies but when those rays that brought down my ships are focused on ray for all rays with its saber so what oh and so the worst enemy sith dies the most evil and powerful dude with his rays bounced by a saber  so suddenly he is gone and the war and everything is over  bum everyone happy well less ben because he sacrifices himself to save ray and there with the death of ben the skywalkers end there ah well but they do not end because ray decides not to be a palpatine so just by his desire he says i am skywalker then he dies lineage but does not die  im sorry but i must say it garbage all the film is garbage
Mar 22 2020,positive,i loved it what do you exactly expect from a star wars movie this is no shakespeare we are talking about space opera the picture was lovely they give their most in order to entertain us oh btw i loved as well tlj but that is for another post
Mar 22 2020,negative,ive never expected less from disney but they still surprised me
Mar 21 2020,negative,tros could actually be better than this i was expecting a lot more about this movie but i get absolutely disappointed i loved some scenes tho but i was expecting more knowing that was the end of an incredible saga   also feel proud of daisy and adam and all the incredible actors they worked hard and did a good job 
Mar 21 2020,positive,if jumanji can fetch a freakin 71 fresh than rise of skywalker would realistically be scored about 1001 its that good
Mar 21 2020,negative,this movie vastly disappointed me theres nothing bold or new here
Mar 21 2020,negative,this movie is just bad in every possible way  major disappointment
Mar 21 2020,positive,good star wars movie moves at break neck pace kylo ren  rey are the best parts and moments in the movie for what the movie gave me its a good send off to the new trilogy
Mar 21 2020,positive,this is an enjoyable film and rounds the saga up fine the films biggest downfall is that it had to follow and fix the issues from the last jedi and jj abrams does the best he can with the limited room he had to take this movie in  it keeps you on your toes its fun to watch there are some really cool moments and scenes in it and the big twist was something i or i think most people did not see coming but was pulled off so well  the movie advances along very quickly and would have been much better if it was split into two movies although it would have meant for a quadrilogy out of star wars fashion it would have done justice to the series meaning it could have explored certain aspects more without rushing given chance to have more grounding and better direction of the movie and could have developed characters and their stories more so  it was enjoyable to watch and a good time other than overuse of lightning effects which made parts hard to watch at times it was much better than its predecessor tlj and made for an enjoyable end to the saga not great but good and enjoyable for what it had to go on after the last jedi
Mar 21 2020,negative,trash its like they have superpowers but dont use them it makes no sense 
Mar 21 2020,negative,wow i would have never thought i might miss the prequels but here we are  what a sad mishmash of forced nostalgia and predictability
Mar 21 2020,positive,watched it twice and enjoyed it even more the second time round the filmmakers had the unenviable task of rescuing a story wrecked by a horrendous previous instalment and untimely death of a key cast member and i think they did a decent job without being a great movie the rise of skywalker and the mandalorian nevertheless brings back a sense of dignity to the overall disney canon rip carrie fisher
Mar 21 2020,negative,they basically throw away the story set up by the previous two films and create a wholly unrelated story what was the point of bringing back palpatine in the end it doesnt matter and nothing changed yeah the so called fans and audiences like you are making star wars into a turd and star wars stop redeeming your villains it get cliched fast
Mar 21 2020,neutral,made for a mass of peopple just not for me dont wanna see star wors movie for some time now 
Mar 21 2020,neutral,not satisfying the plot still had some unexpected twists and turns but the cheesy dialogues leave a lot to be desired the acting was mediocre felt like this was the weakest installment in this series spanning the nine films
Mar 21 2020,positive,great movie the best way to end the trilogy of trilogys if youre a true star wars fan youll love it because its star wars and not to mention it ties everything together nicely with a lot of action drama and excitement if youre not a star wars fan weird place to start but im sure you will like it if not miss 8 films worth of back story is much of a problem for you
Mar 21 2020,negative,aside from the production values the movie doesnt offer that much im so relieved im not a sw fan its a disjointed and underwhelming end to this saga nothing pays off
Mar 21 2020,positive,if the movie wasnt so crunched it wouldve been better it was such a pointless idea to have two directors good lord
Mar 21 2020,positive,i loved this movie it was so beautiful i cried so hard watching it
Mar 21 2020,positive,i loved it it was a great ending
Mar 21 2020,positive,a must see for all who have followed the star wars saga
Mar 20 2020,positive,that it remembers that star wars is meant to be campy it closed out the story well
Mar 20 2020,positive,the rise of skywalker feels like were back in safe hands jj and so once again every moment is visually awesome exciting dramatic andor funny  the way star wars is supposed to be i watched it with a ten year old beside me saw it for what it was  a brilliant piece of first class entertainment in other words a great movie
Mar 20 2020,negative,disappointed the plot was predictable as the story unfolded the filmatography and direction seemed like a bgrade movie made for tv piece truly disappointing end to the saga
Mar 20 2020,positive,firstly so you know im not a hater i wont have it the last jedi was terrible for me it was one of the best star wars films classic cinema  this one shame just too much crammed into it that you spend half the time asking questions would have made more sense to make 2 films out of it
Mar 20 2020,neutral,the big explosion after the train wreck that was this poorly planned new trilogy a tragic disaster but still makes for a big spectacle
Mar 20 2020,negative,i dont know what i just witnessed i could type a novel on everything wrong with this but real star wars fans already know and im glad i gave zero money to this film
Mar 20 2020,neutral,meh glad i saw it free on a plane
Mar 20 2020,neutral,so with this much budget and huge huge fan basethey decided to not set up a straight up plan for the story by knowing this is a new trilogy  cinematography is great special effects and i would say acting is on point too but movies are watched for their stories mostly and this one just makes no sense so for merchmarketing reasons you bring back literally everyone to the star wars universe from the dead to make it bigger better etc palpatines return made no sense this was really the best idea or the greed was too strong to bring back a charismatic character that most people recognize by the black hoodie shame on it i used to be a bigger star wars fan
Mar 20 2020,negative,bad movie its pretty and effects too but the story and plot is ridiculous and the entire disney sequel trilogy is just bad bad bad also so much is ruined in this movie force healing force skype calls force teleport items i could go on its just bad  i would not recommend
Mar 20 2020,positive,i thought that rise of skywalker was ok the special effects were astounding and there was some nice character development on rey but the story was bland as dishwater
Mar 20 2020,negative,this finished an awful trilogy even the prequels was better than this tripe so disappointing
Mar 20 2020,positive,i think its a great movie an i know it has some problems but as a long time sw fan i loved it
Mar 20 2020,negative,what should i even say disney movies are all about fan service nowadays to be honest including all marvel films this movie was catered to teenagers  kids unoriginal  weak a starwars movie that no adult would enjoy  weak
Mar 20 2020,positive,i guess the bar was pretty low after the rj disaster at least this was fun to watch
Mar 20 2020,negative,this is a big disaster
Mar 20 2020,negative,just sucks this last trilogy was really bad jj abrams destroy star wars the episode 7 and 8 was bad but this was awful i really hate star wars now   nothing works in this movie hopefully i dont drop my money in the movies and this was the only star wars movie cant see in theater if you dont have see it please dont do it
Mar 20 2020,negative,backtracks from the previous two sequel entries all for the sake of abruptly ruining character arcs writes out previously established characters all for the sake of plot progression while the movie tries to explain already established characters it still tries to introduce new ones tries being the key word here the ever so mystical force is used to write the cast out of a series of roadblocks of the situations countless plot holes and approximately four different macguffins thrown into these sequences of quickcut 30 second scenes one after another poor editing and sequencing with little to no enticing action or drama
Mar 20 2020,negative,please stop making the same movie over and over its been since 1977 and the only star wars movies to show any creativity beyond the first one are the empire strikes back and rogue one
Mar 19 2020,positive,its a not so good film its not terrible but not so goodone of the worst star wars and the worst disney triology
Mar 19 2020,neutral,i havent walked out of a franchise movie this disappointed in a whilelike was that the ending of star wars literally likewhoever has these new movies they have an uphill battle
Mar 19 2020,negative,i hope they go the way of the mandalorian this was entertaining but a disappointment
Mar 19 2020,negative,this movie did what few ever could it ruined the pervious movies retrospectively lukes story arc meaningless darth vaders sacrifice pointless the force who cares yoda just an old fool obi wan sacrifice and struggle not meaningful in any way who ever wrote this movie does not understand what star wars is and why people identified with it in such a meangful way i loved star wars hell i was a massive fan watched all the movies as soon as they came out i read the booksnow i can honestly say its not for me anymore thanks disney great job
Mar 19 2020,neutral,not particularly groundbreaking in any way and kind of slogs through the plot but still has its moments really shows how disney didnt have any plan whatsoever it was clearly made specifically for the incredibly loud haters of the last jedi
Mar 19 2020,positive,i thought the movie was amazing screen wise but there was a whole lot of plot holes like hyperspace jumping and how the palpatines skip a generation force wise all in all it was a good ending to one of my favorite series but i feel like they rushed it too much
Mar 19 2020,positive,similar to episode vii in that it was neither bad not good there was some nice action and interesting ideas but it was also paced horribly and had some really stupid ideas while disappointing it wasnt an atrocity 75
Mar 19 2020,positive,some stuff redeemed but other wrong
Mar 19 2020,positive,this movie though the end of the skywalker saga felt like a rush job with far to much happening yes it had adventure action and a gillian but no substantial story
Mar 19 2020,negative,if jar jar binks were to show up in this film it might have redeemed it  this movie takes the previous film and throws the potential for a greatness away and leaves one to question the validity the entire saga  the acting is superb but the storytelling and action scenes leave most to more questions that really need not be answered nor asked  the most frustrating part of this film is the lack of respect it shows towards the skywalker family  truly this movie spits on luke and his cronies  had i known this would happen i wouldnt have gone to the theatre to see it  no dont waste your time on this film nor the next one  jj abrams might have respun a new hope but this film simply tells fans to stop enjoying lucas vision  id rather read fanfiction than rewatch this movie  its a dud  sorry disney
Mar 19 2020,positive,much better than the last two films overall very busy the plot thunders along so if you blink you might miss a key plot point i liked that they finally explained where rey got her force powers one thing i think is important be sure to carb load before you force heal someone with your life force
Mar 19 2020,negative,movie was awful they have ruined star wars with this movie and the others
Mar 19 2020,negative,not worth watching  if you are a fan this movie will destroy everything you loved about star wars
Mar 19 2020,positive,bittersweet as this was the last in the series it was excellent tying everything together thoroughly enjoyed
Mar 19 2020,positive,its not terrible as the last jedi i despise that movie  but not as great as the prequel trilogy again these movies only exist for the sequel trilogy to end in a cashhungry trilogy that has no heart to the original george lucas franchise we know and love lacks originality and fresh thoughts but it is still a fun little movie for yourself to like
Mar 19 2020,negative,got half way through felt like a bad fan fiction like hunger games 3 or that last twilight that no one remembers how it ended
Mar 19 2020,negative,terrible pace laughable story and dialogs was this movie written by a child  shitty acting from most of the cast jj abrams kept trying to say well i agree with all of yall the last jedi was horrible so just ignore what happened in it but at least unlike tlj it was so random it made me laugh a couple times
Mar 19 2020,negative,terrible plot writing and direction first star wars movie ive ever seen where i didnt want to finish watching it
Mar 19 2020,positive,it is not the resistance who saves the day but john williams
Mar 18 2020,negative,probably the most traitorous to the franchise movie ever made  so palpatine says that hell possess rey if she kills him  so she kills him and now what  the movie ends insinuating palpatineevil rules happily ever after  george lucas must be fuming because he didnt turn up to the premier
Mar 18 2020,negative,it is a parody of a great series
Mar 18 2020,negative,stars wars ix tries but fails in many ways to end a messy last 3 films the first two star wars iv and v were ground breaking and plot driven cinema experiences leaving fans wanting more then in episode vi they gave us ewoks oh look star wars fans arent the little teddy bears cute they turned an adult franchise into kiddie land
Mar 18 2020,negative,a really bad star wars movie it moves way too quickly the scenes arent given time to breath and the final battle is one of the worst ive ever seen in a blockbuster of this magnitude its time for star wars to quarantine itself from the movie theaters at least until they can find someone that can bring back some life  energy into this franchise its too bad because i really liked the actors they picked for this trilogy
Mar 18 2020,positive,am a star wars fan since i was a child and this movie only tries to rescue all the inconsistencies which was generated by episode 8 and trying to justify absurdities ends up losing the essence of its story a pity that disney ended up destroying magic from star wars
Mar 18 2020,positive,nice movie everyone must to see
Mar 18 2020,positive,movie was mediocrebut plot was bad cgi and other things were quite good it was very disappointing ending of skywalker saga
Mar 18 2020,negative,as insulting as the last jedi
Mar 18 2020,negative,the worst most vile most detestable movie i have ever had the displeasure of seeing i hated almost every single thing about this garbage the plot the dialogue the delivery all pained me to watch sometimes physically if i had to give someone a modicum of kudos for this it should go to the artists and costume people they did a great job with what they were handed the monsters that conceived this travesty in order to stripmine our collective childhoods deserve nothing short of embargo i will never purchase another disney product so long as i live
Mar 18 2020,positive,good ending that imo redeemed the whole trilogy plus it was fun to watch which i couldnt honestly say for tlj
Mar 18 2020,neutral,definitely had some flaws but overall a good end to an amazing saga and im so sad to see it come to a close
Mar 18 2020,negative,plot is bad who cares for whom is not understandable special effects and cgi are excellent having grown up on the franchise i wish i had never seen it
Mar 17 2020,negative,sad robot jj and rian johnson dropped the ball with star wars the final movie installment of a trilogy that does not belong in the star wars universe from the start this movie destroys the history of star wars it feels like an old tv show that took a weekend to write i would love a terminator style remake and act like these poorly cast and underdeveloped storylines never happened
Mar 17 2020,positive,hoo boy here we go  disneys star wars trilogy clearly did not go the way they were hoping changing to such a different director for the middle film gave the trilogy an uneven feeling rian johnsons vision was so vastly different from jj abrams resulting in a hard swing from force awakens to last jedi to this this could have been solved at the production level if  what in the banana muffins are you babbling on about now production schedules director vision nobody cares about all that they just want to know if you liked that movie  but thats the problem 12yearold james theres so much more to film analysis than just saying whether or not you liked the film with so many films coming out of alreadyexisting franchises it is necessary to view films in the context of their predecessors  dude chill out if you think too much about this stuff then your mind is going to be made up before you even walk into the theatre  an excellent point i know i avoided the rotten tomatoes page with constant vigilance in the week leading up to seeing the movie and even then i was still really nervous that jj wasnt going to be able to pull this off  and did he  i guess he got dealt a pretty raw hand of cards his villain got killed off some of his best characters were completely sidelined and carrie fisher passed away he had a very unenviable job  for sure   he was able to introduce a new villain really quickly and had a lot of interesting plot threads i guess my main complaint with both 8 and 9 is the editing it feels like one planet hop should have been cut out to make the film tighter  it did seem a bit long but you have to admit that the journey was fun  it did work internally even if it felt a bit videogamey the references to previous star wars films were also great to see especially in the third act  oh man that final space battle was great there were stakes  there are always stakes just not very much in the way of consequences the only character arc that felt organic was kylo rens  honestly hes probably the bestwritten character in the whole trilogy shame he didnt get a good ending  it could have definitely been written better but he at least got to close out his arc  what about your arc  say what now  how are you going to end the arguing with your 12yearold self bit youve been doing for star wars movies  eh who says it has to end here im sure something from my childhood will get remade that ill want to bring you back for until then thanks for talking star wars with me  may the force be with you  ooh i just shivered a bit
Mar 17 2020,positive,the movie was ok but was not as well written as others in tbe series the actors de to try but it just seemed chunky but over all i did not mind it and watching it in the cinaplex thereater was worth the time
Mar 17 2020,negative,my lord   for me this is the worst star wars ever  a lot of nonsense scenes forced situations old characters that appear again magically  i hope that disney starts a new saga so many years after the original trilogy new fresh story new characters
Mar 17 2020,negative,the movie looks a lot like a trailer you scratch your head for all the talent there how come and i know they are paid a lot dont the actors rebel and say somethingits just horrible
Mar 17 2020,positive,the plot was weak for this chapter like the other 2 sequels but the ending of the saga was satisfied for me so if you are a fan of star wars just you have to watch it love it or not lets hope that the next saga  will be great and good for us
Mar 17 2020,positive,beautiful film full of adventure and nostalgia were some plot points a bit forced sure but was it a thoroughly entertaining film absolutely
Mar 17 2020,positive,i enjoyed the movie and was glad i was able to share the moments with my kids as my dad did with me not everything has to be great to be enjoyable and memorable 
Mar 17 2020,positive,the director did the right thing on this one
Mar 17 2020,negative,the death of star wars disney finally killed the series with this poorly written checklist movie designed to please everyone and no one at the same time
Mar 17 2020,negative,in the history of cinema there actually have been worse films that said this stupid lump of a film creaks along bubbling with illogic a ridiculous story and uninspired acting
Mar 17 2020,negative,lazy writing horrible direction absolute trash physically painful to watch
Mar 17 2020,positive,it is worth watching for star wars fans
Mar 17 2020,negative,this movie was clearly not set up and the return of palpatine totally breaks star wars canon
Mar 17 2020,negative,star crap the worst ever the series formula is just being recycled to death please stop you have nothing left to give
Mar 17 2020,positive,a lot of fun i enjoyed how they wrapped this story up
Mar 17 2020,negative,all around horribly done the plot jumps all over makes major reveals without backstory and lacks any creativity it feels like they tried to rob as many nostalgic moments from the original series and cheapened them along the way
Mar 17 2020,negative,heartbreaking to see these get more and more lifeless and sterile
Mar 17 2020,negative,kind of crap best of the new trilogy but not by much
Mar 16 2020,negative,what a load of unmitigated convoluted nonsensical pewpew what a bummer they games of throned it let this be a lesson for all multi billionaire dollar franchises they only ever existed because the word on the page meant something now all they have is flashy spectacle and dripping sentimentality for when it was good they never should have shot movie one without having written parts 2 and 3 they never should have hired riaan i feel for the actors some of whom are likely to go the path of hayden christensen who had to be here for every minute even they must know in their heart of hearts what they made doesnt stand up to the promise of the potential of what that universe could offer if approached with intelligence character and plotting sigh
Mar 16 2020,positive,itll probably hold your interest but the plot has its share of holes and the characters are about as twodimensional as you might expect from modern tv and movies  ultimately it felt like they were just redoing the original star wars  again
Mar 16 2020,positive,i understand why people hate this movie since it basically episode 6 but i feel like this was a neccacary movie for the saga some of the plot made no sense at all eg rey and kylo defeat stoke but then go back to fighting each other even after kylo seemed like he came back to the lght side that is only one example  but all in all im ok with this movie
Mar 16 2020,negative,this movie was so messy confusing incoherent that the only way to describe it is insane  the hero is rey simply an all powerful girl that has all the abilities needed to solve every obstacle without even breaking a sweat  then theres the plot every time they look for a lead a convenient lead giver person or item is right there to give said lead and there is absolutely no point or motivation of it all beside the old star wars plot  palpatine wants to take over the galaxy jedi rebels want to stop him everything else is exaggerated and unrealistic cheap plot devices to show how rey the all powerful is better then the  in the end rey wins the day and says shes a skywalker  because reasons  very very sad ending to a very sad trilogy that made no sense so much so that george lucas wants to take back the franchise from disney and ignore this trilogy from the true plotline of star wars
Mar 16 2020,negative,very average starwars really took a nose dive with the trilogy
Mar 16 2020,negative,could it be any worse this was supposed to be the great final movie that finished of the saga it was absolutely horrible and uncreative all the other star wars movies were just mindblowing and i understand it isnt easy to direct a final movie but this nope doesnt deserve 2 stars im afraid
Mar 16 2020,negative,every trope in the book visually stunning absolute nightmare of a storyline ending to the trilogy
Mar 16 2020,negative,this movie killed my childhood memories
Mar 16 2020,negative,this movie was really messy i disliked it quite a bit there were a few good points in the movie that i could pinpoint but it was hard to find those points
Mar 16 2020,neutral,this is a disappointing end to the skywalker saga on many fronts mostly due to some seriously flawed storytelling that should not have been given the green light its hard to describe how i felt after watching the end credits roll without going into the specifics of spoilers but the way this ninefilm epic wrapped up left me feeling almost hopeless but more than anything confused rent it
Mar 16 2020,positive,no soul in this one lots of confusion and distractions and why did they have to make rey so moody why cant our lead be solid
Mar 16 2020,positive,absolutely loved the movie what a difference it makes having a great director in jj abrams making this movie the storyline the characters to drama the fighting everything fits together thank you jj abrams for giving us this incredible masterpiece
Mar 15 2020,negative,this movie was terrible what even was that rey palpatineskywalker stuff it made no sense the movie makes no sense and has horrible editing its just a bunch of action youre better off watching the john wick or taken trilogy
Mar 15 2020,neutral,ok film in the franchise
Mar 15 2020,positive,when all the ships showed up was one of the best part and there wasnt one part my family and i disliked at all
Mar 15 2020,negative,it was bad destryed a bunch of things in the star wars universe bad acting bad direction lacked imagination bad bad bad
Mar 15 2020,positive,i thought this was the best of the star wars series  there couldnt have have been a better ending to the skywalker story
Mar 15 2020,positive,finally a satisfying story now we can finally forget that trash last jedi was the ding dong critics complain that it was created just to undo the last jedi good because that movie doesnt count for the fans rise of skywalker cleaned up a mess unfortunately it meant it crammed a lot of story into one movie but so be it it had to be done screw everything about the middle movie that doesnt need to exist
Mar 15 2020,positive,i enjoyed this movie a lot
Mar 15 2020,positive,well it was not the best star wars movieforce healing is my biggest complaint in the movie the whole point of anakin becoming darth vader was because he wanted to find a way to heal padme if force healing was around he could have just healed her and his mom also that force transport was kind of weird but there were good things about the movie like the fitting ending leia got and lando coming back is good and yeah this is iconic because its the end of a saga although i did not like this movie that muchi would recommend it to any star wars fan
Mar 15 2020,negative,terrible movie boring terrible messaging unearned emotional moments stupid
Mar 15 2020,negative,easy plot everything is the most important mission there is very little logic and more often a remake of the earlier movies still cannot connect to rey really missing the learning curve that luke had to go through rey is just the master of everything including using a skimmer she has not ever seen before in her time on a desert planet i really miss the first movies and disney and abrams are not capturing the feel
Mar 15 2020,negative,shameful sad and overwhelmingly bad story a fair ending to a bad saga at least the special effects and the music can be saved at least
Mar 15 2020,neutral,after years of good story lines in star wars i find that this was not i was expecting in the movies and i would want dave filoni to direct this film because his experience in clone wars
Mar 15 2020,positive,i loved this movie this is probably the best movie since the original star wars now episode iv a really good way to end the saga i think there may be a lot of but hurt misogynists who dont like that a seriously badass woman carried this movie  but rae is fantastic and i was gripped at every stage truly an epic end to an epic saga
Mar 15 2020,positive,while the story did take a few shortcuts i dont understand the level of hate being leveled at rise of the skywalker certainly not to the extent where fanboys want george lucas to return  who proved he cant write or direct his way out of a wet paper bag with the horrendous prequels
Mar 15 2020,negative,i really tried to like it i really did unfortunately this whole movie seems forced it looks like it was slapped together in the last few days before release sorry disney but the characters deserve better as well as the audience
Mar 15 2020,negative,what a piece of shit of a movie george lucas did a big mistake by selling the star wars rights to disney so they ended up making this nonsensical trash
Mar 15 2020,negative,hot fking garbage fun space adventure but this is not star wars 
Mar 15 2020,positive,missing a 2nd movie  but a fun ride overal to me it shows how jj could have made a fun tribute to the original if he had done all 3 movies though it still doesnt add anything to star wars i was ok with the first movie  hated the 2nd and i actually like the 3rd one
Mar 15 2020,positive,i loved the conclusion of the story minus a few annoying details but overall if you are a fan of star wars it will be a great time
Mar 15 2020,negative,if there had been more richard e grant this may have been a better movie criminally underused  the rest of the movie is just awful unintentionally comical poor storytelling and the ruining of an iconic scene fro the original movie  the usual bish bosh bang and great special effects but the film was a big let down some more clinical editing couldve saved this film as with the previous movie force movement   a poor end and to a tritrilogy and to the poor trilogy itself  rogue one continues to look more like a masterpiece lets hope they can maintain the quality of the mandalorian
Mar 14 2020,positive,all negative critics are wrong  sure it has its flaws like some unanswered questions and unfilled parts but overall the rise of skywalker happens to be the great ending to one big and beloved star wars saga way better than the last jedi if you ask me
Mar 14 2020,negative,i understand that i as an expanded universe fan am absolutely not the target for these movies if you want an actionpacked movie and can get over sloppy narratives deus ex tropes and plot convenience definitely watch this movie otherwise it will take you out of an otherwise immersive experience
Mar 14 2020,positive,i was 4 years old when i saw iv ix was amazing because it brought me back to the magical fantasy i have loved my whole life the circuit is now complete
Mar 14 2020,negative,this movie was supposed to be the big climax of grand saga insted it feels like a fanfic written by a 9 year old
Mar 14 2020,neutral,star wars has always made me feel things whether they be joy sadness anger bittersweetness peace satisfaction etc i think its important to note that this is the first star wars movie where besides the han solo scene i genuinely felt very little during the entire film i genuinely think it is nearly soulless and once i left i was hit by a wave of feelings disappointment annoyance frustration confusion and finally a sort of dissatisfied surrender as i realized this is how the saga ended whether i liked it or not
Mar 14 2020,positive,this is the best of the new trilogy ignore the critics it seems to me that as a star wars fan from the very beginning born in 1975 that the critics were almost trained to dislike this movie as a passionate lover of the star wars universe and not a big fan of the last two movies but still enjoyed them i can say this was the best of the new three
Mar 14 2020,positive,the rise of skywalker is a pretty good film overall one of its main issues though is the pacing and the reveal of reys bloodline at the end of the first act besides that though it did well and i think this was another hit for jj abrams
Mar 14 2020,positive,felt very rushed with no time to have any type of real feeling towards any climatic scene not a bad movie but not a great way to end star wars
Mar 14 2020,negative,lacking imagination formulaic was completely unimpressed
Mar 14 2020,positive,seemed very cheesy predictable cliche and just not well thought out in many parts ending was by far the best part although it also definitely had its demons
Mar 14 2020,positive,wonderful fixed the issues that made the last jedi so disappointing excellent end to the entire skywalker saga
Mar 14 2020,positive,if you really really know star wars you will understand how she is as strong so good
Mar 13 2020,negative,while the film was fun to watch and would have been great if it was not part of the star wars film saga this shows no respect to the story and plot of the first 8 movies and what could have been an avengers endgame level of conclusion i was left feel blah and done with star wars
Mar 13 2020,positive,this final saga star wars skywalker
Mar 13 2020,positive,it has crispy visuals although the story is confusing
Mar 13 2020,negative,they fell short explaining certain characters in the story it was rushed and they didnt get into any detail on how emperor palpatine survived they referenced that he had clone technology but never confirmed he was a clone darth vader being the chosen one of prophecy was all contradicted in return of the jedi the death star was blown into pieces the way they shot the death star blowing up was a big nuclear explosion leaving the death star into space dust rise of skywalker was lazy writing poor character development the only thing that looked good in the rise of skywalker was the cgi they did with princess leia return of the jedi was the end of the star wars saga rise of skywalker shouldve just been a 10 min youtube video dubbed as disneys official fanfilm on their version of star wars  i wish i could give it no stars the reason why i gave it a low rating score the rise of skywalker didnt make any sense according to the story line lucas left behind before he sold it to disney to me rise of skywalker isnt canon entertaining to watch yes but it doesnt do justice on completing the actual series the fans followed too much contradictory to the story line on prior events and nothing really explained   overall conclusion the phantom menace shouldve been ranked higher due to the fact darth mauls character development and light saber duel were one of the most legendary fight scenes in the star wars franchise the rise of skywalker didnt have anything memorable light saber battles were mediocre nothing stood out just lots of recycled material with nothing new to put in the picture the rise of skywalker is disneys fan film so they need to make another film that actually stays true to return of the jedi story or quit while theyre ahead
Mar 13 2020,negative,it was like visual cocaine but johnny depp wasnt around to make it cool i guess it was better than the book which is backwards and sad   also how is this movie most anticipated dvd coming if it has a score of half
Mar 13 2020,positive,not sure why all the negative reviews other than a few things that didnt make sense from previous storyline overall i enjoyed it and liked many aspects of the movie
Mar 12 2020,positive,despite the ratings the critics give the film its far better than the last movie this time with a decent plot and getting rid of the space race weak story arcs of the previous film though it has its shortcomings and weird scenes overall its the most original and best film of the trilogy
Mar 12 2020,positive,a must see movie sad to see the end of an era
Mar 12 2020,negative,while it had its moments and beautifully shot action sequences this felt more like a fan film and homage to reylo fans and the last jedi haters
Mar 11 2020,positive,i think this movie got way too much hate i thought the storyline was great although there were a lot of side stories  it provided a lot of fan service and was one of my favorite movies i came out of the theater loving it i was so disapointed when i got home to the hate
Mar 11 2020,neutral,so i didnt liked the movie in general but i gotta say the vfx and fight sequences were pretty good but the writing was not good and i also didnt liked how adam drivers abilities were wasted
Mar 11 2020,positive,this film is very good because it  has lots of warsthe ators are relly good my favorite person is rey this movie happens in a galaxy the story is about luke skywalker rey and her cousin
Mar 11 2020,positive,this movie tries to course correct from last jedi explanations are shoehorned in it pretends there are risks but has no consequences
Mar 11 2020,positive,i personally really enjoyed this movie there were some odd moments here and there but its a very good movie best of the new triology and one of the bests of the saga personal opinion
Mar 11 2020,positive,this was ok but i liked the original ones best i miss harrison ford
Mar 11 2020,positive,worst of sequels does not fit to the rest of them uninventive and naive plot unnecessary new characters lots of unexplained things was not boring to watch it just was nothing special like the movie i am going to forget it existed couple days later
Mar 11 2020,negative,this movie is a fn mess it is a result of lack of planning and reasonable logical scripting
Mar 11 2020,positive,awesome ending to an exceptional saga
Mar 10 2020,positive,i liked very much i smiled i cried i had much fun
Mar 10 2020,positive,great movie it felt like some things came out of nowhere not spoiling it but i loved it i may be a little biased because im a huge star wars fan
Mar 9 2020,positive,love star wars story line  good 
Mar 9 2020,positive,i find it hard to dislike much about any of the star wars franchise films special effects and cinematography were on point as usual the main story was kind of basic and didnt seem to allow for a lot of additional story lines or action as can be found in many previous star wars movies the end became quite predictable and was almost a deja vu type moment not the best ending but not the worst for a franchise with some varying plot performances
Mar 9 2020,positive,i enjoyed the way it flowed and the effects were incredible never took my eyes off the screen cast well for sure
Mar 8 2020,negative,omg you just killed off every skywalker and gave the galaxy to the palps gone is vader redemption ark gone are the true jedi gone is the true magic of star wars every character worth a darn are even interesting you killed we all know disney had to as they make no money from the well written universally loved characters but they replaced them with mehhh
Mar 8 2020,positive,despite its predictability and tight corner its shoved in after the previous installments the rise of skywalker is an fanpleasing and heartwarming end to the star wars saga
Mar 8 2020,neutral,just doing way too much watch the originals and compare to this in the originals there was a simple goal with each sequence and not a whole long list of characters to squeeze into relevance one more time before we go the whole oh no x character died oh wait nevermind over and over was too much rey and kylo reviving each other was too much bringing back palpatine was too much im okay with movies being made to print money but they also need to have some artistic value or offer something relevant to the viewer the whole sequel series adds nothing that is necessary to the star wars universe this is the weakest of the sequels that said i was still entertained for better or worse
Mar 8 2020,positive,it was okay very pong i fell asleep 
Mar 8 2020,negative,this was a story that should have been split up into 2 or more movies  hectic is the story line  no time is given to absorb what you just saw just on to the next toy advertisement  this seems more like watching a 2 12 hourlong movie trailer  the kind that treats you to what youll see in the actual movie create all the wows and awes to jack you up for the whole story without giving you too many details  but even if they stretch this out they would still have to explain the horrible final battle sequence  i dont want to ruin it by giving away any spoilers to those who have been lucky enough to have skipped this one but chances are if you are reading this youll still see it when it is released for home viewing and understand why i feel this way
Mar 7 2020,positive,i loved how the characters were with each other the whole movie mostly and how the final sequence ended ending a amazing skywalker saga
Mar 7 2020,positive,my dad and i went opening night and loved it from the moment the movie started the action was great and the cheesiness wasnt as bad as the force awakens i thought it was a fantastic way to end the skywalker storyline
Mar 7 2020,negative,a major downturn in the star was universe
Mar 7 2020,negative,pure absolute drivel pretty lights dont make up for an absolutely dreadful story all character growth was erased with a swift terrible decision seriously palpatine is reys grandpa is that supposed to be good storytelling if i could get my 10 bucks back and erase the whole experience from my brain i would
Mar 7 2020,negative,soso dumb rotten tomatoes says i need to say more about this moviewhich i mean isnt necessarybutsooo so dumb
Mar 7 2020,negative,hahahaha what a careless effort
Mar 7 2020,negative,star wars ended running on fumes and with a flat tire what a sad ending for a great saga this is what happens when businessmen write scripts if you ever read a positive review about this movie by a professional critic please send that critic to the trash bin he doesnt know anything about movies or hes on the dark side of disneys paylist
Mar 6 2020,positive,it was a good movie i felt things didnt tie together really well in some spots
Mar 6 2020,neutral,it was alright  they really tried to fix all the problems of the last jedi  while the cast has really good chemistry the writing just falls flat and you are left thinking about how return of the jedi already did everything rise of skywalker did just better
Mar 6 2020,negative,the movie was very poorly written i left before it was over the film is a sad addition to the star wars universe what were the writers thinking most of the movie is rey doing random force stuff with her boy toys following her around crying rey help us rey we need you dont do it rey its too dangerous complete malarkey
Mar 6 2020,negative,watched twice in the cinema its a okay ending to a poor decade of star wars i wish it was better and that the movies felt like they belonged together rather than just having the same people learning the same lessons 3 times  the movie is tonally and visually out of place from the first seven saga movies but less disconnected than last jedi  also star wars is again suffering from the old problem of power creep something that happened in the older video games  it feel like 2 movies that are trying to cover the loss of its main villain in the previous movie while trying to keep one star alive and not letting old heros out shine the new ones  having said all that ray almost seems to grow a little but finn is learning to be a hero again and poe is basically proved to be the worst fusion of han solo and luke skywalker anyway
Mar 6 2020,positive,i dont understand how people cannot like this movie i think it was beautifully produced and i loved the storyline although the ending did leave me in emotional distress
Mar 6 2020,positive,loved it was awesome it was our 1st star wars movie we have seen def going to watch then all now
Mar 5 2020,negative,ok where do we begin  going in to this movie i had my hopes set really high thinking oh yes something new and exciting but i also had my doubts when learning that trevorrow had left the project and jj jumping in again to finish the trilogy of   ooooh boy was i in for a big disappointment   this movie is a straight copy of return of the jedi just as the force awakens was a copy of a new hope all the new random plotpoints just springboarded into this shitshow of a film made me really really mad this movie made me feel that they simply made it as a continuation as if jj also made episode 8 and that that movie was a basic copy of the empire strikes back   only thing i can really recommend in this movie is the visuals which are amazing the score by john williams and the group dynamic between rey finn and poe plus bb8 chewbacca and c3p0   storywise this movie is a shitshow
Mar 5 2020,positive,the special effects were awesome  i loved the casting of characters  left the show feeling great
Mar 5 2020,positive,while the film is far from being a satisfying conclusion to the skywalker saga the film does provide nonstop action and fun moments
Mar 5 2020,negative,worse than the last jedi  not quite but still very close to being just as bad  ugh disney killed star wars
Mar 5 2020,positive,the movie was a little fast paced and had a few details that didnt fit but overall i enjoyed it a lot
Mar 5 2020,negative,i rate it 86 out of 10
Mar 5 2020,positive,best star wars movie since a new hope my only problem with the film is the reylo scene 
Mar 5 2020,positive,jj abrams returns to complete the third star wars trilogy with star wars the rise of skywalker  in the wake of supreme leader snokes death former emperor palpatine announces his return leading rey and a group of rebels to go in search of the sith world exogol where palpatine and his fleet are staging an attack  abrams and his writing team do a good job at correcting rian johnsons foulups in the last jedi and at resolving the story threads begun in the force awakens  additionally ian mcdiarmids return brings a new energy to the series and carrie fisher is worked into the film impressive well using previously unused footage  and the special effects and action scenes are incredibly welldone  while its not the star wars film to ends all star wars films star wars the rise of skywalker is an exciting and actionpacked space adventure
Mar 5 2020,negative,the rise of skywalker completely undoes the story of anakin skywalker ruining the original trilogy and prequels in a desperate and unsuccessful attempt to repair the damage done by the previous two films
Mar 4 2020,negative,im a film student ive endured 4 hour long films of drying paint and i almost walked out of this one
Mar 4 2020,negative,fan service too little too late it was a failed attempt to correct course after the debacle the rian johnson movie the last jedi was bad writing a convoluted story that made no sense within the star wars universe that looked more like a videogame than a blockbuster movie sad ending to a great creation
Mar 4 2020,positive,lifetime star wars fan  absolutely loved the final installation  i think it retroactively made episode 8 good not through retcons  just subverting your expectations on how you initially interpretted the movie ben is love ben is life
Mar 4 2020,negative,movie review  episode 9 didnt suck me in as the others did it looked beautiful sounded beautiful but it felt wrong its hard to feel something for characters that abruptly do a 360 until they become unrecognizable i felt more for rey in her first few minutes of intro in tfa then i did in the 3rd installment where i should have been more invested kylo ren seemed to be the only interesting character that had a clear arc planned out and was kept consistent throughout the trilogy wished there was more of him and less of the others full of bold interesting choices that were quickly negated and turned pointless and meaningless the plot was over reliant on mcguffins and were pretty farfetched if you thought about it regardless of what you thought of tlj jj should of continued that story rather than retcon it   the story choices jj went for makes the rise of skywalker not thematically nor narratively cohesive to the whole skywalker saga the last jedi was at least telling you something it had a message rise didnt have much to say as much it had things to show a particular niche of the fans to evoke nostalgia instead of paving the way for a new generation of they want star wars to live on past the original trilogy fans and if you are into the lore this movie makes the canon contradicts each other    overall i never want to not like a star wars film that is the worst as a star wars fan if star wars can be described in one word it would be hopeful this one is anything but that it left me feeling hopeless   the highlight of this trilogy was adam drivers nuance and complex performance as kylo ren if this move has one salvageable moment it was the scene between adam driver and harrison ford
Mar 4 2020,negative,it was better then the previous movie but i dont plan of buying this one on blue ray lol
Mar 4 2020,negative,this movie is beyond garbage but very much in line with this blasphemy of a trilogy the day will come where disney acknowledges just how badly these movies went and will work on a complete redo with a story more in line with george lucas vision  in all these years under the disney umbrella only rogue one and the mandalorian are worthwhile
Mar 4 2020,positive,i thought it was awesome i liked when kylo ren conferred back to the bright side of the force especially after reviving rey
Mar 4 2020,positive,abrams does his best to salvage this trilogy after the dumpster fire that was the last jedi i enjoyed the nostalgic parts of the film and some of the loose ends were tied up after they were forgotten about in tlj overall disney absolutely blew it with these 3 films they had a golden opportunity to create an epic trilogy that would have transitioned the old guard to the new who really who did not want to see an older powerful luke skywalker using all his force powers and saber skills at some point not meditating to death oh well what could have been 
Mar 3 2020,positive,the film makers had a heck of a challenge given the state that the trainwreck of a movie the last jedi had left the story in abrams and crew managed to make an enjoyable if rushed and slightly flawed star wars movie it wasnt a satisfying end to the skywalker saga but it is a pretty good movie in its own right
Mar 3 2020,positive,it was fast moving and not too hard to get whats going on nice to see the original characters in it
Mar 3 2020,positive,while there is a fair amount of odd choices and weirdunfinished plot threads the rise of skywalker is a decent star wars movie there are moments worthy of the star wars saga especially the return of an iconic character and said actors performance the special effects and the setting if the problems bother you enough tt helps to revise some of the choices made in your mind as you watch and you get some creative thinking practice
Mar 3 2020,positive,by far my favorite star wars movie ever great way to wrap up the story
Mar 3 2020,positive,disjointed plot convenient and simplistic solutions to problems  felt like the movie was rushing to get through itself
Mar 3 2020,positive,i felt complete as i stepped out of the theater it is a good closure and probably in par with what i was expecting one of my favorite moment is with leias part and chewies reaction to it there are also a few other moments i felt deeply connected with of course it has some flaws but as any star wars movie just think about it i wished there were more space battles like in rogue one but still i liked this movie very much so what else do i need  now the star wars saga needs to rest the fans need to bring peace to themselves and perhaps one day we will be surprised by the next step taken again
Mar 3 2020,negative,a conclusion that disgraces the original trilogy and everything luke skywalker did full of clichés false emotions and bad explanations it all started out wrong with kathleen kennedy already in charge and then it got even worse with her bizarre ideas of changing directors and allowing all this booger to be made the result could not be otherwise
Mar 3 2020,positive,star wars the rise of skywalker also known as star wars episode ix is a 2019 american epic space opera film produced cowritten and directed by j j abrams it is the third installment of the star wars sequel trilogy    its very good  id recommend it   a fitting finale  every generation has a legend

Mar 3 2020,neutral,its a rush finale and forgettable movie
Mar 3 2020,negative,par for the course for disney star wars horrible writing bad acting the only redeeming feature is that hopefully no one is forcing you to watch it so you can just turn it off or leave and find something useful to do with floor time
Mar 3 2020,positive,liked the ending but thought it was drawn out too long
Mar 3 2020,positive,i absolutely love that whole new generation is getting a star wars trilogy its so great to see fan favorites along with new characters all nine of the star wars films have been so fun and this one is no different

Mar 2 2020,negative,how can the story be this bad only the visuals are good in this movie
Mar 2 2020,positive,it was such a great movie and a fitting way to end a series i will probably see it again
Mar 2 2020,positive,overall i found myself really enjoying this film despite the 1st half which does have forgettable moments and plot points despite my enjoyment the first act really hurts my score and the entire film the questions fans have been asking are finally answered but granted not everyone will be pleased with the answers for me i found the film better than what i expected but i cant help think that some opportunities were missed particularly during the setupopening regardless i feel star wars fans will find lots to enjoy as they go down memory lane with the greatest scifi franchise that ever lived  7310  walkden entertainment

Mar 1 2020,positive,it was great but not awesome but a great finale for star wars movie
Mar 1 2020,positive,the movie was heavily detailed and the new characters were great in this movie i liked the new planets in the star wars franchise my favorite character was do because he talked and not beeping and he said funny stuff to adults and kids i also liked there was adult jokes lets hope they make a another star wars movie maybe 2022 in december 
Mar 1 2020,negative,a disappointing finale there are huge plotholes somehow palpatine has returned the characters act so differently from how they behaved in the previous movies force ghosts appear randomly and it just doesnt feel like a finale more like a random movie in a series pity the skywalker saga ended this way
Mar 1 2020,negative,star wars the rise of skywalker is the disappointing trilogy of the star wars franchise
Mar 1 2020,neutral,star wars rise of skywalker is an ok movie it will work for you if this trilogie is your first

Feb 29 2020,positive,it was a star wars movie and exactly what you would expect 
Feb 29 2020,negative,the movie is a sinking ship leaking with plot holes and they try to fill these plot holes with random nonsensical corks but it cant save it this movie is dead or maybe not its alive again oh its died again no its not its alive yet again this franchise been dead since the 80s no its not its been alive the whole time in secret out if nowhere the good guys are bad guys the bad guys are good guys everyone dead but still alive this film was absolute nonsense was the director drunk or high i left the cinema scratching my head trying to work out what exactly they were trying to achieve its like they were making it up as they went along the film was so choppy they cut fight scenes and battles and between characters so much it was an utter mess of a film if it wasnt star wars franchise this film would of been one of the worst performing films compared to budget ever made
Feb 29 2020,positive,took my son to watch  we both really liked it cant wait for it to be on 4k to buy it
Feb 29 2020,positive,i felt the movie pulled me in and then again as the movie and music rose to drama multiple times i felt the actors and shed tears at times very powerful and a meaningful send off after 9 seasons over the years it left me satisfied as the different times from the past new and old i loved the movie and i will add the rise of skywalker to my set of these movies that were so entertaining and i will watch them over and over
Feb 29 2020,positive,i was born the year star wars came out growing up return of the jedi was my favorite movie at one point i could recite it the was herculean task to wrap this beloved series up but i thought the did a very good job i honestly enjoyed it more the second time i watched it
Feb 29 2020,positive,good ending to the saga
Feb 29 2020,positive,marvel knocks it out of the park again with another tear jerking emotional rollercoaster after thanos is defeated the knights of ren and palpatine reappear and their galactic onslaught continues only by joining supreme leader kylo ren does she finally defeat them once and for all lightsabers
Feb 29 2020,positive,great acting and effects  lots of surprises and a couple of notsosurprises  wraps up the story but leaves some room for more to come
Feb 29 2020,positive,im the fan who likes all the movies but if youre the picky fan youre not going to like it they did a lot of detail stuff picky fans wont like but i had fun and thats what matters to me dont hate me
Feb 29 2020,positive,the saga was brought to a very satisfy conclusion
Feb 29 2020,negative,this film felt like a disappointment and has me wanting a better ending to the skywalker saga
Feb 29 2020,positive,solid ending to a very average trilogy its a shame this is what they did with star wars couldve been so much better 
Feb 29 2020,negative,predictable tripe may as well have been with by a 8yo
Feb 28 2020,negative,an hour in i looked at my gf and said do you even care how this ends thats really all i have to say about that
Feb 28 2020,positive,kept my interest but 
Feb 28 2020,positive,i liked the movie very well  it had a very nice closing finish  it answered a lot of questions  i really liked the flow of the movie as well
Feb 28 2020,negative,garbage just sad tried to make 2 movies in 1 after mostly ignoring tlj everything felt rushed no emotional weight for anything worst star wars movie ever made one of the worst movies of 2019 i wish i liked it i really do it was just bad 
Feb 28 2020,positive,for the end of the saga this is the most disappointing film ive ever watched the acting is fine but the story sucks but im glad that i saw lando calrissian for one last time the action sequences were ok as well the third act was fine overall probably the worst since the phantom menace and attack of the clones 6510
Feb 28 2020,positive,i like the idea of star wars but i never like the execution of them and know the story behind the film it is depressing the lack of foresight and originality when there are so many storylines that i find vastly more interesting than the skywalker saga
Feb 28 2020,positive,entertaining but the pacing was so fast there was no time for any scene to have any emotional impact 
Feb 28 2020,positive,there were some plot holes here and there but in the end despite what the rating may be this movie somewhat manages to pull off an acceptable ending
Feb 27 2020,positive,this is an amazing movie and is an absolute masterpiece the sequel trilogy is by far the best trilogy         but this movie actually sucks dick
Feb 27 2020,positive,i like it and its not a problem if i like it ok just accept that i like
Feb 27 2020,positive,id give it a 355 because most of the movie was boring and violent it was a  a star wars horror film
Feb 27 2020,positive,action packed from beginning to end
Feb 27 2020,positive,it was ok saw it a second time and no change in opinion others before way better
Feb 27 2020,positive,much much much better than the previous movie in the sequel trilogy  a respectable end to the series
Feb 27 2020,positive,a film series of this magnitude will always be heavily critiqued and what a great deal of criticism there has been about this film   in my view star wars needs to be a fun actionpacked fantasy allowing the viewer to turn their brain off and enjoy the ride   the film delivered on providing consistent relentlessly paced progressive action told through a characterdriven storyline with a largescaled overarching threat that links all the films in the saga together  i agree with some of the criticism the film has received since release its certainly not perfect although neither was the original trilogy i find it interesting that as a consensus the general public seems to approve of ros film critics did not   ros currently has a critic score of 58 while the audience score is 88 on rt  somehow this film has been judged too harshly and i cant help but feel that its riding an unfortunate wave created by the controversial splash that was made by the last jedi
Feb 27 2020,negative,better than last jedi but still that isnt saying much
Feb 27 2020,negative,well someone finally ruined my childhood
Feb 27 2020,positive,it was like they tried to shove 3 different movies into one it was probably better than last jedi but i expected a lot better effort from disney there better be at least three hours of deleted scenes in the blu ray or i am not buying it
Feb 27 2020,positive,a great finale to these wonderful movies ive been going to my whole life
Feb 27 2020,positive,when the movie started it took me back to the same feeling of excitement i had 22 years ago when the first movie came out  the movie was a gripping conclusion to a saga of good vs evil  there were great new characters and beings but the movie also included characters from the beginning
Feb 26 2020,positive,its hard to rate swros by itself as many of its cons stem from the last jedi and resolving those plotlines quickly ros was a fast paced movie missing much of what many star wars love about the seriesdialogue however the action and cgi was incredible and it serves as probably the best end to the sequel series that we could have gotten after tlj  probably the biggest pro is that it sets up many different side series and movies in the future always love more sw
Feb 26 2020,neutral,honestly it could have been a better way to end the saga properly  the screenplay has huge issues not to mention the lack of originality and imagination to create an intriguing plot despite this it has potential as far as special effects are concerned cinematography and sound are both good but honestly not that much as its predecessor 2017 a good beginning that unfortunately drops down to a complete collapse at the end  final score 5510
Feb 26 2020,positive,it was so good i watched it twice
Feb 26 2020,negative,what an absolute expected failure of a story rey is as boring as ever still a marry sue who is instantly loved by all she can even summon the most powerful dark side power by accident the force used to be mysterious and required training now its an all purpose plot filler finn is again wasted which is a shame because he had such promise three films and he accomplished nothing both he and poe have so much missed potential that is just left behind in exchange we get the return of the emperor oh boy dont worry guys it wasnt anakin skywalker who brought balance to the force who payed the ultimate price to destroy the empire he himself helped build in one last shot at redemption no no no its rey the white bread protagonist of our nightmares who killed him not some pesky man whose entire storyline built up to him betraying his master nope its rey forget anakin and luke in fact you can just skip the ot seeing as nothing of consequence happens i mean after all this is the story of rey defeating the empire the ot was merely a speed bump for old man sheev seeing as he is now more powerful after being exploded this movie makes so little sense its not hard to tell it was designed by committee is it worse that tlj im not sure bundle them together and chuck them both into the fires of mount doom
Feb 26 2020,negative,destroys everything the sagathe loreand all u already knew about the jedis siths and balance
Feb 26 2020,positive,great performances  effects great art direction and explosions but the dialogue  lets let this franchise end
Feb 26 2020,positive,definitely isnt like the other star wars movies disneys romanticized and magical style is all over this if you keep that in mind you wont be as disappointed
Feb 26 2020,positive,fantastic conclusion to the saga fun exciting and well paced sure it skips a few plot points but overall it is a really fun and exciting movie heres hoping it inspires future generations
Feb 25 2020,positive,i love how they went deeper into their stories
Feb 25 2020,negative,disappointing better then the other two but still weak plot and storyline  they should have just made the thrawn trilogy instead
Feb 25 2020,negative,everything that was right about last jedi it changed it in order to make fanservice  no development of characters even with the amazing performance of both adam and  daisy no time to actually breathe between scenes and above all an unsatisfying ending which doesnt worth 9 movies as it should  best adam and daisys performance quite enjoyable and i hope i see more of them in other movies worst rey as a palpatine
Feb 25 2020,negative,its an absolute mess i was bored after the first half and didnt care about what was going to happen i laughed throughout most of the movie because it was so terrible countless resurrections and plot going faster than an xwing drained all of the emotions from this movie still better than the last jedi though
Feb 25 2020,negative,who actually thinks this story made any sense it was complete garbage
Feb 25 2020,positive,to have been a truly great movie this movie needed to do something special and different and great just as the first movies were special new and great i didnt get that wow wow wow this is new and great feeling but i didnt joy the film i think the ending was acceptable and reasonable and entertaining but do you really want to have this ninth film ending in an acceptable and reasonable and entertaining way this was the time to really zap the audience for one last time and maybe it didnt happen but it was a good enough film to have done the series proud and not have done a disservice to the rest of the other films sprinkling in nostalgic moments was indeed moving for someone like me in my mid50s but not the wow wow wow moments of something new and dazzling but they were lovely to have and that was a feature that star wars took advantage of to help spice the movie
Feb 25 2020,negative,horrible movie this almost feels like i was watching cinderella in space im glad they give explanation behind snoke creation but one of the most confusing question is how the hell was palpatine was alive the whole time his body literally got destroyed in the death star and yet the movie never explained it i am sorry but as a huge star wars fan i have to admit this is the worst star wars movie ever everything did not fit in the star wars universe because disney made it too happy like some fairy tail
Feb 25 2020,positive,loved everything i have seen it multiple times in the theater will watch it another 50 before i die an old woman
Feb 25 2020,positive,great movie tied everything together for the final episode wish it was shot with a little more light and not so dark
Feb 25 2020,positive,loved the continuation of the star wars families great characters and just exciting story lines and twists  the same quality as all the others
Feb 25 2020,negative,does it even matter at this point who thought sequels so rapid wouldnt cause burnout for the series
Feb 25 2020,negative,please stop its so bad
Feb 25 2020,positive,lots of action  plot going on dramatic endingbut really longhopefully this is the end of the star wars saga lol
Feb 25 2020,negative,god awful while i could go into depth explaining my hatred for this movie star wars the rise of skywalker pitch meeting on youtube all but sums it up quickly i will list five things however that made the movie laughably bad 1 no consequences seriously nothing bad happens to any of the main characters 2 the kiss just why 3 force healing what why 4 bringing palpatine back just because and giving him the most basic and boring motives 5 rey shes just a boring character in this movie
Feb 25 2020,positive,another great film way better than i expected this is one of the best star wars films 
Feb 24 2020,negative,id have to watch episodes 1  2 again to be sure but this may have been the worst star wars movie i have ever seen  this trilogy was absolutely the worst of the three  there is not doubt about that  they crammed in way too much  they didnt fill any plot wholes but created new ones  the death of the emperor was a complete joke  anakin skywalkers story arc loses its weight because of these films  it is obvious the creative team had no plan for the story arc across episodes 78 and 9  its almost like they planned to trash the original trilogy
Feb 24 2020,positive,so for all the people who know star wars is just movies and not real this movie was awsome
Feb 24 2020,negative,awful movie i strongly disliked episode 8 but this one made episode 8 better in comparison it also had the unique effect of undermining the entire 9movie arc there was not one memorable scene performance or line of dialogue absolutely abysmal
Feb 24 2020,negative,more horrible trash from disney star wars it is so sad what could have been if disney only had a plan and good leadership in place for these movies but sadly they didnt and still dont this move makes no sense
Feb 24 2020,positive,great conclusion to an amazing series of movies
Feb 24 2020,positive,good movie  but it felt like the last season of game of thrones  too rushed 
Feb 24 2020,positive,not giving any spoilers i do have to admit jj abrams had some big shoes to fill in completing george lucass saga in the star wars empire you could tell it was a corporate film finishing the legacy and not lucas himself it was good i can only say it was not lucas good
Feb 24 2020,positive,not terrible but definitely overhated
Feb 24 2020,positive,loved how they connected it with the 1977 star wars without it being cheesy  loved to see the characters connect
Feb 24 2020,positive,satisfying tieup to the star wars saga remained true to george lucas original vision the plot was exciting suspenseful and witty where it needed to be downside the film is too long some of the plot threads were extraneous the movie would have flowed better if it was no more than 2 hours
Feb 24 2020,neutral,the action was fun and the movie obviously has a large budget the acting was good too however i found the story to be too much of everything working out for the good guys they did a good job of tying everything up but i just want the star wars movies to be something that they arent  much darker it was fun though
Feb 24 2020,positive,i jomama enjoyed this movie a lot  so write gooood reviews or else
Feb 24 2020,negative,very boring confusing and full of macguffins that lead you other macuffins forced situations like healing the worm with the force why would she even attempt that if she didnt know about it why didnt yoda and kenobi ever use that power really poor outing 
Feb 24 2020,positive,star wars the rise of skywalker delivers a exhilarating adventure that is both emotionally and visually beautiful leias scenes are amazing and the new characters add extra flair to the film overall its a great end to the nine part skywalker saga
Feb 24 2020,positive,it was amazing to see the star wars saga totally wrapped up like that great
Feb 24 2020,positive,very well done finale to recent trilogy
Feb 24 2020,positive,the action was awesome
Feb 24 2020,negative,it was soooo painful the carrie fisher scenes were awkward at best the acting by the living actors was not much better kathleen kennedy should step down from lucas films for the murder of a great franchise more like rise of palpatine
Feb 24 2020,positive,this movie was okay
Feb 24 2020,positive,dont listen to the critics we wanted a movie better than the last jedi and they delivered it was a good time and i enjoyed it cant wait for it to release on digital
Feb 24 2020,positive,represented what the entire series has from start and now until the finish definitely the best of the last 6 movies
Feb 23 2020,positive,really liked the movie pretty good wrap up to the skywalk saga but there is always room for improvement in any movie but as someone who has always liked the starwars series i liked the movie
Feb 23 2020,neutral,not enough space battle action
Feb 23 2020,positive,best of the three made up for the last jedi which i initially rated really good after first viewing but after watching two more times would have rated it a lot lower
Feb 23 2020,positive,great cinematic experience while remaining true to the story
Feb 23 2020,positive,was concerned that the ending to the whole thing would be disappointing  it wasnt  if you wanted to dig into some inconsistencies or why wasnt this brought up in earlier movies you certainly could  but it was a decent movie
Feb 23 2020,negative,the final installment of the insult trilogy which is the sequel trilogy plotholes everywhere main characters who still had no character development by the end of the trilogy which was substituted by shitty jokes and a plot which goes nowhere   all of these shortcomings made for an incredibly messy film which doesnt even stay true to the source material which came before it  this is not cannon and never will be fuck this garbage which is disguised as a film
Feb 23 2020,negative,completely disappointing
Feb 23 2020,positive,movie rating with dialogue 1 star  movie rating without dialogue 5 stars  the actors and story line get in the way of great special effects
Feb 23 2020,negative,honestly just a boring movie and a disappointment
Feb 23 2020,negative,it is tough to talk about the rise of skywalker without pointing out some issues about the film as a movie itself it has a decent story and is easy to understand the issues in this movie were the following the tone the pacing and somei wouldnt say unsavory some scenes in this movie seemed out of place despite my average feeling towards this movie i strangely recommend this still the big key detail i have noticed throughout the trilogy episodes 79 is consistency i wished that more time was given for characters such as rey kylo ren and even snoke if only it is a shame that this movie was the last presumably in the star wars saga  if you have time do check it out when you can
Feb 23 2020,positive,this makes the absolutely needed reconnections to the original star wars trilogy after the soulless awfulness of the last jedi felt good with a rollercoaster of emotions and a decent job concluding the saga special effects were great the massive stormy ocean scenes alone are worth the viewing solid 4 stars
Feb 23 2020,positive,as a film photography set design effort polish all the things that make up a good film are present and are great  however the one thing that needs to be present was missing a good story  i was disappointed in the story as with all the previous movies reys skill and prowess are totally unearned and we never see her developing we are supposed to just take their word for it  it makes for an unlikable character  and it isnt even the bad guy its supposed to be the protagonist   you end up liking kylo more than any other character  i wont spoil it but it could have been much better
Feb 23 2020,positive,for actual story line followers disney deviated from the common storylines agreed on across dozens of star wars series authors a must see for those that are indeed dedicated
Feb 23 2020,negative,wasnt impressed and very long
Feb 23 2020,negative,i hated rey being palpatines relative there are a lot of points that no match with episode 8 caracteres are introduced from nowhere and unnessessary the lesbian kiss on the end
Feb 23 2020,positive,probably one of the best star wars ive seen in years  i would go see it again
Feb 23 2020,negative,in one word this movie is contrived bizzarely paced with no reverence for what has come before any who have loved star wars  and good storytelling in general  should be prepared to be saddened
Feb 23 2020,negative,adam driver can only carry this trilogy so far this final installment felt more like a jumble of settings and characters aimed at maximizing merchandising revenues than a wellcrafted story ultimately lazy revelations that fail to push any boundaries but instead play it safe for easy digestible nostalgia the knifematchingthe wreckage scene feels like a goofy indiana jones knockoff 25
Feb 22 2020,positive,this is my 17th time i still laugh and cry love the way it ties up the last 40 years of my life
Feb 22 2020,positive,i felt that the first hour or so of the film was a bit rushed but as the film proceeded i felt it just got better and better the ending was amazing and carrie fishers send off was emotional but brilliant
Feb 22 2020,positive,it was exciting and interesting to see what happened to the old characters as well as the new ones
Feb 22 2020,positive,the rise of skywalker is not everyones cup of tea but ive got to tell you two months later this might be my favorite star wars movie ive seen it  5 times in theatres so far
Feb 22 2020,positive,this is a fun movie if your not too dialed into the star wars universe  for those who are die hard fans this movie was a huge let down and missed so many opportunities  i think it suffered greatly for having multiple directors helm the three movies in the saga
Feb 22 2020,positive,a masterpiece the best end the saga could have
Feb 22 2020,positive,i enjoyed this movie
Feb 22 2020,positive,very enjoyable despite a horrible episode 8 digging a whole bunch of holes for this movie to get our of was a good watch from start to finish
Feb 22 2020,negative,no vision terrible actors terrible writing very disappointed i thought it was impossible to get worse than the first movie disney released but they did
Feb 22 2020,positive,maybe i now like star wars expect for the final epic the rise of skywalker is good movie and ending of it is excellent but on story the character rey it should be luke  leias grandaughter not palpatine but it is a excellent movie
Feb 22 2020,positive,best movie ever so amazing and sad that its over
Feb 22 2020,positive,liked the character development and the plot regarding the whole star wars series
Feb 22 2020,positive,satisfying end to both the sequel trilogy and the entire saga leave your preconceived notions of what should or shouldnt happen and just enjoy the film
Feb 21 2020,positive,one of the best star was
Feb 21 2020,positive,the ending was not what i expected
Feb 21 2020,negative,the latest and probably last movie in this once great franchise words cannot express my absolute horror when experiencing this for the first time i hope that disney learn from this travesty of a trilogy and we get a decent movie in the future wishful thinking
Feb 21 2020,neutral,still fun as a star wars film but a lot of random and unexplained things and events poor story and bad ending
Feb 21 2020,positive,love the star wars episodes  very good
Feb 21 2020,negative,big fan here  while some if fan moments were great after seeing it three times i realize how weak the overall plot actually turned out bringing back a big bad actually seemed out of place as it was never the plan with episodes 7 and 8 i wish they had built more on the ideas of the preceding movies they could have still given us fan moments but in a better overall story 
Feb 21 2020,negative,theres no damn way the audience likes this movie at 86 no damn way it was such a piece of trash that i cant honestly believe it
Feb 21 2020,positive,i loved star wars  i especially loved the merging of all the old characters as the story continues id see it again
Feb 21 2020,positive,loved it the storyline plot   characters all great this one was extremely emotional it got to me the only thing i didnt like was leia  kayle loren dying in this movie the characters were overwhelming the pure emotion  an unusual certaincy self doubt made this movie worth checking out
Feb 21 2020,positive,its fine i guess its pretty dumb but its interesting but its not horrible but its just a dumb fun thin movie you kinda hope for more cuz theres so much potential with cool characters worlds and stuff but its just kind of a sily dumb movie its not bad but its not great either but its too weird to be mediocre or boring its fine but i really wish it was better the dialogue is really lacking and lots of characters pop up for 5 seconds with nothing to do meh i mean i liked some of the weird crazy stuff tgat was the stuff i thought would be the worst but it was the best cuz it was so silly it was shocking hard to review
Feb 21 2020,positive,im not even a star wars fan but this movie was very good
Feb 21 2020,positive,did wish ending was differentgreat seeing all the characters from different movies
Feb 21 2020,negative,i really dont know what to say about this movie  i really would like to rant but i dont feel like typing so much  straight up this movie is terrible  there are too many plotholes to count that dont make any sense in the continuity in the films palpatine is back for no other reason than  to replace snoke they dont even explain how he survived or why he sent that ridiculous message at the beginning of the movie  they did a complete copout and used see throwaway line from revenge of the sith about sith abilities being unnatural just total rubbish and shows jj is a complete hack whose gimmick is just making everything so mysterious and intriguing and than giving lame nonsensical endings  they spemd no time discussing how palpatine was able to survive yet they waste so much time in the movie on these ridiculous subplots and mcguffins and new useless characters  kerri russels character was completely unnecessary and did not need to be in there  i could pick this apart for hours so all ill say is this movie is garbage nonsensical  and completely devoid of any vision its the worst star wars movie ever made even though attack of the clones was bad and cheezy as least it made sense in the vision of the trilogy but this movie makes no sense and is just overall ridiculous
Feb 20 2020,negative,really disappointing i was one of the few who loved the last jedi so this felt like an absolute mess in comparison the visual effects are stunning and there definitely are some enjoyable parts of the film but the plot is just characters running around from planet to planet the palpatine reveal felt like a cheat and the fact that his return was never explained was infuriating
Feb 20 2020,positive,it was good but seemed very familiar  was a lot like the first movie  left me with the feeling that there could be more movies to come  which would be great
Feb 20 2020,positive,i liked all of the sequel movies this one was the least good of the sequel trilogy movies in my opinion but it was still absolutely amazing
Feb 20 2020,negative,force healing palpatine never dies because reasons rey is the avatar palpatine is the dark avatar its simultaneously ripping other stuff off and also attempting to retcon the previous movie and also other force rules for reasons this is the worst writing ive ever seen for this series
Feb 20 2020,positive,everything was just fine c display name and take that the
Feb 20 2020,negative,grew up with the original three films  this film was a space turd compared to the original films
Feb 20 2020,negative,this movie was ass it was too long it was boring the characters entire development thus far was stunted their personalities were deflated how could anyone have wanted palpatine back in our faces awful literally laughable throughout rose and finn got did so dirty undeservedly so the ending was the most unspeakable part i could not have imagined something more ridiculous to have a story this good and bulldoze it in this way is very impressive and disappointing justice for rian johnson
Feb 20 2020,negative,movie ok did not live up to its predecessors
Feb 20 2020,positive,this movie is a great mix of new talent and surprise tributes to the past  go see this movie and may the force be with you
Feb 20 2020,positive,it was an awesome movie what a way to end tha saga it was my 3rd favorite of all the star wars series
Feb 20 2020,positive,this was the best star wars of them all  tied all of the original trilogy into the prequels  the final trilogy bringing the original actors back into play as well  well done
Feb 20 2020,positive,tied a lot of pieces together
Feb 20 2020,negative,alright but garbage at the same time
Feb 20 2020,negative,it was trash because luke likes it
Feb 20 2020,negative,yikes this movie is a mess im going to pretend it doesnt exist it exists for the sole purpose of retconning an even better star wars film the last jedi the plot is incoherent its full of nostalgia thrown in for fans of the original trilogy which wouldnt be bad except the nostalgia doesnt make sense
Feb 20 2020,positive,another great star wars saga is there another one
Feb 20 2020,positive,i really liked this movie a nice ending to the storyline
Feb 19 2020,positive,i enjoyed watching this movie  way better than the last jedi  i just love reys character  she kicks arse  kylo ren never did it for me in this trilogy but redeems himself mostly in this one  didnt exactly make sense to me the emperors returnbut definitely didnt ruin the film
Feb 19 2020,positive,the rise of the skywalker was an excellent addition to the star wars universe the film had great special effects  a lot of the entire star wars story line comes to a conclusion within this movie
Feb 19 2020,negative,something unexpected happened to me during this movie i felt nothing i could notice that the movie was doing everything it could to pull me in with all the epicness and the nostalgia pulling all the tricks it had and yet all i could see were the strings pulling the puppets and a pupeteer going through the motions of a damage control performance trying to please everyone and risking nothing in the process
Feb 19 2020,negative,something unexpected happened to me during this movie i felt nothing i could notice that the movie was doing everything it could to pull me in with all the epicness and the nostalgia pulling all the tricks it had and yet all i could see were the strings pulling the puppets and a pupeteer going through the motions of a damage control performance trying to please everyone and risking nothing in the process
Feb 19 2020,positive,like all star wars movies its filled with great action and cgi and as the story progressed i would never have expected the way it ended
Feb 19 2020,positive,im not a star wars aficionado but heard good things and had to see it  it kept my interest all through and i enjoyed it
Feb 19 2020,positive,great movie it was a redemption to the last jefi
Feb 19 2020,negative,2nd worst star wars so far
Feb 19 2020,positive,several activities going on at once keeping you informed as to what and why
Feb 19 2020,negative,pathetic what an absolute disgrace
Feb 19 2020,positive,fun from start to finish  makes a few leaps of faith  but an adventure throughout
Feb 19 2020,positive,han  luke  and leia did it 40 years ago now rey   finn  and poe did it 40 years later it was a fun ride
Feb 19 2020,positive,i did not liked the 3rd act ben and ray did good 
Feb 19 2020,negative,one of the shittiest movies ive ever seen with no logic in any of the world or character actions that completely ruin star wars lore
Feb 19 2020,negative,as the end to a saga 42 years in the making the rise of skywalker is incredibly disappointing  every time a character dies in the film just wait a few minutes this issue of the lack of stakes is a continuous one throughout the film kylo rens mask which was destroyed in the last jedi has been rebuilt yet its cracks much like the films are showing chewbacca dies yet he is actually still alive c3pos memory is erased yet magically it is restored   the films plot equates to not much more than an inane side quest in a video game that has you fast traveling from planet to planet in search of various thingamajigs such as wayfinder devices and daggers inscribed with secret sith text new characters like zorii bliss and jannah feel like npcs you meet along the way rather than living breathing characters  the rise of skywalker fails to accomplish every one of its objectives providing a satisfying end for the character of leia which was not an enviable position to be in given the obvious restraints providing answers regarding reys past concluding the reykylo relationship and providing an overall satisfying ending for the trilogy and saga as a whole   babu frick may be the only redeeming quality of the film but it is hard not to think that novelty characters like these are created merely for the purpose of selling merchandise and toy dolls which has defined the production of the star wars franchise for decades sadly the rise of skywalker is the latest example of what happens when filmmaking is pursued for the purposes of making money rather than artistic inspiration
Feb 19 2020,negative,dont know where to begin commercial as to be crass rehash the same themes and scenes from the precedent movies add a bit of dr strange supernatural powers to the old mix and  drive to the bank  perhaps the worse of these all
Feb 19 2020,negative,cowardly cowardly cowardly to pare a woman romantically with her literal mind rapist torturer and stalker is beyond disgusting and despicable  at every turn they showed that they cared only for pandering to the absolute worst bad faith criticisms of the previous movies  jj abrams i am disgusted
Feb 19 2020,positive,not my favorite star wars episode but in the top half and it does a good job of wrapping up the story
Feb 19 2020,negative,abrams did his best to undo everything johnson did in the last jedi but it was an impossible task as with the last two films in the sequel trilogy the characters are plain except for kylo ren this movie would have been good if it was split up to make the entire sequel trilogy the pacing was fast so you didnt have time to catch all the massive plot holes that plagued its 2h22m run time on top of that rey stole lukes entire story she even stole his sunset
Feb 19 2020,positive,story line  very uninspiring
Feb 19 2020,positive,really good and accurate love it
Feb 19 2020,positive,the movie was great
Feb 19 2020,positive,the movie was awesome
Feb 19 2020,negative,this is a bad film it continues the reylo bs from the last jedi there are many things in the film that dont make sense overall it excuses domestic violence a la reylo much like the last jedi i wont ever own this on dvd evade this film at all costs
Feb 18 2020,negative,hmm 43 years to finish the 9 films did not meet expectations although wrapped long story arcs decently hate to note it however too much gratuitous fx wandering story lines
Feb 18 2020,negative,way to many plot holes lame story shit all over the lore there was not one thing about this movie that made sense
Feb 18 2020,positive,loved it one of the best star wars movies
Feb 18 2020,negative,this was an absolute disaster this movie does not feel like star wars not only is it a badly written and terribly paced movie but it is also a horrible star wars movie the worst thing about this however is that it is the last movie in the skywalker saga wow  its a shame i have to give this movie even half of a star
Feb 18 2020,positive,excellent cast  so glad to have seen it with my family
Feb 18 2020,positive,good movie there are some things that i would change but overall it was a good movie

Feb 18 2020,positive,i appreciated how this film pulled  all of the story together  it was a fitting end to a great saga
Feb 18 2020,positive,great balance of action friendship love comedy and creativity
Feb 18 2020,negative,spoiler warning they kiss then kylo dies right after such a disappointment for a fan like me
Feb 18 2020,negative,star wars the rise of skywalker is an extremely fast messy and overwhelming movie that loads all of its plot points into a shotgun and fires them directly into the eyes of its audience however the movie isnt actually the worst thing ever its certainly better than the phantom menace and attack of the clones despite what some diehard fans might say but then again better than garbage isnt exactly high praise either it has some funny quips some cool if exhausting action scenes and a whole lot of lightsaber fights but unfortunately it simply fails to tell a compelling story in a way that is both narratively comprehensible and actually engaging to the audience it is basically a transformers movie with a star wars coat of paint as kylo ren once said let the past die kill it if you have to and disney has certainly followed that advice with this one
Feb 18 2020,positive,story was disjointed and formulaic instead of one planetkiller deathstar there were thousands of super ships with planetkiller weapons  too loud in the theater  rather stay home and get it on cable  the seats were excellent powered recliners  worth the price of the ticket by themselves
Feb 18 2020,positive,i loved the story line and it wasnt predictable suspenseful with as always great special effects
Feb 18 2020,positive,valiant effort in trying to correct the course of this franchise the first third of the movie skipped around too much but after that it found its pacing good conclusion to an ok trio of movies
Feb 17 2020,positive,not mad about the ending
Feb 17 2020,positive,amazing ending to it all
Feb 17 2020,positive,i thought it was a great way to end the saga they did it with all the information they had based on the last jedi i know they probably wanted the same director for all three so there were some different interpretation of the 8th and 9th one overall the way it ended was amazing it came around full circle to episode 4 and tied into the first episode
Feb 17 2020,positive,awesome storyline and action
Feb 17 2020,positive,great movie with tie into the last movies
Feb 17 2020,positive,great finish to the saga
Feb 17 2020,neutral,this movie lacks good pastinga good story but it was better than the last jedi
Feb 17 2020,positive,i was not expecting the movie to go as it did
Feb 17 2020,positive,pretty good star wars movie seemed a little rushed
Feb 17 2020,negative,trash like trash can

Feb 17 2020,negative,stupidest movie dumbest story line wouldve been better if she would have turned evil
Feb 17 2020,positive,a great end to the skywalker saga

Feb 17 2020,negative,bad movie ruins the entire story

Feb 17 2020,positive,same ol flavor feel good formula check all the boxes for a family blockbuster sound editing and mixing is amazing and exciting glad to see the live costume characters felt cheesy with all the return characters but still its star wars
Feb 17 2020,positive,loved it great way to wrap up the series
Feb 17 2020,positive,loved itworth the wait
Feb 17 2020,positive,did not get out of my seat the whole movie
Feb 17 2020,positive,while the writing is a hit or miss the rise of skywalker is a not so bad finale to the saga
Feb 17 2020,positive,episode ix did not disappoint action packed from start to finish
Feb 17 2020,positive,decent closure to the nine chapter story by george lucas
Feb 17 2020,negative,a sad ending to a great franchise feels more like a mish mash of characters lazily cobbled together into a reel than an actual movie there are so many flat spots wtf and why did they put this character in here moments that it isnt worth the investment to bother caring the carrie fisher footage is so poorly incorporated it almost is offensive on a holotupac level if you love star wars skip this one and imagine the film it should have been
Feb 17 2020,positive,loved the storyline  very suspenseful  great visual affects
Feb 16 2020,positive,great special effects 
Feb 16 2020,negative,didnt like it it didnt seem like an actual movie as most of the time it was arrogant rey just running off
Feb 16 2020,positive,i felt like somethings were missing out of this ending like one major thing the close of the love story for anyone everyone had a well maybe love story just to end it as it was i mean its star wars great film but as far as this movie goes it wasnt finished but i can tell they were like lets just end the saga and move on to the next which was a horrible way to go out reminds me of the horrid got ending like what is going on is the movie business in need of fresh new ideas and blood or are they just tired themselves of doing the same kind of movie like someone the other day mention to me why we cant have a sith movie which it would be assume to see the full power of the dark side and it would have to be rated r to be great but honestly i just want to see more of what the force can do i always feel as if i never really get to see the full power of the force and the level of skills i can truly do i mean mind control the push lifting fighter jets or stopping them all expected give me something to wow me as the lighting coming from reys hands did where is the power
Feb 16 2020,positive,cherry on top of the pie what a way to end this saga
Feb 16 2020,positive,saw it twice loved it both times if i stop and actually think about it i start hating it but it was just nice to see the main characters actually go on a clone warsrebel style adventure
Feb 16 2020,negative,basically took a shit on star wars
Feb 16 2020,positive,it was anti climatic for a movie that was supposed to tie up the entire star wars saga
Feb 16 2020,positive,amazing perfect end story
Feb 16 2020,positive,i really loved how this completed the saga for now it was truly brought a fitting end to the sith i am sure for now  look forward to seeing how disney and lucas films takes the saga
Feb 16 2020,positive,entertaining but not as good as the originals
Feb 16 2020,positive,a must see for a star wars fan
Feb 16 2020,negative,absolute trash movie
Feb 16 2020,positive,maybe the appearance of the emperor may be strange but the movie accomplishes to give a great story and moments to finish with a goldbelt the skywalker saga
Feb 16 2020,negative,very predictable i hope its the last one
Feb 16 2020,positive,with an excellent direction by j j abrams a formidable script by chris terrio and abrams a great story by derek connolly colin trevorrow abrams and terrio a more frantic pacing stunning and beautiful visual effects which in my opinion are the best of the entire franchise exciting action scenes a wonderful and unforgettable soundtrack by john williams a stupendous sound edition by matthew wood and david acord and exceptional performances by carrie fisher rest in peace our princess mark hamill adam driver daisy ridley john boyega oscar isaac anthony daniels naomi ackie domhnall gleeson richard e grant lupita nyongo keri russell joonas suotamo kelly marie tran ian mcdiarmid and billy dee williams star wars the rise of skywalker manages to be exciting memorable epic and a more than satisfactory conclusion for the skywalker saga
Feb 16 2020,negative,worst closing of an already rotten trilogy i have ever seen childhood ruined
Feb 16 2020,negative,movie was a huge let down the action scenes took forever and ben died it couldve been better
Feb 16 2020,negative,they killed the original characters and delivered weak ridiculous and instantaneous new ones the agenda on the new trilogy screw with it  i think that would be better with the triumph of the emperor at the end this is not a star wars film and for me the end of the trilogy was at return of the jedi
Feb 16 2020,negative,2 stars only by the grace of adam drivers acting a dumpster fire of retconning
Feb 16 2020,positive,the movie is spectacular
Feb 16 2020,negative,a disappointing ending to the skywalker saga the writing is horrendous scattered illogical and all over the place still there are incredible scenes backed with great performances state of the art vfx and john williams masterful score
Feb 16 2020,positive,it has everything that was missing from the previous episode deus ex machina all the time done quickly and without thinking
Feb 16 2020,positive,probably the best one
Feb 16 2020,negative,a patchwork of a movie with plottwists able to embarass the cheesiest animes
Feb 16 2020,negative,i feel like disney spent a lot of money to spam high user reviews for this film it had great special effects with a garbage story that made no sense in terms of the larger established saga and the best thing i have herd said about it is that it poorly attempted to undo the damage the previous film did  i personalty saw this film as at best creating stories for new characters for a future story while abandoning the lost cause
Feb 16 2020,positive,i loved the ending it was sad knowing that ben aka kylo ren dies 
Feb 16 2020,positive,its cringey it makes little sense in the wider canon and it makes me question the point of the sequel trilogy but its also fan service and emotional and sometimes thats all cinema needs to do
Feb 16 2020,positive,i really enjoyed it they did a nice job cleaning up the mess made in the last jedi they kind of went back to the basics of what made star wars such a popular movie franchise in the first place
Feb 16 2020,positive,i waited a while to see this one because the last few have been one disappointment another yet i was pleasantly surprised how good this one was it didnt feel heavy handed it was finally given a light touch loved the little twist and especially loved the conclusion
Feb 16 2020,negative,all i gotta say is that theres never going to be a star wars like the first nor the second 
Feb 16 2020,negative,so disappointing but to their credit they tried to give fans eveything they were missing from the last two movies however it was too little too late one movies is not enough to undo the damage done by the two previous star wars movies plus all of the interesting scenes are given away by the teasers and trailers
Feb 16 2020,neutral,ugh just a jumbled mess of scenes some were good some were bad
Feb 16 2020,positive,loved it kept me on the edge of my seat the whole moviekept me wanting more didnt feel like 2 12 hours long
Feb 16 2020,positive,i mean yes ive watched all of the star wars movies yes even the bad ones i thoroughly enjoyed this installment as always it left off with an opening to continue the storyline the cgi pieces were phenomenal
Feb 16 2020,positive,great fight scenes humor very entertaining liked it 
Feb 16 2020,positive,way better than the last jedi but still has many flaws
Feb 16 2020,positive,great dialogue and very classical was just looking for more special effect and lightsaber usage
Feb 16 2020,positive,i felt this film wrapped up the trilogy very nicely while leaving doors open for additional stories as well as showing many callbacks to the original films
Feb 16 2020,positive,overall i enjoyed the movie there were moments when i feel it lagged and got boring but only a few i really liked how they tied in the previous movies by answering the loose ends
Feb 16 2020,positive,jj abrams did a masterful job in tying the star wars saga  this was our 2nd time viewing star wars and we picked up nuances that we didnt notice the first time  we thoroughly enjoyed the movie
Feb 16 2020,positive,a powerful movie that wrapped up mostly a satisfying experience only sad that this had to be the end
Feb 16 2020,positive,absolutely loved it the twist was awesome
Feb 16 2020,positive,it was a good movie had its flaws but you should definitely see it
Feb 16 2020,positive,really good movie with a lot of themes being completed
Feb 15 2020,neutral,its a good movie just not my cup of tea not very much action
Feb 15 2020,negative,not worth the money words cant express my disappointment at this mcguffin fetchquest excuse of a movie if i get into plotholes world breaking question marks and lack of character development ill be here all day wish i could give a minus score
Feb 15 2020,positive,excellent movie excellent special effects and as always it delivers i really enjoyed the little extra that was put in this film on chewbacca would not have expected anything less from the star wars franchise
Feb 15 2020,neutral,while being a fun movie that was enjoyable to sit through as a fan the disconnect from the previous films and dedication more to please the fans than to tell a good story hurts it upon rewatches
Feb 15 2020,positive,a perfect ending to the amazing series the treatment of the princess leia character was perfect and emotionally touching it has everything that makes a movie great plot twist amazing special effects and character defining moments
Feb 15 2020,positive,it was a great continuation of the star wars story i especially loved the ending  no spoilers here
Feb 15 2020,negative,any excitement and promise of getting to know the fantastic new batch of characters introduced in the force awakens and then left to find their own meaning in the last jedi was erased in this movie  this trilogy started with a bang had a wonderful twist of a second act but finished with nonsensical fanservice from a loud minority of fans
Feb 15 2020,positive,ive watched star wars since it came out 42years ago action packed special effects suspense and love it was great
Feb 15 2020,positive,eh a little over the place but still entertaining  may piss you off if you are a diehard fan of the franchise
Feb 15 2020,negative,the character upgrade is not happened and the story is croweded and bad
Feb 15 2020,negative,the worst one out of all of them i dont know how they did it
Feb 15 2020,positive,a little disjointed but answered a lot of questions
Feb 15 2020,negative,rise of skywalker is a movie that tries to please everyone while not spending the time to earn its heartfelt moments an over focus on fan demands rather than a cohesive story structure and narrative
Feb 15 2020,positive,well done in typical star wars fashion of course nice wrap up of the characters and story line
Feb 15 2020,neutral,not the best but it was good
Feb 15 2020,positive,had a good plot and was easily the best of the three new star wars episodes i like where they took each of the characters stories and how they grew each character
Feb 15 2020,positive,i thought it was a great movie with familiar themes however its star wars and i wasnt disappointed the ending could have been a bit more conclusive but i thought the movie was very grasping
Feb 15 2020,neutral,i almost feel bad for jj knowing what riann johnson left him to work with almost this movie doesnt know what it wants to be too much humor in first act just over the top with oneliners i did enjoy the retcons that were thrown in probably the best parts of the movie  also everything is just thrown at the screen and the movie is whats left that stuck was hoping for a better ending that was 40 years in the making thanks riann johnson
Feb 15 2020,positive,love love love people will disagree but be thankful we get more star wars it may not be the story i wanted but it was someones story so im glad it was made star wars fans stop being so cranky and enjoy the sagas
Feb 15 2020,positive,it was great though palpatines return didnt make sense and the plot was a bit rushed this movie definitely ended the saga on a much higher note despite its ups and downs
Feb 15 2020,positive,non stop action fantastic cinematography and good story line loved it
Feb 15 2020,positive,a touching and beautiful ending to a epic story
Feb 15 2020,positive,good way to end the seriesif in fact it has ended
Feb 15 2020,positive,have been a star wars fan from day one episode ix does not disappoint great conclusion to an epic saga that started in 1977 must see on the big screen
Feb 15 2020,positive,what a way to end the star wars story loved it
Feb 15 2020,negative,an awful movie that has a senseless plot that neither makes sense within the premises it sets out nor in connection with the other star wars movie in the new trilogy let alone the rest of the series its a complete garble  great special effects and in some ways a more interesting film that the other two of the new trilogy but still terrible and nonsensical the star wars legends stories are the real star wars
Feb 15 2020,positive,was ok im past the childlike enamoration with the sw franchise but this was ok
Feb 15 2020,positive,they did the best with what they had
Feb 14 2020,positive,absolutely loved the movie made up for the disasters of the last jedi
Feb 14 2020,positive,its exactly what youd expect in a star wars movie
Feb 14 2020,positive,a definite must see for star wars fans  a nice wrap up of characters and plots as well as having potential for spinoffs  well done disney
Feb 14 2020,positive,i love star wars and i think lots of critics are too hard on this franchise it can also be said that the fans as a whole are too hard on these movies it is hard to please everyone but i did love this movie
Feb 14 2020,positive,nice wrap up to the modern trilogy
Feb 14 2020,positive,good story great characters and adventure the theme of this star wars made this a favorite film  the redemption and act of goodness that changed k ren from evil to choosing good due to goodness  kindness demonstrated by rae
Feb 14 2020,positive,i liked it obviously the death of carrie fischer caused them to have to make changes but i found it entertaining despite reviews id heard
Feb 14 2020,positive,great action good story overall well acted and well directed would have been 5 stars except there were some pretty glaring missteps with the writing
Feb 14 2020,positive,the best star wars movie ever  star wars tros is amazing from the cinematography to the adventure that awaits its everything you want from a star wars film that is why in my opinion it is the best star wars film  spoilers  the film gets straight to the action with a crawl like no other it pans down to mustafar where we see kylo ren slaughtering those in his way to get the sith wayfinder it then takes him to exegol and he meets emperor palpatine and the entire scene is spinetingling also he doesnt explain how he survived which creates suspence later on rey is trying to pull a transport and she erupts force lightning from her hand and she thinks she had killed chewbacca eventualy though we find out hes alive c3po has his memory wiped which was a sad moment but hope goes on when r2 restores his memory later on in the film also in the middle of the film we find out reys true lineage she is the granddaughter of palpatine she finds her way to the emperors wayfinder on the remains of the second death star and faces her greatest fear herself she then fights kylo as well leia than speaks to kylo through the force and dies a vision of han solo then fully redeems ben solo rey goes to achto and luke skywalker tells her of training his sister by a flashback and persuades rey to continue fighting the final battle is incredible ben joins rey as she fights the emperor palpatine then takes the life force of the 2 and finds out that they are a diad in the force then he chucks ben in a pit and uses force storm that was the best bit then rey hears the voices of the jedi of the past beautiful she rises and proclaims and i am all the jedi and with the strength of all the jedi defeats palpatine once and for all the last part of the film returns to tatooine at the home of lukes uncle  aunt and we see rey buries luke and leias lightsaber and shows us her new one then a traveller walks past and asks who she is rey looks at luke and leias force ghosts in the distance and saysrey  rey skywalker and the film ends with her looking at the twin sunsthis was when i cried so much so fitting she was born of evil but she was not evil she saw luke and leia as the parents she never had  this film is mindblowing i 100 recommend it
Feb 14 2020,positive,not a star wars fan but i was entertained by this movie it is a worth a watch on the big screen with a good sound system
Feb 14 2020,positive,i would say it was good worth watching one time
Feb 14 2020,positive,the perfect ending to my favorite saga
Feb 14 2020,positive,great action humor and story telling
Feb 14 2020,positive,it was pretty good considering what the last jedi gave us
Feb 14 2020,negative,ruined star wars re anakins arc and the extinction of the skywalkers solos and amidalas while palpatine lives on in rey after ludicrously coming back from the dead such a mess and disaster of a movie literally made me want to die ben solo was amazing however
Feb 14 2020,negative,it was as if someone took all of the star wars movies of the past added some harry potter and stuck them in a blender and out spewed this film  extremely dissatisfying to watch
Feb 14 2020,negative,much more enjoyable than episode viii but truly a disjointed movie the lightning scenes were way too jarring the plot buildup to how rey is basically the avatar of the star wars universe without training is lame and poor writing i was incredibly disappointed in the pacing of this movie and will not be watching it again for a long time
Feb 14 2020,positive,better than the last one but still predictable and not a fan of how far these films now differ from the old ones disney is just trying to churn them out and make a lot of money 
Feb 14 2020,positive,enjoyed it sorry to see them come to an end have always been a fan makes me want to binge watch all again
Feb 14 2020,neutral,the cgi and graphic are cool but not a good story repeating plots
Feb 14 2020,negative,please no more of this crap worst acting ever
Feb 14 2020,neutral,just a bad moviethis movie tries to put 2 movies into 1 because it tries to make up for the mistakes in tlj the second act has some good momentsonly some but the first and third act is a joke this entire plot line makes no sense
Feb 14 2020,positive,great movie lots of great actors killer scenes great effects
Feb 14 2020,negative,i cant believe i am saying this butit was even worse than tlj how the hell is that even possible i know ruin johnson left  jar jar nothing to work with but wow just wow
Feb 14 2020,positive,it was good to see jj abrahms back at the helm for a star wars movie it was a like a b  i wasnt blown away but i really enjoyed it it was worth seeing in theaters
Feb 14 2020,positive,if there was a how to make a star wars movie video this movie followed it to tee it had all the right feels in all the right places
Feb 14 2020,positive,this has been long overdue
Feb 13 2020,negative,generic cash grab leading to a boring plot not star wars
Feb 13 2020,positive,it was an amazing end to an amazing series i just love when good triumphs over evil very fond memories since 1977 thank you george lucas
Feb 13 2020,negative,the half a star rating may be a bit biased from my end due to the love i hold for this franchise if you are to look at the movie as a stand alone entity its still likely to be a 2 star experience at most the last jedi while having its flaws was a fresh look on the star wars story this movie takes a uturn on every decision made in the previous movie and crashes to a startling halt while trying to tie this whole mess of a movie together
Feb 13 2020,positive,it was great it was dark it was exciting and hopeful
Feb 13 2020,negative,for the amazing cast they had  its unfortunate how flawed and rotten it was i feel bad for those that followed star wars from the beginning id be pissed too if a series i loved was ruined by 2 different directors and shipping fans the only good thing is the actors in this film become successful and do projects that deserve their talents
Feb 13 2020,negative,pretty corny flick even for a star wars film
Feb 13 2020,positive,as a major star wars fan i was happy to see similarities with episode vi i would recommend this movie to people who didnt enjoy the the previous two episodes like me at the beginning the plot was slow and a little rocky but the second half reminded me of why i started watching the saga in the first place
Feb 13 2020,negative,it was hot nostalgic garbage waste of time and money the plot sucked couldnt even think of a new villain so decided to bring back palpatine
Feb 13 2020,positive,was slightly disappointed in all characters story lines  ive watched all the star wars movies multiple times and can say the other movies were phenomenal  im not a a scream writer i can honestly say i wouldve liked to see the stories of all the charactersend differently
Feb 13 2020,negative,the only thing that is not a disaster here is the performance of adam driver the script lacking imagination the characters that appear meaningless and an address that does nothing but highlight the flaws in all other aspects in the end what could have been simple fanservice it became a disaster painful to see
Feb 13 2020,positive,it was the best out of the more recent movies there was closer i felt it was rushed this could have been a mind blowing movie as it is its was good to see atleast once
Feb 13 2020,negative,hopefully disney will put this franchise to rest
Feb 13 2020,positive,dragged on in some areas but in general it was good
Feb 13 2020,positive,listen its not the original trilogy but its still a good popcorn movie and an acceptable wrapup to the skywalker saga manage expectations
Feb 13 2020,positive,if you just love starwars movies because they are about starwars the you will love this one too i have seen it 5x so far  i think its great  sure there are plot holes everything has that  but it is a great story
Feb 13 2020,positive,i liked the story line and the outcome of the movie the acting was amazing and the twists in the story where unexpected and tantalizing in short the suspense was there and the emotions where real and touched me deeply
Feb 13 2020,positive,lots of action easy to follow stayed true to the series
Feb 13 2020,negative,is this the worst star wars movie ever maybe but it has strong competition with the last jedi fans hate this but disney doesnt care
Feb 13 2020,positive,the return to tatuione was a fitting ending but i was disappointed with the final fate of ben solo
Feb 13 2020,positive,great special effects obviously a nice twist of finding out who she really is no spoiler alert and bad guys switching sides was a surprise too hopefully there is one more in the making
Feb 13 2020,positive,wow this was so amazing the acting was perfect there was the right amount of story and the right amount of action this truly feels like the end of the skywalker saga i loved the surprises i loved every second of this film the score was beautiful the cinematography was good in most parts every second i was on the edge of my seat the shocks and surprises really did surprises me it was truly an amazing adventure thank you to all the people involved in these films and may the force be with you
Feb 13 2020,positive,the last movie of the skywalker saga was absolutely a perfect ending to the franchise and it was absolutely amazing the visual effects original score and sound editing was excellent its definitely a must see 
Feb 13 2020,positive,really great end to an incredible franchise dont listen to the negative reviews
Feb 13 2020,negative,disney has completey destroy star wars  this movie is  rushed mess the whole trilogy was a mess with no clear direction
Feb 13 2020,positive,this movie made me just about cry every time  it is amazing  it ties up the whole saga  i loved it
Feb 13 2020,positive,not the way i would have ended this epic tale but the movie itself was fine fans should definitely watch but moreso because its a star wars movie and not because its a masterpiece of film
Feb 13 2020,negative,wow jj abrams what a disappointment totally disrespected the star wars tradition fans and george lucas this movie was worst then episode i i mean no mystery what so ever toward the plot you couldnt spend more on how the idea of the emperor came to be a zombie wtf thats what that was zombie emperor palpatine next time copy a good story not one already done anyways just wanted to tell powells dont waste your time with this one wait till boba fett film is made hence kevin smith as director
Feb 13 2020,positive,best movie up there with force awakens  dont listen to the haters  youll love this movie
Feb 13 2020,positive,a great end to the new trilogy  full of fun action and nostalgia
Feb 13 2020,positive,the plot was not the best completely unrealistic that palpatine survived not 1 but 2 explosions but the fam service throughout the film 100 made that almost obsolete hearing anakin obi wan ahsoka all the jedi at the end was incredible and gave me a nice good bye to the series i call my entire childhood
Feb 13 2020,positive,the acting was great no dull moments lots of intense action
Feb 13 2020,positive,i liked the commradery of the characters and how it pointed at we are not alone even though the advesary wants to make us feel alone i liked that kiloren changed and began to help the good side and liked the way it showed that those who passed on are still with us
Feb 13 2020,positive,a good end but boy am i going to miss star wars
Feb 13 2020,negative,rushed messy and illogical the movie is a spectacle to behold partly because of the consistently great acting paired with consistently incredibly scoring and backdrops but mostly because it is painfully obvious just how little either writer understood about what anything in the skywalker saga meant to the characters in the story or the audience watching it
Feb 13 2020,positive,great plot and storyline loved the way all of my favorite plot lines converged
Feb 13 2020,negative,very poorly written without being biased the writing and plot are all over the place and is attempting to capture all the nostalgia of the original trilogy in a single film and the lastminute change and concept of palpatine suddenly returning is ridiculous especially in the first 5 minutes of the films runtime
Feb 13 2020,positive,i would have given this more of a 45 maybe this is a good movie although slightly predictable i felt like some things were left open vs closing it all up but all in all the movie was enjoyable its definitely worthwhile to watch
Feb 13 2020,positive,a little slow in parts overall a good ending to the star wars series
Feb 13 2020,positive,sound visual effects story line tied all the episodes together
Feb 12 2020,positive,what it lacks in story pacing and character it makes up for with a great score amazing visuals and superb acting from all involved and of course ian mcdirmid is still killing it as the evil emperor
Feb 12 2020,positive,i thought the movie was great i only wish they gave us one movie with rey and kylo ren ben solo to give us a good show of their powers combined the ending however was fitting enough i love the series and i am looking forward to what comes next
Feb 12 2020,positive,loved it great ending to the skywalker saga
Feb 12 2020,positive,i actually like the apology they did a good job trying to give us back star wars
Feb 12 2020,positive,this movie isnt entirely awful though it does have an okay ending to the saga the overall film is enjoyable but the characters werent well used and i didnt like them as much also some of the plot points and acting wasnt great and i feel this movie should have took more time to get the story and everything right as it did not rating b
Feb 12 2020,negative,how to take the best thing of the series kylo ren character development and throw it away not to mention everything else like the emperor implausible survival and shitty end
Feb 12 2020,neutral,the movie had a lot of moments i felt were supposed to be heartfelt but just came off as either unintentionally funny or pandering it certainly wasnt bad but it wasnt good either
Feb 12 2020,negative,disney do better dont write your movies at the shareholder meeting please
Feb 12 2020,positive,great movie i loved all the scenes with kylo and ray
Feb 12 2020,negative,disappointing what could have been a great conclusion to the franchise ended up being a trying to save whats left pacing was wayyy too fast and dialogue and story decisions were laugh out load stupid only positive was ben soloskylo ren story arc coming to a good ending but that doesnt save the film hopefully itll be a long time ago in a galaxy far far away the next time a star wars film comes to theatre
Feb 12 2020,positive,great finish except i wanted to see rae and ren together
Feb 12 2020,positive,enjoyed the storyline and action was a little slow at times and seemed too long because of that but left you wanting for the series to continue
Feb 12 2020,negative,terrible another franchise i used to love has been butchered
Feb 12 2020,negative,worst star wars film ever its a rushed mess that relies on nostalgia and fan service to make people happy without having to think of anything original and it messes up the 8 films before it doing so
Feb 12 2020,positive,the best star war movie ever
Feb 12 2020,positive,good movie i hated that kiss scene
Feb 12 2020,positive,didnt like that rae keep on taking off without her team  back up 
Feb 12 2020,positive,not original or deep but thats not what star wars flicks are for while the writing was painful and clichéd the cinematography action flow of the story as well as weaponcostumeenvironment designs were both compelling and inspiring adam driver is an awesome sith lord
Feb 12 2020,positive,it bulges with fan service but i really enjoyed it
Feb 12 2020,positive,its star wars whats not to like
Feb 12 2020,positive,exciting with constant action and we finally learned reys story so glad the force won as we all knew it would but wish we had been able to learn who rey ended up withso not entirely happy with the ending otherwise great movie
Feb 12 2020,positive,ties everything up and puts a bow on it great finale to the saga fun
Feb 12 2020,positive,very good story line to tie up the last of the star wars skywalkers
Feb 12 2020,positive,it was not up to star wars level
Feb 12 2020,positive,it all comes to a satisfying end after the garbage dump that was the last jedi
Feb 12 2020,positive,well made movie but the right decision to finish it off the story is played out
Feb 12 2020,negative,the visuals are good as id expect from a star wars movie   but the story and how they finish it is godawful and an insult to this franchise
Feb 12 2020,positive,best one of the new trilogy of course not perfect but very entertaining
Feb 12 2020,negative,this was an actual slap in the face to anyone who cares about star wars trash storyline it was all a load of bs fan service with no substance
Feb 12 2020,positive,fun characters to root for but a very messy plot which has become the norm for this franchise
Feb 11 2020,positive,fabulous finish to a saga i enjoy
Feb 11 2020,positive,i cried when ren said her last name at the end all pieces and folks in good place
Feb 11 2020,negative,it was bad very bad to bad its so bad
Feb 11 2020,positive,i saw this movie in 4d and it was absolutely breathtaking the action was undeniably better than the previous instalments the character development has come a long way i am looking forward to the future of this new franchise 
Feb 11 2020,negative,thats not how the force works
Feb 11 2020,positive,the best of the skywalker trilogy adam drivers smile at the end was worth aiting for
Feb 11 2020,positive,a fastpaced movie that takes no time to breathe its nonstop and proves to be its downfall theres definitely a great movie there but there are too many missteps that unfortunately stop that from happening the return of palpatine creates new issues and there are certain scenes that are very familiar from another disneyowned franchise that ended a saga recently
Feb 11 2020,positive,nice action sequences alot of fan service a couple items are alittle too blown up to be believable even in the star wars universe
Feb 11 2020,positive,i loved the plot twist of rey being emperor palatine granddaughter and ben turning back to the jedi
Feb 11 2020,negative,waste of time
Feb 11 2020,positive,it should have been 2 parts to this movie i honestly felt gypt out of the darkside version of the whole movie we had bits and pieces and whatever was that warp jump moment between worlds they never ever talked about but the story was pretty good and i wish the ending wasnt the ending but if your a starwars fan just get this into your system and get it over with your childhood will be questioned about what you just seen  hanjedisolo
Feb 11 2020,positive,loved all the twists in the story but it made it a long movie i will buy it on blueray
Feb 11 2020,positive,amazing film  best of the latest trilogy  not sure why the vitriol people need to sit back and enjoy more
Feb 11 2020,negative,i dont have the words to accurately describe just how awful this movie was  story decisions made no sense whatsoever  worst star wars movie ive ever seen and yes im including the prequels in that
Feb 11 2020,positive,a film that is a strong ending to the saga i see why other fans and critics may not enjoy it but it is a fun film with emotion and action putting a bow on the saga
Feb 11 2020,negative,this movie is more for teens and youngsters
Feb 11 2020,negative,they did something unforgivable with one of the most beloved characters of the whole franchise
Feb 11 2020,positive,i dont know why people hate it it was a good star wars movie obviously is not the empire stikes back but it was pretty good
Feb 11 2020,positive,best movie ever of 2019 dont listen to the critics on this one and the perfect conclusion to any franchise just like toy story 4
Feb 11 2020,positive,this was easily the best and most exciting movie in the new trilogy however too many mistakes and disappointments from the second installment the last jedi killed the momentum of the series i am a life long star wars fan i am glad that dave filoni is helming the mandolorian with john favreau you can immediately see the difference back to this movie the action and visuals are top notch the story mostly sticks to gaining momentum toward the conclusion there are a few missteps but overall it is enjoyable and entertaining some folks will sit and stew with resentments for the direction and choices made and that will prevent their enjoyment if you can look past all of that its worth watching my advice is if you are angry focus on another aspect of the universe just leave this one alone
Feb 11 2020,positive,the first 30minutes are a pretty bad experience to watch the pace is way too fast events and dialogues are brushed over characters and relationships feel shallow it does improve when the pace slows down but overall the closing of this trilogy is a puzzle of strange choices it would have been best to stick with 1 director throughout the three films and not change the scripts at the last minute  the best star wars film disney has made so far is rogue one undeniably
Feb 11 2020,positive,ending does not exactly line up with the true story but was still an awesome movie hope there can be some cool spin offs
Feb 11 2020,positive,great movie we loved it
Feb 11 2020,negative,this was the end of a 42 year saga and would kill the franchise for me if it wasnt for the mandalorian the film starts out well then the whole thing turns into a disjointed mess seriously dubious plot fiascos one after another disjointed storyline to be honest it looked like the director didnt know where to go or how to end it episode 4 a new hope had a story a start middle and end the empire strikes back although darker had the same setting up return of the jedi boom a trilogy episode 12 and 3 the prequels set up the in depth story regardless wether you liked jarjar then came episode 7 hmm ok  long awaited saga continueswith basically a remake of episode 4 done badly but on a bigger budget better special effects but this turd  the saga ending story left me feeling deflated i went to a premier and at midnight we sat ant watched it two hours i could have spent in bed  seriously deflated movie ending people were asking if they could get their money backone bloke went to clap and the people on either side of him asked him if he was out of medication if jj abrams thinks this is good i for one dont wat to see any more of his films he broke star trek and upset the fanbase now hes killed starwars for so many people what a turdsave your money if you want to see it itll be on freeveiw soon
Feb 11 2020,negative,unbelievably terrible 
Feb 11 2020,positive,this movie kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time and as a star wars fan it did not disappoint
Feb 11 2020,positive,loved it a great finale to a longrunning saga is it perfect of course not but its a fun swashbuckling adventure which is what star wars is all about at its core also my 6year old was completely transfixed the whole time and has been playing lightsabers at home for days afterward thats what star wars is all about
Feb 11 2020,positive,would give it more stars but it couldve been  gayer
Feb 11 2020,positive,solid new age star wars saga being raised on the originals the last six did not capture the imagination quite as much
Feb 11 2020,positive,i thought it was the funniest action movie i have seen in a long time apparently the rest of the audience enjoyed the humor as well based on all of the laughter while it tied all of the past story lines together it did so in such a mishandled way that it seemed amateurish at best and incompetent at worst
Feb 11 2020,negative,some good classic star wars moments but it tried too hard to please all masters with the ending as a standalone movie probably a 3 star rating but as the culmination of a solid trilogy it was really a let down
Feb 11 2020,positive,it was classic star wars  all the fun elements you expect  fun good ride
Feb 11 2020,positive,great story obviously but also all the actors were exceptional so believable filmed beautifully and the cgi bar none great movie allowed me to forget for awhile and just live the story
Feb 11 2020,negative,line star wars hated this lame movie nothing interesting or new
Feb 11 2020,negative,the worst episode this movie should not have been made
Feb 11 2020,positive,was there for the first one and jj abrams did a great job on this one
Feb 11 2020,positive,one of the best star wars movies a very satisfying end to the skywalker saga
Feb 11 2020,negative,only went because my wife wanted to go  rather bland with no plot  lots of meaningless action  if you didnt see the previous couple of bad star wars movies you would not be able to follow who these boring people are  i have always been a big fan of the original episodes 4 6 suffered through ep 1 jarjar crap and ep 2 teenagers in love  episode 3 wasnt too bad as it shows how darth vader came to be  but i am done with the entire series now
Feb 11 2020,negative,worst star wars ever made borderline disrespectful hey weve used the death star too much so lets just put the death star laser on hundreds of star destroyers and call it good bad they should be ashamed kylo ren was never an intimidating antagonist bad trilogy not impressed
Feb 11 2020,positive,wrapped things up nicely the original beloved references to character an assumed connection better unfoldedi could have watched a few more hours more
Feb 10 2020,positive,a heartrefreshing end of a legendary saga as piece of my life all this defamating critics are of the dark side of the force 
Feb 10 2020,positive,wow hubby and i are star wars junkies and i have to say that this one ranks way high on my list of top star wars movies great graphics and story line
Feb 10 2020,positive,it was fine if you just enjoy seeing star wars movies youll enjoy it but if your a diehard you will most likely find it annoying
Feb 10 2020,positive,is it a great movie no is it a good star wars movie yes
Feb 10 2020,positive,the movie was great and all but the end just wish it had a different ending
Feb 10 2020,positive,i loved this movie it is the best starwars to date
Feb 10 2020,positive,it was forgettable 
Feb 10 2020,positive,very entertaining nice to see all the old actors would recommend the movie if youre a star wars fan
Feb 10 2020,positive,ending was ok but it could have had a better conclusion story line seemed rushed
Feb 10 2020,negative,boring preposterous  times poor editing poor storyline disappointing
Feb 10 2020,positive,i liked it but hate to see it is the last one
Feb 10 2020,positive,loved return of all the original players the unexpected outcomes were exciting
Feb 10 2020,positive,predictable plotbut as usual great special fx
Feb 10 2020,positive,absolutely loved the movie
Feb 10 2020,positive,while it may not break new ground for a lifelong fan like me who grew up with new hope this is a brilliant sunset on a series of movies that have provided a consistent source of entertainment for 40 years for critics to look too closely at it for its cinematic worthiness is to ignore the nostalgia from which these movies grew and their value as an entertainment medium that goes well beyond box office receipts   a little comedy lots of action strong characters not too complicated and easy to watch im no diehard fan i havent been to conventions or read the extended universe books never even played a home video game but i do consider star wars to be a fond memory from my childhood and one that through reys character especially i have now been able to share with my daughter   i think jj and his team did a great job and cant wait for its release on streaming
Feb 10 2020,negative,a convoluted story mashed up with endless action sequences i really wasnt empathetic towards any character and i really didnt care which side won just wanted it to be over an hour earlier than it was
Feb 10 2020,negative,terrible movie with many wasted chances
Feb 10 2020,positive,tear jerker with the death of princess leia
Feb 10 2020,positive,very good movie  had a good moral ending
Feb 10 2020,positive,special effects were great the wat they pulled it all together for the final was alright
Feb 10 2020,positive,loved it nice ending lots of action
Feb 10 2020,positive,loved this movie felt like it corrected a lot of mistakes and unanswered questions from the last jedi was so tense throughout the movie i barely stopped to eat my popcorn didnt know what direction the movie was going in was kept interested at all times would deffo recommend
Feb 10 2020,negative,seemed to jump from scene to scene like a series of afterthoughts rather than a coherent story
Feb 10 2020,positive,cameo shots storyline
Feb 10 2020,positive,my family and i enjoyed it
Feb 10 2020,positive,the fight scenes were amazing
Feb 10 2020,positive,the only disappointment was that it should have been made into 2 parts cant wait to see it again the best of the last three
Feb 10 2020,negative,rushed pacing doesnt begin to describe this mad dash of a movie that does not begin the finish character archs for anyone who isnt rey or kylo not to mention reverting everything from the previous movie and giving more seemingly meaningless fan service than any previous jj movie
Feb 10 2020,positive,best of the three the main characters were stronger and more purposeful  the storylines concluded nicely rather than floating with weak purpose in the first two
Feb 10 2020,positive,not what i expected but it raised more questions than answered  great action pieces but the story was a rushed return of the jedi  a must see for star wars fans though but it can wait for video
Feb 10 2020,negative,i cannot unsee this movie 
Feb 10 2020,positive,it was really awesome
Feb 10 2020,positive,force light sabers jedi bad guys space ships what more do you need
Feb 10 2020,negative,okay so my last review for this gave three and a half stars now that i think about it having rewatched it a few times as well as some other sequel movies three and a half is four too many episode ix is a disgusting spit in the face of every true star wars fan out there  an unimaginative lazy disappointing star wars film that makes the clone wars movie look like a work of art it has more plotholes than there are grains of sand on retch kijimi all solely to please a small clique of fans you know the maniacs who despise rose tico and enjoyed the force awakens with reverence as if it wasnt just one long showcase of bad choreography and angy solo boi i mean i dont like some parts of the last jedi but it was at least creative this was not this was fanservice thats all there is to it  its a heaping pile of fanservice what i most hate about this is the fact that rey is a palpatine why so that you could have an excuse to give ea another palpatine skin the whole idea with rey which is what gave her so much potential as a character was that she was the first main character of a trilogy to have no forceimbuing family ties this is what episodes vii and viii were saying she was a nobody special only in her connection to the force and then suddenly shes the senates granddaughter you know what would have gotten me to give five stars keeping the trevorrow script now that was brilliant and creative while still being sensible and consistent
Feb 10 2020,positive,lot of action from the beginning fast moving
Feb 10 2020,positive,adam driver was by far the best character in the trilogy it was plot twisting when rey had force lightning which only meant that she was palpatine
Feb 10 2020,neutral,unoriginal takes too long to get off the ground and apart from the marvelous visuals sorely disappoints  this is not the end either
Feb 10 2020,positive,good storyline good plot twists strong female heroine good action
Feb 10 2020,negative,if youve been a fan of disney star wars up to this point theres a good chance youll like this movie being someone who grew up on george lucass trilogies however i was disappointed a lot of obvious plot holes and even when the surprise twist is revealed youll probably see it coming a mile away i didnt mind that abrams borrowed so much from the originals when he made tfa but at this point instead of appearing as a tribute it comes off as lazy filmmaking better then tlj but then again what isnt
Feb 10 2020,positive,it was a great movie
Feb 10 2020,negative,if you hated last jedi you wont like this it relies on nostalgia to hide the bad acting and the throw in characters made to sell merchandise
Feb 10 2020,positive,its the best of this trilogy but it should have been titled the rise of palpatine given the ending  i would have enjoyed this movie much more if the final confrontation was better and i really wished theyd have switched the narrative at the ending for the 2 primary characters in terms of who lived and died   with its given title id have preferred kylo live and be reunited with leia at the end  given reality and fishers death it would have been nice to give one of the original characters a happy ending  hopefully disney will get rid of kathleen kennedy and put someone in charge of star wars who actually loves it
Feb 10 2020,positive,while i understand that the typical oldfashioned anakin prophecy purist star wars fan probably disliked the movie because rey and kylo replaced anakin in the role of bringing balance to the force my argument against this is that anakin had already fulfilled his prophecy fully after episode 6 as he brought balance to the force even if just for a short time the sequel trilogy in my eyes is a separate story in which the anakin prophecy is no longer a necessary part of the story
Feb 10 2020,positive,having leah and luke in the movie
Feb 10 2020,positive,its star wars what is there not to like
Feb 10 2020,negative,a total shame for the saga  this end the trilogy in the worst way possible and is a total spit on mr lucas work and to all the luke and anakin fans   the movie itself if it was not part of a bigger picture would be alright but it is a aberation to the original story line of the first six movies  how did disney  give a green light to this misery  a comedy movie on this flop would be way deserved 
Feb 10 2020,positive,it was better than the last jedi but it left to be desired it is tied with episode 7 for being the second worsed star wars movie its a good movie but just not a good star wars movie
Feb 10 2020,positive,it was good but the ending was a little weird i have watched it multiple times in theater
Feb 10 2020,positive,it would have as okay  i mean i liked it but it really didnt have the thrill of the last one you  could see what was coming before it happened
Feb 10 2020,positive,was a serious let down for the final star wars saga film expected more with the story and the ending and cheesy lovey divey scene could have gone without total miss
Feb 10 2020,positive,good to finally have an ending to the story a bit slow in places
Feb 10 2020,positive,good action all the way through good acting  enjoyed it
Feb 10 2020,positive,over all a very good movie just some spots were a little bit corny and predictable
Feb 10 2020,positive,thought it was exciting to watch really enjoyed it
Feb 10 2020,positive,it had it moments but not quite the ending i was expecting
Feb 9 2020,positive,the film is all that the critics say it is messy rushed nonsensical etc but i enjoyed it i enjoyed the familiarity of palpatine even though it didnt make sense i enjoyed that it was fast paced so that it could fit in all the nostalgia it could before drawing a close i enjoyed the simplicity of the plot so i do not have to overthink the movie i appreciate the fact that they made this movie for the layman and not the critics like all the other episodes it has its issues but i think it was a fitting ending to a decades old saga and in time perhaps the critics will be kinder to the episode
Feb 9 2020,negative,this was really really bad
Feb 9 2020,positive,not my favorite star wars movie but i still enjoyed it
Feb 9 2020,positive,had me on the edge of my seat fantastic finale
Feb 9 2020,positive,fitting end to the saga
Feb 9 2020,negative,worst star wars ever disregards any continuity previously established because lucasfilm was afraid of getting pushback from fans who hated last jedi terrible jokes nonsensical plot barely any continuity with the other films and in my viewing the audience groaned at two different scenes towards the end would not recommend especially to diehard fans of the franchise this is for a casual viewer whos never seen a star wars before and it shows
Feb 9 2020,positive,not nearly as bad as others reviewed it
Feb 9 2020,positive,great story line with many twist
Feb 9 2020,positive,finally made sense out of the trilogy and great send off of the characters from original trilogy
Feb 9 2020,positive,i have many issues with the story line of these last three star wars movies but i admit this was pretty epic still not thrilled with aspects of the story in this third movie but i have to admit i was absorbed nonetheless some people will see it as predictable others will be shocked others will scoff but overall its true to the sw legacy and satisfying to watch
Feb 9 2020,negative,undermines all 8 other star wars movies and was clearly written by people who dont actually know anything about star wars
Feb 9 2020,positive,a truly fitting end to greatest saga
Feb 9 2020,negative,nonsensical you dont care about the main characters seems like the emperor thank you disney for ruining the vaders sacrifice and the ending of rotj can just come back whenever and without explanation  and the sudden love interest between kylo and rey was pathetic  just a reason for the house of mouse to steal money from fans  kathleen kennedy needs to go
Feb 9 2020,negative,it lacked creativity and the ending was very confusing
Feb 9 2020,positive,unbelievable critics are so off these days how in the world does the best of this trilogy get more poorly reviewed they course correct most of the awfulness that was the last jedi and you cant envy abrams on the task he had to undergo especially with disneys short turnaround many great moments messy early plot but easily overlooked if you love the world of star wars best acting of all of the characters love having lando back
Feb 9 2020,negative,ive been a star wars fan for as long as i can remember i grew up watching not only the original trilogy but the prequels and clone wars too now im well not exactly grown up but pretty close to it and have disneys star wars the force awakens was good the last jedi was great and the mandalorian is amazing the rise of skywalker was the ninth and final movie in the skywalker saga meant to tie all of the previous movies together in one big finale and boy did it fail to do that from the opening scene to literally the end of the movie i sat in my seat with my arms crossed just disappointed in what i was watching the first act was nearly incoherent the second was boring and infuriating at times and the third though the best part still lacked much substance from the chewie takeout to the random reappearance of the emperor to the rey reveal i was just totally done with this movie there were perhaps two or three references to the prequels and alot of things that just felt packed in at the last second in a poor attempt to satisfy long time fans lukes drastic turn from what he was in tlj to this made absolutely no sense and the idea that rey would spoiler fall in love with the guy she stabbed a couple hours ago and also that palpatine reproduced with another human being just completely took me out of the movie not to mention the total randomness of finns forcesensetivity roses exclusion from the films entirety and fact that the 9 year old anakin skywalker programmed 3po so that he couldnt speak the ancient language of the sith overall i did not like the rise of skywalker and i would not reccomend watching it especially if you are a star wars fan
Feb 9 2020,negative,forces to introduce new plots without needing it perfectly they could be taken without having an impact on the plot
Feb 9 2020,positive,its star wars nough said i like it very much but i knew i would i thought the flow of the movie was spot on and the light saber battles were awesome
Feb 9 2020,neutral,the energy between kylo and rey was strongfor me the best part of the movie seeing carrie again was poignanti liked that her death was honored    the plot required too much suspension of belief to be taken seriously even in the context of a fantasy space opera the first order seems at once all powerful and helpless without the sith fleet the viewer is supposed to believe the sith fleet is helpless without a navigation signal that these very sophisticated ships cannot compensate or that they are simply waiting in line up formation to be destroyed that somehow in the time of the final battle sequence a massive fleet made up of individualindependent groups managed to respond and get to the sith fleet all at the same time thats beyond ridiculous and felt like a forced political statement without bothering to be creative about it the 16 hours before launch felt artificial and a lot things seemed to happen during that time frame   what kind of atmosphere did exegol have how close to the planet where the ships doesnt make sense the ships would be too close yet the rebels were charging on horseback on the exterior of a ship with no protection why is it that the republic never seems to play any part there was a lot of fighting but never enough build up to create tension i never felt tense not once this was a movie to see once and move on
Feb 9 2020,positive,wrapped up the series in a satisfying way
Feb 9 2020,positive,this movie is perfect perfect star wars movie i also want to see it again
Feb 9 2020,positive,this is star wars so i was hoping for some good old fashion light saber fight and battleship blowing up each other i got what i was hoping for but the ending was kinda rush in a way they were still a few loose end and question that didnt get any answer but for a star wars movie it was pretty decent i hope they wont make any other
Feb 9 2020,positive,i enjoyed the movie but it took 45 years to finish the story would recommended this one
Feb 9 2020,positive,exciting and rewarding conclusion will be criticized by some for the usual formulaic and nostalgic aspects but the acting that evil voice action and emotion make it very satisfying
Feb 9 2020,negative,tons of fan service absolutely confusing script and no logic followed thats the rise of skywalker when you leave a story on the hands of a big corporation the compromise with the previous events is null the movie was supposed to be the third part of the story that began with the force awakens although most of the elements are either too new or too repetitive no continuation can be found from the state things were in the second movie to the third its just people running things blowing and nice visual effects in this trilogy star wars became a kids movie more than everything because if you pay attention to the story and details you will be quite disappointed but if you want just to see some action and nice effects following no logic at all thats a great movie for you
Feb 9 2020,positive,i liked it is this really the last star wars movie how sad i always enjoy these movies 
Feb 9 2020,positive,sound volume was deafening boardering on sickening
Feb 9 2020,positive,it answered a lot of questions i had they did a good job about the death of leah
Feb 9 2020,negative,j j tried to fix the mess but there are so many loose ends and stuff happening that the movie feels like a videogame they should have left the old saga alone and created something new
Feb 9 2020,negative,only slightly better than the previous film but oh so boring i used to love the star wars filmsbut this really was a snooze fest for me i really felt nothing for any of the characters and was quite happy when they were getting killed off except when they brought that one back to life ugh anyway rogue one was better in that regardill wait patiently for the next season of the mandalorian that is much better than this drivel was
Feb 9 2020,positive,the story felt rushed why do we have to see political statements everywhere now star wars should be just a good and entertaining story keep social and political statements out if it
Feb 9 2020,positive,a good movie with an great plotline there are a few things i liked more in the last movie but hey whos perfect
Feb 9 2020,negative,the force awakens brought a fantastical world back in magnificent fashion the last jedi challenged what blockbuster filmmaking can achieve the rise of skywalker is about 2 and a half hours long
Feb 9 2020,positive,although i do understand why some people may not enjoy this film so i say this as a person who watched this filming without any expectation in the sense i hadnt watched the previous movies in a way that i cared of what happened like you do with marvel i enjoyed this movie sometimes the story was a bit sloppy but it was good sometimes the action scenes were a bit overwhelming but still i would watch it
Feb 9 2020,positive,everyone its in a hurry to end this thing under 2 hours place the fans extend nostalgia and correct the path of the other two movies i liked the movie as one unit but not so much as whole because we still dont know what they where trying to reach
Feb 9 2020,positive,fun and exciting perfect for the casual star wars fan the group of super fans i watched with had a ton of things to break down and discuss so if your a die hard you may want to prepare for some deep thinking after you watch
Feb 9 2020,neutral,slow paced and boring not a good way to end a good trilogy
Feb 9 2020,positive,great way to end the saga loved the classic elements they put in for us longtime star wars fans
Feb 9 2020,negative,worst starwars movie ever dont see it not worth watching
Feb 9 2020,positive,it was great the mystery revealed the dark side vs the light  shocking all the way to the end awesome
Feb 9 2020,positive,everything you look for action suspense drama humorexcellent finale to this saga
Feb 9 2020,positive,i really enjoyed it my teenaged daughter and preteen daughter really liked it fun exciting  humorous
Feb 9 2020,positive,it was a good ending to almost 45 years
Feb 9 2020,positive,wow didnt see it coming
Feb 9 2020,positive,sad the run has come to an end
Feb 9 2020,positive,im a romantic   i wish  spoiler      rae  and ben could have lived happily ever after
Feb 9 2020,positive,loved the surprise in the story and also was sad to see one of the characters i grew attach to pass away
Feb 9 2020,positive,it was a beautiful story
Feb 9 2020,negative,thank god its actually over such a rich and great universe was created but theyre just releasing the same movie over and over how many times can you blow up a big laser in space oh wait i have an ideawhy dont we instead have a fleet of big lasers and whats with the increasing powers every single film save your money and watch the mandalorian instead its way more interesting
Feb 9 2020,positive,entertaining but not a great movie
Feb 9 2020,positive,loved it an enjoyable movie and it tied up the sequel trilogy nicely
Feb 9 2020,positive,with what i have read and heard my expectations were low but i have to admit it was good i really enjoyed it i think they did a good job at repairing the story that last jedi almost ruined
Feb 9 2020,neutral,it was goodpredictable nice story
Feb 9 2020,positive,its was absolutely amazing end to the trilogy and greatly expresses the meaning of hope
Feb 9 2020,positive,absolutely love star wars son and i had a great time at the movies
Feb 9 2020,positive,highly enjoyable story line and action we were thoroughly entertained by star wars the century la quinta is a great theater to see a movie
Feb 9 2020,positive,good movie if youre a star wars fan and are looking to have the series wrapped up  the movie was a bit long and lacked any intrigue or mystery  it was great that the movie included cameos from so many of the original cast
Feb 9 2020,positive,completes the saga the band is back together loved the tieins to the previous episodes tiedup all the loose end
Feb 9 2020,positive,great movie a must see
Feb 8 2020,positive,excellent ending very emotional and well finished  very nostalgic  like life itself 
Feb 8 2020,positive,amazing just amazing kylo ren carried the whole movie on his solders
Feb 8 2020,neutral,could be much better but it was ok
Feb 8 2020,positive,not bad good action not entirely predictable wait for it to come out on pay per view
Feb 8 2020,negative,im not even sure if this was a star wars movie disasterous
Feb 8 2020,negative,its clear there was no vision with disney in the overall direction of the 3 final movies this was just a complete waste of my time they should have stopped at force awakens
Feb 8 2020,positive,star wars rise of skywalker might not be even close to be the seriess best work but it is still a satisfying conclusion to a beloved series
Feb 8 2020,positive,made me cry a couple of times very well done
Feb 8 2020,positive,a well done movie it easily kept my attention throughout with an interesting storyline
Feb 8 2020,positive,i would have given it 5 stars but the script toward the end took on more of a disney animated movie character than a star wars character overall im glad that i saw it
Feb 8 2020,positive,my recommendation to see it would be for true star wars fans  it makes an attempt although arguably a weak one to bring the series full circle  if you arent a fan and are looking for pure entertainment this may not be for you
Feb 8 2020,positive,the good  all the people who were recently alive are in it good guys win  lots of action if you love all star wars you will love this one too the bad  it is hard to know or like the characters  the story doesnt make sense   how the main character who did not have the power to win has all her power drained from her suddenly has the power to win with no explanation  how the bad guy becomes a good guy without explanation for this transformation  the story was poorly designed the unclear   significance of what was done at the end  is this it   is this an opening for another episode   i dont think the writers had a clear plan when they wrote it  it could go either way
Feb 8 2020,positive,i thought the movie was fantastic as always the story line is relevant to many issues in todays society the directing is on par with the other movies the cinematography was superb and i wasnt bored for even a second the pacing was perfect
Feb 8 2020,positive,a nostalgia filled movie with a lack of direction and a convoluted plot but an enjoyable family film  negatives there was a lack of consistent pacing throughout which lead to an elastic band like feeling of being flung across the star wars galaxy only for everything to stop in the middle act and then pick up again themes and ideas introduced in tlj were dropped in favour of a u turn approach which seemed to neglect much of ltjs set up lack of direction a weak villain who clearly was not supposed to be there lack of development on our supposed main characters too many fake deaths  positives babu frik once again the visuals are quite stunning particularly on the watery planet i looked it up and it said it was called kef bir if that means anything to anyone and i quite enjoyed some of the shots between rey and kylo one of the few things carried forward from tlj  the acting in particular driver was terrific as always and i quite enjoyed isaac in what little he was in as he always played his role of comic relief with an upbeat and energetic feel  overall i found it to be an easy watch and fairly enjoyable just sit in the cinema have a nice time and dont think too hard about it afterwards as you may start to realise it doesnt make a lick of sense
Feb 8 2020,positive,great special effects story line and it ended well
Feb 8 2020,positive,it was so good loved it
Feb 8 2020,neutral,great movie  loved plot characters and special effects
Feb 8 2020,neutral,it had energy and jawdropping visuals but fails when it comes to the script and pacing
Feb 8 2020,positive,i like this movie but they did so many stupid things that shouldnt have been done and thats mostly becasue they needed to somehow redeem everything that happened in the last jedi and they couldnt
Feb 8 2020,negative,nothing but exposition completly disconnected from the last movie should of made it 2 movies to cover all the random plot points that were shoved down out throats
Feb 8 2020,positive,this could have really been an excellent star wars movie instead it was just good star wars movie this star wars film is gorgeous and the score is fantastic the sound is perfect i wish all movies looked and sounded this good theres also some really intriguing and inventive plot points and fun new realms of the star wars universe we get to explore   the biggest flaw in the film was princess leia they should have wrote her out the script the old footage they use of her is so clunky and unnatural that its actually very funny when it shouldnt be another one of my big problems with this film is that jj abrams disney and the movies other producers obviously do not think the american movie going audience is very intelligent some of the concepts jokes and editing are so condescending and absent of faith that i personally feel disrespected like all of the movies in this recent star wars iteration some of the characters and props clearly only exist to sell merchandise rather than to seriously provide depth context or humor to the plot theyve seemed to have forgotten why we loved c3po and r2d2   spoiler alert this star wars films helps correct some of the disappointing aspects of the previous star wars films but also suffers from the studios inability to provide a cohesive narrative the ran throughout the trilogy the reintroduction of emperor palpatine was actually really fun and super cool but also left me asking where the heck has he been you just spring this on us now i dont know whether or not i would have liked this movie so much if i didnt see it in theaters but im still glad that i did
Feb 8 2020,negative,terrible completely destroys not only the new star wars trilogy but potentially jeopardises all of the previous 6 movies also would rather forget this one existed
Feb 8 2020,positive,chewbacca finally got his medal what more is there to say than that
Feb 8 2020,positive,nothing new here felt like it didnt fit together
Feb 8 2020,positive,it was intense i love how we got to see so many original actors and it was just overall a great movie no spoiler alerts from me
Feb 8 2020,positive,action packed as always if comparing with the first star wars  that was still so ahead of its time i think this is the last one   had to see finale nice to see carrie fisher showcased a must see
Feb 8 2020,positive,a satisfying finish to great story
Feb 8 2020,positive,once again star wars proves the rotten tomatoes critics dont know dick the skywalker finale so far does a good job of correcting course from the last film consistently entertaining
Feb 8 2020,positive,liked it wouldve liked it more ifthere had been more interaction rae and ben
Feb 8 2020,positive,like the wrap up of the series
Feb 8 2020,negative,yep probably would have walked out if my husband hadnt felt strongly about finishing the series
Feb 8 2020,neutral,i didnt see as much action from this movie versus all the others from the star wars world  i bit long in the dialogue for my taste there are only so many back stories before you get bored and yawn  then what you want is a good old fashioned fight scene with the good guys kicking ass
Feb 8 2020,positive,i dont understand the professional critics  they just dont get it  this was a fun film  not the best star wars film but certainly not the worst  id put it in the top five  good entertainment that should impress real star wars fans
Feb 8 2020,positive,nice wrapup of reys story
Feb 8 2020,negative,longest two hours ive spent in a movie theatre
Feb 8 2020,positive,made me laugh and cry loved every minute
Feb 8 2020,positive,this movie was amazing and had a perfect ending
Feb 8 2020,positive,a bit of an improvement over the last jedi it is a lot to take in after watching it but it ended being satisfying enough
Feb 8 2020,negative,perhaps without the intrusion of the appalling last jedi the sequel trilogy could have been something better but this is a movie that had to occupy itself with damage control from what preceded it  littered throughout tros are moments where jj abrams has to concoct silly explanations for the universebreaking actions in tlj why dont we just perform the holdo maneuver one character asks in the latter part of the story referring to the ridiculous moment in tlj that retroactively makes a mockery of the entire star wars saga  but even disregarding these damagecontrol moments tros is a movie without a voice or philosophy every instance of seemingly consequential action is later undone there is no gravitas to anything the plot is a video game sequence of actions into which the characters feel like they have been forced there is nothing natural about their presence in the various locations they are required to be in for the plot to advance objects and characters magically appear to be exactly where they need to be tricky situations are resolved by the right macguffin appearing at the right moment none of it feels meaningful or significant the characters skills and motivations almost become redundant in the face of the handofgod that seemingly moves them around the gameboard of the universe  the only examples of quality to be found in tros are in the visual effects cinematography costumes etc and this is the tragedy of the sequel triliogy clearly there was a lot of talent working on these movies its just a shame their skills were put to use in service of such worthless material  ultimately the sequels are a stain upon the star wars saga that try to diminish the significance of the originals undermine its characters and philosophy and coopt their success for its own twisted purposes  there is only one rational response to this abomination pretend the sequels never happened
Feb 8 2020,negative,garbage dont make this shit anymore
Feb 8 2020,negative,only had to watch this out of curiosity
Feb 7 2020,neutral,as a star war purist it was long boring and lacked the quality of special effects that 2019 should have provided
Feb 7 2020,positive,it was a fun movie cant wait for it to get on fandangonow so i can buy it and watch it all the time
Feb 7 2020,positive,i loved it cried 3 times
Feb 7 2020,positive,naysayers be damned star wars fan from the start here i found this installment to be filled with goodness great art direction special effects acting storyline  highly entertaining and satisfying
Feb 7 2020,positive,i liked it just fine its star wars it was a bit frenetic and seemed rushed in some places but it was pretty cool overall much more epic in scope in a lot of places it was always going to be impossible to make everyone happy trying to wrap up this whole thing its almost become a cottage industry with people crapping on every star wars movie this one is a perfectly decent wrap to the whole thing
Feb 7 2020,negative,spoiler alert after the last jedi i was expecting this movie to be terrible and it ended up surprising me but after some time to think about it it isnt as good as it was on the first viewing  pros they make the last jedi the second least important movie in the saga they fix most mistakes about the last jedi and rose is barely in the movie kylo ren is awesome again the visuals are the best that starwars has ever seen there are some great moments like kylo ren almost beating rey in a light saber fight until leia stopped him kylo ren was the best character in this movie rey being a palpatine is pretty cool the scene with luke skywalker is pretty good the score is good once again the be with me scene in the final act was great i also like landos return and c3pos character arc kylo rens redemption was pretty good  cons bringing the emperor back was a stupid idea because of the prophecies in the first six movies of anakin bringing balance to the force and killing the emperor it doesnt connect well as a trilogy and it is all over the place the pacing feels rushed and they could have used some explanation on how the emperor can switch bodies leias and kylos death was dumb because they died the same way as luke the sith troopers were disappointing and just stood there rey is overpowered and the most overpowered she has ever been there were moments that should have been more iconic like lando flying the millenium falcon with all of these other ships behind it it feels like they try to copy some scenes from endgame but theyre not as good the emperor is inconsistent with his power and his death was lame reylo became a thing and i didnt like rey saying she was a skywalker   im going to give starwars the rise of skywalker a c
Feb 7 2020,positive,i wasnt bored my headline would be an entertaining mess the cut scenes in the first 10 minutes were so rapid it was like the editor was flicking through a deck of top trump cards after the disappointment of the last jedi i knew this final film would be impossible to make and i have total sympathy for jj abrams i had no expectations for this film its the first time ive gone to see a star wars movie and not cared about it a real shame the whole movie carries on at a great pace theres lots to see and be dazzled by but it lacks any scenes that bring the characters down to earth and allows space to just breathe the finale takes a leaf out of the prequel movies and sees how much it can fit on the screen in one go it tries way too hard and when an impossibly large fleet of rebel ships appear out of nowhere i actually laughed the concluding scene i did actually feel emotional and personally thought was handled well but the movie as a whole was an attempt to fix the plot holes left by the last jedi and as others have said it felt like 3 movies crammed into one clearly the lack of planning ahead of time for this trilogy has proved to be the undoing for this franchise nevertheless theres plenty to discuss and the conversation and reinventions will most likely continue till long after we have all passed on from this galaxy   may the force be with you
Feb 7 2020,positive,better than the last jedi  hated the last jedi  didnt feel it made up for some of the previous entry choices but i did like some of the choices they did make in this round  makes me want to see rey form a jedi academy and find lukes child and continue on what i felt they shouldve done with luke leia and han with recasts
Feb 7 2020,negative,the movie that killed the saga disgusting ben deserves much better
Feb 7 2020,positive,loved it best of the trilogy ill get some unanswered questions in the comics cant wait for the next saga may the force be with all of us
Feb 7 2020,positive,i loved it it had you on the edge of your seat the whole time
Feb 7 2020,positive,not a bad effort given the utter disaster that was the last jedi suffers from a toorushed pace and lack of time for the characters to breathe but thats what happens when you have to cram two movies worth of content into one movie since the last jedi was such a failure
Feb 7 2020,positive,this was the best movie out off the last 3 good plot twist
Feb 7 2020,positive,who saw that coming  kind of campy at the end
Feb 7 2020,negative,easily the worst of all the star wars films  it was rushed non sensical anti climatic and amateurish  there wasnt a single awesome light saber battle or sufficient action to keep one engaged  ive been watching star wars since 1977 and this was a letdown of epic proportions  unlike the other star wars films i will never watch that mess again  save your money and do your best to remember the original characters as they were these new characters and their boring aimless direction will be easily forgotten
Feb 7 2020,positive,i felt like they pulled put out a 100 for the end of the saga i just didnt like how it kinda dragged there towards the end im not gonna lie i fell asleep for a little bit
Feb 7 2020,negative,a jumbled mess of a film that was clearly rushed there was plenty of wow factor with visuals but no real substance to back them up this could have been the plot of any garbage b movie that would go straight to streaming if it wasnt for the branding and disney money behind it most people would agree that this is a piece of poor filmmaking
Feb 7 2020,positive,fine culminations even if too much to cover 
Feb 7 2020,positive,i like star wars but id this movie didnt have the moniker it would be a mess
Feb 7 2020,positive,it had its problems but giving it under 3 stars would be harsh
Feb 7 2020,positive,the movie ended weirdly
Feb 7 2020,positive,i loved it i loved everything about it it had all the ingredients  for a great finale i have been a huge fan of the star wars saga ever since the premiere started back in the 70s ive watched and followed each episode i fell in love with luke and han and leia and anakin c3po r2d2 chewbaca yoda obie ben wan kenobi and all the rest i love that in the face of great evil and hatred that our protaganists always chose to be good and hope and  love prevailed when all looks lost hard work and faith works wonders i am so attached to all of the characters just as if they were family members and i will sorely miss them just like all of the endings in all the other episodes the rise of skywalker leaves you with a warm feeling of joy and wellbeing  bravo well done well done thank you lucas films the star wars saga has been so important to me through the years as i was awed and thrilled and saddened and enlightened i may never be a star figher pilot and galavant around the galaxy saving many worlds but i lived it and loved the fantasy created through each film i really loved the way the writer was able tie every thing together in a wonderful way i loved this film and all the others i stayed and watched the film and all of the credits as if to saver and appreciate all of the thousands of people it took to make this movie and to say a respectful goodbye to my old friends and their stories farewell my friends and may the force be with you
Feb 7 2020,positive,love from start to end
Feb 7 2020,positive,completely blows away the tfa and tlj j j really redeemed himself rey is actually human and relatable my only two critiques are that abrams couldnt resist copycating the original trilogy and trying to hint that poe was like solo didnt work for me
Feb 7 2020,positive,what an emotional end to the new trilogy while some people may not like them as much i really liked the direction they went and it all culminated perfectly in the end i cant wait to see it again
Feb 7 2020,positive,i would have given 5 stars if they didnt kill off someone that you begin to care for
Feb 7 2020,negative,literally no part of this movie was given a single moment of thought the first half of this movie is a continuous string of location and objective changes accompanied by awkward expository dialogue explaining each new place they go and thing they have to do  the second half takes the few good ideas in the dumpsterfire of the last jedi crushes them up snorts them then spits their dead remains into the audiences face
Feb 7 2020,positive,this makes me wish adam driver had been around to play anikin oh what a dream that would have been strong acting well thought out and coherent movie that delivered really enjoyed this
Feb 7 2020,positive,a wonderful film full of fun entertainment  throughout a true theatre going experience
Feb 7 2020,negative,this movie was hot garbage
Feb 7 2020,negative,where do i start  thankfully the mandelorian is a step in the right direction lets hope disney learns from the mistakes made in this failure or a trilogy
Feb 7 2020,negative,one of the worst movies of the year one of the worst star wars movies in the series no script dialogue was awful
Feb 6 2020,positive,what happen to the development of characters the was plot was rehashed and flat and interesting iconic characters like the knights of ren were left on the sidelines as an after thought  the film is still entertaining but at its lowest level potential wasted characters wasted and almost my time wasted im a fan so its hard to not like star wars but i expected more and left the theater guessing is this where the star wars franchise is going i have hope
Feb 6 2020,positive,best of the disney episodes not the best disney star wars movie  i would give that to rogue one
Feb 6 2020,positive,meh it passed the time
Feb 6 2020,positive,expectations going in were really low due to other reviews enjoyed most of the film story felt rushed for most of the run time overall a good film in my opinion
Feb 6 2020,positive,it was decentworth a rental kind of disappointing though
Feb 6 2020,positive,the seamless continuation of the whole story is perfect  i think the last scene is a teaser that indicates there is more to come
Feb 6 2020,neutral,this was a mess from the beginning the characters are never really that strong and the story never hits home or even comes close the the originals its a good time if youre a star wars fan probably more so if youre not i enjoyed it for what it was which was fan service some cool battles and horrible treatment of the original characters is what sums up this new trilogy for me that just ends pretty much like avengers endgame but falls short
Feb 6 2020,negative,3 words what a mess
Feb 6 2020,positive,satisfying enough conclusion plenty of fan service did its best to remedy the mess of the last movie getting back to the core the charles yera didnt feel political agendas in this one well paced giving 35 because it is better than an average movie but not as good as the best movies ive ever seen
Feb 6 2020,positive,not the best star wars by any means but it paid respect to all the main characters of the past 42 years i did catch the line about the festival occurring every 42 years
Feb 6 2020,positive,entertaining movie but completely destroyed the skywalker saga not the end the audience was looking for at all
Feb 6 2020,neutral,there were parts that my wife and i liked but things could have been much much better
Feb 6 2020,positive,star wars the rise of skywalker was great and its one of the best star wars movies of all time the only star wars movie that was better is solo great movie
Feb 6 2020,positive,awesome culmination of all the star wars movies i loved all the touchbacks and memories great great movie
Feb 6 2020,positive,if you are a original star wars fan from the 70s and have an open mind and imagination then you will be pleasantly surprised how they are able to tie up all the loose ends and come up with a conclusion for all 9 movies there will be a lot of people who think that they ruined the franchise but everyone is entitled there opinion go see it and judge for yourself it has been a great franchise and i look forward to seeing more new and imaginative stories and characters for the future may the force be with you
Feb 6 2020,positive,the majority of the movie didnt flow smoothly for me
Feb 6 2020,negative,not that interesting and acting was so so
Feb 6 2020,positive,love it i wish there was a longer love story between the two main characters 
Feb 6 2020,negative,star wars episode of backpain for adam driver due to carrying this entire trilogy  rise of skywalker was exactly what i expected abrams typical rushing over all contrivances and plot holes in favour of brisk colourful fun strangely that seemed to fit as an apt ending to this new trilogy however that also made it a terrible terrible movie and a woefully underwhelming conclusion to the three trilogies of movies  it reminded me at the worst moments of the worst moments of the matrix revolutions with rey a sort of uninteresting forcedriven fauxjesus with the powers of whatever the plot dictates and trust me and im doing this alone dialogue and every other soppy fool is just running to keep up with her rash cringey actions and to counter that the best arc in vii viii and ix belongs to ben solo a skywalker whose rise is undoubtedly actually the titular rising skywalker and not rey who i will defend to the hilt should have been a nobody im fully sick of watching films and long running tv shows where everyone and everything is connected with headspinning amounts of forced retconning ros is a stealth ben solo trilogy adam driver is a superb actor who can even shine amidst this plot dreck and rey should have ended the movie announcing she is just rey ending the saga for good reshoots clearly did not allow for this  speaking of repeated tropes i hate we have another quick team a have to shut off the generatorbeaconlead shipsatelliteforce field etc etc so that team b can zoom their unlimited but somehow were told is dwindling ship supply to pew pew something that deus ex machinas a chain of explosions that saves absolutely everything ever its tired its cute in a new hope its so boring now that i cant help but gloss over  ros also shits all over rian johnsons tlj and in doing so actually made me appreciate it more i liked rose tico when i saw how crassly she was sidelined and how much clear contempt there was from including her in the main proceedings a simple fix would have been omitting that ridiculously uninspired female finn that lando creepily comes on to at the end and instead have had rose tico in a painful long term relationship with finn driven to taking up finns cause after falling in love with him and seeing how much she could help after the first order took her sister from her by having her emancipate the child soldiers of the first order to endors moon which would have facilitated a nuanced and fertile continuation of her arc and relationships and relevance and the beats dedicated to luke skywalker not only directly contradict his character growth and story moments of tlj but im even sure he repeats the exact opposite dialogue from tlj just short of winking directly at the previously outraged fans  what did i like besides the creatures effects actual directing work cast and photography with exception of the flashing lights what a terrible way to start a movie well all the reylo stuff was creative and surprising i yelled out loud when he snatched that necklace and the throne room fight felt like a rian johnson move which is to say an inspired and different way of staging a thing like that and in every scant scene theres the mote of a good idea but its rolled over so fast and without sealing any of the gaps that it squashes each one i imagine thats to do with writer terrios comments about wanting to divide it into two movies and disneys adherence to having cake and eating it leaves moments like the force lightning or c3po with unfathomable screen time here bereft of weight when theyre reversed moments later  reys powers were cool and she actually seemed powerful and the last of her kind better than in episode ii where throwing disposable weak jedi like fodder at the screen was a dumb idea and its good to see a genuinely strong female character battle with her dark and light sides but all the fan references and easter eggs were ugly and awkward and even the kooky side characters they introduced however enjoyable were clearly window dressing and distraction and merchandising  leias arc and interactions are crass cutandshut moments lifted from other movies and it shows its cringey to be honest and starting the opening crawl with the death of leia and revolving large portions of the movie around it with her communication through the force may have been better in retrospect and would have done her more justice and the movie is plagued with a million other stupid decisions im not even touching palpatine or any of that shit what a clusterfuck  its a shame that the new trilogy clearly started with the intention of building a new world a new fanbase with new leads but keeping a dash of that old magic and after the last jedi for better and worse leaned into that full tilt then episode ixs course correct is a lastminute slapdash rush to appeal to the older fans and hastily conclude 9 films instead of just conclude 3 films well and in their own way and style  so why give it an average score if its a terrible movie well as always with abrams its a good experience in the cinema i laughed i cheered and i felt something no matter how processed it was theres a particularly accurate comment from redlettermedia to the effect of with episode ix abrams took straw and spun it into bronze its the best it could have been with the disney overlords pulling the strings and having to answer to ending 3 films 9 films constantly changing chiefs grappling with fan expectations predictions backlash and time constraints thats not an excuse just a reality there were always contrivances in star wars but this film is hinged entirely on puffs of air its literally a popcorn movie its tasty but utterly pointless and you wouldnt go reaching for it again unless you had limited choice
Feb 6 2020,positive,too many cameos for my liking but certainly not as bad as some people made it out to be
Feb 6 2020,positive,too many cameos for my liking but certainly not as bad as some people made it out to be
Feb 6 2020,positive,there are many things to like about the movie  the light saber duels the desert chase sequence  but i feel a let down by it because of the lack of any real character development and the disservice it does to the new characters especially rey at the expense of shoehorning in all of the callbacks to the the previous trilogies
Feb 6 2020,positive,i have seen it twice now and could watch it more
Feb 6 2020,positive,we thought is was great it brought everything to a close
Feb 6 2020,positive,fantastic loved it
Feb 6 2020,positive,better than last few films in the star wars series liked the tie in with the original cast members
Feb 6 2020,positive,loved the movie clash of of school new school characters and looks to be the wrap of a series and what a series its been worth owning to complete your collection
Feb 6 2020,positive,a very good actionscience fiction movie
Feb 6 2020,positive,great way to end the story given where the last movie left it somehow able to recover the story with a meaningful nostalgic sendoff
Feb 6 2020,positive,i thought this was a fantastic finale to a trilogy i have seriously loved it ended in a very satisfying way for me and i struggle to think how it could have been improved i loved the characters arcs and how they completed their stories sure finn could have had a better story but he played an important role nonetheless i loved the action and emotion in this film and am glad i watched it twice
Feb 6 2020,positive,its a pretty solid movie in my opinion if you were a fan of the storyline from the last jedi then this one might not be for you as it retcons many things to try and fix the plot without risks has its up and downs but id recommend to any star wars fans out there
Feb 6 2020,negative,nah mate none of the characters are interesting and the story just goes nowhere jj did his best but yikes does it flop
Feb 6 2020,negative,ahhh i waited until is was a rental and was still dissapointed i spent the 6 this trilogy had such potential there are some scenes in this that show what this trilogy could have been but alas it wasnt to be heres to hoping that disney doesnt ruin tano in the mandalorian
Feb 6 2020,positive,was very good  it would be good even if you had not seen any of the previous star wars movies
Feb 6 2020,positive,i like this group of people in the movie this one ends with out leaving you hanging knowing there has to be a sequel 
Feb 6 2020,positive,best star wars movie in a long time tied together the loose ends and lack of cohesion from eps vii and viii in a truly satisfying way a brilliant way to close out the skywalker saga
Feb 6 2020,negative,overall pretty lousy movie i was able to foresee generic movie tropes from a mile away i found the cgi choppy at some parts story pacing was too fast and confusing etc etc good time killer movie i guess but not a good send off to the new star wars trilogy 
Feb 6 2020,positive,ill liked that they brought all of the heroines back for one final current call
Feb 6 2020,negative,disney should have given abrams the 2 part episode 9
Feb 6 2020,negative,meh i stopped caring about sw winks under eyepatch
Feb 6 2020,positive,heard it wasnt good but thoroughly enjoyed it from the standpoint of a star wars appreciator not fanatic so maybe i missed some things but for two hours and 32 minutes i was never bored
Feb 6 2020,positive,im surprised by the poor reviews this was my favorite of the new trilogy 
Feb 6 2020,negative,did not enjoy it they are ruining the star wars franchise
Feb 6 2020,positive,ehh everything was too easy and convenient for the main characters the new star wars really lack character development
Feb 6 2020,negative,sorry but this franchise was officially done with after revenge of the sith 
Feb 6 2020,negative,there was nothing compelling about the story i pretty much only enjoyed the new droid i wont be watching this movie ever again
Feb 6 2020,positive,didnt care for the way it ended
Feb 6 2020,negative,movie was a mess  disney star wars is a mess
Feb 6 2020,positive,pretty solid ending to the skywalker saga although some scenarios could have been different
Feb 6 2020,positive,far far better than the last one i felt a little bit of feel gooddisney nonsense of course but a decent wrapup for one of the all time greatest movie franchises i highly recommend if youve ever even sorta liked star wars youll like this movie
Feb 5 2020,positive,really good it was not my favorite but still liked it
Feb 5 2020,positive,great way to end the skywalker saga had some flaws with kylo and rey but overall a fun movie experience and one of the great star wars films of this century
Feb 5 2020,negative,rae is a palpatine not a skywalker leia should have hugged chewie not rae she had no history with rae rae grandfather destroyed anakin sywalker  and just basically wtf i hated this movie
Feb 5 2020,positive,one of the best star wars storie the rest is what the fans saw in the last 20 years changing a little bit here or there
Feb 5 2020,positive,redemption on multiple levels do not hesitate to see this brilliant popcorn finale on the largest screen possible thank you jj 
Feb 5 2020,negative,a decent ending to a forgettable trilogy that spoiled the true star wars
Feb 5 2020,negative,despite the movie being mildly better than the previous cough movie i cant find it in me to give it anything more than 15 stars
Feb 5 2020,negative,enjoyable enough if youre there for nostalgia and cheap entertainment but thoroughly lacking if youre looking for more 
Feb 5 2020,positive,had an amazing ending but it needed a much longer runtime almost perfect fan service
Feb 5 2020,negative,worse than i could possible imagine the script is a bloody mess
Feb 5 2020,positive,this movie is the best out of all the skywalker saga the cast is amazing and the theming and colours
Feb 5 2020,negative,emperor palpatine was gr8 even though it made no since at all and i had to invent my own version of how he survived dying twice based on new cannon that apparently palpatine knew of a shatter point and used clones to facilitate his clones snoke and himselfto keep some hold on the galaxysmh disney  you should have listened to george lucas and used his script sigh so much for sw ripieces
Feb 5 2020,positive,was the best star wars movie i could imagine was incredible good characters good plot and an incredible end was amazing my favorite star wars movie and my favorite movie ever
Feb 5 2020,negative,theres such thing as too much fan service the lack of cohesion in this trilogy is most obvious in this entry 
Feb 5 2020,positive,other than the inadequate endingwhich did no justice to the most compelling character of this trilogy kylo renben solothis is a riveting and colorful blast through the galaxies the end could have been so much better which is a big factor in the disappointment expressed by many
Feb 5 2020,positive,awesome movie great visual effects
Feb 5 2020,positive,sad but fun movie that had some twist and turns i didnt see coming
Feb 5 2020,neutral,completely forgettable jj did what he could i guess still wasnt that interesting and thats hard to achieve in a stars wars movie
Feb 5 2020,negative,anthony daniels is the only saving grace at this point that mans a national treasure
Feb 5 2020,negative,trying to completely undo the previous movie in the instalment within the first 20 minutes was painful to watch but the worst things about this movie are its weird editing that leaves more than one character discarded its relentless nostalgic fan service and lack of originality stemming from abramss painfully reductive stated belief that at its core star wars has always been a story about palpatines vs skywalkers
Feb 5 2020,positive,it was all around amazing
Feb 5 2020,positive,i enjoyed my time watching the film but i still noticed the flaws but since the recent leaks from the original episode 9 script and concept art i feel like this movie could have been much better and now i get the feeling that jj abrams and chris terrio ruined the movie they could have kept the original plan but they changed everything and not for the best
Feb 5 2020,positive,as with all the other star wars movies this one did not disappoint it was action packed full of familiar faces and just very well done i would watch it again
Feb 5 2020,positive,i loved it i hear people complaining about all the callbacks to the original movies when thats what a story is supposed to do this is not just one standalone film its the culmination of one long story also it was definitely made for the fans of the original films because the fan service was off the hook there was lando the ewoks luke lifting his xwing out of the water palpatines return with a secret armada of ships luke training leia rey taking on palpatine with lightsabers belonging to the twins chewbacca finally getting the medal he never received in the original films rey shooting force lightning from her hands the force bringing together a group of forcesensitive people to overpower the dark side the voices of every jedi that passed on and rey fighting her evil self on the old death star i enjoyed every moment of this movie im definitely buying it when its available  td  these are the last days of dark
Feb 5 2020,positive,dont understand why people dont like this movie is incredible
Feb 5 2020,positive,its back this one was for the fans
Feb 5 2020,positive,literally the perfect end to an amazing saga jaw dropping the entire time incredibly acted edited and directed driver and ridley are electrifying i can not for the life of me figure out why critics found this anything less than what it was spectacular forget the critics if you love star wars you absolutely will not be disappointed
Feb 5 2020,positive,lots of time to retell  a new hope but  satisfactory for a send out
Feb 5 2020,positive,overall entertaining more or less agreed with how things turned out but it was a good movie
Feb 5 2020,positive,fitting end for the star wars saga  so happy with it i saw it twice in the theater
Feb 5 2020,positive,it was amazing  paced very well  do yourself a favor dont listen to critics
Feb 5 2020,positive,loved the girl power in the movie and more races being in the movie  i miss george lucas vision of it though
Feb 5 2020,positive,i was moved to tears with the end of an era
Feb 5 2020,negative,disappointing but not dreadful
Feb 5 2020,positive,much better than i expected  i fund little to smile about in the earlier two films some things to smile about in ron howards solo film  this film is an outstanding incredible achievement of imagination and craft  i suspect this is jjs best film and best script with his several collaborators  the light saber fight choreography has never been better ever  the acting has never been better    what i dont see mentioned in other reviews is the videogame angle  the rogue one movie played more like a video game than like a movie lots to do not much emotional engagement    rise of skywalker plays as a perfect hybrid of movie and video game best elements of both lots you culd do in a videogame and lots of emotional engagement even some originality luke and leia were bother sister  rei and ben become brother and sister    i think more credit needs to go to the brain trust of writers including colin treverow and jj two masters of breathing fresh life into old ips sometimes strikingly original new life    the trailers suggested the movie could be overly sentimental fan service a star wars greatest hits  every disney star wars has tried to be star wars greatest hits  i found the story engaging over and above the hundreds of greatest hits moments  quite an accomplishment  
Feb 5 2020,positive,the movie was brightheartedi love it
Feb 5 2020,positive,great and of the saga
Feb 5 2020,positive,excellent film hate to see the saga end
Feb 5 2020,negative,really awful would have walked out in the middle if i hadnt promised my mom i would watch it with her i never thought id say i miss the prequels this was that bad
Feb 5 2020,positive,loved it seeing it again saturday
Feb 5 2020,positive,definitely flawed esp when it comes to pacing but ultimately a satisfying finish that demonstrates it understands whats so great about the series
Feb 5 2020,negative,the rise of skywalker feels convoluted and rushed as the only thing the charachters do is search for plot devices to move the story forward jj abrams tries to undo the events of the last jedi and it ends up feeling like this conclusion to the star wars saga leaves more questions asked than answered
Feb 5 2020,positive,great job incorporating the older movies into this one
Feb 5 2020,positive,it was ok it finished the series but still a let down for anyone who wasnt a huge fan half of the movies were badtoo bad they made them for kids
Feb 5 2020,positive,honestly im a bit disappointed the movie felt extremely rushed i definitely think this movie would have gained better reviews had it been split into two parts i find that the story lacked information and had too many loose ends that being said the visuals acting and humor make up for some of the shortcomings of the film
Feb 4 2020,positive,star wars the rise of skywalker is an excellent film it is about the surviving members of the resistance who face the first order once again carrie fisher and adam driver give fantastic performances the screenplay is well written jj abrams did a great a job directing this movie i enjoyed watching this motion picture because of the action and adventure star wars the rise of skywalker is a must see
Feb 4 2020,positive,all over the place but overall fun several lol linesscenes it brought in some memorable elements from the past in a good way this was my favorite of the three sequels
Feb 4 2020,negative,it just destroyed the whole saga
Feb 4 2020,positive,good ending to the saga
Feb 4 2020,positive,best star wars movie ever action packed great way to end the saga daisy riddley is awesome
Feb 4 2020,positive,wonderful adventure
Feb 4 2020,neutral,well well wellafter a halfway decent fa and a terrible tlj ros tries its best to bounce back but fails in to many ways to save this trilogy
Feb 4 2020,negative,not as bad as the last jedi
Feb 4 2020,positive,i really liked the battle scenes the outstanding special effects and the over all movie plot i truly enjoyed this movie eve thought l am not a hard core star wars fan
Feb 4 2020,negative,oof that was rotten
Feb 4 2020,negative,wow to imagine the amount of money that went into this and the number of viewers who saw this and this felt like some half baked episode of duck tales with better effects i went in with low expectations given the reviews and was still like wtf am i watching here there are better b grade video game cut scenes than this whole movie even with my amc a list making it almost free i want my two hours back
Feb 4 2020,positive,i liked that they brought luke leia han  lando back for the cameos in the end i disliked the ending
Feb 4 2020,positive,it is a solid movie yet the smell of preowned is emanating through the whole from flashbacks of xwing rising out of waters from throwing away lightsabers it happened at least thrice during this movie to the big battle in the end during this battle authors literally recycled the shots from episode vi emperor seducing luke while rebel fleet is being exterminated that is one interpretation there is another one as well this movie is a bridge the link between my generation and that of my children my generation can enjoy episodes iv to vi and keep argueing if han shot first yes he did but my children  they need new heroes new adventures the story though  a fairy tale in the galaxy far far away the dreams  of exploration of alien cultures and species of friendship and loyalty  they are the same let the force be with you always
Feb 4 2020,positive,better than last jedi
Feb 4 2020,negative,on this movie we learn that vaders sacrifice was meanless that responds how bad this is dont even watch
Feb 4 2020,positive,pleasing end to the saga not the best though
Feb 4 2020,negative,i was waiting for it to be over
Feb 4 2020,negative,worst of all the star wars movie plot was horrible
Feb 4 2020,positive,of the 9 star wars movies i rate episode 9 as being better than all but the original episode 4 1977 the 4th episode of the story arc but the first of the 9 movies to be produced and screened it ties the series together and takes is back to where it began so if youve been putting off seeing the final episode dont delay any longer because it will only be in theaters for another 2 days or so and its well worth the time and money
Feb 4 2020,neutral,predictable a couple good moments good fight scenes but the plot is terrible but what can i say it is star wars go see it and have fun
Feb 4 2020,positive,amazing im obsessed im a star wars fan and love alll the trilogies the only people who dont like this movie havent liked any of this new trilogy if you enjoyed tfa youll love this one way beyond my expectations i think the second time you see it gets even better and allows you to process whats happening more clearly the acting score special effects are phenomenal as usual the nostalgic moments the characters are fun but the epic light saber fights depth connection complexity and chemistry between rey and kylo rens characters and their force bond really make the movie i obviously have critiques but given that the entire story wasnt thought out before the 3 movies were made makes it difficult for a super coherent seamless plot line and villain and after tlj with what jj abrams had to work with i just accepted the whole palpatine bit to be fair palpatine really is the epitome of the dark side and the most terrifying sith were all very familiar with thats haunted both the previous trilogies so i just accepted that it would be a cool way to end the last of the skywalker movies my biggest critique is the very end all the force ghosts should have been behind her he had all the siths with him the force ghosts should have appeared with their light sabers behind her that would have been the ultimate hell yes moment of the movie palpatine should have screamed in fear seeing them all and it would have felt like an epic justified ending with them all killing him together with her that would have given more closure to this skywalker saga for me knowing that anakin and luke got to be part of that final take down of someone they already destroyed also wouldnt have minded kylo living and appearing next to rey on lukes planet with luke and leia looking at both of them proud and at peace and ben and rey standing with the moons that would have left it more open ended as far as their future their kids more movies idk guys lol i loved it though so much i dont ever write reviews but i just loved it haha
Feb 4 2020,positive,i liked how it tied up the loose ends of the story
Feb 4 2020,negative,same storyline as before with all kinds of loose ends for future quarterly star wars moviesit will get to the point where they will start numbering the movie sequels
Feb 4 2020,positive,ok but over the top
Feb 4 2020,positive,feel like the saga should continue
Feb 4 2020,positive,all good worth the time and money
Feb 4 2020,positive,people like to complain about things for the sake of it these days the film does lack some invention in certain areas but overall its action packed and full of good fan service really not much to dislike here
Feb 4 2020,positive,great visual effects
Feb 4 2020,positive,well written  stars wars fan must see 
Feb 4 2020,positive,good movie not epic definetly set up for another
Feb 4 2020,positive,they really focused on drawing everything to a close honor paid to the whole saga
Feb 4 2020,positive,it was a lot better than i thought it was going to be  the backgrounds were visually brilliant  the directing was very nice  the sound effects were topnotch and the soundtrack was amazing as always  better still i really enjoyed the new cast  the comedic elements landed pretty well and the dialogue was decent  the writers definitely had to do some creative kungfu to tie everything together and i think they did a pretty deft job  overall it was truly good and a nice way to wrap up the saga
Feb 4 2020,positive,good action could have been edited a bit shorter
Feb 4 2020,positive,the storyline was very interesting and kept up with the story being told enjoyable for the whole family
Feb 4 2020,positive,i really enjoyed watching the rise of skywalker
Feb 4 2020,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed seeing palpatine resurrected zombie style
Feb 4 2020,positive,overall it wasnt a bad movie ive certainly seen worse from the star wars franchise it just wasnt a great one im not unhappy with this movie in any major way its just that i was not excited either no part of it truly felt surprising and despite some engaging moments the whole movie felt too much like an obligatory tieup of loose ends like the movie had a checklist and was just ticking them off one by one without much enthusiasm at some points i was looking at my watch wondering how much longer it was going to be sorry its a 3star at best
Feb 4 2020,positive,very good movie i went back and watched it 2 more times  no regrets
Feb 4 2020,positive,good conclusion to the big story consistent with series style
Feb 4 2020,positive,storyline and special effects were inredible

Feb 3 2020,positive,a great wrap to all the others  left an opening for future films
Feb 3 2020,positive,ill likely forget what happened in a week but it was fun enough whilst it was on screen but very safe
Feb 3 2020,positive,amazing ending to long story
Feb 3 2020,positive,i liked pretty much everything except the ending
Feb 3 2020,positive,tied things up pretty well
Feb 3 2020,positive,the entire movie felt rushed would have been better if it had been 2 movies
Feb 3 2020,neutral,it leaves a bunch of open questions that are never answered it only sorta wraps up the skywalker saga
Feb 3 2020,negative,literally one of the stupidest  most disjointed movies ever  i guess you have to expect them to jump the shark on movie number 9
Feb 3 2020,positive,a rehash of all the others  too many chases and light saber fights
Feb 3 2020,positive,if you are a star wars fan this was actionpacked movie that filled some holes in the star wars lore  haters are going to hate  i loved it
Feb 3 2020,negative,it so sad for me because this could been much more than it is
Feb 3 2020,positive,not even a star wars fan but i rllyyy enjoyed this
Feb 3 2020,negative,the whole trilogy just didnt have a compelling or interesting story it had great potential with great actors an actresses but the writing and character development wasnt there to make sure that the audience really cares about the characters the fin and rey relationship could have been better and they should have had all the original leads in atleast one scene together
Feb 3 2020,positive,awesome movie and im not even into star wars i took my 12 year old to see it because hes a fan would definitely watch again
Feb 3 2020,negative,it is a terrible movie the only good thing is the fan service at the end of the movie
Feb 3 2020,negative,dull beyond redemption
Feb 3 2020,positive,i loved it  was missing something though which could have been fixed had they planned the three movies out before hand
Feb 3 2020,negative,pretty much just watch robot head on youtube it will all make sence he describes every problem i had with the movie
Feb 3 2020,positive,acting special effects and how so many characters were made part of a long story since its inception
Feb 3 2020,positive,what a challenge it was to bring this to a close  from 1977 to this movie i have been on the ride did it all work  i dont know yet its still seeking in was i entertained yes
Feb 3 2020,positive,loved it as the end to the saga had some holes to be sure but for a trilogy with  now clear direction from the beginning it felt like an appropriate and really the only way to close it out
Feb 3 2020,negative,the ending was so dumb this movie was all over the place there was no heart in this film
Feb 3 2020,positive,it was entertaining enough but not the best of the star wars movies from recent years rogue one was the best imho  didnt really feel like the end of the saga some of the magical leapingflying sequences seemed poorly done technically think house of flying daggers style poe is an irritating character misogynist  always thinks he knows better than the women leaders what strategy to pursue  all that being said id give it a second watch to pick up on anything i may have missed in all the action
Feb 3 2020,positive,i liked almost everything
Feb 3 2020,positive,i recommend seeing the rise of skywalker with two nineyearolds and a twelveyearold  after the film they were so excited to discuss the events of the film and so full of questions for me that i didnt have the time nitpick  it was fun it was funny it was exciting and it had its share of touching moments it was a star wars movie
Feb 3 2020,positive,i thinks this was the best of them all such a roller coaster lots of great surprises
Feb 3 2020,positive,very long or seemed to be dragged at parts
Feb 3 2020,negative,great acting by adam driver and daisy ridley  horrible storyline  so many missed opportunities  star wars fans wanted so much more than just another bangbangshootemup with special effects and lasers  zero explanation of any of the mythology great supporting actors roles relegated to sidekicks no redemption resolution for ben solo or the force dyad with rey and finally rey is evidently right back to where she was at the beginningalone on a desert planet  this could have been an epic tale and what sophisticated fans got was an epic fail
Feb 3 2020,positive,i really liked this movie great story acting and cinematography the only thing i could say that was lacking was the closure factor supposedly this movie was supposed to close the current story arc and so dont think it did that well if at all other than that a great movie
Feb 3 2020,negative,a terrible film and a blemish on wonderful childhood movie memory
Feb 3 2020,positive,gave a good conclusion to the saga but got a little hokey
Feb 3 2020,positive,great end to the latest trilogy  loved the characters and storyline
Feb 3 2020,positive,loved all of it a lot of action
Feb 3 2020,positive,i thought it was very well done once again a little predictable but hey thats disney for you
Feb 3 2020,positive,just thought they finally started a new path to look forward to no cussing no f bombs wow so refreshing
Feb 3 2020,positive,the action was almost nonstop  the mix of old beloved characters with the recent characters worked really well  the integration of the nostalgic images into the current story line brings both a smile and a year to my face
Feb 3 2020,positive,ancesters coming around to help rey
Feb 3 2020,positive,ive been a fan since a new hope i never thought i would like a movie better then some of the originals but this is my favorite star wars film to date
Feb 3 2020,negative,there was no george lucas touch in it it was too disney safe weak ending to an amazing saga  wish it would have been different better wait for it in disney plus dont waste the money and that is coming from a hardcore starwars fan
Feb 3 2020,negative,ffs the choices were bad 
Feb 3 2020,negative,cared more about pleasing a handful of fans than telling a good story squandered so much of the potential that the first two movies set up
Feb 3 2020,positive,i truly dont know what people couldve expected to be done differently than this i enjoyed last jedi but honestly it didnt add much to the trilogy and really just left everything up in the air you left with the same questions you had going into it this movie did as good a job as possible to tie up all loose ends and bring closure im a star wars fan i truly just enjoy the star wars universe the people that trash this trilogy in my opinion are not clinging to the original trilogy and acting like anything that has come since then isnt worthy is ignorant and kind of sad just appreciate being able to experience new characters stories and worlds in this truly amazing galaxy ive watched everything and read many of the books some are better than others but i always come out glad i experienced it
Feb 3 2020,positive,after the last jedi i had very low expectations overall i think this film was an improvement it was very cartoonish and over the top but it did have some emotion payoffs
Feb 3 2020,positive,havent we seen all these before since abrams took over
Feb 3 2020,negative,ugh crazy disappointing
Feb 3 2020,positive,very nice conclusion to the main star was timeline the fact that palpatine never died was amazing rey being the granddaughter of sheev palpating was amazing i would watch this movie over and over very good movie
Feb 3 2020,positive,a decent ending to this latest trilogy
Feb 3 2020,positive,i thought it was a good movie i love the twist with her being palpatines granddaughter i thought it was exciting it was also a little sad good movie also you killed ive ben solo which i was grateful for lol
Feb 3 2020,positive,it was actionpacked but i wished jj and crew paid just a little more attention to science  oh well its just a movie
Feb 3 2020,positive,lots of action and multiple good storylines
Feb 3 2020,positive,i loved it so many references to past movies in the franchise and the colorssoundspictures were just amazing it was great
Feb 3 2020,positive,i did enjoy it very much is it the best star wars out thereno but its a fair conclusion of the saga
Feb 3 2020,positive,felt like they rushed and tried to cram too much into the first half characters introduced but still felt no connection to most of the characters
Feb 3 2020,positive,sure some on rotten tomatoes like almost half them prolly shoot for one side and i do too soar winners losers like dropping life with bombs and keels bloom o yeahs
Feb 3 2020,positive,loved the movie bit bought it was a little long great way to wrap up a lifetime of love of the star wars series and to watch it with my son was great we watched all 8 over the christmas holiday break and then school and commitments took over our ability to catch the movie until i pushed hard for it and we got it in last night
Feb 3 2020,positive,all around awesome
Feb 3 2020,positive,it was a great story and way to end the saga
Feb 3 2020,positive,should have spent more time on who reys parents were and how she became the  one
Feb 3 2020,positive,the best one of the three glad ren turned back to ben palpatine was scary i wasnt too mad he reappeared rey did a great job as always carried the new franchise imo she had a bit of a frozen ii scene were she dived over the water to reach the ship after seeing a vision of her backstabbing grandfather from touching a relic and finn was anna screaming and chasing after her thats disney for you 
Feb 3 2020,negative,it lacks of coherence like justice league or bvs  is just scenes put together the middle has great ideas that dont pay off and the end is just  dragon ball z
Feb 3 2020,positive,the movie was pretty good wasnt empire strikes back but not nearly as bad as the last jedi with what little ground jj abrams was able to work with after the last jedi he did great some things were beyond my star wars knowledge but overall it was a very decent galactic adventure
Feb 3 2020,negative,unoriginal and unimaginative the plot was so awkwardly put together that it ended up being a jumbled mess of plotholes and irrelevancies  and this is not to mention the thoughtlessness of bringing back palpatine doing this completely undermines the moral and achievements of episode vi there were plenty of things they could have done without having to hurt lukes story why not bring a villain from the comics into the mix how hard could it have been  shockingly bad star wars film right on par with episodes vii and viii it was an awful ending to an awful trilogy good riddance
Feb 3 2020,positive,a great ending to the saga lots of action and appearances from most of the characters from the other movies
Feb 3 2020,positive,i know the film got a lot of bad press i understand what the fans didnt like on the same token i watch the star wars films for the visual beauty the inspiration and the foundation of what the films are based on so im a fan and the film was beautifully done
Feb 3 2020,positive,i love movies and i love it all
Feb 3 2020,positive,it was the best one of all the star wars movies
Feb 3 2020,positive,really liked it this was one of the best of the nine
Feb 3 2020,positive,great special effects loved the entire movie great ending love how they add old elements props characters from all the old star wars movies
Feb 3 2020,negative,if it wasnt part of the star wars universe and didnt have gaping plotholes then it would have gotten a 3 but it is supposed to be part of the star wars universe and that lowers the score
Feb 3 2020,positive,star wars was exactly what it needed to be  i saw episode iv when i was 13 and nothing will beat that  this was a good final episode though
Feb 3 2020,positive,one of the best star wars movies
Feb 3 2020,positive,like coming home to family good closure cgi was great  story wassame old stuff with a few new twists
Feb 3 2020,positive,loved it   loved the themes and lessons and pretty much everything  if youre a star wars can you must see this 
Feb 3 2020,negative,music was great some visuals that were also great but story line writing actingall feel flat i couldnt decide if it was bad acting or bad writing  i found myself laughing at moments that were supposed to be momentous and groaning at the awful lines that were supposed to be humorous so much made no sense at all  i had avoided going for a while but got invited to go with friends just to pass the time verged on walking out just a mess
Feb 3 2020,negative,what the actual f even
Feb 3 2020,negative,this was a mess a terrible ending to the skywalker saga i wish i could unsee it
Feb 3 2020,positive,the best of the lot
Feb 3 2020,positive,my family really enjoyed the movie
Feb 3 2020,positive,so good i liked they finished it very well no complaints on the production story and acting all was top notch disney did it again
Feb 3 2020,positive,loved by my eight year old but men it was long
Feb 2 2020,positive,i love star wars and i liked it a lot but it rushed to wrapup way too many timelines
Feb 2 2020,negative,about what i expected  silly at times  the villians were much more interesting than the heroes good to see leia han lando and luke one last time
Feb 2 2020,positive,right where it left offawesome
Feb 2 2020,positive,i really loved the ending it was emotional and heartfelt
Feb 2 2020,positive,i applaud jj and crew for making a satisfying conclusion to the skywalker saga i will definitely rewatch this on disney
Feb 2 2020,positive,been a star wars fan since the first episode hit the theaters this episode was epic and tied the whole saga together thanks so much 
Feb 2 2020,positive,you just have to love the whole darn series and this was a perfect last episode
Feb 2 2020,negative,how to undo any accomplishments of the original cast in a rushed convoluted mess
Feb 2 2020,positive,maybe one of the best movies of the saga 
Feb 2 2020,negative,ill be honest  i had absolutely no idea what was happening throughout the movie potential plot ideas were never explored characters came and went without much explanation and in the end it clumped together to form a notsomemorable movie if youre interested in the plot you can probably find a summary of it somewhere not worth the time to watch through what was essentially 90 filler
Feb 2 2020,positive,the final isnt the better but the spevial effects l the story and the music was good enough
Feb 2 2020,positive,it was oki just wished carrie fisher well you know
Feb 2 2020,positive,it was a fitting ending to an epic story i was sad to see it end but i was not disappointed at all
Feb 2 2020,positive,would have edited the horses riding on the spacecraftdidnt need that part
Feb 2 2020,negative,theo whole character development of rey and kylo was just utter crap
Feb 2 2020,positive,it tied a lot of the storyline together and gave me some twists i did not expect
Feb 2 2020,positive,a great way to end the iconic trilogy now disney can work on original star wars content 
Feb 2 2020,positive,it was fk great
Feb 2 2020,positive,im definitely a star wars fan and this was a solid conclusion to the skywalker arc however i thought it lacked the charisma and energy of most of the other films it seemed too dark and trite near the final battle glad i saw it just wanted to come away a bit more exciting by it
Feb 2 2020,negative,i will probably never watch it again which is sad considering its a star wars movie how is it that the writers for disney dont know about the fact that without tragedy you dont have a very good drama how is it that writers employed by a huge company like disney dont understand that war movies require tragedy for their drama to be effective   it is sad that a 40 year series ends in such an anticlimactic fashion without the level of drama it deserved  bottom line is that a lot of characters should have died and stayed dead for the epic level of tragedy and drama the series demanded in fact some characters should have died and stayed dead the previous movie no loss  no tragedy  no dramatic value  a dud of a plot
Feb 2 2020,positive,rise of skywalker may not have much to offer up characterwise but between the great effects fair amount of heart and full service to the films before it rise of skywalker is enjoyable and far from the worst way to finish off the skywalker saga
Feb 2 2020,positive,surprising i liked the movie unlike a lot of starwars movies it felt like it had an actual end instead of leaving you hanging i loved how the original characters all showed up and cinematography was impressive
Feb 2 2020,positive,sad to see this saga end but loved every minute of it
Feb 2 2020,negative,worst star wars of fancies 
Feb 2 2020,positive,very enjoyable good pacing and a fun adventure if you like star wars youll have a good time with this one
Feb 2 2020,positive,great way to end the story line
Feb 2 2020,positive,it was ok  it answered most questions  they dragged it out a little
Feb 2 2020,positive,my wife and is favorite star wars movie to date
Feb 2 2020,positive,visually the movie is everything you want it to be the vastness off space the variations of different worlds etc the acting was good however the movie was a bit to predictable you really have to suspend belief to enjoy movies these days
Feb 2 2020,negative,terrible  a zillion plot points with zero motivation for any characters  doesnt even feel like a movie feels a story a 4 year would tell  and then and then and then and then
Feb 2 2020,positive,i feel like i expressed a little more of the movie
Feb 2 2020,neutral,couldnt quite recover from the disaster of the last jedi they did what they could to repair the franchise but even bringing back sheev wasnt enough
Feb 2 2020,positive,i hate movie critics
Feb 2 2020,positive,the whole movie was great everything about it
Feb 2 2020,positive,delete this
Feb 2 2020,neutral,it felt like the same plot all over again
Feb 2 2020,positive,this movie really tied all episodes together well wish the ending wasnt like it was but necessary there was a lot of action and battle sequences that was very entertaining the skywalker saga will never die but be calm for a long time liked the voices from the past their actual voices
Feb 2 2020,positive,like everything about it
Feb 2 2020,positive,i loved it didnt see any trailers or pictures and went to watch it blind and i loved it so much im not hooked on the first trilogy so i didnt pay attention to what the fans hated in it
Feb 2 2020,positive,entertaining even if storyline is cobbled together for new trilogy
Feb 2 2020,positive,jj abrams should have had the entire trilogy the problems people had with this film was the result of jj correcting the awful mess the ryan johnson left johnson was given a perfect canvas to create something amazing but instead like an inexperienced child he demolished everything trying to make it his own the rise of skywalker is fun exiting and heartwarming everything jj does best the fact the he feels that he failed with this film is tragic this was a fun star wars film
Feb 2 2020,positive,perfect ending to a classic
Feb 2 2020,negative,lets just forget this happened and let people that make stories such as kotor  swtor and many other interesting ones make the star wars universe 
Feb 2 2020,negative,one star for some entertaining parts other than that i basically spent the movie with wtf hanging around the back of my head as a film it want the greatest piece of work music was overbearing in some scenes the story felt rushed most of the way the plot was i dunno forced apparently there was no time for character development overall it felt recycled callbacks up the ass recycled quotes from previous star wars films special guest appearances by old cast members with roles that really werent necessary  spoiler warning  as a star wars film it was frustrating to deal with i understand they went with the path that would please the most fans but how about some originality maybe a story that didnt have to rely on the good vs evil trope since the ultimate evil had already been killed in the previous film oh but wait a zombie sith lord can now drain life force and create force lightning powerful enough to take down entire fleets and also teleporting objects is a force power now but i guess that one was already implied in the previous film oh by the way this reanimated evil guy has an entire fleet of planet killers more dangerous than ever before with a massive crewarmy that he somehow had access to no explanation of why he didnt use it before when he was emperor of the universe but anyway they cant navigate themselves out of a planet but apparently all the rebels can easily guide themselves there and the fleet gets taken down pretty quickly  only one had made it out and used its laser to show its destructive power   is it a love story well some lesbian kissing happens in the background but thats about as lovely as it gets well my bad theres another kissing scene but its uhh i guess it probably got an emotional response from at least one person that saw it the point is friendship none of the heroes ride off into the sunset with anybody to bang but they have friendship  also force ghosts have force powers but they waited until this movie to do anything with it apparently and why reduce the asian chicks role so hard did they really have to listen to the few fans that were triggered by seeing an intimate moment between people of two different races from the last film godamm it really felt like these writersproducersdirectors were too scared to make something original please the fans   the only noteworthy parts  1 c3po having a moment of artificial intelligence feeling somber 2 the hacker that rewired c3pos brain was cool and it was funnycheesy when he reappears at the end but why bring him to a space battle 3 something about the music festival scene felt original unnecessary but original nonetheless 4ish even though palatine questionably brought back into it its still cool to hear him say do it   but yeah the film sucked you can sleep through the first 45 minutes and itll still make just as much sense i bet if they removed the first 45 minutes more people would actually have better things to say
Feb 2 2020,positive,i really enjoyed this film palpatines return was excellent but i wanted to see more of him and more about his relationship with rey and his son special effects were great as usual and the characters actually had matured especially kylo ren the story could have been better and the ultrafast passing could have slowed down and let the characters develop more this movie has deleted the last jedigood as far as the critics not liking tros they hold no credibility with me after how they gushed all over the last jedi that was a pos movie       if you didnt like this sequel what did you expect after is was announce jj abrams would be writing and directing the first movie that guy is an a list secondrate writer a good writer should have been chosen and a good director helm the film and lawrence kasdan should never have cowritten the force awakens he is another a list second rate writer the best thing he has written was raiders of the lost ark which was great but his star wars record is not so great he was cowriter of the the empire strikes back only because the first writer the good one died
Feb 2 2020,positive,a really fun movie with great action and good humor ian mcdiarmid once again does an excellent job as palpatine and the rest of the cast is also great rey is a lot more likeable in this movie and its a good conclusion to the star wars saga
Feb 2 2020,negative,the worst star wars movie ever
Feb 2 2020,negative,non sqeuotorial writing and strobe lights were used equally in this pointless movie this franchise has been through a lot and i am in no way a purest to the series but this movie was bland starwars tropes and bland disney tropes competing for screen time it was like eating a mouth full of plain white flour you know what is in your mouth and it isnt dangerous but it is unpleasent nevertheless
Feb 2 2020,positive,it fast pace good fun and pretty entertaining just dont think about to much
Feb 2 2020,neutral,great special effects as always story line is getting stale this one had more angry determined characters with less humor than some in the series ok for passing the time but yeah its time to move on
Feb 2 2020,positive,great music and production per usual the movie was 25 hrs long and still managed to feel rushed it was so jam packed with action and jump cuts that at times it felt disjointed
Feb 2 2020,positive,great ending to an amazing story
Feb 2 2020,negative,the storyline the acting all aspects of the movie were either very disappointing or just bad the only bright spot was harrison fords appearance
Feb 2 2020,positive,very well done and a great ending to this chapter
Feb 2 2020,positive,should have made a part one and part two fillm too soon for emperor palpatine to die including the admiral
Feb 2 2020,positive,the action the previous actors from star wars in this one as well as the creators
Feb 2 2020,positive,amazing no words to describe such an amazing plot the thing is its highly accurate with the books as well they really did their research
Feb 2 2020,negative,just goes to show if you havent got an destination you cant have an ending terrible disney really terrible trilogy
Feb 2 2020,positive,loved every second of it the resistance lives
Feb 2 2020,positive,great end to the saga
Feb 2 2020,positive,enjoyable end to the franchise but a missed opportunity for it to be amazing the story took a few pointless turns that didnt pay off in the end
Feb 2 2020,positive,good movie although i deeply disliked  the ending given to the narrative arcs of rey and ben solo the unpleasant  of this ending hopeless and incoherent with all the mythological background of star wars made me observe the narrative holes of the  argument and detract value from the visual beauty and musical spectacularity that the film has rey must have  always been an important bridge for ben solo to win the battle and successfully conclude the heros path regaining his honor and that of his family in front of the  community rey should never have been named himself skywalker the romantic situation of the ending was correct
Feb 2 2020,positive,one of my favorite movies watch all star wars before watching this one 
Feb 2 2020,negative,not really any story  a lot of running about in chases  had a hard time staying awake  it got very confusing was a recall of old the old characters from the other installments  lots of dead folks reviving  they did work in the ewoks who didnt seem to do anything waste of time
Feb 2 2020,positive,it tied up the skywalker saga and left you satisfied
Feb 2 2020,negative,someone edited this thing to death poor writing wont watch it again i love star wars but this movie just made me angry 
Feb 2 2020,positive,a fitting end to original saga
Feb 2 2020,negative,could it have been better yes did some parts feel a little slapped together a lot of 79 did but ix was fun i enjoyed watching it and what they tried to do with it my kids enjoyed it a lot too
Feb 2 2020,positive,great finale to the series brought the feels out worth the wait definitely worth seeing again and again m
Feb 2 2020,positive,i thought overall it was a good movie and appreciated that it had an ending that left you feeling good i wished that some of the characters  arcs had been widened and given them more meaningful connection but i think it wrapped up nicely while still leaving opening for future movies
Feb 2 2020,positive,this was the perfect ending to a saga spanning 9 movies  non stop action delicate handling of the characters and it gave me all the feels  if you are a star wars fan or just a fan of movies go and see rise of skywalker today
Feb 2 2020,positive,the last two movies had to much drama and very little action but this one had very little drama and more action  seems like disney cant find a happy medium when it comes to star wars  some parts were very predictable and i felt like i   was in slow monition waiting for it to happen  im so happy that kylo ren wasnt as winy as in the first two movies  but who could blame him  he had two mentors that didnt seem to do anything to help him develop  i really felt disney could have brought so much more to his character  the action seens were so long you almost forgot what they were doing  they determined who reys family stems from but it still didnt make sense to me  without giving away details i wont go into it  so im giving this movie a 35 because as far as the mythology goes in star wars i feel like disney still didnt hit the mark
Feb 2 2020,neutral,spoilers  its a good movie in terms of the acting and vfx fight scenes all that jazz my problem is with the plot and the pacing  you barely get a chance to process some of the information  early on theres a scene where a character may or may not be dead but within a minute we know the fate of that character  add to that problems such as palpatine somehow secretly building a million star destroyers all with mini death star lasers on them piloted by who according to my searches they typically need 40000 crew the lack of clarity on what a diad is and how all the civilian ships managed to just warp in all at once despite rey and kylo being shown to have a tough time going through that red nebula basically star wars does dunkirk   its ok as a movie to enjoy for its visual value its good but as the conclusion to a 9 part saga i was hoping for better   i personally prefer prequels to this sequel trilogy purely because theres a coherent direction its going in  ep ix just throws the emperor back in as a desperate attempt to salvage this trilogy after snoke snuffed it in tlj
Feb 2 2020,positive,movie was good i think the ghost of darth should have showed up like lukes ghost it was kind of freaky seeing carrie fisher 
Feb 2 2020,positive,i thought it was really as good as all of the the others
Feb 2 2020,positive,the movie was the best ive seen so far
Feb 2 2020,positive,glad it was the last one not as good as previous ones  it got rather long  boring
Feb 2 2020,positive,actionstory ending
Feb 2 2020,positive,loved this movie it was a beautiful end to a long story
Feb 2 2020,positive,the cheese quotient was absurdly high but thats always been true of star wars so it shouldnt be a disappointment to a real fan
Feb 2 2020,positive,loved the storyline and how they brought the old and the new together
Feb 1 2020,positive,nice finish to the final trilogy
Feb 1 2020,negative,lots of unanswered questions and the cg made everything seem so phony and fake this beloved classic certainly went downhill and even jj abrahams couldnt redeem it
Feb 1 2020,positive,as a fan you want to see how it all comes to conclusion   however the movie does not give you closure or a fell that one has when they see s conclusion to a series   overall watching the move was not a disaster but we could have let go of some cliches of the kiss and sacrifice
Feb 1 2020,positive,good ending for the starwars franchise   the plot doesnt hang well with the earlier movies  but otherwise it is a good action film with plenty of easter eggs from the original
Feb 1 2020,neutral,positives visual effects and score  negatives acting script plot and relies on nostalgia from previous installments
Feb 1 2020,positive,its not the same star wars i grew up with but even yet the story line was good and the action and cgi where great 
Feb 1 2020,positive,it was a good conclusion to the skywalker story a definite improvement from the previous film hopefully we will see films in the expanded star wars universe
Feb 1 2020,positive,thought it was a good easy to end the story it was a bit cheesy at times
Feb 1 2020,positive,just fun escapism nothing complicated  good times
Feb 1 2020,positive,i enjoyed this movie more than the first two im looking forward to seeing what disney does next
Feb 1 2020,positive,awesome cant wait for next one
Feb 1 2020,positive,super production and super story
Feb 1 2020,positive,loved it even more the second time
Feb 1 2020,positive,very busy better the second time
Feb 1 2020,negative,the final movie in the franchise was very disappointing it has a really unsatisfying ending i dont think that this movies failure is due to abrams i believe this movies failure really comes from the last jedi the last jedi ruined the franchise there was a clear plan but that was thrown away by johnsons terrible film buy the end of the film i cried of only disappointment
Feb 1 2020,positive,star wars the rise of skywalker finishes off the sequel trilogy of the disney star wars franchise in this finale emperor palpatine returns and the resistance have to take down the emperor and the final order  written by chris terrio and jj abrams the plot for this film is nothing short of a shambles emperor palpatine returns with no explanation to how he came back from the dead a certain moment that is supposed to be a surprise is seen from a mile away no major risks are taken or consequences received on the side of the protagonists in attempting to take down the biggest ever sith power the galaxy has seen the characters are overwhelmingly under written so despite however much the actor tries the audience just dont care for the characters rey seems to have incredible force powers seeming to be more powerful than some of the most experienced jedi like mace windu yet the audience have no idea how this is possible as she is incredibly under trained kylo rens arc was terribly set up throughout this trilogy and his decisions are never taken seriously by the audience as he has always been a very wish washy character  directed by jj abrams shot by dan mindel and edited by maryann brandon  stefan grube the uses of shot selection and transitions between different scenes were all executed really well with there being some really great shots of landscapes that are drawn out which allows the audience to take in the picture in the frame despite this general solid direction abrams missed many markers on comedic moments especially within the first act which wouldve brought the act to life more and have the audience more invested due to the faster pacing  john williams is the one constant over the nine episodic films of the star wars saga that has never let the film down he has an excellent ear as for what instruments should be playing what they should be playing use of dynamics and more to enhance or in the case of this film create the atmospheres within the scenes  the acting in this film is very mediocre given that the characters are underwritten the actors do very little with the characters they have to tell the story of what little there is their characters have to tell adam driver kylo ren daisy ridley rey and john boyega finn all do very little with the dialogue theyre given to create a dynamic character the audience can connect with and although he has a smaller role the same can be said of oscar isaac poe dameron all the veterans within this cast show the main protagonists how to portray an interesting character mark hamill luke skywalker though having little screen time does a good job ian mcdiarmid emperor palpatine once again does a sublime job at portraying the most evil and sinister person in the galaxy and richard e grant general pryde also does a great job of creating an antagonist the audience take seriously  this film had promising elements within it but a lack of vision over the whole trilogy by the producers meant that the film was always fighting a losing battle in trying to cap off the most iconic cinematic franchise of all time
Feb 1 2020,negative,doesnt have that star wars feel just another mass produced crowd pleaser and not really for long term fans
Feb 1 2020,positive,another amazing star wars masterpiece
Feb 1 2020,neutral,i think the last jedi is an truly masterpiece in writing than this unnecesary fanservice bufet of the franchise
Feb 1 2020,positive,classic star wars action previous actors from earlier moves were good to see again star wars will endure forever
Feb 1 2020,positive,it was good but it felt a little long which usually means it was
Feb 1 2020,positive,great movie dont listen to the critics
Feb 1 2020,positive,it was a good movie and it helped bring the saga from the disaster of last jedi really like the connection of kylo and rey it will look good no matter what because of the money involved but the story was moving and enjoyable thought the kiss of kylo and rey wasnt too needed bit it wasnt too bad
Feb 1 2020,positive,you can only stretch out a good thing so far
Feb 1 2020,positive,if you didnt like this movie your kind of a hater just to be a hater i dont know what people expected but they did good with the material it had 
Feb 1 2020,negative,terrible movie worst directed star was yet
Feb 1 2020,negative,too many contradictions and contrivances
Feb 1 2020,negative,what a sad mess lets throw in anything familiar to try to tug at heart strings lets throw in the most star destroyers ever fuck it lets equip all of them with a planet killing weapon then lets make then all dependent on 1 tower the bad guy built them all by himself  pure garbage good riddance to the worst trilogy ever of the most valuable franchise in the world people waited decades and this is what disney gave them what a joke
Feb 1 2020,negative,this was the worst of the 9 star wars movies the script and story were horrible disney and jj abrams have trashed the star wars franchise bring back george lucas please
Feb 1 2020,positive,okay but nothing new
Feb 1 2020,positive,great characters that you want to route for or route against
Feb 1 2020,positive,lovely finish to the skywalker saga
Feb 1 2020,positive,like all star wars movie it was a cartoon brought to life  i could have done without the obligatory everybody congratulating everybody scene at the end  but for a check your brain at the door movie it kept me interested   i liked it
Feb 1 2020,negative,same plot lines regurgitated from other movies rey was terrible again fin was only okay and ben was the only good actor  would not receive rushing to theaters just wait for dvd
Feb 1 2020,negative,so bad so camp so boring
Feb 1 2020,negative,after watching this trash i wish i could force ghost out of existence
Feb 1 2020,negative,horrendously edited weird pacing and random useless plot twists that had zero reason to be placed in absolutely no setup made within this movie or throughout the entire trilogy had a proper pay off the movie was pure fan service to try and distract from the lack of plan disney had all along not to mention  palpatines return was the dumbest thing ever done in cinema history it was not adequately explained within this movie or any points prior to the movie and it robs from the impact of the original trilogys ending
Feb 1 2020,positive,way more entertaining than tlj  great special effects as always  thank you jj for a valiant attempt at saving the star wars franchise
Feb 1 2020,negative,a product of two creatives known for their terrible writing being put in charge of the final piece of one of the most legendary sagas in all of movie history a story making almost no sense from start to finish terrible pacing and editing worse performances from all of the actors and a terrible almost depressing end to what should be a mystical and fun scfi fantasy adventure mental note dont ever make a movie trying to please everyone for you will please noone
Feb 1 2020,positive,of course i have a few criticisms but as someone whos been a star wars fan since the mid 90s this is one of my favorites
Feb 1 2020,positive,nice storyline awesome scenes and set but could have been a bit more catching in general
Feb 1 2020,positive,great action and suspense not to mention a couple of unexpected outcomes and appearances making for an interesting conclusion butthere seems to be a familiar feel to the plot and characters circumstances  many scenes seem somewhat repetitive of those from 4 5 and 6  otherwise the movie provided 25 hours of fun and distraction
Feb 1 2020,negative,sloppy writing the story arch was a huge let down without spoiling anything was fin ever going to tell her the thing i could go on for hours on how the ending was just a huge pile of hot gahbage
Feb 1 2020,positive,loved it star wars started when i was a kid and i havent loved any of its episodes more than the first and now the rise of skywalker what an awesome ending to an amazing story
Feb 1 2020,positive,powerfully acted plenty of action and a satisfying conclusion if not for some questionable writing at times
Feb 1 2020,positive,definitely best of st and its even my favorite movie of all time rey and kylo are each perfect and their character arcs are deep and there are still audience subversions and surprises
Feb 1 2020,negative,didnt feel like a star wars movie  so many plot holes so much stupid stuff crammed in for no real reason  the only good spot was how they handled leias final moments  reys growth into a jedi was barely touched on  fin had no character development  palpatine back from the dead  really really  jet packs on storm troopers just to justify one joke  this is what you get when you dont involve or even consult with the guy that created the entire star wars universe  wish i could get my 15 bucks and 2 12 hours back directy from jj abrams
Feb 1 2020,positive,it was a good great movie not a great great movie but a good great movie
Feb 1 2020,positive,the movie was awesome
Feb 1 2020,positive,rey played an exceptional role grand daughter of a sith she showed the world that no matter your genes your journey through life dictates your future
Feb 1 2020,negative,monumental lack of imagination unworthy end for the saga just another disneylike trash
Feb 1 2020,positive,id love to give rise of skywalker 5 stars but cant as much as i love star wars and the continuation of the series this is episode 9 i think its time to move on i loved everything about this movie how it followed the canon the action twists and turns and the ending couldnt have been more classic star wars however the saga in this iteration is showing its age the never ending theme of good vs evil light vs dark will always be around so you cant really completely kill the darkside any more than you can the lightside so i dont know of this was truly the last installment of the series but they need to do something special for the next one come on disney flex your creative muscles and give us some episode x goodness
Feb 1 2020,positive,great felt like a true star war saga
Feb 1 2020,positive,loved the story and the action
Feb 1 2020,neutral,full of fanservice like avengers endgame but in the wrong way it has a mix of things that feel kinda rushed somehow it manages to entertain but with a clear loss of the sw spirit
Feb 1 2020,positive,a tad too much suspension of disbelief for a star wars movie  also who was blowing up in those star destroyers  was it a bunch of green conscripts  these things only quashed my enjoyment slightly i have never met a star wars movie i didnt like
Feb 1 2020,positive,great movie had some plot issues but lots of fun fan service that left my jaw dropped multiple times not a perfect movie but im so happy with it
Feb 1 2020,positive,it maintained the story line was very well cast and acted  and came full cycle back to the skywalker home great movie and we saw the first when it opened
Feb 1 2020,positive,a great end to the star wars saga
Feb 1 2020,positive,a non stop action was amazing i like how they brought characters from the original 3 series back including wedge antilles and lando calrissian
Feb 1 2020,positive,great movie and ending to an epic story 
Jan 31 2020,positive,its okay good escapism  but they could have edited out 20 minutes at least i could pic and nic at it but lol ill let it go and we now move on
Jan 31 2020,positive,pretty good even if predictable
Jan 31 2020,positive,completely surprised how amazing this movie was after seeing all of the star wars movies from my early childhood true to the anticipation and awe and character development from the older originals its very difficult to be awed with all of the modern movie tech abilities
Jan 31 2020,positive,i thought its was good
Jan 31 2020,negative,abrams screws up again
Jan 31 2020,positive,glad ray didnt turn to the dark side shocked by the kiss at end of movie
Jan 31 2020,positive,i was disappointed by many parts of the movie
Jan 31 2020,negative,horrible movie its just random fan service that completely ignores the previous episode
Jan 31 2020,positive,over loved it good conclusion  definitely catered to the fans more than genuine storytelling at times
Jan 31 2020,positive,pretty good movie in the se franchise
Jan 31 2020,negative,as far as star wars goes it is mediocre  it doesnt have the charm of the force awakens and it doesnt have the artistic direction of the last jedi  while i thoroughly dislike the last jedi this is just worse
Jan 31 2020,negative,easily my least favorite movie of the sequel trilogy the first 45 minutes of the movie consisted of some of the worst editing ive ever seen while the rest of the movie tried to undo what rian johnson did in the last jedi
Jan 31 2020,neutral,sometimes it benefits you to let a scene breathe this movie is so fast paced it left me with a headache and too many questions action is nice but i wish i waited for video on this one 
Jan 31 2020,positive,thought it was a great ending to the trilogy  was great to see all the original characters back one last time but sad for the loss of our princess  rip carrie fisher you are missed
Jan 31 2020,positive,interesting to see how the usual suspects trash a movie thats basically accomplished the impossible complete the most important and relevant movie saga ever both main actors play superbly their roles stressing powerful ness and female independence enjoyed it from beginning to end
Jan 31 2020,negative,it starts at a 9 and stays there there is very little transition from one hectic plotpoint to the next and youre given no time to explore all of the new characters and planets as youre being dragged across the galaxy   jj tries to pull at your heart strings by playing on emotional ties that the characters are supposed to have but its confusing as to what exactly those emotional ties are as throughout the trilogy we havent had much time to explore and develop these elements which causes some scenes to feel artificial and confusing  ideas are recycled and theyve taken very few creative risks with this film attempting to remake aspects of a film that accomplished it much better  overall its a frantic story designed to push the viewer along as fast as possible before you have time to think why many of these things dont make any sense within the context of the star wars universe it attempts to emotionally involve the viewer and then immediately backpedals with an eyyy we gotcha moments several times which renders anything that anyone does meaningless theres nothing at stake no points of any real contention and never a moment where you feel that our protagonists wont triumph  its an altogether safe and very bland movie attempting to vomit as much as it can at the viewer in hopes of obscuring its nature
Jan 31 2020,positive,it was  awesome i loved it was not rushed and had a good flow 
Jan 31 2020,positive,funny and action packed
Jan 31 2020,positive,jj abrams somewhat corrected the trajectory of the star wars universe undid some choices made in the last jedi but nothing drastic enough to pull you out of the movie its unfortunate that the films in this trilogy contradict each other as opposed to working together to tell a cohesive story
Jan 31 2020,negative,total disgrace to whole series it became a cash cow for disney such a waste and shame to its own foundation of sw series probably it will get even worse till disney gets back the investment and make enormous profits
Jan 31 2020,negative,no flow no need for palpatine way too chaotic dullcolored and fast paced
Jan 31 2020,positive,it doesnt reinvent the series or the genre but its a great closing chapter the emotional content felt real and the performances were worthy of all thats led up to it funny in the right places and serious when it needs to be without getting too overthetop for all they needed to close out im pretty thrilled with how they managed it go into it like a kid seeing star wars for the first time and you may find that you like this movie a lot more than some critics did
Jan 31 2020,positive,best star wars film to date
Jan 31 2020,positive,good film just disappointed by the end
Jan 31 2020,positive,i felt it was a tribute to long time star wars fans
Jan 31 2020,negative,the biggest poop on sw franchise ever thx disney
Jan 31 2020,positive,for me a really good movie with a great changes until the end but its dificult to be with fans and critics at the same time
Jan 31 2020,neutral,this movie was filled with so many plot holes that might make you confused through out the movie
Jan 31 2020,positive,excellent example of big screen professional film making engaging from first scene to last i am not a star wars fanboy so unfortunately there were a few scenes that i actually laughed out loud  and not because i was overjoyed the breakdown for me is something like 25 childrens movie 25 video game 50 great movie
Jan 31 2020,negative,a series of montages of characters been chase all around and a series of stupid decisions to move the plot forward and fan service cheap one not even good fan service
Jan 31 2020,positive,we waited for the rush to die down and then went to see it in a theatre we totally enjoyed it
Jan 31 2020,positive,i thought it wasnt going to be good because of the negative reviews but it was so much better than episode viii and did a good job at tying up loose ends of this trilogy  it was a great movie and im glad i saw it
Jan 31 2020,positive,cool special effects epic lightsaber fights fun to watch
Jan 31 2020,negative,terrible script  lots of plot convenience to fill in the numerous holes in the storyline
Jan 31 2020,positive,the movie was fun but it did move very fast and i feel that it needed to take its time and expand on some of the story beats
Jan 31 2020,positive,as a huge fan of the sequel trilogy i couldnt be happier with this epic conclusion to the new trilogy in my personal opinion it also offers a fitting end to this beloved skywalker saga   the beginning part of the movie may be slow plot wise but is chalked full of fun banter exciting chases and character development fans of action may be bored but those like me who have grown to love these new and old characters will have fun throughout   the climax is epic and powerful both stunt wise and emotionally its bittersweet and leaves your heart achingin a good way powerful tributes are paid to beloved characters and past movies that are satisfying in every way this film is a joyous celebration of starwars  this film has only been out a little over a month and already its quite controversial some love it others hate it   id say if you are a fan of the sequel trilogy movies or just all of the movies youll probably love this movie  this movie was not made for critics to rave over it was instead made as a love letter to fanswhile also trying to be separate for the casual movie goers   if you are watching this to pass the time and you arent really a starwars fan by all means give it a try but there are probably other shorter movies youd enjoyand understandbetter  if you are a fan of the originals and andor the prequels and didnt like the force awakens or the last jedi because they just arent what you would have written yourself then please skip this one as you probably wont like this one any better and the last thing this movieor all the wonderful cast and crew who worked so hard to please us and pay tribute to our beloved starwars franchiseneeds is more hate from fans who just want to see the originals again   conclusion   this movie is amazing a joyful celebration of all things starwars worth several views my new favorite movie youll love it but only if you have the right mindset for it   may the force be with you always
Jan 31 2020,positive,one of the best star wars
Jan 31 2020,positive,the story line was great
Jan 31 2020,positive,i really dont know how the true star wars fans think this is a good end for the saga the story is rushed yet the movie feels really slow is incoherent and even in some points contradict itself the worst part is that finn poe and the others new characters even kylo ren were wasted to leave the hole weight of the trilogy to rey
Jan 31 2020,positive,a great ending to the trilogy and impressive after having to reconstruct and save everything the last jedi destroyed imagine what the trilogy could have been if rian johnson never got anywhere near it
Jan 31 2020,positive,i like everything about it  it was a great movie and so much better then the last movie
Jan 31 2020,neutral,better the tlj it just couldnt recover the damage done by rian johnson
Jan 31 2020,positive,i liked that it didnt have too many slow moments but the story was a little convoluted but since it was trying to fixed the damage the last one did its understandable overall a good movie experience
Jan 31 2020,positive,i think that it didnt work in conjunction with the last jedi
Jan 31 2020,positive,this movie answered a lot of questions really well there was a lot going on but if you just enjoy the ride its a great flick i guess there are a lot of star wars fans that cant be satisfied but this one was
Jan 31 2020,negative,so boring both of us passed out watching it
Jan 30 2020,positive,really good moviemy kids and i really enjoyed it
Jan 30 2020,positive,after episode 8 it was as good as it can be
Jan 30 2020,positive,the final chapter was long awaited and provides everything needed to end the triple trilogy it wasnt the greatest film of the nine but essential to complete the story envisioned by george lucas
Jan 30 2020,negative,once again the powers at disney and lucas films has delivered a trifecta on how to destroy a much loved franchise just like the two previous movies we have no imagination on continuing a great story we just get a story full of plot holes bigger enough to hide a death star in the return of palpatine wtf how lazy can they be
Jan 30 2020,positive,liked the new actors and the returning actors fighting the evil forces
Jan 30 2020,positive,great movie and a lot of action
Jan 30 2020,negative,the movie was awful there really wasnt much of an actual plot and you can basically forget continuity cannon if i were you i would not go and see it it will ruin all the enjoyment from previous movies it had a poor beginning and not much of an endingmore like the lights came on in the theatre i felt robbed of my money and made a fool of for wasting my time i thought surf nazis was badoh i didnt realize how good i had it dont be fooled it doesnt end the franchise on a high notei am forced to give the movie a starit deserves 4 black holes
Jan 30 2020,neutral,i enjoyed it but i didnt like it at all  does that make sense
Jan 30 2020,negative,jj abrams an kathleen kennedy ruined the star wars universe the last jedi and rogue one were really good and solo was underrated the rest are pretty bad and just a retelling of the original of the original series with different characters i wish rian johnson was in charge of the star wars franchise because his was the only good one out of the three that jj started and finished
Jan 30 2020,positive,we really enjoyed the movie we like the actors the drama and the comedy in parts
Jan 30 2020,negative,i have seen tros three times now and i simply cannot understand how some people like it it is easily my 10th or 11th favorite star wars film i thought last jedi was a pretty good movie but tros has so many illogical moments and poorly planned payoffs the death of ben solo is unnecessary and rushed not to mention he has no lines in the entire third act it makes no sense why rey would go to tattoine in the final scene the palpatine stuff is a mess reys lineage is a mess palpatine wants her dead the first half then suddenly wants her alive in the third act ren doesnt know that rey is on his ship until the vader mask travels through their force bond although she is holding the dagger from his ship during their entire battle finn is criminally underused rey and poe still have little to no weaknesses or character rose is underused lando is great but also a bit underused babu frik is cool though so thats nice the last minute reshoots and corporate interference by disney really hurt this film but also it should have been directed by collin treverrow not jj abrams who also made the below average force awakens its a shame a great saga had to end this way
Jan 30 2020,negative,totally sold all the characters arch short and was just super flat pretty mediocre and poorly constructed story line a disappointment of epic proportions
Jan 30 2020,positive,i am a fan of the star wars series since the first movie  the characters and storyline were appealing  it still had an assortment of kookie characters and robots  i also liked how han solo and lea were included in this movie  this was a vital connection with the original series storyline  i guess this is the end but i hope not
Jan 30 2020,positive,best one in the new trilogy
Jan 30 2020,negative,sometimes ill start a sentence and i dont even know where its going i just hope i find it along the way  jj abrams probably  star wars the rise of skywalker is one of the most underwhelming movies ive seen in a while the plot is strewn together via various coincidences and aha moments that are in no way earned the reveal of reys grandfather is incredibly anticlimactic and feels thrown into the mix especially since its in direct conflict with the progress made by rian johnson in the previous film say what you will about tlj but the idea of the force being accessible to others is a magical development in the star wars universe  in fact this movie retcons so much and delivers so much fan service that its almost at fan fiction levels of cheesiness the most ridiculous example of this is the kiss i would bump this review up a whole half star if rey and kylo ren had hugged instead folks two people do not spend three movies trying to kill each other and then make out hours after one of them decides to do some good this is not hermione granger and ron weasley ending up together after 7 years of bickering and more importantly friendship not only does this kiss feel completely out of place but it further complicates the unfinished plot line of finn pining after rey another problematic aspect of the trilogy as a whole  before i move on to some positives id also like to say that this films treatment of rose tico is disrespectful at the least great job letting crazy fans bully you into submission disney  id be amiss if i didnt praise adam drivers performance as kylo ren driver goes there in this movie i also thoroughly enjoyed the duelingbattle sequences and special effects although there was nothing groundbreaking there
Jan 30 2020,negative,boring  too many effects  story was mishmash until the end  director didnt do his job
Jan 30 2020,negative,jj is a good action director but cant write a coherent script and terribly misunderstands what made the original trilogy so enduring the story moves at such a fast pace you dont have time to figure out that the scene prior doesnt make any sense his attempt to retcon the changes rian johnson made in the last jedi will be studied by film students for decades these final moves are a disaster
Jan 30 2020,negative,a travesty disney  who ever is responsible should apologize to the artists and the fans for wasting their time and money nothing is earned way too many rules are broken with no setup theres about 3 to 4 times too many ideas delivered too fast making none of them stick with any meaning opportunities for some great mysterious reveals were wasted with no build up easily the worst star wars film to grace the theaters it has some wonderful visuals but theyre just thrown away on this film
Jan 30 2020,positive,it has all the qualities that a good star wars movie should have
Jan 30 2020,negative,the total and complete lack of continuity and creative writing leads to a disappointing ending that does not fit in with the rest of the trilogy and even star wars as a series  the rise of skywalker even hits a similar conclusive beat that seemed to result in diminishing emotional returns which was mainly caused by the lack of dialogue and an unearned kiss this also due to the butchering or even dismembering of kylo rens character arc
Jan 30 2020,negative,felt like watching an video game with constant pointless fetch quests character inserts to sell merch and more if you think this is good cinema then i think you probably just want a good video game if you like movies check out david drivers other work its much better
Jan 30 2020,positive,special effects in action
Jan 30 2020,positive,i enjoyed the movie very much it was visually stunning moved along rapidly had adorable moments and was emotionally moving answered many questions about the saga in usual graphic novelcomic book way  its what i expected and what was given and i loved it
Jan 30 2020,positive,it was a fun movie to enjoy with all ages  lots of action and adventure
Jan 30 2020,positive,a satisfying conclusion to the star wars story i loved it
Jan 30 2020,negative,the star wars universe was created a long time ago in a galaxy far far away with general rules on how things work in the universe yet the director throws that all away  terrible character development terrible plot development just a pathetic effort to try and appease fans
Jan 30 2020,positive,it was good because it was star wars
Jan 30 2020,negative,jj tried to reverse tlj but in the end the story was to far destroyed to have any of it really make you care
Jan 30 2020,positive,very good and well supported story of the rise and fall of the enemy
Jan 30 2020,positive,a decent story to tie up a number of loose ends in the saga  however in that they tried to cover too much ground in one movie
Jan 30 2020,positive,great action moviewonderful on how they did the leia characterit completes the storylinesa must see more than once to see everything
Jan 30 2020,positive,great graphics plenty of action
Jan 30 2020,positive,actually i was bored
Jan 30 2020,positive,i like scifi but im not a star wars fanatic it was ok
Jan 30 2020,positive,it was entertaining with action
Jan 30 2020,positive,this is a very entertaining movie but certainly lacks some basic dramatic structure to be a consistent movie on the other hand this is truly a star wars movie unlike the last jedi which was the teenagers wet dream of directorwriter this is not the clausure i wouldve liked but this is ok after the huge damage done by the previous movie
Jan 30 2020,positive,this was only my second star wars to ever see and smit was great great
Jan 30 2020,positive,it was a great family film
Jan 30 2020,positive,it was a beautiful movie i loved the story visuals and cast
Jan 30 2020,positive,as an individual film i love it but it has flaws great acting from adam driver and daisy ridley and john williams music is flawless i felt the film ignored many aspects of the last jedi that were new to the saga but overall a good film
Jan 30 2020,positive,great movie  george lucas films do not disappoint
Jan 30 2020,positive,a great ending for the greatest saga ever
Jan 30 2020,negative,i thought it couldnt get any worst than episode viii it did a reintroduction of an old character to make up for inability to create new interesting stars says it all
Jan 30 2020,positive,this movie paid a lot of tribute to the star wars expanded universe in various ways that the average star wars fan might not understand as such it was a sendoff for the true star wars geeks out there but in making some of those choices it may have left those less informed about the lore of the star wars universe a little confused  its an excellent film especially for the serious star wars fan and i loved it
Jan 30 2020,positive,it was really good much better than i was being lead to believe by friends the story was really good the special effects were a little cheaper than im used to from disney and star wars but its a great movie
Jan 30 2020,positive,dont care what the detractors are saying  its another blockbuster action packed and thought provoking for future star wars stories must see chapter in the 3 generational series that will endure for so many years to come  thank you george lucas and everyone who has had anything to do with the making of these wonderful stories
Jan 30 2020,positive,enjoyed show and actors were great    a bit long   but had plenty of good popcorn to make it through
Jan 30 2020,negative,same old soap opera pointless long surely the last one
Jan 30 2020,positive,best of the sequels by far and out of the 9 skywalker saga movies its 79
Jan 30 2020,negative,this is a film that really didnt know what it wanted to be it thinks its a followup to the previous two star wars sequel trilogy films and it also seems to think that it needs to tie up every single loose thread from the other two trilogies as well it succeeds at none of these  every interesting plot thread from the last two films is thrown out the window in favor of gratuitous fanservice for fans of the original trilogy and the basic plot itself is so crammed together with useless new secondary characters that steal the spotlight away from the main heroes and multiple fetch quests marred by plot detours that are ultimately rendered pointless later in the film there is no meaningful character development rey effectively has her entire character arc reset in this movie and she ends the film worse off than when she started finn is entirely superfluous to the story spending the entire film either being useless or an outright hindrance rose went from an important secondary character that played an important role in developing finns character as well as the overarching themes of the trilogy to being reduced to a glorified cameo in this film who has a combined two minutes of total screentime in this nearly 25hour film poes development from the last film isnt followed up on at all and even when the film reaches a point where he should take the center stage in the conflict he still ends up losing screentime to the aforementioned superfluous finn  the villains were easily the worst part of the film however kylo ren was set up as the final villain during the last film but instead he spends much of the film playing second fiddle to emperor palpatine the villain of the previous trilogies who inexplicably has returned from the dead this is not a spoiler his face is on the poster and his resurrection is established in the first two sentences of the opening crawl palpatine has no reason to be in this film he wasnt set up at all in the previous two movies and his influence on the overall narrative was minimal at best hes only been shoehorned into this movie as the main villain as a means of justifying not one but two lazilywritten very outofcharacter redemption arcs one of which is effectively dropped as soon as its brought up as the character in question dies unceremoniously and is never brought up again  overall this film is a mess while not necessarily the worst star wars film i maintain that the phantom menace and attack of the clones are worse than this its still a flaccid conclusion to this trilogy and an absolutely embarrassing ending to the skywalker saga anyone who likes this movie is certainly entitled to their opinion but i left the theater with very few positive impressions that have only soured in the time since ive seen it
Jan 30 2020,positive,i thought the last chapter of the star war movie was fantastic it was what i hoped for regarding the final ending of a longrunning successful 3 trilogy career consisting of 9 movies  the first 3 in my opinion were the best from 1977 to 83 when i first saw them the prequel trilogy from 1999 to 2005 wasnt in my opinion very good due to script writing digital effects and acting but the last 3 from 2015 to 2019 i did enjoy regardless what the critics said in the media gg
Jan 30 2020,positive,one of the best star wars out of  all star wars movies
Jan 30 2020,negative,it had space battles and laser swords and a few good ideas but the plot is a hot mess that ignores or seeks to overrule way too much of the previous film while throwing in new things out of nowhere with little to no satisfying explanation the set up of last of the jedi was great but is thrown out in favour of leftfield connections to the earlier films and new characters who do nothing but take time away from the main cast and existing supporting characters who deserved more time
Jan 30 2020,positive,the movie was good but the story wasnt exactly what i expected in the end  i dont know if that is what george lucas intended
Jan 30 2020,positive,i thought it was a very well done movie that closed off the sky walker saga well
Jan 30 2020,positive,honestly i am not a star wars fan and only went because other family wanted to go  it was ok
Jan 30 2020,positive,i thought it was a good ending to a great saga
Jan 30 2020,negative,what a disappointing ending to a disappointing trilogy
Jan 30 2020,negative,just saw it to finish the set
Jan 30 2020,positive,the movie had all the characters in it
Jan 30 2020,positive,loved the ending and all the action
Jan 30 2020,positive,sure there are plot holes but this movie builds on what has gone before it brings great resolution to the arcs of rey and kylo ren and is a fitting end to the 9 movie saga
Jan 29 2020,negative,it was so stupid and rushed overwrote all the great things last jedi have us i hope this move will be redone
Jan 29 2020,negative,not the worst star wars movie but nowhere near the best the story is badly written with major plot holes and unnecessary side quests jj abrams doesnt use the current cast as well as he should have because he was to busy trying to introduce too many new characters the ending is probably the best part of the movie ending the saga in a nice way however it does feel a bit to similar to the ending of endgame
Jan 29 2020,negative,packed with fabulous acting and spectacular visuals yet so rushed that it felt more like a fastfood drivethrough catering to hungry fans with all the ways they could have concluded the trilogy its disappointing that the production team seemed to focus on retconning the last jedi
Jan 29 2020,positive,not bad gave me some really nice surprises couldve used better fight choreography and directing though
Jan 29 2020,positive,its a good movie lots of fan service but dont listen to most of these hollywood blowhards who hate this movie but some how love the last jedi its not empire but its a solid movie
Jan 29 2020,negative,these movies just keep getting worse im officially done with star wars disney has turned the franchise into a steaming pile of fetid trash how did disney put out such quality for decades then just in a matter of a few years become one of thee most loathsome production companies im the world i really am curious the plot is all off course theres no character im cheering for here its insanely injected with political agendas the jokes didnt make me laugh once one of my kids fell asleep in the theater he said he was so bored the other said he doesnt mind not seeing the next one and i agree ive told all of my friends and family to skip this one and the rest
Jan 29 2020,positive,it tied up loose story ends
Jan 29 2020,positive,i love these movies  however the open items are so frustrating when the thought is closure
Jan 29 2020,positive,as good as any other star wars episode good action and effects kept me interested for the entire length of the movie if youre a star wars fan see it
Jan 29 2020,negative,an incredibly brazen unimaginative and above all disrespectful film it is inconceivable how disney managed to do that
Jan 29 2020,positive,a lot of action but i hated the ending the final battle with great but not ending
Jan 29 2020,positive,ties up the story in epic fashion makes you wish they had kept jj abrams on for the entire trilogy the storytelling worldbuilding and emotional impact are so much better in his capable hands shame on disney for allowing ryan johnson to smudge what could have been a perfect trilogy
Jan 29 2020,positive,it was a good finish but there were problems like them standing on the ship in space cmon really
Jan 29 2020,positive,i expected alot better the first half of the film was cramped with extra material that we didnt need the ending was very disappointing
Jan 29 2020,positive,the visual effects and overall story line were great however the end came quicker than you would like and left you feeling there would be another film that is not going to come
Jan 29 2020,positive,not thrilled with the ending was hoping for a jedi marriage babies future powers
Jan 29 2020,positive,a good movie that closes this bumpy saga with emotion and nostalgia a lot
Jan 29 2020,negative,i dont even know what to say 
Jan 29 2020,positive,my favorite out of the 3 films 
Jan 29 2020,positive,as much of a let down to this legacy as the last series of got
Jan 29 2020,negative,another ewoks vs empire failure what is it with the third installment that the plot just goes south its like the writers are tired of their own story weve seen this all before nothing new here and nothing good two stars for the great acting but the writing plot and cinematography get nothing 
Jan 29 2020,neutral,better than the last jedi but not by much
Jan 29 2020,positive,very nice shot i like it
Jan 29 2020,negative,i hate  everything in this movie thank u disney
Jan 29 2020,positive,great movie sorry to see the end of this great saga
Jan 29 2020,negative,awful  there can be no course correcting of tlj and this attempt failed miserably  rewriting the original trilogy by throwing the canon in the garbage and lighting it on fire is a terrible way to prove how woke disney is  in the end not only did they neuter the greatest jedi of all time but they also flipped the chosen one script by letting a palpatine outlast the skywalkers then steal their name  sidious won after all
Jan 29 2020,positive,everything i want from a star wars movie
Jan 29 2020,positive,its a movie and a good story not real life see it like that and youll enjoy the movie
Jan 29 2020,negative,seemed disjointed and not well plotted out from the previous entries
Jan 29 2020,positive,i enjoyed the movie the acting and writing were entertaining
Jan 29 2020,negative,i think i dont have to add anything couse everything had been said thx jar jar u did it  but it is stunning and brave so it has to be good
Jan 29 2020,positive,an underwhelming conclusion to one of the most influencial film series of all time the disjointed story seen through the trilogy demonstrates abrams perhaps never had a clear vision of this project which consequently affects the movie and its messy narrative the first two acts are fairly entertaining following a simple adventure through the galaxy unfortunately the third act falls flat and shows a lack of imagination and risktaking by part of the writers which ultimately leads to having an anticlimatic final battle and a rather bland closure faking the death of the beloved chewbacca demonstrates they played it as safe as possible
Jan 29 2020,positive,awesome movie i dont know which movie the critics watched because i want to go watch it again it only took a few decades for everyone to figure out how to shoot and hit their target on the first shot i love this movie you
Jan 29 2020,positive,the 9 films as a body of work is a colossal achievement  by this time though the themes have become a bit stale even with the evolved set of characters and the ever improving moviemaking technology
Jan 29 2020,negative,mild spoilers involved  just not a very good movie in general  i agree with many of the critics for once the powers that be seemed to concentrate more on clicking boxes and making rey the savior of well everything and everyone rather than tell a good story  the one good element was that the acting was superb for the most part  they just did not have much to work with  it was beyond predictable and half way through i was just ready for rey to kill you know who already so i could be done  the interesting and exceedingly frustrating miss is that the story screamed for a huge twist that would have really cemented a lasting legacy for the franchise  in the almost year leading up to the premiere there were minor hints of a possibility that rey could fall to the dark side at some point  though as more trailers revealed this was probably not going to happen it would have made for a great plot choice with endless possibilities  1 rey falls kylo is redeemed and must stop her  2 rey falls and finn becomes a jedi to stop her perhaps with kylo  3 even rey falls but is ultimately redeemed   any of these options and more would have really opened up the story more  it also would have solved another glaring problem with the trilogy as a whole  i like most everyone thought the prequels were pretty bad but i believe this was more due to poor acting than anyone cares to admit  but what i loved about attack of the clones and revenge of the sith was the multiple jedi and to a certain extent sith we were able to witness  this was something even the original trilogy did not have though i will admit those movies were certainly fine cinema at its best on their own  in any case it would have been great to see more than just rey and kylo in every movie  luke leia and the emperor had mere moments of battle plus they were all known characters and old by this time  it would have been great to see finn explore his abilities snook not dispatched so quickly and in action and perhaps a couple of others  i was genuinely tired of the reykylo fight love whatever before the last movie even started  ok my rant is done maybe well get this and more in the next trilogy
Jan 29 2020,positive,love it i think it ended the series on a nice note and finished up the story
Jan 29 2020,positive,what an amazing movie to end such an amazing saga definitely my favorite of the new 3 star wars movies
Jan 29 2020,positive,way better than the last sw spends a 13 of the time explaining the last movie and the other part with fan service the effects were very good and had some nice fan service moments much darker than the rest of series dipping into dark mysticism and possession overall a nice end to a other wise debacle 3 series run by disney if you love the originals this one will meet your fan needs makes it into my the top 5 sw list saw it twice  dont listen to the paid critics
Jan 29 2020,negative,the story was stupid and way over the top most of the resistance characters are boring and uninteresting the actors that play fin and rey cant act for shit it would be recommended that they focused on the story rather than the cgi and conforming to the pc culture
Jan 29 2020,positive,was a great ending to the series
Jan 29 2020,positive,great movie fantastic to see all the old stars from previous movies
Jan 29 2020,positive,fantastic movie best of the series
Jan 29 2020,positive,i loved it how it kept you on edge on whats going to happen next one of the best films ive seen in a while sorry end game but skywalker has got you beat
Jan 29 2020,negative,please god fire kennedy hire anybody else idc but these terrible movies have to stop  the mando is 10000 times better  at least it has interesting characters granted abrams didnt have much to go off of with that last one idk why i thought this would be a decent movie  just call george lucas do us a favor
Jan 29 2020,neutral,bland film full of fanservice
Jan 29 2020,positive,lots of action and well played 
Jan 29 2020,positive,a good ending to the sequels had a great time   the originals and prequels i find more compelling storywise but cant deny the next level visuals in these
Jan 29 2020,positive,i loved it i thought it was a very satisfying ending to the series while still leaving open some possible disney or future movie spinoffs great special effects as well
Jan 29 2020,positive,excellent way to end the star wars saga the movie was as good as the very first one in 1977 an awesome movie with excellent actors  glad we saw it  may see it again
Jan 29 2020,positive,loved it had all the things i needed to conclude the chapter seeing my story close to eloquently it couldnt have been done any better 
Jan 29 2020,positive,awesome easter eggs and hidden messages
Jan 29 2020,positive,we loved it great way to end the saga
Jan 29 2020,negative,it was worst sw movie ever
Jan 29 2020,positive,wrapped up the series in a logical way adam driver got to do some acting other than fighting
Jan 29 2020,positive,as a movie this was hot garbage if you watch it like it was fireworks completely ignoring and not expecting anything about a plot it was one hell of a spectacle
Jan 29 2020,positive,great movie loved the ending leaves room for so many possibilities
Jan 29 2020,positive,very satisfying closure to the star wars saga at least the skywalker part for now checked all of the boxes
Jan 29 2020,positive,sad to see the end of this saga but it was time it was good for the final chapter
Jan 29 2020,positive,i absolutely loved it it had so many easter eggs of all 9 movies its fast paced so hang on tight
Jan 29 2020,positive,some lazy written sub plots couldve been left out all together im looking at chewbacca
Jan 29 2020,positive,great graphics and story line i laughed cried and got madd
Jan 29 2020,positive,what an amazing movie daisy ridley did such an amazing job it was even better the second time i watched it five stars for sure
Jan 29 2020,negative,too much too much going on too much action too much twisted plots too much back references it was just all too much you can tell that they are trying to hard i was hoping for a good story but instead we got a resurrection of a dead man calm down disney
Jan 29 2020,positive,so i loved how this film was a beginning to end unifier for the skywalker story  i cried theough the majority of the movie and it was beautiful how they concluded it  now the person that i was with pointed out that every fight scene was actually a replica of previous fight routines from the earlier movies which dampened their enjoyment  but i am nostalgic and love the throwbacks  i recommend for sure
Jan 29 2020,positive,best one since the empire strikes back did a great job wrapping up the story
Jan 29 2020,positive,it was incredible  the special effects were spot on
Jan 29 2020,positive,kept my interest and never slowed for entire 2 plus hours  better than previous opinions made me think it was gonna be
Jan 29 2020,neutral,after the promise of the last two films this one fails on just about every level
Jan 29 2020,positive,entertaining but is too fast paced a unique and original script
Jan 29 2020,positive,much of the special effects were not realistic like all the characters hope the adventure continues
Jan 29 2020,positive,beginning set up was a little rushed ending had a needless death otherwise it was entertaining
Jan 29 2020,positive,it brought me back to my childhood when i saw the very first star wars movie with my family as little rugrats now more than 40 yrs later it has ended it was bittersweet
Jan 29 2020,positive,so much hate from star wars fans but this was a great addition to the story
Jan 29 2020,positive,star wars the rise of the skywalker was a fun movie to watch and does well with making the viewers think one thing and then something else happening the massive battle scene was impressive to see and has a relative good conclusion
Jan 29 2020,positive,was ok but had some pretty cringe stuff near and at the end
Jan 29 2020,positive,confusing to keep up with
Jan 29 2020,positive,really enjoyed it kylo redeems himself rey lando c3po  finn  poe were the best heroes any star wars fan could ever hope for
Jan 28 2020,positive,great way to end 40 years of star wars viewing even got a little weepy
Jan 28 2020,negative,similar to the latest terminator this story does everything it can to completely dismantle the previous story especially the originals dumb plot with characters who serve no purpose in the movie
Jan 28 2020,negative,bring back george lucas now
Jan 28 2020,positive,exceptional  it checked all of the boxes including providing closure for this series
Jan 28 2020,positive,its star wars a good science fiction franchise that ended this chapter well with fantastic people behind it and in it you get a good movie when that movie is trying to fix its predecessors constantly it will show that doesnt take away from anyones nostalgia blinders or need for it to be perfect none of the previous movies were perfect no movie can achieve that rise of skywalker is a good movie and worth the watch anyone telling you different is in film school or overly critical if you arent either youll like it
Jan 28 2020,negative,i just want to erase the sequel trilogy from memory and pretend it never happened the only good things about it were the force awakens score and bb8 but i can no longer listen to the wonderful rey theme without remembering her origins and going into hysterical laughter i find the the disneyfied lucasfilms lack of vision and coherence disturbing
Jan 28 2020,positive,we loved it it was fast paced and the cameos by original characters were a wonderful surprise
Jan 28 2020,neutral,i get jj was screwed after the last film im just glad he made luke catch anakins lightsaber and tell rey and ryan johnson that a jedis weapon deserves more respect really redeemed it for me lot of plot holes just wish this movie wasnt rushed when youre ending a saga that most people grew up as kids still sucks to see how luke was treated but whatever
Jan 28 2020,positive,it wrapped everything up almost too nicely
Jan 28 2020,positive,the best of all the newer star wars movies by far
Jan 28 2020,positive,i have seen this movie twice  for about a month before the release i put myself on blackout to avoid spoilers and especially to avoid reviews i knew that reviewers would attack the movie and i predicted everything most of them would say even before i saw the movie myself  all i can tell you is that i loved every minute of rise of skywalker and im grateful for the return of the chemistry and fun between the main characters that was established in the force awakens but absent in last jedi
Jan 28 2020,neutral,evidently upset by rian johnsons contribution to the series in the last jedi jj abrams has returned to the star wars universe to set the record straight often directly contradicting the plot points and character arcs set in motion by the preceding film that makes for an awkward sort of arm wrestling competition as johnson himself often seemed intent upon bucking the conventions established by earlier chapters in the franchise in other words you undid my work now im going to undo yours  the result in this case is an overstuffed mammoth of a film that tries to do too much while also somehow accomplishing very little not the first time a skywalker film has been messy but the lack of enthusiasm and excitement is certainly new even in the muchmaligned prequels there was something unique and special about seeing a star wars movie this time despite the enormous budget eight films worth of leadin tons of new environments and alien races plus constant callbacks to please the diehards the final product is rather bland and pedestrian and thats probably the most damning thing i could say about it this isnt the grand conclusion to a generationslong space epic its just a nondescript runofthemill science fiction shelffiller with a billiondollar sheen its a mass of writers room concepts tossed into a tumbler and belched out onto the screen without much connective tissue  episode ix does have successful moments the law of averages says given enough options somethings bound to stick yet even when they hit upon a winner abrams and companys lack of conviction their reluctance to take a risk and get firmly behind any one direction lessens the meaning of the whole how disappointing that its come to this
Jan 28 2020,negative,overall the plot moved way too fast and coursecorrecting from tlj was on overdrive the movie had good moments saving it from a onestar but at the end of the day just a mess
Jan 28 2020,positive,it was so good a good finish to a great saga
Jan 28 2020,negative,id rather watch paint dry than see this shit again
Jan 28 2020,negative,a fitting end to the absolutely horrid sequel trilogy i have no idea how disney could fail this hard with such a wonderful franchise the film is nonstop quests after nonsensical plot devices culminating in nonsensical worldbuilding that fails to remedy the deficiencies of the previous movies
Jan 28 2020,positive,plenty of fanservice maybe a little heavy on the technobabble in places im convinced that the screenwriters started with the idea of a cavalry charge on a star destroyer and then wrote the final battle around that this movie didnt have a scene as cool as the suicidejumptolightspeed in the previous film but overall i think this was a better film lots of fun and a nice goodbye for many of the characters
Jan 28 2020,positive,jj abrahams managed to fix up the mistakes of the last jedi
Jan 28 2020,negative,disney ruined star wars the final trilogy was terrible as much as i loved the mandolorian is as much as i hated the last jedi and rise of skywalker as fans we should file a class action lawsuit to have creative rights turned back over to george lucas all three movies were written as though they were cartoons even palpetine wasnt the same lucas had a way of developing characters and telling the story that was uniquely star wars disney got it way wrong please just let this be the end dont ruin anymore of my childhood
Jan 28 2020,positive,great end to the series
Jan 28 2020,positive,rey is strong and good the forces that love will win in the end a great metaphor for our times
Jan 28 2020,positive,glad i got to see it in the theater a great movie and jj abrams somehow was able to splice together the storyline of his force awakensloved it and rian johnsons last jediwas alright  an excellent star wars movie that had a few twists and turns and some great moments to close the series down are they really going to stop making star wars movies  i dont think so    definitely a thumbs up
Jan 28 2020,positive,this movie is leagues better than the catastrophe that was last jedi a lot of the plot points you can tell were shoehorned in but when you gotta end a series in 150 minutes thats gonna happen overall was good and sent the rocky trilogy off on a good note
Jan 28 2020,negative,they should have built onto the ideas introduced in the last jedi instead of boring us with this abomination trying to please everyone is what gives you crap like this this is what happens when businessmen not artists make the decisions
Jan 28 2020,positive,very entertaining and actionfilled  enjoyed it as it continued authentically in the star wars vein
Jan 28 2020,positive,for what we got im grateful but it couldve been better i liked the 1st act 2nd act was fine but the whole 3rd act was just horrendous i was quite disappointed with the 3rd act and i didnt quite agree with some of the decisions that were made also i was not a fan of palpatine coming back especially without no explanation on how he survived from being disintegrated and thrown down a shaft he was just brought back to die by rey which was such a let down i did like how they retconed tlj i was very pleased with the stuff they fixed from that film overall it was just an alright film 710
Jan 28 2020,positive,as a fan who was in the theater in 77 as a kid watching star wars and who grew up on the franchise this was a satisfying end to the saga
Jan 28 2020,positive,better than i expected
Jan 28 2020,positive,excellent finale to the saga but has to be seen in the context of the series
Jan 28 2020,positive,was way too fast in exploring relationships  left me feeling empty at the conclusion oh the saga  guess ill have to see it again
Jan 28 2020,positive,one of the better star wars movies
Jan 28 2020,positive,this movie does a great job of tying up loose ends and also excels in bringing star wars a promising future however the plot started getting messy towards the climax and many promising characters were thrown away
Jan 28 2020,positive,i was really surprised to like this movie as much as i did found it to be far superior to the previous installment with a level of passion from daisy ridley and adam driver that carried the day trotting out old favorites like billy d williams and a very overweight mark hamill was stale and predictable but it was good to see emperor palpatine again hes one of the few villains that truly scares me with his evil   having  rey be his granddaughter made sense to me  i was truly moved to tears by the climax of the movie where rey and ben have their moment   ben was doomed by his close association with the dark side but his soul was redeemed by his pure sacrifice for rey      the other fresh aspect of the movie were the droids  the ever annoying c3po actually gained my sympathy with his memory loss   and the new conefaced droid was really adorable  with the never underestimate a droid subtheme the writers brought out the true humanity in these  artificial beings they continually fight for recognition  c3po saying  im ok although you didnt ask  and never quite get their due  but their hearts are as real as ours
Jan 28 2020,positive,i thought this movie was great it had the feel of the original trilogy and kylo ren had an amazing arc
Jan 28 2020,positive,best movie of the sequel by far  very cool to see everything from the whole series finally come together  in my mind this was the best movie since episode vi return of the jedi
Jan 28 2020,positive,likedvisually very goodso much to watch need to see it again to catch all that was in this movie disliked  really think this is my problem  i havent seen all the movies more than once so it seemed like an alot was assumed i knew or could figure out so i think i missed a lot of what was intended  just means i will have to catch up  in the future
Jan 28 2020,negative,hard to follow plot boring scenes this movie is all over the place people complain about the obi wan and anakin trilogy but this film definitely takes the low ground
Jan 28 2020,positive,a little less of the ships fighting thats all
Jan 28 2020,positive,expected the end to be different
Jan 28 2020,positive,i thought it was a great movie for the finale of the 9 part series it was never going to be prefect but it definitely was epic many things were tied up many urges satisfied and it was moving at a steady pace throughout
Jan 28 2020,negative,rather than delivering a final hopeful conclusion the 42yearold saga the movie is trying to retcon what came before and does it in such a terrible way the movie itself feels like it was catered to the toxic fanbase and it doesnt carry the story anywhere it makes every single easy coward and unoriginal choice very disappointing  the cinematography and vfx are also very bad the whole movie is absurdly blue lukes force ghost looks like a listerine bottle  the only good thing about this movie is john williams
Jan 28 2020,negative,no plan for a trilogy of films makes rise of skywalker seem like its in a constant fight with the last jedi over narrative choices they tried to cram several movies worth of plot points and all of them are poorly developed and many lead nowhere beyond being mentioned
Jan 28 2020,positive,tied together some loose ends from earlier episodes and set up some story lines for future episodes pretty exciting
Jan 28 2020,positive,solid movie definite plot reaches for max onscreen excitement but the story found ways if interconnecting the series in unexpected ways which was nice
Jan 28 2020,positive,surprisely better overall movie than i thought it would be  rey and ben characters were much more interesting and consisted of stronger acting than in previous movies  while many of the other actors were soso as in the previous movies  pretty interesting story with a few unexpected twists although much of the movie contained similar and predictable scenes as in the previous star wars or other action movies
Jan 28 2020,positive,entertaining i did not sleep through this it was a little long though it did not compare well to other star wars movies but this saga is now ended  i think
Jan 28 2020,negative,as a long life fan of the franchise this was heartbreaking  i love star wars and forever i will support it however  starting from the force awakens until the last jedi the greatest thing about the new saga was that rey was a nobody the decision for making this movie is so reactionary basis  then again it is what it is ill keep supporting the next saga as we all should  hopefully better next
Jan 28 2020,positive,i really enjoyed this ending to a great saga honestly ive love star wars since i was a little kid and ending the saga with this ending was honestly an honor to see
Jan 28 2020,positive,its a damn good movie with the highest ending of the whole star wars saga
Jan 28 2020,positive,wrapped up the series very well  im a huge star wars fan and i loved it
Jan 28 2020,positive,it was really good did not disappoint
Jan 28 2020,positive,i am certainly glad that i saw this movie as i did want to see how everything wrapped up  it could have been a little tighter as there were parts that tended to drag a bit  however all in all it was still a good story
Jan 28 2020,positive,the franchise returns to what charmed us in the first place the power of family the family you find along your way the bond between rey finn and poe supported by chewie threepio and the rest of the supporting characters give the movie a ton of heart add the epic battles wonderful humor and tearinducing moments and the rise of skywalker stands as a classic entry in the franchise
Jan 28 2020,positive,with a critical hat on its easy to find flaws  the breakneck pace robs us of what would have been welcome character and story beats the plot and some motivations are cosmically iffy but as a fan damn there is so much to enjoy here   enjoyed it with reservations first time around loved it the second time some choices i was initially dubious about have definitely grown on me
Jan 28 2020,positive,this was an excellent installment to the star wars franchise some slow to get there moments but the great performance of the cast kept things moving and enjoyable for the entire film
Jan 28 2020,positive,great ending to a great story arc
Jan 28 2020,positive,thank you jj abrams for bringing some closure to an old star wars fanboy
Jan 28 2020,positive,wonderful lifealtering
Jan 28 2020,positive,tied the skywalker saga up nicely well worth seeing
Jan 28 2020,positive,great ending wrapped it up well
Jan 28 2020,positive,dont listen to the haters this movie was great cleaned up all of last jedis missteps what an epic finale
Jan 28 2020,positive,plot was superficial and acting or the directing of the actors was mediocre
Jan 28 2020,negative,the most disappointing thing is that there is absolutely nothing special about this film  a lackluster conclusion to the skywalker story
Jan 28 2020,positive,thank god its the end
Jan 28 2020,positive,strangely enough i fell asleep 3x during the movie it like a little rushed maybe its because im a casual star wars viewer that i needed more of a backstory or of a refresher but i didnt know what was going on at certain moments and i dont think its just because of me falling asleep
Jan 28 2020,positive,seeing all the old timers in this movie takes me way back
Jan 28 2020,negative,it was really bad the camera shots of the film werent anything special the story was really confused the end was so bad and ruined everything this franchise was going for a definite skip
Jan 28 2020,positive,a good conclusion to the star wars saga
Jan 28 2020,positive,it was a good ending to the story although reys character is good i find it hard to find her a lasting character like leia
Jan 28 2020,positive,exciting movie with some old some new characters
Jan 28 2020,positive,its star wars the xwing vs rey scene was magical but that magic was expected throughout the whole movie not just 5 minutes
Jan 28 2020,positive,pretty much more of the same
Jan 28 2020,positive,loved the whole movie  the end wasnt what i expected it was like blha
Jan 28 2020,positive,i really like the love story between ben and ray he really loved her and im glad he finally found peace with who he was
Jan 28 2020,positive,jj did his best to save the johnson fiasco   embodied the spirit of star wars
Jan 28 2020,positive,better than last jedi but not has good as force awakening
Jan 28 2020,positive,liked some of the tie in with the emperor and previous movies
Jan 28 2020,positive,the force was truly with this film i enjoyed it from beginning to end all the great characters the scenery great film
Jan 28 2020,positive,the story line was very good i absolutely loved it great action and sad too i cried like the last 10 mins of the movie my husband was happy with it also great date night
Jan 28 2020,positive,loved it  very little i can complain about as a genuine star wars fan
Jan 28 2020,positive,i dont understand all the negativity about this movie it continued the story and brought the series to a conclusion
Jan 28 2020,positive,i hope not last of star wars
Jan 28 2020,positive,its star warsso much has been said about this movie that it is not necessary to repeat it all  this is a good movie if you just go to see a space opera  disney has made it so that if you do not watch the cartoons and disney pay per view then you dont really know who is doing what or how they got there  this is an ok ending to the star wars original story line as flawed as it is  the fact that so many different people have taken a shot at telling george lucass story leave the whole franchise fractured so you cant blame jj abrams for not having enough super glue to put it all together neatly
Jan 28 2020,positive,special effects were good
Jan 28 2020,negative,horrible piece of writing and filmmaking rouge 1 remains the best star wars film followed by empire strikes back
Jan 27 2020,negative,this is not peak star wars what it reminds me of is when authors were allowed to go in any direction they pleased during the expanded universe days this movies doesnt feel like a star wars movie it feels like something the mcu would put together everything is overpowered invincible and indestructible truly a sad and depressing ending to a great saga thankfully clone wars season seven is on its way
Jan 27 2020,positive,loved how well the balanced the entire film giving you everything you could want in a movie bringing the franchise to an end beautifully
Jan 27 2020,negative,bad from beginning to end
Jan 27 2020,positive,i thought the movie was great i saw it twice i have heard that a lot of people are not fond of it i just went in for the entertainment value some questions were answered and some i felt we were left hanging anyway ill probably see it again
Jan 27 2020,positive,im a star wars fan  i really enjoyed the film i am looking forward to seeing it again
Jan 27 2020,positive,by far the biggest movie events of my life we all waited for this and from the start you get the feeling all the negatives although few from previous star wars outings got the better of the production it starts off extremely fast paced if not rushed only to realise once you get halfway you end up with more questions than answers by the end you wonder why could this not have been split in part one and two jj abrahams got the job done and bloody well done in the end  but you cant help but wonder how brilliant this could have been had it just been kept to the original recipe
Jan 27 2020,negative,i am so disapointed in both rian johnson and jj abrams for destroying what could have been what a horrible ending to the skywalker saga unimaginative boring stupid beyond belief and a complete betrayal of star wars
Jan 27 2020,positive,great story and movie overall 
Jan 27 2020,negative,the last jedi was initially a hard sell for me but at the end of the day it still felt like a star wars movie and in hindsight it was refreshing that the movie covered new ground however i feel the rise of skywalker is not only a bad star wars movie but just a poorly made movie in general the editingpacing is frantic the storytelling and character building weak and the star wars canon was blatantly ignored at several points in the movie also there were absolutely no stakes in the movie whatsoever any danger that was felt was immediately resolved this film felt like a complete mess and gave me the same nauseous feeling in my stomach after seeing indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull i have been a strong supporter with the direction disney was taking this franchise up until this point it is so unfortunate to see this new sequel trilogy fighting with itself when there was so much potential
Jan 27 2020,positive,everything i wanted tremendous fun and a rewarding end to the saga
Jan 27 2020,positive,im always going to rate star wars favorably but definitely a great episode and must see the inclusion of old locations was well done the truth of rey being answered was good and the character of ben solo was well done
Jan 27 2020,positive,the subtle humor and fast pace kept me engaged i wish they had done this in two movies although i loved the nods to the original trilogy it just felt like there were too many wrapped with a disney bow
Jan 27 2020,positive,great movie wrapping up the star wars saga
Jan 27 2020,positive,i am a lifetime star wars fan and thought they tied in old information and characters perfectly wrapping the saga up with heart and integrity
Jan 27 2020,negative,its ok plays out more like a treasure hunt or scavenger hunts then really a movie and it also feels forced and a lot of the scene especially the comedy
Jan 27 2020,positive,loved it sad to see it end
Jan 27 2020,positive,i really did enjoy this movie i read the reviews that said it was all over the place but i think it worked the way it was i cant say it was the perfect ending to the series but when do we ever get a perfect ending to such a beloved series i would definitely recommend it
Jan 27 2020,positive,very good for the hand he was dealt was it perfect no could it have been better with just one director piloting the whole trilogy from 7 to 9 of course dont blame jj and star wars for the bad choices disney execs made he made a fun movie and tried his best to tie up 42 years of lots of people having different and sometimes competing ideas about what star wars means saw it six times and loved it more each time
Jan 27 2020,positive,good action and story
Jan 27 2020,negative,spoilers i think of myself as a huge star wars fan so i support them in almost every decision they make when i was watching the movie however i would be lying if i said i wasnt resting my head on my hand half the time rey had such raw strength and such skill with her staff that she had become an excellent jedi even without the amount of jedi training she couldve gone through but if youve seen the movie then you know that she was able to kill the emperor in the end with kylo rens help this troubled me mostly because it destroys the prophesy that anakin skywalker was the chosen one the one to bring balance to the force but if palpatine survived does that mean that rey is the chosen one after seeing lots of the colin trevorrow leaks in his duel of the fates script i feel that the movie could have gone a lot better if taken in a different direction of course this is just my opinion
Jan 27 2020,positive,loved it cant imagine a better way to wrap things up for what has come before and leave the door open for new stories in the star wars universe
Jan 27 2020,positive,satisfying if not inspiring of repeat viewings rise of skywalker adequately wraps up the nine film saga
Jan 27 2020,positive,overwhelmed  such an epic adventure i made a great memory with my son and my brother you must see it on the big screen
Jan 27 2020,positive,there were a few plot holes that got brought up but overall enjoyable seemed like emotionally a mild rerunning of episode vi but without the intense connection to characters in the original trilogy
Jan 27 2020,positive,very entertaining  lots of very neat resolutions but overall fun
Jan 27 2020,positive,most star wars fans will like this movie  for me i needed a nap part way thru  the plot line is limited and doesnt benefit from the new idea that one needs to be evaporated not just annihilated to be dead and gone  too bad  i am in love with reyridley who continues to be awesome in this film
Jan 27 2020,positive,the movie had me on the edge of my seat at times  i also feel like this being the last star wars movie my best friend just died  i love all the star wars movies it was the first date my husband and i went on in 1977  he has since passed away and i felt that same feeling sitting there watching the movie i did 43 years ago when he was with me  thank you for the memories
Jan 27 2020,positive,an okay at best ending to the skywalker saga a very safe story with abrams usual panache for generic fan service
Jan 27 2020,positive,great action the kiss was well strange
Jan 27 2020,positive,there were a few things i wish had gone differently but overall i still loved the movie
Jan 27 2020,positive,i been a fan of star wars since 8 years old i hated the last jedi but this movie was pretty good i enjoyed it very much
Jan 27 2020,positive,good plot great picture satisfying end to star wars
Jan 27 2020,positive,i enjoyed it  great special effects sound etc
Jan 27 2020,positive,much like the rest of the new ones it was okay nothing to spend the next 4 decades watching over and over again
Jan 27 2020,positive,im conflicted about this movie 90 of it is very entertaining especially the lightsaber battles you get moments with all of your favorite characters what i couldnt get past was one major plot point thats introduced in the first five minutes i thought it took away from the drama at the end of return of the jedi the script is lacking a bit too  some things are thrown out there but not resolved i thought there was too much forced humor in the first hour if you are a star wars fan like me youll probably like the movie but overall i think the last two movies were a bit of a disappointment
Jan 27 2020,positive,exciting and fast moving good video effects
Jan 27 2020,negative,destroyed lore  had no real story to speak of  piss poor character development  the space battles and saber fights were boring at best  2 hours of my life i can not get back  not to mention the money
Jan 27 2020,neutral,bad guy in black turns good at the end and helps defend the last jedi against the emperor i saw that movie already it had vader and luke skywalker in it the whole trilogy was a rehash of a story already told terrible
Jan 27 2020,positive,great movie my only suggestion is to have an interlude so that we can have a restroom break
Jan 27 2020,positive,my husband loves scifi and star wars i watch them with him and they have been entertaining and okay was kinda dreading going to the new star wars yesterday and absolutely loved it even clapped super good
Jan 27 2020,positive,i loved it so much so that i wept uncontrollably at the end as it closed out a 40 year series of movies that started for me a long time ago in a place and time far far away  plus my daughter who had never seen a star wars movie before loved it too so it worked for fans old and new
Jan 27 2020,positive,fantastic fight scenes throughout good start great ending
Jan 27 2020,positive,awesome movie  if ur a star wars fan go see it if not go see it anyway far from disappointing   t
Jan 27 2020,positive,if you are a true star wars fan you will like the movie as it has the same flare as the other ones  its not a modern new action movie which i think is why so many were disappointed  it liked it was it the best one no but it was fun to see and give me my star wars kicked
Jan 27 2020,negative,invented new history and powers at odds with older movies  lots of telegraphed scenes  very simplistic movie
Jan 27 2020,positive,i loved it it was the third best star wars and the best of the new series
Jan 27 2020,positive,it was formulaic and predictable  while it was nice that it paid homage to the legacy characters it certainly didnt break new ground
Jan 27 2020,negative,a mindboggling mess that tries as hard as possible to pretend the previous film never happened while filling its bloated plot with story threads that belong in the middle film of a trilogy at least ian mcdiarmid seems to be having a very good time
Jan 27 2020,positive,warning potential spoilers ahead most people can agree its not that great yet not that terrible but that didnt stop me from enjoying it though better than the last jedi the rise of skywalker still has its major flaws such as feeling a bit too fastpaced and rose tico being absolutely ignored throughout the whole movie aside from the flaws there are the good things and one thing that stuck out in the rise of skywalker was the fanservice and chewie finally gets a medal also leias final act was absolutely extraordinary and the scene with harrison ford returning out of nowhere left me trying to hold back all my tears to wrap this up the rise of skywalker is a satisfying ending to the skywalker saga yet missed out on so much opportunities toms grade c
Jan 27 2020,positive,action packed and emotional im not sure why its getting all the hate we loved it
Jan 27 2020,negative,movie was rushed seemed like scenes were just cut  pasted together palpatine didnt fit in the story at all so disappointed
Jan 27 2020,positive,awesome movie kids loved it fun characters and past character involvement some nice twists and unexpected humor throughout
Jan 27 2020,positive,action filled and good story line
Jan 27 2020,positive,this movie has gotten an undeserved flogging it was fun exciting great effects good action and nostalgic sure it was a bit sugary at times but it had the spirit of the original star wars and is worth seeing it
Jan 27 2020,positive,it was great a lot of easter eggs for fans of the saga but also well developed and catching even for people who havent seen any of the other movies
Jan 27 2020,negative,the first half of the film is busywork where the characters are sent on fetch quests the second half of the film is playing a oneup contest with itself but with no real emotional stakes about 13 of the jokes are okay the other 23s are pretty cringeworthy it is okay for there to be fake rules in a fantasy world but you have to follow your own fake rules that you set up or else you risk being annoying which this movie is
Jan 27 2020,positive,loved it from beginning to end would definitely wanna see again
Jan 27 2020,positive,its entertaining but lacks the true sw feel from the first six disney still missing the mark again ruining sw another one they had to buy
Jan 27 2020,positive,it was not a disappointment and was surely action packed
Jan 27 2020,positive,amazing like all star wars movie you wont be disappointed 
Jan 27 2020,positive,loved it  very different  ending 
Jan 27 2020,negative,wow that was awful you couldnt have possibly made a worse trilogy if you tried i cant wait to see you in 2030 years when disney reboots this hot garbage
Jan 27 2020,negative,besides the great soundtrack and image editing the ninth movie of the star wars franchise was awful important characters that gained long screen time in the previous movies were ignored and elements such as the force seemed naively used disney wasted the enormous potential of this trilogy and made every possible choice wrong
Jan 27 2020,positive,this movie is really good
Jan 27 2020,negative,the movie was all over the place it was throw together so fast what little plot thier was it was hard to find
Jan 27 2020,positive,it was a good movie overall but i didnt like a few parts
Jan 27 2020,negative,weak story line and too violent
Jan 27 2020,positive,a good way to end the franchisefor now star wars rise of skywalker does alot right by giving fans of the franchise what they want while still being an entertaining movie on its own there may be the odd plot hole and the neglection of characters and developement but on a whole its a strong entry to the series that at least sees this beloved franchise end on good terms
Jan 27 2020,negative,messy storyline that doesnt hold up
Jan 27 2020,positive,was very entertaining and lots of twists and turns great movie
Jan 27 2020,positive,loved that some old characters were brought back  it was nice to see princess leiacarrie fisher very fitting to end the series  hated to see it end
Jan 27 2020,positive,i had read many bad comments about this but i personally thought that the movie was great  i think it did a good job at tying all the episodes together
Jan 27 2020,positive,great way to end the dynasty loved it
Jan 27 2020,negative,an absolute cringe fest
Jan 27 2020,negative,terrible ending to a terrible trilogy i loved the first 6 films however the only good movie since disney took over was rogue one
Jan 27 2020,positive,great movie superb cast  best star wars
Jan 27 2020,positive,adventure fantasy love it
Jan 27 2020,positive,i think jj abrams saved the trilogy by fixing and cleaning up rian johnsons mess thanks jj he came back and answered many questions that were opened up in the 1st film rian opted not to answer those questions and upset everybody by taking u turns with the story that  nobody wanted to see i do wish a certain relationship got its clarity or was materialized it began to catch fire in the 1st film and the second film threw a bucket of water on it i was hoping to see it rekindled oh well good film overall
Jan 27 2020,positive,hard to close out a tremendously impacted series this did a great job
Jan 27 2020,positive,a fun time and definitely better than the last jedi the whole trilogy leaned too much on nostalgia was not enough on story
Jan 27 2020,negative,disney should give sw back to lucas fights are lame as fuckkkkkk
Jan 27 2020,positive,i liked that it was star wars disliked the storyline and the writing there were a lot of things that shouldve been left out and a lot of campy lines imo
Jan 27 2020,negative,disney do not carry the torch as george lucas would have the story left much to be desired  i was highly disappointed by the final episode i will never view star wars  the same way again i love mickey but i hate what you did to the star wars franchise disney
Jan 27 2020,positive,i think this is a good conclusion for the series the loose ends were tied up the hope is there for the future the main characters were able to succeed despite their flaws it was not perfect but it was satisfying
Jan 27 2020,positive,good story great closure for this saga
Jan 27 2020,negative,unbelievable crud  thank god its over
Jan 27 2020,positive,many opportunities were just not explored in this movie
Jan 27 2020,positive,it was the best ever i cant even describe how beautiful it was
Jan 27 2020,negative,its not the worst star wars movie but it was the worst film i saw of 2019 just because jjs parents made movies doesnt mean he should
Jan 27 2020,neutral,see it because its star wars and its not the worst possible night you can have at the movies but this is derivative and a little goofy at times  is it the worst star wars ever is ok sure but greatthats in a galaxy a long time ago and far far away
Jan 27 2020,positive,i enjoyed the movie in that it answered some questions i had
Jan 27 2020,positive,fantastic i have only watched a handful for this franchise and my kids wanted to go even though they have never seen one and we all loved it
Jan 27 2020,positive,a great conclusion to a 9 movie series
Jan 27 2020,positive,i felt it had a good plot continuity and kept you engaged it was trie star wars
Jan 27 2020,negative,story did not make sense based on past movies and it was so boring
Jan 27 2020,positive,was at first sceptical because it was the end it did not let me down a complete joy from begging to end if you cry easily beware
Jan 27 2020,positive,overall a good story and great way to end the saga plenty of action and great effects would see it again
Jan 27 2020,positive,lots of star wars easter eggs
Jan 27 2020,neutral,although not a perfect movie and the trilogy as a whole was left in a steaming pile of shit this movie deserves respect on its own merits as abrams tried to show the fans they still care whether its to late or not this film is a mediocre end to a rather troubled trilogy
Jan 27 2020,positive,absolutely loved it
Jan 27 2020,positive,clearly unfinished hops around more than a rabbit in springtime meh  that being said theres a great underlying story too bad the producers didnt let it come out  save yourself a drive and wait for the directors cut
Jan 27 2020,positive,67510 jj abrams determination to rely on the original trilogy as inspiration and direction for his own work is disappointingly apparent finishing out the series following an incredible middle installment with a comparatively shallow hohum finale you know how it goes  the galaxy is brought to life by glorious special effects pulsepounding action a great score and awesome performances from the cast but alas abrams cant rise to the artistic challenge issued by episode viii director rian johnson to finish the series with daring instead he seeks to placate the rabid devotees of the franchise who cant handle any deviation from their own expectations and casual film goers who may have no expectations at all by bringing back previously dead and everpopular arch villains and undoing some of the twists that made xiii so great it feels like a movie that was focused grouped into mild tepidity offering little more than fan service and nostalgia in an attempt to hurt no ones feelings while getting as many butts in the seats as possible there are some wonderful character moments particularly between the po and finn who have found a wavelength that makes there friendship feel like brotherhood and between rey and kylo who build on their connection from the previous film that ends their characters arcs in a predictable but still pretty satisfying fashion excepting a final forced moment between the two that made me throw my hands in disgust this probably wont be the final star wars film or trilogy 15 years from now some young film student who saw these movies in theaters will be the next talent to reintroduce us to a galaxy far far away i hope she or he chooses to follow after johnsons example rather than abrams
Jan 27 2020,positive,loved the whole thing
Jan 27 2020,positive,i have been a fan my whole life love all the movies and thought it was a great and touching ending to the 9 film saga but i didnt like how they brought palpatine back the last one should revealed him in the force awakens
Jan 27 2020,positive,i wish jj did the whole trilogy he worked wonders for star treks recent trilogy but only came up short here due to tlj before it also ben didnt have to die that was a huge unnecessary story error shouldve also been two parts episode ix part i and part ii giving the saga the ending that it deserved but whats here isnt terrible so
Jan 27 2020,positive,it maintained the flavor and heart of the star wars movies paying homage to the early films
Jan 27 2020,positive,the movie was a bit long but definitely worth watching in the theater complex story line and a surprise ending well worth the ticket 
Jan 27 2020,positive,great special effects about 90minutes of the 25 hours was fun i am not a star wars fan and i liked it my husband who is a fan said it was good not great
Jan 27 2020,negative,awful moviedisney and abrahams should stop making star wars movies since when did jedi become all powerful this movie was more about cameos and cash mostly cash 11 bucks ill never get back you would be better off waiting for this to come to tv and then still dont watch it 
Jan 27 2020,positive,it was a great ending to a long saga i have been a fan since it conception
Jan 27 2020,positive,my favorite of the sequel trilogy
Jan 27 2020,positive,great movie action sequences are amazing characters become more rounded
Jan 27 2020,negative,overrated 2 plus hours i wont get back suggestion wait until its on free tv
Jan 27 2020,positive,so so so much better than the last jedi this movie understood the force better and understood star wars better actual fan service that was very enjoyable its amazing what happens when you make movies for the fans instead of your own self interests
Jan 27 2020,positive,i expected a little more story wise however it did bring all of the open questions to a close however the new trio storyline was not as strong as lukeleia and han
Jan 27 2020,positive,it is very much like all the rest but if you are a star wars fan then you are a star wars fan and need to see it
Jan 27 2020,positive,this movie did not disappoint
Jan 26 2020,positive,the beginning was very rapid in the story sequence the platforms of the other star wars were more slowed to give the audience the emotion and felt sort of robbed of it the timeline was great and well told to complete the saga this way was great i do miss the lucas touch to the series though overall it was great
Jan 26 2020,negative,ripped off  doctor who with the ending 1st half of movie is just an clumsy stumble through star wars locales bad work editing in carrie fisher was morbid and nonsensical
Jan 26 2020,negative,you can only enjoy this movie as my daughter did if you know or care nothing about star wars and the mythos it represents where last jedi tried to be iconoclastic basically saying jedi and sith all failures and outdated concepts the world is gray and it needs new heroes rise of skywalker tried to be an anime cartoon the story was nonsensical almost as if these sweeping visuals were filmed then someone saidokay great now think of the way to script this in and in the most egregious violations of story writing adding in characters or new hitherto unknown plot devices just to justify a cool scene so you introduce a new female character just to have horses in space  and you introduce a new force power to make the final scenes you shot have some sort of cohesion  if this movie wee not star wars if it was a midbudget scifi channel offering it would have been cancelled before it aired one star for wow that was like a way cool visual and one half star for not killing chewbacca
Jan 26 2020,positive,for a conclusion of a 9 film saga i was not satisfied  for a closing to the sequel trilogy i was not satisfied for an action film by itself its ok but not good  it lacked character moments but had a lot of spectacle this was that biproduct of a studio making a trilogy wout a roadmap
Jan 26 2020,positive,not bad not bad at all
Jan 26 2020,positive,great movie kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time
Jan 26 2020,negative,simply exemplary of the kind of frenetic pacing weak plot nonexistent character development and overreliance on nostalgia that is the hallmark of both jj abrams and the disney star wars films in general  it made no sense in the star wars universe nor would it have as a stand alone film  i found it jarring irritating insulting and genuinely difficult to watch   if you care little to nothing about good writing clever and well developed plots original concepts or the classic star wars saga in general and just like fast paced video game style plot jumps and fetchem quests then this film might entertain you  personally i found it exemplary of the entire disney sw sequel trilogy pathetically conceptualized very poorly executed and an insult to the star wars legacy and all the writers and craftspeople who helped create it and to fans of both the star wars saga and good movies in general  furthermore this film is so objectively and demonstrably poor that any critic giving it an overall positive review will have unquestionably lost any credibility or respect in my view  if you ever meet someone who claims to be a professional film critic and they tell you that this was a good movie  you can go ahead and laugh directly in their face i certainly will
Jan 26 2020,positive,after the previous film to critics delight trampled on major characters tossed a raft of foreshadowed events out the window and generally played like that guy in a shared storys attempt to ruin it for everyone this film manages to get the main story wrapped up with some fun and excitement along the way
Jan 26 2020,positive,great end to the saga a couple of times things worked out way to fast or too conveniently but still an amazing movie
Jan 26 2020,positive,i liked the surprise ending
Jan 26 2020,positive,great ending to a wonderful saga  dont listen to the critics  see it anyway
Jan 26 2020,positive,im a huge star wars fan and rise of skywalker didnt disappoint after the dud of the last jedi overall this installment of the saga is an action packed fun movie that ties up a lot of loose ends also my favorite era of star wars is the clone wars and in one scene in particular pays homage to the jedi of yesteryear when rey hears the voices of anakin skywalker mace windu yoda obi wan kenobi and more easily my favorite scene in the film the only thing that would really make this movie for me would be the return of anakin skywalker the true chosen one even if he was a force ghost anakin shouldve had a hand in the final destruction of palpatine after all george lucas has even said star wars is the story of anakin not even luke and to not include him in any way  in the final chapter of the skywalker saga is a totally wrong and a huge missed opportunity but it didnt ruin it for me in conclusion i highly suggest you see this one i actually think it is the strongest of the 3 sequel trilogy films and its packed with nostalgia for us that grew up with the franchise
Jan 26 2020,positive,a lovely tribute to a story the spans the hearts of so many generations regardless of your views on the cannon this is a wonderful film  enjoy it
Jan 26 2020,positive,thought is was a great end to the saga
Jan 26 2020,positive,eff the critics and negative fans
Jan 26 2020,positive,third time still loved it
Jan 26 2020,positive,fun and engaging but plot wise stupid but good stupid
Jan 26 2020,positive,not a huge star wars follower but my daughter wanted to see this movie i thought for the movie being 2 12 hours long it kept me interested
Jan 26 2020,negative,010 story i have seen better scripts written by 12yearolds the script is basically a bad fanfic
Jan 26 2020,positive,a poignant and powerful conclusion not flawless but strong and masterful it was what we needed it to be
Jan 26 2020,positive,not what i expected but kept my interest
Jan 26 2020,positive,much better than last jedi which a terrible disappointing film
Jan 26 2020,positive,i really enjoyed start wars and im not a start wars person
Jan 26 2020,positive,great model action packed and great storyline
Jan 26 2020,negative,too neatly wrapped up at times confusing for a movie that ran over 2 12 hours your think theres be more memorable scenes not a terrible movie but i expected more
Jan 26 2020,positive,loved it i have seen all of the star wars movies i remember seeing the first one on the big screen at a one screen theater
Jan 26 2020,positive,not perfect but pretty good  i liked how we seemed to be going full circle
Jan 26 2020,positive,as a big star wars fan i enjoyed this movie immensely the things that i look for in a great movie are all there great imagery cinematography and special effects along with an understandable story line all pitchnin to make this one of my favorite star wars movies ever i think it definitely ends the saga with a cohesiveness that will satisfy most all of us star wars fans definitely going to see it again as soon as possible
Jan 26 2020,positive,absolutely loved it
Jan 26 2020,positive,the movie was awesome  the story line sucked
Jan 26 2020,positive,it is impossible to put 5 starts as rian johnson burned the opportunity to see luke skywalker finishing the saga lando calrissian really saved the saga thanks god rian johnson did not consider him in previous movie because he would be already dead the appearance of harrison ford was unexpected and extremely nice kylo ren is the only character of this trilogy that i can like but finn rey etc are not at the level of luke and han why not all these heroes from childhood together for me han could have died but at the end of the first movie but in some point lando han leia and luke would have to be put together that was a huge mistake and killing luke in episode viii in such a stupid way because he used all his energy was ridiculous leia flying like superman was another ridicolous mistake in ep viii episode ix had nothing stupid like that jj had to keep some consistency with eiposode viii so luke had to appear only as ghost  and he had to keep this stupid connection that kylo and rey had stupid things that rian johnson created and destroyed star wars jj had to save the film with lando and with the remaining leias unused footage people criticize jj for the poor plot and lack of imagination but people forget that he had a great challenge left by the atrocity that rian johnson created and movie had to be focused to fix episode viii so it could not be much better
Jan 26 2020,positive,great movie balance in the force finally
Jan 26 2020,positive,great ending to the star wars saga or was it
Jan 26 2020,positive,i loved everything about it
Jan 26 2020,positive,jj abrams did a nice job of ending the sequel trilogy  corrected a number of plot mistakes from the last jedi  fun and action packed movie
Jan 26 2020,positive,this movie is a very tough one to review for me on the one hand im a major star wars fan and enjoy almost all the movies and content however this movie also feels like kind of a play by the book movie but done well so my final decision is that this movie is a good movie it relies on nostalgia but if youre a star wars fan this is a must see and probably my favorite of the new trilogy
Jan 26 2020,positive,similar to return of the jedi just differant actors still was a good movie
Jan 26 2020,positive,i though it was a good ending to star wars i did not see ben ending that it was good liked to of seen more of how life goes on with ray
Jan 26 2020,positive,when your lead character literally falls into a pit and accidentally discovers a key piece to their journey you know the writing is not top notch there were a lot of things in the movie that were not earned like jedis suddenly having new powers looking past that the movie did have some great fight scenes and stunning visuals
Jan 26 2020,negative,awful worst one of the lot
Jan 26 2020,neutral,too cute and childish at times franchise has lost the charm and wonder of the original trio
Jan 26 2020,positive,loved it was the best movie yet
Jan 26 2020,positive,i only went to complete the series i found the movie generally boring
Jan 26 2020,positive,it was great one of the best
Jan 26 2020,negative,the movie was okay but the end was pathetic
Jan 26 2020,positive,not the best of the franchise productions  the story line was a bit predictable and i thought fighting scenes in other sw movies were better  but it was entertaining and i found it cute that some of the older character types were featured
Jan 26 2020,positive,it was a great movie
Jan 26 2020,positive,soooo good loved it
Jan 26 2020,positive,movie was basically a love story
Jan 26 2020,positive,great movie best seen on the big screen   great seeing some of the original star wars actorsactresses too    loved it
Jan 26 2020,positive,i like this movie despite it being very nonsensical very unpopular opinion for some reason
Jan 26 2020,negative,disappointing resting reputation on the original
Jan 26 2020,positive,tied it into the rest of the series very well  rey was great  revising leias character to be more than she was at his late entry was a bit frustrating  should have tied in yoda and windubut still very good
Jan 26 2020,positive,loved it after 42 years of watching this series i was very satisfied with how it ended very fun and emotional as well
Jan 26 2020,positive,i thought it was a good end to the skywalker story
Jan 26 2020,positive,great moviesad to know it was the last of the this star wars series that i started watching in 1977  anyway hopefully any future star wars related series will invest the same effort not to cheapen the series  may the force be with you
Jan 26 2020,positive,finally an end to the sagathought it was pretty darn good  slight twist at the end  glad they paid homage to all the ships and the past characters throughout the movie
Jan 26 2020,positive,while its my least favorite of the new star wars movies i also think adding another halfhour would help it it is missing so important meat that im sure was shot which is too bad considering how good some of it is
Jan 26 2020,negative,not even poop smeared on celluloid anymore it is all digital
Jan 26 2020,negative,i thought the special effects were horribly done i live the star wars movies however this was the worst one by far
Jan 26 2020,positive,the movie felt rushedoverall great 
Jan 26 2020,positive,so glad i went to the theater to see saw the first at the drive in in the 70s
Jan 26 2020,positive,i am a star wars fan so i really enjoyed this movie as well
Jan 26 2020,positive,the acting was great  the special affects perfect  loved it
Jan 26 2020,positive,very good movie  loved the plot and how it leaves an opening for the future of the  star wars saga
Jan 26 2020,negative,this disney trilogy was a disaster the movie was a mess with little originality and im pretending it was never made
Jan 26 2020,positive,i like this one waaaayyyyyy better that the last 2 in the series the storyline made sense and you could follow it without a whole bunch of existential bs muddying the water it was still there but not as bad
Jan 26 2020,negative,this movie was a wild and fun ride however it is identical to how it starts the movie starts with poe gaining important intel and then hyperspace skipping to multiple points in the universe with the goal of reaching their destination that right there is this movie in a nutshell the characters jump from place to place without developing the story or the characters themselves the only goal is to reach the destination and end the series dont get me wrong there are some cool moments in the movie but as a whole i think the movie is horrible on its own and as the ending of the trilogy i think it ruins the overall sequel trilogy by itself   as a viewer i didnt have a chance to become invested in any of the new locations or characters introduced in this film it breezed past them too fast and for the returning characters they had so many fakeout deaths that it makes the movie kind of meaningless kills chewie but wait he was on another ship that wasnt shown and survives there were so many cool ideas like how other stormtroopers have deserted the first order like finn but they werent fleshed out either just like the characters or destinations instead the movie just keeps trudging forward with all its issues without giving a shit   the thing i hate the most is emperor palpatine he didnt need to be in the film palpatine served his reason in the original as the reason for anakin turning back to the light and fulfilling his role as the chosen one this movie essentially null and voided both the original and prequel trilogies with this one character addition and whats worse is they didnt even explain why the emperor returned they just give a vague and frankly bad opening crawl like if there was an explanation for why the emperor returned and what his plan was i think i could have been more invested   personally i think this movie is trash disney should delete what they have and try to redo the entire movie give us a satisfying and proper ending one last note for as messy as the last jedi was i can look back and appreciate the movie for what it tried to accomplish and i now believe the last jedi to be one of the greatest star wars movies of all time this movie helped me realize how amazing rian johnson and his vision for star wars were because this movie is anything but that the rise of skywalker lacks story character development and significance definitely the worse star wars movie of all time yes it is worse than the phantom menace and attack of the clones because at least they had a purpose and a vision in their trilogy
Jan 26 2020,negative,long and boring in spots some scenes left me wondering whyive seen better acting visually wonderful the writing is awful rey has one expression fins only line in every scene is rey this isnt cannon
Jan 26 2020,positive,grest acting and special visuals am amazing vibrant and touching ending  for the skywalker saga
Jan 26 2020,positive,it is a fantastic movie and will entertain for many years to come i cannot wait to watch them in a marathon it is offcourse similar to the first 3 movies but that is what makes it so much fun to watch hope you enjoy it as much as i have
Jan 26 2020,negative,not the worst of the franchise but a far departure from the original trilogy this thing was thrown together and it looks like it continuity be dammed we are already using light speed as a weapon why not bring back emperor palpatine the real palpatine and do the same thing we did in jedi but this time with a girl    is now completely screwed the pooch with this entire trilogy but the good news is theres nowhere to go but up hopefully grown ups take charge and make better decisions what a completely wasted opportunity these past three movies have been
Jan 26 2020,positive,good always prevails
Jan 26 2020,positive,finally story lines come together a great ending to the saga
Jan 26 2020,negative,special effects of boom whizz pow keep my primal and inferior instincts as a human amuzed  the intellect behind the story narrativd and what drives poorcharacter development  could have been mistakenly written by myself seeming i failed my english major   i expected a lot more cohesiveness between the movies and a longer build up to a meaningful end i should have known better  movie goes like this bad guysssss oh noo we need to stop them how we need this thing it will help but where to find it who knows where it is i do ok cool how do we get it ok we got it now we need more help but who will help we will all help yay  end
Jan 26 2020,negative,what could have been the film lacked any and all forms of character development or logical plot clarity the characters visit 47 different planet have 23 battles meet 119 new characters and out of all that nothing feels genuine or interesting everything is so rushed that nothing worthy of our emotions actually happen does anyone in this series actually die for good also what happened to rey being a nobody  is the force only passed through bloodline now it seems like unless rey has children the force will cease to exist and if she is living her life out on a derelict old moisture farm she definitely wont be having any male friends over to stay the night  the light saber duel on the wreckage of the death star was cool and at least chewy finally got his medal
Jan 26 2020,positive,they did a wonderful job of honoring the original trilogy of the saga  as one who saw the first star wars in the cinema in 1978 at the age of 8 i absolutely loved the movie  beautiful cinematography too
Jan 26 2020,positive,amazing every little thing was amazing i loved it
Jan 26 2020,positive,it wasnt bad it just wasnt good either
Jan 26 2020,neutral,it was okay but the fight scenes were decent
Jan 26 2020,neutral,wasnt as good as i thought it was going to be was expecting a better light saber ending duel
Jan 26 2020,positive,i dont get the complaints gotta be all the comic con fanatics this story was different but it was refreshing entertaining and a well done story at that
Jan 26 2020,negative,absolutely horrible one of the worst films ive seen in recent years destroyed everything that the original movies stood for its best to pretend this entire trilogy doesnt exist
Jan 26 2020,positive,the best star wars ever kylo ren and his story and ending are sad but amazing john williams did it again jj abrams did it again ignore the haters the only negative is that it ended what should never have been ended and shouldve brought us more like this
Jan 26 2020,negative,such a disappointment for me  i grew up and the 70s and have closely followed all the star wars movies  this one is just too wordy for me and i got so bored with the presentation  this show has to much potential to be amazing beyond words  the final conflict for the last movie was such a major let down  this story landed with a giant thud for me  give me jedis that come out thick as can be fighting the dark side  and after so many years show me some major technologies in aircraft abilities
Jan 26 2020,positive,best one of the three
Jan 26 2020,positive,nice conclusion to the star wars saga
Jan 26 2020,positive,of course the main atoryline went astray there were too many contemporary issues altho it did keep me on the edge of my seat 75 of the time overall in line with the last 3 of the saga it rates third
Jan 26 2020,positive,really good but reylo was ruined at last because ben died bringbensoloandreyloback
Jan 26 2020,positive,i mean come on its star wars nuff said
Jan 26 2020,positive,nice end to the whole series

Jan 26 2020,negative,this movie does not belong in the star wars universe
Jan 26 2020,positive,it was an okay movie not enough action compared to the others at least ben solo rose from the foam pit
Jan 26 2020,positive,saw this movie for the second time and it was better than the first showing although i cant wait for the jj cut 
Jan 26 2020,neutral,not what i expected
Jan 26 2020,positive,absolutely fantastic ive seen every star wars movie and spin off and they went all out for this one and although sadly it wraps things all up very nicely i was like a kid sitting there with my bucket of popcorn and half keg of soda too bad there wont be any more of these great movies
Jan 26 2020,positive,i thought the entire movie beginning to end was awesome great story line special effects and some good comedy moments
Jan 26 2020,positive,the epic space battle between the final order fleet and the galaxy was insanely cool
Jan 26 2020,negative,killed the originals
Jan 26 2020,positive,by far the best film of the series a good closure for the skywalker saga
Jan 26 2020,positive,pretty solid  lots of callbacks and reminders of what used to be  well acted  some plot points felt a little rushed but pretty good
Jan 26 2020,positive,good but not the best for 2 and half hours if did keep you interested but were times the story really slowed down to a crawl it left so much open to other movies and tv shows to follow so happy with that end was good but didnt take your breath away as always chewie was awesome
Jan 26 2020,positive,it was a great close to the story i enjoyed it not as funny as some of the original movies glad to see princess leia
Jan 26 2020,positive,not the best ending for the trilogy but acceptable
Jan 26 2020,positive,great story line and graphics
Jan 26 2020,positive,it was great a good end to the saga
Jan 26 2020,positive,great end to a saga
Jan 26 2020,positive,excellent movie i always enjoy star wars boys enjoy seeing them will be sad if they ever stop making them
Jan 26 2020,positive,i really liked it thought maybe it couldve been more open ended i felt it was a little bit rushed at the end but overall the movie delivers
Jan 26 2020,positive,bittersweet ending to the skywalker storyline im sure many will find problems with this new updated version of the tales of the jedi v sith but not this viewer may the force be with you
Jan 26 2020,positive,xbox theater is awesome  really enjoyed star wars
Jan 26 2020,positive,this movie felt like a salvage mission making up for the last one  like theyre trying to undo some of the mistakes made and i think they did pretty decent job with that being said the damage cannot be fully restored and the franchise canon has suffered for it  it was a good watch though
Jan 26 2020,neutral,story line screen writing  disliked
Jan 26 2020,positive,nothing to offer other than nostalgia
Jan 26 2020,positive,was entertaining but slow at times and was much of the same scene repeated maybe was good for fans who know all the details but for a casual watcher of the series could be better
Jan 26 2020,positive,really good action and was into the story the whole time its pretty good
Jan 26 2020,positive,we thoroughly enjoyed the movie  it was a good ending or beginning depending on how you look at it   i would love to see it again
Jan 26 2020,positive,its star wars in a galaxy far far awayhow could it not be good
Jan 26 2020,positive,good but the storyline is kinda jumbled
Jan 26 2020,positive,very good movie definitely the best out of all the new star war movies
Jan 26 2020,positive,great special effects good plot line
Jan 26 2020,negative,adam driver was excellent  everything else drivel
Jan 26 2020,positive,wtf is wrong with you people this is the greatest stat wars movie go see it
Jan 26 2020,positive,this movie was an excellent conclusion to the star wars series yet still left room for spinoffs which is excellent this visuals were spectacular and the actors did a stellar job portraying their characters
Jan 26 2020,positive,amazing this was my second time
Jan 26 2020,positive,as a star wars fan i absolutely loved the movie jj abrams did an excellent job wrapping up the skywalker saga
Jan 26 2020,negative,mehit is what it is
Jan 26 2020,positive,loved it  great ending to another great trilogy
Jan 26 2020,negative,a final conclusion to a longlasting series this felt completely rushed and horribly executed as a person who was a huge fan of the force awakens and the last jedi this film feels completely out of place character and storywise the introduction of the main plot twist alone opened a gateway to many plot holes while all development established in previous films was thrown out the door for cool action scenes the pacing of the film itself made the movie feel like it was running a marathon and i couldnt register anything until my second viewing the one positive i have for the film is the amazing soundtrack visual effects and chemistry each actor share with each other to execute their scenes together i would recommend this film to casual viewers of the series or as something to run in the background while doing something else
Jan 26 2020,negative,this movie really pandered to the fanboys without any regard to the last jedi tlj contained a lot of meaningful storylines and content that were erased from the final film in the trilogy what a letdown to end the skywalker saga this way i felt confused as to what direction they took characters and storylines the entire film the plot was rushed and resolutions were never satisfied and nothing made sense many ideas and characters were thrown in at random as well after jurassic world 2 was so terrible i was worried about colin trevorrow as a writer and applauded when he was fired after hearing his version and how he connected the last jedi to the final skywalker film i only wish i could turn back time and bring him back i dont know what they were thinking with this movie  if i wanted to experience a man with a small ego trying to disregard something artistic i could have just gone to buffalo wild wings and talked to frat boys jenny nicholson reviewed how terrible this movie is on youtube highly recommend that over wasting your money on this film
Jan 26 2020,negative,if i had to sum up my mood during this movie in one word it would be bored
Jan 26 2020,positive,hate to see the saga end all the past jedis should have appeared including ben
Jan 25 2020,positive,great end to the saga
Jan 25 2020,positive,was not as bad as i thought it would be
Jan 25 2020,positive,i went in thinking i would hate it and loved it
Jan 25 2020,positive,i liked how it tied all the other episodes together
Jan 25 2020,positive,might be one of the best
Jan 25 2020,positive,keeps a great flow going right from the start and gets even better as the movie goes in
Jan 25 2020,positive,did not feel like the epic ending to the star wars saga
Jan 25 2020,negative,on its own it was fun if not confusing the special effects are nice and lando calrissian was nice to see however palpatine came out of nowhere and abrams was too busy playing catchup in trying to undo rian johnsons mess
Jan 25 2020,positive,great movie even for our young kids connected all of the previous movies so nicely my son said he cant wait for the next episode
Jan 25 2020,positive,movie was entertaining definitely things they could have done better but overall i enjoyed the story
Jan 25 2020,neutral,it was boring to me just more of action of earlier films i almost fell asleep during the first hour
Jan 25 2020,positive,the best of the latest skywalker trilogy go
Jan 25 2020,positive,satisfying ending to this story
Jan 25 2020,neutral,an awful messy ending and payoff to the new trilogy lots of elements clearly thrown together quickly to try and piece together a cohesive story technically impressive as always however
Jan 25 2020,positive,the movie was so good 
Jan 25 2020,positive,it keeps the innate themes  and i actually liked the twist
Jan 25 2020,positive,one of those films you really need to see the precious ones to enjoy it else great special effects outstanding weekend entertainment
Jan 25 2020,positive,the rise of skywalker brings an end to the saga that fans will enjoy and be satisfied with the movie was very smooth but had a little to much disney in it
Jan 25 2020,positive,star wars the rise if skywalker was the absolute best and most fulfilling conclusion to the skywalker saga i loved it this visuals music and acting were incredible
Jan 25 2020,positive,do not miss jj abrams and cast do not disappoint  fabulous film
Jan 25 2020,positive,they did a great job wrapping everything together
Jan 25 2020,positive,absolutely perfect i dont understand all the hate at all
Jan 25 2020,positive,epic its not perfect but i cant wait to see it again i would like to see the extended version because its happen a lot lof things in short time and some characters know hardly anything about them
Jan 25 2020,positive,this movie suffers from the fact that it had to answer questions from the first movie that werent answered in the second movie its it far better than the last jedi and a nice adventure between the characters we like
Jan 25 2020,positive,solid enough i guess force shouldnt solve everything but i did like the character this movie deletes the whole point of the last jedi this has some good characters and its very fun to see an adventure between poerey and finn a lot of fake out deaths shouldnt stay
Jan 25 2020,neutral,very meh pure fan service
Jan 25 2020,positive,good ending to the skywalker story
Jan 25 2020,negative,didnt think it was possible to write a worse story plot than the last 2 but gosh darn it they did it boring illogical glad its over
Jan 25 2020,positive,as we all know when we were still kids we live science fiction movies this bring back memories
Jan 25 2020,positive,the entire movie was awesome awesome awesome all i can say is just awesome
Jan 25 2020,positive,amazing until the ending
Jan 25 2020,positive,quick cuts in the beginning made me not care towards the end
Jan 25 2020,positive,the best out of the 3 latest installments nice plot twists good action and unlike the previous movie  no annoying plot gaps
Jan 25 2020,negative,garbage dump of a movie
Jan 25 2020,positive,back to the same old though without the earnestness of the six lucas movies clunky as some of the past movies have been this one is no better especially with the rushed pacing weird vibe that everyone involve on and off and in front of the screen was just going through the motions
Jan 25 2020,neutral,it is a very messy conclusion to the franchise there is a lot to dislike in this movie  negatives  palpatine coming back just kinda happens not really explained  the story is very messy rushed and all over the place  the lightsaber fights suck  luke landorose and the knights of ren are wasted as characters  introducing too many new characters   an absolute insult to the last jedi and not a proper sequel to it  the twist sucks  there are a fair amount of good in the film though  leia is handled very well  phenomenal cgi  the real practical stuff are amazing  some nice surprises  the ending at least feels conclusive  great action near the end  richard e grant is amazing  its not great and it does make you wonder what star wars sequel trilogy couldve been but at least its over now
Jan 25 2020,positive,the critics rate this movie very bad but like a fan of star wars this one is the best of the sequel trilogy
Jan 25 2020,negative,kathleen kennedys trilogy destroyed the legacy of anakin sky walkers sacrifice darth vader remains far superior to a pathetic kylo ren new characters have no charisma total failure
Jan 25 2020,positive,was surprisingly much better than i was expecting but it didnt tap its full potential of being a really good movie
Jan 25 2020,negative,poorly written and edited retconned the previous movie worse than the phantom menace
Jan 25 2020,positive,not the best but good movie to see
Jan 25 2020,positive,on the dark side  too much mysticism cluttered cgi confusing family trees on the bright side  tons of action lots of exotic landscapes and creatures and clearly a crowd pleaser  the packed house applauded no less than 8 times
Jan 25 2020,negative,meh  not worth the ticket price
Jan 25 2020,positive,this movie to be honest could have earned a lower score but they finally gave an end to this saga and i feel for fan service this movie rocks but overall it disappointing lack of focus made it hard and its pacing so if each scene was a new planet if you are a long term star wars fan it will leave you disappointed in areas but leaping for joy they gave a respected end to the series
Jan 25 2020,positive,it was great it didnt even feel like 2 and a half hours kept me engaged  the whole time
Jan 25 2020,negative,the most overplayed and at least of risktaking movie of the star wars saga filled with the most onedimensional characters as a huge star wars fan i thoroughly hated this movie
Jan 25 2020,positive,awesome and spectacular episode in star wars saga
Jan 25 2020,positive,i think this movie was good was not the best but certainly not as bad as critics say it left me looking forward to what comes ahead in this franchise yes disney should continue making star wars movies for new generations
Jan 25 2020,neutral,i struggled to stay awake during the first hour as an original trilogy fan i liked seeing old characters reappear but the cameos seemed random ive just had a hard time connecting to the protagonists of episodes 13 and 79 theyve lacked the charisma of hamill fisher and ford it was a very good cinematically and the second half did pick up but it just lacked punch in dialogue what memorable lines from 13 79 can you quote in a hurry i remember moments like hamill tossing his light saber in 8 but not much else the ancestral characters were just cynically leveraged to get people like me into the theater but star wars now belongs to another generation and not mines anymore  i loved lucass homages to kurosawa lean fellini etc i wont go to theaters to watch going forward ill wait for streaming at home
Jan 25 2020,positive,since i had not seen the previous films it was hard to relate to the story the last star wars movie i saw was when the 1st 3 came out years ago i will try to catch up
Jan 25 2020,positive,fun and exciting conclusion to the skywalker saga not without flaws but the main story are ie rey and ren is worth every second
Jan 25 2020,negative,what a piece of shit
Jan 25 2020,positive,nice but a bit boring
Jan 25 2020,positive,i liked it   it was better than i thought it was going to be
Jan 25 2020,positive,if you believe the critics this film is worse than the phantom menace which is insane they are way overthinking it i found it fun and entertaining as hell i left my mind at home and brought my heart
Jan 25 2020,positive,fuck the critics they think this movie sucks and that the last jedi is the good one lmaooooooooooooooo
Jan 25 2020,positive,such a great way to end a series not perfect but they did a pretty great job of paying tribute to an epic story stated 4 decades ago
Jan 25 2020,positive,it was definitely not my favorite star wars movie ive ever seen but it also wasnt my least favorite either while it did a nice job tieing the three trilogies together there were several times that it left the most hardcore star wars fans confused it also seemed to be trying too hard to be deep instead of being the cheesy star wars movie it was meant to be however there were some positives the acting and directing both seemed to be pretty good also there were a few cool fight scenes
Jan 25 2020,positive,i enjoyed the movie and the connection between kylo and rey
Jan 25 2020,positive,it was a good ending to an epic story
Jan 25 2020,positive,overall its a good movie great effects but the thing i didnt like is the movie really didnt explain how palpatine is still alive
Jan 25 2020,negative,helmed by someone who doesnt understand star wars as well as he thinks does at least it tries to undo some of the damage left in the wake of the last jedi i wish we could have seen what trevorrow would have done
Jan 25 2020,positive,great visually but a rather convoluted storyline
Jan 25 2020,positive,finns character and story arc looked the most promising at the beginning of this trilogy but ended as the least satisfying although noone asked for a love interest in rose it was even worse to just ignore it in this finale and it soured his likeable persona the sith dagger and wayfinder were interesting star wars universe objects but the goonies had more believable treasure hunting skills the location of the wayfinder and the method of revealing its location was laughable
Jan 25 2020,positive,fuantastic computer simulations made it very believed and a fantastic fantasy
Jan 25 2020,positive,great finish to a great story
Jan 25 2020,positive,i think it wrapped the movies up nicely but it was underwhelming compared to previous star wars movies personally this movie had some of the most boring light saber fights its forgettable in comparison
Jan 25 2020,positive,despite the flaws its still a good way to end the saga 
Jan 25 2020,positive,the ending was horrible
Jan 25 2020,positive,held true to the star wars story
Jan 25 2020,negative,super rushed made more plot holes to cover other plot holes  that cool build up for the knights of ren in the first movie just for them to be a group of brutes that dont even do anything the final order fleet makes absolutely no sense that many ships plus all the crew where did these people come from not to mention  all the workers to build them  and if palpatine was controlling smoke how did he not know about the dyad im pretty sure he even makes it known hes the reason for their communication connection in the 2nd movie and dont get me started on the transfering objects thru the force and light speed skipping and poor rose might as well been written out rose wasnt a problem its how she written and then she has like 5secs of screen time after trying to make her out to be a major character and wth was finn going to tell rey i mean we have a good idea but we really couldnt wrap that up really no time i tried to give this movie a second shot and it was even worse the 2nd time around because you can start picking it apart more
Jan 25 2020,positive,is it perfect definitely not but overall its a really fun movie to watch
Jan 25 2020,positive,much better than expected dark edge humour nostalgia and a decent conclusion
Jan 25 2020,negative,this movie just feels like it came about because jj realised he had to finish the trilogy and thats it cram as much fanservice as you can dont bother with writing a proper plot or fleshing out characters whove been one of the only aspects to market the movie with and its good to go but eh its a mediocre end to a mediocre series
Jan 25 2020,negative,its cl ear jj abrams set out to delete rian johnsons work a nobld mission but in the process sacrificed a movie with great potential for one with a rushed plot and lazy writing and to many plot holes
Jan 25 2020,negative,well the franchise officially died for me  this triology was really bad  especially this one was rotten the plot was so random i mean seriously let us just fall down some quicksand and voila at the bottom is a cave with all the things they need   im glad this storyline is finally over may you rest in peace skywalker
Jan 25 2020,positive,this movie does not deserve a good grade but not derseve a bad drade neither he is really disapoiting because we can see that he has a big potential in it but actually a really bad exploitation of the ressources he has the music has no impact and this is a shame for a music like this the shots are not really good and there is no big wow in the movie but this is not a bad movie rey is great there is some good moments in it just this is some movie ill rewatch in ten years saying well it exists
Jan 25 2020,positive,excellent movie i could see this a few times just to catch things i am sure i missed
Jan 25 2020,positive,just get caught up in the story and feel for these characters i know i did definitely worth seeing
Jan 25 2020,positive,dont listen to the critics they are the same critics who rate last jedi higher than return of the jedi so that tells you all you need to know about how accurate they are when it comes to reviews is this film perfect no but its not bad either i enjoyed it far more than the last 2 movies that came out last jedi and solo and as a fan of star wars im happy with the way it all came together
Jan 25 2020,positive,nostalgic characters and even though the storyline was a little predictable i loved the movie
Jan 25 2020,negative,i guess it was fun but it was a bad movie and even larger disappointment for the star wars universe
Jan 25 2020,positive,alot of plot holes but over all good almost the whole movie feels to be a repair job for the dumpster fire that was rian johnsons crap movie
Jan 25 2020,positive,good movie with watching
Jan 25 2020,negative,nothing new disappointing i had high expectations and they were definitely not metcompletely dashed
Jan 25 2020,positive,cant stop  need new adventures with rey and finn
Jan 25 2020,negative,this movie is over hyped and can only be compared to the fall of rome in its final days
Jan 25 2020,positive,i loved it it has its flaws but i was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie great end to not only the sequel trilogy but the skywalker saga
Jan 25 2020,positive,i liked it it was kind of cheesy and story was all over but it was fun critics are so critical they definitely need to loosen up a bit
Jan 25 2020,negative,love the performances of the actors but otherwise terrible editing and rushed
Jan 25 2020,negative,this movie was dumb as fuck lol it deserved the 56 rotten tomatoes gave it
Jan 25 2020,positive,while not as good as the last two rise of skywalker had great moments but lack something
Jan 25 2020,positive,see it of course its the final star wars or is it  my wife stayed awake and thats saying a lot  for me its becoming too much like the comic book super hero movies  a long way away from the originals when life and the possibility of death seemed more real  nowadays anyone can be resurrected it seems
Jan 25 2020,positive,wrong leading character for the job
Jan 25 2020,positive,as a traditional star wars fan i enjoyed it like the new characters like the old characters story was rushed but felt like they tried to fix the missteps in the previous two
Jan 25 2020,positive,i came into the movie with low expectations following the last jedi and after seeing some leaks i was pleasantly surprised for the first 34ths of the movie however with a final fight that makes little sense wasted characters and an extremely disappointing end the sequels once again disappointed me i enjoyed the force awakens but with rian johnson directing a movie that made star wars fans as aggravated as the last jedi and jj abrams trying to undo the entire last movie the movie is just a mess in the later half is it bad no but it sure as hell is dissapointing
Jan 25 2020,positive,the music was familiar and great the cameo appearances by former characters helped me follow it but i couldnt really keep up symbolism here and there went right on by since i havent followed the intervening episodes
Jan 25 2020,positive,the best movie of its trilogy perhaps if all three were written together it would have not felt like a puzzle that all the pieces had to fit completely perfect  i wish the ending would have been different to end the saga id still recommend as a good movie for both non and star wars fans alike
Jan 25 2020,positive,i liked that they kept lea and honored her character in a respectful way i liked the story line it seemed the cast truly cared for one another in the movie and potentially true tears at the end scene i think it was a great way to end the show but wouldnt have let ben die disappear within seconds of becoming good all in all i thought it was great
Jan 25 2020,positive,wrapped things up quite nicely
Jan 25 2020,positive,its fine but the main conflict was cartoonish at best with the absurd scale and the revolution was good in the moment but unsatisfying and the movie was poorly paced and reys heritage was predictable after she used the force a bit but was obviously unplanned
Jan 25 2020,positive,it was totally awesome
Jan 25 2020,positive,jj did a great job cleaning up the mess that was the last jedi this one was enjoyable meaningful and iconic unlike the rest of the series
Jan 25 2020,positive,not quite as great as vii viii better than vi
Jan 25 2020,positive,awesome movie loved it cant get enough of this star wars awesomeness
Jan 25 2020,positive,we loved seeing all the characters from star wars  brought back so many memories and was a great evenings entertainment
Jan 25 2020,positive,great movie one of the best
Jan 25 2020,positive,great movie and a wonderful end to the saga
Jan 25 2020,positive,well it wasnt bad but it wasnt that great either but could had been a bit better too the story plot just didnt hav3 much connection and it was very predictable
Jan 25 2020,positive,my favorite star wars flick of all time
Jan 25 2020,negative,please just start over this whole saga
Jan 25 2020,positive,amazing stop what youre doing and go see this now you dont even need to have followed all the movies it was easy for even me to understand just go do it you wont regret it
Jan 25 2020,positive,pretty decent movie and fun to watch however it just felt like they were trying to fit two movies into 2 hours and a half obviously to try make us forget the last movie overall its a very much turn your brain off star wars movie
Jan 25 2020,neutral,after second the viewing i was less invested and began to see some of the problems and plot holes that i really cant blame jj for since he was left with a difficult task of finishing a trilogy that rian johnson screwed over however its not this that bothers me but the lack of bridging all 3 trilogies as a whole it felt more of a wrap up to the sequel trilogy rather than a saga unlike the avemgers endgame
Jan 25 2020,positive,great movie full of action and story line
Jan 25 2020,positive,this review starts off spoiler free but will warn for spoilers later okay so its not perfect but are there any perfect movies nowadays first off rian johnson and the critics of rotten tomatoes youre not sw fans secondly thank you jj you have brought closure to the mishaps of disney with a bit of happiness into the hearts of sw fans  spoiler section  so this movie had to retcon all the retconned bs that rian the troll had done in tlj so its a lot to take in but this was the first movie that was for the fans sure it lacked imagination but had a lot more than the previous two its action packed from start to finish and i only wish jj and disney had started off with this instead of ripping off a new hope with tfa  after coming out of the cinema from tlj i felt lost it didnt feel like any sw movie before all the others i had felt like becoming a jedi like my grandfather before me however this movie gave me that same feeling of wanting to be a jedi this was great  ofc there are going to be flaws but i was expecting a pile of steaming rubbish action was really good too the flaws no character development when youre trying to right the wrongs the character building that was meant to happen in the 1st two movies really takes a bit on this one because you still dont feel any connection to the new characters i mean when big spoiler  kylo died i felt nothing reylo was almost as forced as finnrose not nearly as cringe tho  knights of ren  i still have no clue what the point of them were pretty much the next bunch of captain phasmas big spoiler 2 chewies deadno hes not that was literally the suspense allowed if youre not going to make the moment count why make the moment at all  3 i never once thought rey would turn like palps saying kill me come on he should have said  i killed your mother like this blasts her with lightning she gets flash backs gets rage mode on is about to deliver the finishing blow and then let your imagination do the rest but for me luke whispers to her turn around rey looks puzzled palps looks horrified he repeats turn around rey slowly turns the camera turns with her then we see all the jedi looking to her anakin obiwan yoda mace qui gonn etc etc finally luke palps face turn from horror to sething rage his eyes glow a deep sith yellow he tossed rey aside with the force like a ragdoll at this moment kylo enters from the side and palps unleashes masses of lightning into the jedi maybe they could block it butagain for me it does nothing so palps realising theyre just ghosts turns his lightning up to the sky same as the film to take down the goodies he shouts  what can you do against my unlimited power hahaha anakin says  your fate will be the same as ours palps face of rage turns into a look of confusion his lightning stops  the camera moves down to reveal a glare of blue from a light sticking out of palps chest the camera turns and we see kylo with anakins saber in palps kylos face is not of anger but pity and sadness hes unaware of how evil the emperor was so he has no anger but did what had to be done palps falls and dies kylo stands facing the jedi his eyes and leias connect she smiles mum he says as he runs to hug her guess we have rian to thank for this ghosts can touch things nowbut i think it works here to make a touching moment tears stream down his face as they hug im sorry mum no im sorry i shouldnt have left you leia looks him in the eyes youre so much stronger than we ever were im so proud of you anakin says we all are  ben says it wasnt me it was he turns hastily looking for rey shes still unconscious he rushes to her side he feels for a pulse but says  theres nothing  he cradles her head in his lap but removes his hand to find blood turning reys head he sees a head wound from when palps had thrown her ben places his hand on her head although rey healed him he has no clue how to do the same he cries leia says you can do this but you will have to pay a price are you sure you want to ben says yes leia says  feel her life force through the force my son shes still there reach out ben says how luke says close you eyes ben he closes his eyes slowly after a bit rey opens her eyes they embrace and smile at each other kylo falls into reys arms vanishing rey looks up to see luke leia and all the jedi tears in her eyes luke says to her i knew you would not turnsmiling you are the last of us then all the jedi say may the force be with you each in turn rey says it will be as will all you ghosts vanish end scene then rest as the film but rey accepts her name to create a new legacy just an idea but hey jj gave me and the rest of us the material to be able to have our own ideas on this meaning its a good film just needed some polishing i realize this was supposed to be a review i got lost in the moment there anyways watch it if you havent done so already ps ofc there will be other flaws i feel like there are some big ones but i cant think of them now oh yh also thanks for redeeming luke jj it was a nice close but rian troll really messed up wish we could have had a luke living battle for old times sake jj did what he could last thing the han bit was nice too probably shouldnt have made his death so meaningless in the first place tho jj ah its 2am okay im signing off before i rang on anymore
Jan 25 2020,positive,it was good not great but good
Jan 25 2020,positive,finally made one for us
Jan 25 2020,positive,good action movie  but a little too long
Jan 25 2020,positive,it was good to bring closure to carrie fishers leia so sad was disappointed in the end
Jan 25 2020,positive,it was a lovely conclusion to all these years of unfolding story i loved the many subtle and notsosubtle homage references from the music to the dialogue to the cameos to the classy but tender treatment of carrie fishers role   a bit muddled at times for me okay now were searching for the what again that you need to be able to find the huh to then unlock the thingamajig in order to save the universe right but who cares it was great fun and such a great place to enjoy it
Jan 25 2020,negative,seems unfinished cobbled together and with the battle scene between protagonist antagonist visually repellant like having a strobe light flashed in your face for way too long some brutal special effects in parts by far worst of the franchise bad movie period
Jan 25 2020,negative,a bit better than last jedi but still lacking in the story department a sad way to end and bury the lucas saga
Jan 25 2020,positive,i liked it not perfect but enjoyed it nonetheless
Jan 24 2020,positive,it was good i liked it the ending was really bad for the last star wars movie
Jan 24 2020,positive,amazing movie wraps up all the films beautifully actually gives the fans what theyve always wanted critics are wrong dont let them trick you this movie is great
Jan 24 2020,positive,i loved my experience of watching episode 9 in the theater my current total is 3 showings the movie has a ton of beautiful action and characters weve grown to know get to interact with one another in new ways the future of star wars looks promising kudos to jj and team for their inspired results
Jan 24 2020,positive,although it had the classic ending it was a very well written movie and a very excellent screenplay
Jan 24 2020,positive,i love all star war movies i enjoyed this one too but it did have a couple places where it dragged on in fact my friend next to me went to sleep while watching this one
Jan 24 2020,positive,best star wars movie since episode iv
Jan 24 2020,positive,really enjoyed this movie despite what critics are saying
Jan 24 2020,positive,fitting end to a big part of cinematic americana  thoroughly enjoyed it  also glad to see that emperor palpatine finally got his just deserts
Jan 24 2020,positive,an impossible task to wrap up this story  i think they all did a fantastic job trying to tie off lose ends keep it interesting and surprising all while telling an individual story
Jan 24 2020,positive,enjoyed it wasnt earth shattering but thought it brought closure to things that were needed
Jan 24 2020,positive,great finally for the series
Jan 24 2020,positive,about the usual star wars fare
Jan 24 2020,positive,it all came full circle it was a fabulous way to end this story arc
Jan 24 2020,positive,it was good but left too many plot holes nonetheless im glad i saw it
Jan 24 2020,positive,entertaining well presented good performances overall good movie
Jan 24 2020,positive,it was a little less ominous but was still great
Jan 24 2020,positive,its does seem a little rushed but i truly loved and enjoyed it
Jan 24 2020,positive,as for tying off nine movies full of disparate threads and diverging tangents catering to new fans and old increasing inclusivity without succumbing to tokenism or browbeating and offering modern visual spectacle while retaining the old aesthetic jj stuck the landing  i laughed i misted up i sat on the edge of my seat and i ultimately left satisfied this was the best of the new trilogy
Jan 24 2020,positive,movie had my blood pumping i laughed i was scared and i almost cried no tears came out haha great movie
Jan 24 2020,positive,great finish to a beloved franchise keeping track of multiple storylines were a bit much
Jan 24 2020,positive,same old fight scenes heroine has no self confidence over and over again
Jan 24 2020,positive,the movie was so exciting y funny also it have a good ending to all the star wars saga
Jan 24 2020,negative,retread a lot of old ground didnt do anything particularly interesting set up more questions than it even tried to answer it felt tired realizing that your favorite film series of all time can go out with a complete whimper was a humbling existential experience
Jan 24 2020,positive,i loved that all the characters appeared in this movie
Jan 24 2020,positive,as a star wars fan it was awesome to see the future of the next generation 
Jan 24 2020,positive,my husband and i loved it  special effects were awesome and so was the story line with a great ending
Jan 24 2020,positive,lots of action and special effects
Jan 24 2020,negative,dont bother with it hopefully in a decade or so they will just make a redo sequel series a everyone can forget about the disaster that became of this attempt
Jan 24 2020,negative,05 stars for rushing the movie and compressing different scenes too close together and for having forced and unnecessary scenes such as kylo ren smashing one of his generals into the ceiling  that was unexpected and senseless 05 for no character development except for reys heritage but thats very little 05 for not going back to coruscant and not having coming a full circle jedi tower  temple etc and only showing lukeleia as force ghosts at the end as opposed to a lot more force ghosts 05 for allowing an abomination to live on and take the name of skywalker over ben solo a true soloskywalker 05 for wrongfully naming the movie rise of skywalker as opposed to rise of palpatine 1 star for not following treverows script which seems to be far superior to the release of this one
Jan 24 2020,negative,this trilogy is no longer canon to me anymore i prefer the star wars legendseu to be canon disney and kennedy have no clue what the franchise is all about good luck ruining indiana jones
Jan 24 2020,positive,disney could have done better i am a fan so you got my money
Jan 24 2020,positive,it kept you on the edge of your seat there were twist and turns throughout the movie that kept you guessing and on the edge the whole movie  loved the ending
Jan 24 2020,positive,it was awesome that ben solo came back to the light side and at the end where the resistance rose
Jan 24 2020,positive,great end to the best trilogy
Jan 24 2020,positive,one of the best stars wars movies yet
Jan 24 2020,positive,it was fine felt like there were a lot of holes left not something ill go see again
Jan 24 2020,negative,this movie is crap is the perfect finale for a crap trilogy thanks disney for ruining a great story
Jan 24 2020,positive,loved it a great ending to the movies
Jan 24 2020,negative,overall its the worst star wars film because it gets the very basic parts of the story wrong such as pacing continuity engagement and overall logic the movie may look great in the trailers and if you just watch it without thinking about it you might enjoy but as film it fails bring all its elements together in a satisfying way
Jan 24 2020,negative,the critics got it right on this one all of the ridiculous and horrible rumors were true what a dumpster fire of a movie the rise of sywalker is perfect for an uninspiring disney sequel trilogy as a huge star wars fan i find it a shame this movie is the end cap to what is considered by disney the skywalker saga which spans more than 40 years there is no cohesive story to this movie or the entire sequel trilogy disneydisney lucasfilm had a chance to course correct the poor decisions made in the last jedi that really hurt the franchise but instead they chose to go full throttle this movie as the other sequel trilogy movies before it is not ground breaking and goes out of its way to destroy yet even more star wars lore created by george lucas destroying what star wars fans had enjoyed for decades the original star wars was actually a cultural phenomenon and became a true classic disney is trying to change star wars for some reason into something it is not what fan service is offered in the rise of skywalker pulling characters out from the original films 19771983 especially the main villain from return of the jedi has not saved this mess of a movie and it will be forgotten what a soulless cash grab by disney
Jan 24 2020,positive,maybe not the ending that some of us were hoping for but still a good movie
Jan 24 2020,positive,entertaining had all the nuggets you would expect in a star wars movie
Jan 24 2020,positive,if youre a big fan of the sw franchise you like the movie
Jan 24 2020,positive,its normal film fans star wars dont know what they want disney made good movie  when the force awekens went to hire all people saidthis is a good movie when was rougeonesolo nobody said that disney destroy star wars please think about this  i think that people will like sequels trilogy
Jan 24 2020,negative,way too contrived video was not good overall a giant disappointment
Jan 24 2020,positive,was totally awesome unexpected story line but so good without giving away the end
Jan 24 2020,positive,great way to end the epic saga
Jan 24 2020,negative,star wars  the rise of skywalker attempts to use the formula that the force awakens to make a successful star wars movie it takes a star wars movie that was already successful and copies many of its scenes unfortunately a lot of the movie is also dedicated to scenes that say remember what happened in the last movie well it didnt really happen or it didnt really mean that  while note as bad as at least one or two of the prequels i feel like the end of this saga deserved better maybe the next trilogy will get it right
Jan 24 2020,neutral,the movie was fairly predictable some major plans holes
Jan 24 2020,positive,original idea with plenty of great action
Jan 24 2020,positive,i think palpatine was a necessary evil coming back to tie everything together i think rey and snoke being nobodys really does nothing for the 3 new episodes creating the 3 episodes really made the chosen one theory almost pointless anyways so bringing back palpatine added no harm in my opinion ill say it felt a little rushed i think because jj tried to repair overall storyline damage from episode 8 people were so excited from the trailer they were given time to process btw the trailer was the greatest of all time disney shouldve been more prepared before starting episode 7 and have a common goal i think the mandalorian will have a plan to show palpatines return just a guess 
Jan 24 2020,positive,i havent really cared much for the recent group of movies but this one was excellent  in fact i think its the best of all the star wars movies
Jan 24 2020,positive,great film for the family and fans tied everything up the best jj could do glad the main characters came back together again the last jedi was such a disappointment
Jan 24 2020,positive,best one out of the last three star wars movies
Jan 24 2020,positive,the movie has macguffin things when you say what the fuck did the writers do here so its no perfect but its a good movie that close 9 movies and 42 years may the force be with you
Jan 24 2020,positive,its alright it wasnt that good to be honest and thats coming from a boy who absolutely loves star wars the story is good the music is obviously excellent and the cast is excellent but unfortunately every bit of this movie didnt give me the energy i was expecting i hear everyone never liked the ending and so did i rey is not a skywalker and will never be a skywalker
Jan 24 2020,negative,disney couldnt produce a product that appeals to normal people so we got this
Jan 24 2020,negative,as the end of the saga this film and two stars is not suitable 
Jan 24 2020,positive,good movie just so long 
Jan 24 2020,negative,constant action but very little wit or soul much of story felt like checking off necessary boxes and no sense of surprise or improvisation
Jan 24 2020,positive,felt rushed but overall felt like an alright movie wouldnt call it the worst of the current trilogy but it was lacking
Jan 24 2020,positive,very satisfying ending given what a disaster ryan johnson left them to work with there were some unanswered plot holes you just had to accept but overall probably my favorite out of the new trilogy
Jan 24 2020,positive,a lot of fan service confusing story cheezy and unbelievable final act
Jan 24 2020,negative,the worst star wars film since the prequels spends a majority of its runtime undoing everything from the previous installment and the striving to be the opposite the last jedi gave us strong female protagonists deep character development and the prevailing moral that anyone could be the next luke skywalker  rise of skywalker takes those female protagonists power and credits it to the men in their lives rey is only strong because she was given palpatines strength leias power is only their to serve bens narrative rose isnt in the film the characters do not grow and our left exactly where they were at the end of the force awakens i am immediately reminded of my disappointment with the final season of game of thrones similarly it felt like they ignored everything that came before and just regurgitated a story so that it could end beyond disappointing for me the last jedi will be the last star wars film in my headcanon
Jan 24 2020,positive,i liked the story line and action plus more character development a lot of questions answered but despite protestations of this is the last there were just enough doors left ajar for yet another adventure sometime down the road i dont want the story to end but if this really is the last feature movie in the star wars line it was a good one
Jan 24 2020,positive,great movie and a fitting end to the greatest saga of all time audience score ftw
Jan 24 2020,positive,just passed the time  felt lost in story even though ive seen them all  hoping this is definitely the last star wars movie  no need for more
Jan 24 2020,positive,best of the prequels and sequel i honestly didnt want to see it after the last one but i was pleasantly surprised the exact same sentiments of my senior citizen mother
Jan 24 2020,negative,its a disappointing ending ive been nothing but upset lately just thinking about this bad unrespectful nonsense story
Jan 24 2020,negative,disjointed plot rehashed storylines from previous sagas replaces a compelling story with grandiose setpieces and action drops interesting ideas from the last jedi and replaces them with outofnowhere and alltooconvenient tropes  lightsaber fights were good
Jan 24 2020,negative,the story does not make sense this film will make you feel nothing at the end not sad not happy just nothing
Jan 24 2020,positive,greatest movie of all the times and i really enjoyed it a lot
Jan 24 2020,positive,heres to you rouge leader 
Jan 24 2020,positive,i think it was as about as good as it could be given the trainwreck that was the last jedi
Jan 24 2020,positive,great ending to a story that molded my formative years
Jan 24 2020,positive,a force to be reckoned with beautiful
Jan 24 2020,positive,i enjoyed the film it had a bit of introspection in the form of rey and her relationship with her surprise family i feel that this was more than the usual action film we are used to  i liked seeing all the old characters from the old days good film go see it not a blockbuster but hey what is
Jan 24 2020,negative,i dont care that it wasnt original just that it wasnt good it was not plausible considering the star wars precedent the previous original 6 movies set the stupid 1000x more powerful than the first order army palpatine had makes the whole movie moot why doesnt he just take over   then why is his force lightening strong enough to incapacitate 500 ships but cant take on one lightsaber and is over powered by two   this movie made me shake my head almost as much as the previous one cannon fire from a spaceship that arcs as if acted upon by gravity what in the   star wars legends will always be my star wars f these latest movies
Jan 24 2020,negative,highly incoherent dont understand the premise destroy sagas with equality
Jan 24 2020,positive,the ending was not what i expected but overall i really enjoyed it not true star wars but the best of the newer films
Jan 24 2020,negative,one star for the cgi artists one star for all the actors zero stars for story understanding of source material being timeless movie
Jan 24 2020,positive,honestly i thought it had just the right amount of nostalgia and absolutely amazing fight scenes it was funny where it needed to be and everyone characters found resolve in life i thought it was phenomenal and im a big star wars fan the rise of skywalker was beautifully made and executed also raised some questions that will hopefully be answered in a later film overall i was more than happy with this movie i cant believe people called it whack although ben solo deserved better 
Jan 24 2020,positive,this movie was awesome i loved everything about it there was humor awesome fight scenes and a little romance definitely a must see you finally find out where rey comes from ive always loved reys character in this new trilogy something about very soothing id marry her in real life if i had the chance lol anyways this movie is appropriate i think for all ages
Jan 24 2020,positive,loved it characters back on point plot awesome and was so nastalgic
Jan 24 2020,positive,lots of action of course many surprises highly recommend
Jan 24 2020,positive,weak last showing of an epic saga out with a whimper sad
Jan 24 2020,positive,it was fantastic lost of nostalgia which made it a great movie
Jan 24 2020,positive,i dont understand the hostility to this movie it is such fun does an amazing job of bringing a satisfying resolution to most of the conflicts across the trilogy and has fantastic character arcs not a perfect movie but definitely one of the strongest in the sw saga
Jan 24 2020,positive,good things and bad things about it enjoyed most of it but its the only star wars movie ive ever fell asleep during
Jan 24 2020,positive,convoluted but action from beginning to end i recommend i guess
Jan 24 2020,positive,very emotional film beautifully done
Jan 24 2020,positive,the movie left some stuff that i as a fan would love to see or feel but it brings so much more than what it doesnt that i already watch 3 times in the theaters the movie brings an amazing and awesome closure to the saga no its not perfect but theres no such thing as an perfect movie special when theres so much diversity between the fans and the audience in my honest opinion forget what would you like to see because everyone wants to see something and unless the movie lasted 5 hours and had more than 50 endings its impossible to please  everybody see the movie like he is and youll realize and see how good and fantastic it is
Jan 24 2020,neutral,disjointed way to much homage to long forgotten actors and or characters from the original trilogy at the expense of neglecting currently developing characters from this trilogy
Jan 24 2020,positive,i loved it it was inspiring i preordered it during the movie and then went to see it again to write down a few quotes i liked it is strange that anyone wouldnt havw liked it
Jan 24 2020,positive,really liked it except for what happens with ben solo
Jan 24 2020,positive,i have been a huge star wars fan since the beginning yes im that old while i have loved the characters and actors in the sequels the story lines just have not moved me while this movie is a million times better than last jedi which doesnt say much it was completely underwhelming and unable to undo so much damage that has been done i actually almost fell asleep on my second viewing probably wont go see it a third i guess it is time for star wars to move on to something different
Jan 24 2020,positive,intense pacing satisfying visuals and a great cast help raise up the conclusion to the  trilogy where the story may fall a bit short
Jan 24 2020,negative,its a very entertaining movie with tons of nostalgia and great graphics unfortunately thats all there is more questions were raised and practically none were answered the plot is silly at best more main characters were added the idea of death was thrown out the window multiple times and none of the characters get their due   i love star wars and i hope disney learns their lesson from this beautiful cgi train crash which we cant look away from ps rey skywalker wtf
Jan 24 2020,positive,i loved it if you are into that type of movie dont miss it
Jan 24 2020,positive,to the people that sit and give a movie part of a series bad reviews   its fictional corny humor that made the franchise what it is today you are trying to review characters that are completely ridiculous in a time and space that does not exist there is no theme or timeline the series needs to follow every story is unique to the series because it is new i cant stand people that try to judge or rate something that was never designed to be judged or rated on any scale just go and enjoy the new characters and cheesy acting we love explosions and blaster fire as well if you try to get more out of the series than just entertainment then you are the fool
Jan 24 2020,negative,hugely disappointing while rise of skywalker has great visuals and some awesome set pieces it was let down by a terrible plot and an inconsistent scriptacting job in addition the movie suffers from jj abrams obsession with going bigger is better and needing to top the scale of the previous movies which is exactly what happened in the force awakens sloppy arrogant and confusing describes this film through and through
Jan 24 2020,negative,once again they change the cannon of the universe to suit their needs
Jan 24 2020,negative,the writing is horrible its not worth explaining all
Jan 24 2020,positive,loved it very well done
Jan 24 2020,negative,probably the worst of all nine main films the big reveals are completely unearned and in fact undo some of the emotional points of the previous films vaders sacrifice to save luke in vi reys reveal to be a nobody in viii etc too fast and disorganized to have much emotional resonance its a sad way to end the skywalker saga
Jan 24 2020,negative,exhausting to watch it retconned so many plot points from the original trilogies while the plot also made very little sense i dont consider it canon
Jan 24 2020,positive,thank you jj abrams considering the perfect alleyoop the force awakens you threw to rian who proceeded to clang the dunk off the back of the rim with the last jedi this is your greatest masterpiece of your career somehow you managed to salvage the parts of the last jedi that were worth saving while erasing the rest from star wars memory this movie was a beautiful star wars film with enough fresh and nostalgic tones to pull at the viewer emotionally obviously john williams tickles the ear drums with new and classic scores giving us a sendoff to remember for the star wars franchise this is the best most fun star wars film since return of the jedi and something must be broken with the rotten tomatoes critical consensus at a 50 splat i thought the last jedi was going to be awesome because of the rt score and i thought this one was going to suck because of the rt score opposite was true both times there is some sort of echo chamber groupthink critic snottyism going on with our movie critics today i dont get how this rt score is possible given the greatness not perfectness of this film and what it achieves given the stinker that preceded it bravo mr abrams
Jan 24 2020,positive,ok nothing special plot is running thin
Jan 24 2020,positive,loved it  hope they keep making more star wars movies
Jan 24 2020,positive,i liked the connection to previous movies but found some disconnects in the store
Jan 24 2020,positive,i really enjoyed this film it seemed like they knew the other two were mediocrebad so they made it in a way to really please the fans and i think they did a great job
Jan 24 2020,positive,i completely disliked ep 8 and felt that the trilogy was ruined beyond reviving went to see it with very low expectations  surprisingly i didnt hate it like ep 7 and especially 7 there were some inconsistencies and plain stupidity but it was a nice wrap up of the trilogy
Jan 24 2020,positive,very disjointed the cinematography saved it because the plot was all over the place
Jan 24 2020,positive,nice ending to this beloved series
Jan 24 2020,positive,loved it great movie
Jan 24 2020,positive,i enjoyed the movie yes there are story inconsistencies but its a movie its purpose is to entertain which it did
Jan 24 2020,positive,despite the criticisms i enjoyed the movie it was an interesting story about the emperor the emperors granddaughter and the unique love between ben solo and rey the one thing i was disappointed by was that they did not show an explicit romantic relationship between finn  poe dameron however i give it 5 stars i cant wait for more movies
Jan 24 2020,positive,i honestly loved it it moved me especially at several points in the last hour that i found emotionally charged with several character resolutions that made sense to me and were appropriately respectful of the overall message and themes of the entire series i was entertained and satisfied but the mass of critical griping from others is puzzling to me and not a little bit annoying it was a damned good movie and i want to feel good about loving it but all these obsessive whiners have made that nearly impossible filter them out and it becomes a much more uplifting experience
Jan 24 2020,positive,i loved it idk why critics hate it
Jan 23 2020,negative,it was inconsistent at best
Jan 23 2020,positive,personally i wish they would make more movies like rogue one im a fan of star wars but i didnt enjoy any of the movies in this trilogy
Jan 23 2020,positive,tried to keep things similar to old star wars and introduce some new freshness did a decent job of it
Jan 23 2020,positive,love love love i want to see it again
Jan 23 2020,positive,it was okay  story line could have been better
Jan 23 2020,positive,this film isnt quite as bad as i expected i really enjoyed last jedis best material even if it had flaws this film tried to accomplish a bit too much for its own good and has only a few strong scenes while nothing got as terrible as phantom menace nothing was too great either its not worth a movie ticket because everybody knows who will win between the good guys and bad guys however those who dont know star wars too well may really enjoy it
Jan 23 2020,positive,i really liked it  rey kicked butt it was typical star wars but kept the suspence
Jan 23 2020,negative,i would give it a zero rating if this app would allow me to disney has ruined this franchise the main character is not believable 
Jan 23 2020,positive,great way to end the trilogy
Jan 23 2020,positive,you do not have to try very hard at all to love it
Jan 23 2020,positive,it was star wars its been a part of my life since 1977 nuff said
Jan 23 2020,negative,what a train wreck of a trilogy its star wars not marvel theyre just shoehorning in ridiculous comedy theyre buying everything and throwing it into the same bucket up yours disney
Jan 23 2020,negative,this was the most derivative piece of crap ever put to film they stole from goonies and endgame star wars is the series everyone used to copy now theyre copying others they attempted to erase last jedi as if to please reddit when they should have continued the story this was bad fan fiction that would embarrass 50 shades of grey thankfully its the end of the skywalker saga and jj abrams wont be directing another star wars movie he left mystery boxes in a conclusion of a saga thats just a hack move fortunately there wasnt a cry for martha from the former bvs writer there were out of nowhere plot holes i am rambling but this review is more coherent than the plot of this movie see it and follow me into madness
Jan 23 2020,positive,if you didnt like the last jedi you will like this film  if you did like the last jedi you might like this film  its a lot of fan service as in it answers questions you have about certain characters peppers in some old characters and tries to make an entertaining movie for people that are fans of stat wars  is it perfectno but considering it had to 1 fix a bunch of things from the previous movie 2 had an actor die that was supposed to have a big role in this movie and 3bring a saga that has played out over the last 30 years to a satisfying close it did a really good job
Jan 23 2020,positive,it all seemed very unnecessary and could easily have been a 2 part movie and not a trilogy
Jan 23 2020,positive,it was worth seeing once  got bored in some spots of the movie  plot was meh
Jan 23 2020,negative,this is just a great disappointment to the star wars series it was barely passable to watch and i had a hard time staying interested in the plot everything moved way to fast it had a ton of plot points and there was never a break in between the plots have the time i was still thinking about the last plot point by the time the fifth one came up
Jan 23 2020,negative,pure trash its as if someone handed a 4 year old a recorder right after they saw star wars for the first time and asked them to make up a movie based on it they ran with it
Jan 23 2020,positive,good movie all things considered
Jan 23 2020,positive,absolutely stunning roller coaster of emotions and action must see
Jan 23 2020,negative,it is a complete mess that pretty much sums it up
Jan 23 2020,positive,to write direct and produce the finale to the greatest popular science fiction story ever brought to screen is no mean feat  you have to combine a plethora of disciplines and keep it all within the star wars genre  because it is its own genre  well done all  i cant imagine anyone being left wanting from this  it is a true spectacle
Jan 23 2020,neutral,this movie just throws out a lot of the star wars lore that was setup by previous movies  it jumps very quickly from one scene to the next giving very little time to think about what is actually happening or if it makes sense visually the movie is great and so is the acting but the plot makes very little sense especially if you stop to think about what just happened how does that line up with that how long ago did that occur why do they keeping doing that why not just do that instead of making it more difficult
Jan 23 2020,positive,as a longtime star wars fan i found the return of jj abrams as a blessing compared to the failure of rian johnson still as a lover of the original first trilogy i feel that the overall disney marketing is still present in the series unfortunate as star wars didnt need a new identity after its history and legacy i managed to enjoy this one even though i was negative after the disappointment of the last jedi
Jan 23 2020,positive,i loved it  i was scared happy sad and mad all in one movie i even cried at one point  loved bens transformation didnt expect the ending at all
Jan 23 2020,positive,i though that the movie was cool but there are major plot holes in it like how for some reason spoiler palpatine is alive this makes the return of the jedi pointless  which is stupid
Jan 23 2020,positive,good action sequences story tied up few lose ends from force awakens and some appreciated course correction from where the last jedi left off  a touching and fitting last scene
Jan 23 2020,negative,i think this movie is subjective and if you enjoyed it good for you but i thought this movie was the worst in the sequel trilogy and that it really brings the whole trilogy down and i knew when i was going in it would be bad but it really feels like a fanfiction where they just threw everything at you because of a lack of imagination if i had to be honest it wasnt the worst movie but its not worth your time
Jan 23 2020,negative,i have never seen a worse ending to a trilogy than this movie it feels like they tried to overthrow everything what was established in the first 2 films in this one and just make a whole new trilogy compressed into one movie needless to say it didnt work i have never in my life walked out of a cinema during a movie cause we all know who expensive that sht is but my god the first 15min of this movie almost made me its all over the place not knowing what its doing and the worst part is how they massacred the legacy of carrie fisher and the character of leia my god i have never seen something so disrespectful it would have been perfectly fine to let her character die in the last movie but nope they had to create a cgi zombie and feed it with prerecorded lines
Jan 23 2020,positive,a clear pandering to disgruntled fans of the last movie the problem is you can tell this was not the story that was originally going to be told 
Jan 23 2020,neutral,some of the nostalgia in the movie is fun and well done but the narrative and how it compares to the force awakens and the last jedi is muddled and lazy bringing back a dead character from the original trilogy was a poor plot device
Jan 23 2020,negative,they just remade the originals no new story no new ideas
Jan 23 2020,positive,despite all the people complaining about the newer characters i enjoyed it its nice to see the fresh new people i really liked the original cast but their time had come i hope disney is planning on continuing to expand the story
Jan 23 2020,positive,movie was entertaining but same old same old  hope this is the end after how many years
Jan 23 2020,neutral,much better than the last jedi if you can believe it
Jan 23 2020,negative,disney definitely buried the star wars saga
Jan 23 2020,positive,i thought this was a good conclusion a little long and some characters should have stayed dead c3po but other then that a good final conclusion to this sequel trilogy
Jan 23 2020,positive,the disney star wars movies are inferior to the og trilogy because they seem to have a hard time committing to depth in a story arc  in a given character good acting  beautiful cinematography though couldve been so much more
Jan 23 2020,negative,a absolutely shambolic filmstoryline this film trys to salvage the trilogy but the ball was dropped to many times for this movie to save the day just glad this mess is over
Jan 23 2020,positive,continuation of the star wars story and the action
Jan 23 2020,positive,i can agree that it is a fastpaced movie i do feel that the pace of the movie was a result of making up for the catastrophe left by rain johnson and the repercussions of tlj i was comfortable following the action that came scene after scene in my personal opinion this is what i have always wanted to see in a star wars movie it is called star wars for a reason a new hope was a space opera in which included action a hint of comedy awesome aesthetics and love this movie included all those elements and more the lightsaber and force fights and action were stunning and stimulating something that i personally have wanted to see since cgi has become so predominate in the movie industry i left the theater on opening night in awe and satisfied with what jj abrams did with what he was working with if you havent seen it please go see it before it leaves theaters
Jan 23 2020,positive,its the conclusion to star wars
Jan 23 2020,positive,it had to clean up a lot of issues from the last jedi but it was a very good film
Jan 23 2020,positive,though this isnt a perfect star wars film i must say it was a thoroughly enjoyable one it has all the elements needed it was fun exciting humorous and poignant in places i think there were some missed opportunities but jj gave a satisfying conclusion to the skywalker saga i could give my views on how i think it could have been better like so many so called fans tend to do or i could enjoy for what it is a good old romp which left me feeling happy enjoy
Jan 23 2020,positive,jj sticks the landing
Jan 23 2020,positive,i loved the original trilogy as a kid but am certainly not a big fan  this latest had its share of holes or problems but ultimately the movie was fun and the effects fantastic  like many people i think it would have benefited a lot from an extra few months of production however the final result were still in my opinion among the best of the star wars franchise then again i think my favorite movie in the whole franchise with solo
Jan 23 2020,positive,imagine running in the desert covered planet called passana with all of your friends from an insane empire out to kill you rise of skywalker hit theaters on december 20 2019 and it caused an uproar in the star wars community many people had many different opinions about the movie and i loved it the director j j abrams said that he wanted to finish what george lucas started with a bow on top   in the movie the beloved character rey faces the final battle against the first order while also discovering herself she goes on an adventure with poe and finn and is joined by the beloved droids bb8 and c3po all the while kylo ren the supreme leader of the first order will do everything he can to turn rey to the dark side   the movie lets you get to know all of the characters on a personal level as well as discover more about their character arcs a large turn of events happen and many twists and turns help you discover a new side to all of the characters and you also meet some new ones along the way all and all it was an amazing movie and i would rate it an 8 out of 10 just because of some small plot holes and other things like that but i highly recommend it to people who love scififantasy
Jan 23 2020,positive,thank you for finally trying to make a decent star wars movie instead of a political statement
Jan 23 2020,positive,can never go wrong with a star wars movieepic
Jan 23 2020,positive,this is by far the best star wars movie out of the new generation 79
Jan 23 2020,positive,love it some small parts didnt really fit with the overall universe but i felt it tide the universe all together
Jan 23 2020,negative,this movie had an agenda that is evident in each scene while it still serves up some star wars fun it is rushed from the first scene and wasted time introducing new characters and retconning the previous film this is a film that wanted very much to be the 2nd part of a trilogy as well as the concluding chapter this film and the sequel trilogy as a whole suffer for this fact
Jan 23 2020,positive,decent recovery from the dross of the last jedi the usual visual effects and excitement levels are strong but for me this entire new trilogy felt much like a repeat of the original hidden family connections characters redeemed from the dark side unexpected romances jedis returning from the dead to guide the living all very predictable really  what was missing for me personally and may have been left on the cutting floor was maybe some gaps which could have been filled i would have liked to have seen how palpatine survived the fall into the abyss after vader saved luke that would have been a nice touch obviously he probably survived the same way luke did by rejecting his fathers offer to join him on the dark side jumped and exited via a side tube  having said that the way they used spare footage of carrie fisher to become intertwined in this movie was beautiful and the manner of her passing was very moving brilliantly done  overall a nice enough distraction from the real world for about two hours but not a movie im in a hurry to watch repeatedly hopefully now we can enjoy the new star wars movies in the years that follow and explore other parts of a galaxy far far away  now what would be very interesting would be the star wars universe overlapping with our own star system will never happen of course but disney do like their profit margins ill take 1 disney 
Jan 23 2020,positive,fantastic movie i am a 40 year fan of this franchise i saw the first movie when i was 11 and was blown away i do not understand the critics hate filled diatribes at all it was a fantastic movie well written well acted and visually beautiful go see this movie on the big screen
Jan 23 2020,negative,the film is a colossal calamity and betrayal of the sw history not only is useless but also makes the previous film useless the return of palpatine was the most hardcore trying pseudo maneuver to try and save the franchise where in the end it just did the opposite garbage
Jan 23 2020,positive,it was the perfect way to bring the entire skywalker saga to a close anyone who complains about this movie has unresolved issues that have nothing to do with movies
Jan 23 2020,positive,rise of skywalker was a decent movie it had some cheesy parts in the beginning but i thought the second half was good enough
Jan 23 2020,positive,in brief this film was spectacular  given what the filmmakers had to salvage from the debacle that is the last jedi all that could have been done to honor that story while providing a satisfactory end of the saga was done and that more expertly than was believed possible  it gets better each time i watch it  five times so far
Jan 23 2020,positive,great special effects
Jan 23 2020,negative,illogical film  destroys episodes 16  it feels  was made by someone who has a narrow idea of what sw is    forced movie they tried to fix all the holes of episodes 7 and 8 and feels like s
Jan 23 2020,negative,a complete mess despite the efforts made by the actors and everybody else involved  in the making of the film this trilogy is basically a continuity of poor narrative with no plan a product with good vfx and visuals with the brand star wars on it for the money flow
Jan 23 2020,positive,awesome finish to the skywalker saga enjoyable on so many levels adam driver and daisy ridley give amazing performances that wrap you up in their force dyad
Jan 23 2020,negative,nothing new very formulaic
Jan 23 2020,negative,this movie is absolute bottom tier trash with its own cringe being its only redeeming quality if you can even bring yourself to laugh at it
Jan 23 2020,positive,wow this is hard  i really wanted to like this movie  its so busy from start to finish i would need to see it at least three times to get more of the details honestly  its just not worth the cost in money or time all the characters ive been invested in were gone after the last disaster of a movie theres a reason that disneys going in a different direction with their next sw movie  hope they figure out sw before they make it
Jan 23 2020,positive,it is a compact film with pace though between events there were some exaggerations related to the use of the force ie the passing of the lightsaber from rey to ben behind her back through the force in general it was a pleasing movie with great cinematographygreat shots and landscapes i enjoyed a lot the character of babu frick and c3pos humour and rey tapping to the dark side releasing lightning looking forward to rewaching the movie soon
Jan 23 2020,negative,boring plot could not stay awake while watching it
Jan 23 2020,positive,i dont know how many times can i give a 5 star rating to this movie by my accountive watched the rise of skywalker and i am more convinced that the last jedi should not even exist in the first place there should be another movie to change the 2nd story of the new trilogy to suit better with the rise of skywalkerrian might be a good director himselfbut this is a mess for the entire storyi love the force awakens and rise of skywalker but i completely loath the story of the last jedi however beautifully made it isjj please make another star wars story
Jan 23 2020,positive,absolutely amazing film a must see flick
Jan 23 2020,negative,so this was the last movie in this new star wars trilogy i think they could have done allot better than this in my opinion the worst thing in this movie is the pacing and directing the first half of the movie just flies by and nothing is explained properly at all the second half is also rushed with a ridiculous amount of plot holes that do not make sense within the lore of star wars it is incredibly obvious that this movie does not convincingly flow with the past 2 movies as the developers try to make up for mistakes in the last movie while trying to end this trilogy all at the same time on a satisfying note in turn they tried to jam all that into 1 movie and it came out looking like a rushed and inconsistent mess the plot was absolutely absurd because the main villain is emperor palpitine who has come back with no explanation at all and this was not hinted at in the previous movies begging the question did they just make this up straight after the second film released  in short they have to find 1 mcguffin that leads to the other mcguffin that will lead them to the main villain so they can defeat him with a bunch of inconsistent filler in between used to cheaply prolong the movie that is the whole plot the main characters had a very unsatisfying ending which fell very short of what we thought they were going to become in the force awakens especially finn one of the most idiotic parts in the movie was when rey had to use the dagger mcguffin 1 to find the second mcguffin in the fallen death star by lining up the pattern on the daggers handle with the exterior of the death star until both of the patterns line up like a puzzle piece and the dagger will point where they need to go the absolute idiocy in this scene was beyond insane the death star was sitting there for decades in a rocky ocean environment and rey just literally lines up the dagger in the exact right place in less than 10 seconds however the movie is full of these stupid moments this is not how you make a good movie you have to be consistent with the plot and the laws of the universe that you are actually using end character arcs in a satisfying or at least an interesting way and if the developers are not going to carry on villians and other important story mechanics in the end of this supposed trilogy then at the very least explain the new villians and story mechanics that you introduce in this movie besides the terribly inconsistent and boring plot lacking of character interest acts that destroy the canon and lore in star wars and straight up stupid scenes the movie had good visuals cool space battles and the acting was quite good i think why some people really liked this movie is because they are not star wars fans and just went to the cinema to see an action filled movie with no expectations of greatness in regards to the other star wars films or the star wars universe they dont understand how this movie destroys much of the lore in star wars
Jan 23 2020,negative,as a long time star wars fan episode ix has a total absence of story and imagination the feelings and the passion expressed in the movie are frustratingly fake this last trilogy along with solo makes me feel nostalgic of jar jar binks
Jan 23 2020,neutral,what happens when you have two different directors who have two different takes on a franchise this movie
Jan 23 2020,positive,a must see if you are a star wars fan
Jan 23 2020,negative,i felt it was quite underwhelming such a movie is supposed to be cataclysmic but instead it felt too narrow and fizzled out several great elements were retconned and many decisions sadly seemed to be pandering to toxic elements in the fandom not something we should be doing it felt very shallow and narrow in its scope the previous movies had done a great job of opening the mythos up showing how the force and rebellion spread through regular people this movie went backwards on all of that having the world dependent entirely on the bloodline of the same old people returning to the tired old chosen one cliche i also felt it was very rushed with insufficient time to develop proper story the reasons and process of characters changing views etc and no time to develop meaningful characters for those just introduced deciding new ones with barely any time to develop was better than spending some more time developing those that had just been introduced before all in all it just felt quite boring rushed and weak
Jan 23 2020,positive,great movie if you are a true star wars fan and i mean true you will appreciate every moment of this movie the drama the action the nostalgia and the love is what this franchise is about and it delivered with this final installment
Jan 23 2020,positive,great movie love star wars since i was a kid
Jan 23 2020,negative,this movie felt rushed and poorly written the plot was extremely confusing because it went about retconning the previous film without warning furthermore palpatine comes back with no explanation there is nothing new to tell in the starwars universe apparently
Jan 23 2020,positive,great way to end the star wars saga of skywalker
Jan 23 2020,positive,i enjoyed the story and the action
Jan 23 2020,positive,i loved it my third or fourth favorite star wars movie after star wars and empire it had everything i want from a star wars film
Jan 23 2020,positive,enjoyable but not up to standard of the original 3 films very predictable at times
Jan 23 2020,negative,sadly they keep ruining what used to be a good franchise
Jan 23 2020,positive,good film it told me a couple of views for me to get all the references from the past films to the present one great to see old friends from the past
Jan 23 2020,positive,best cg of the year top 3 light saber battles great ending
Jan 23 2020,positive,very fun to watchenjoyed the movie a lot
Jan 23 2020,neutral,there was fun action sequences and it was enjoyable and entertaining but i didnt like the plot or characters
Jan 23 2020,positive,it was ok and as expected john
Jan 23 2020,positive,good movie second time
Jan 23 2020,positive,my wife is a big star wars geek but i really loved it too in fact i cried a little bit
Jan 23 2020,negative,jj should be ashamed and putting this movie out as a skywalker saga
Jan 23 2020,positive,wasnt what i expected but still a good movie
Jan 23 2020,positive,should have been episode 7
Jan 23 2020,positive,fantastic end to the trilogy
Jan 23 2020,positive,the movie closed out the saga but it did leave unanswered questions still to be unknown in the end it was still a treat to see even if it wasnt so sweet
Jan 23 2020,positive,entertaining well acted beautifully shot
Jan 23 2020,positive,while there are definitely choices to the story that i did not agree with especially in the first act of the film in the end i loved it  i was engrossed connected with the characters and above all it felt like star wars to me  i was always going to love the film as i will always love all of star wars  it is hard to say goodbye especially to something we love as much as the saga is loved  but i am pleased with where it ended with friends with hope and with fond memories   the force will be with us always
Jan 23 2020,positive,pretty good but how the hell is palpatine alive and kylo ren and rey have hated each other the entire series and then they kiss alswhen rey said she was rey skywalker at the end was cheeses and wtf was finn gonna say but besides from those things i thought the movie was pretty good
Jan 23 2020,positive,great movie it brought the trilogies all together
Jan 23 2020,positive,its a movie without a purpose to anchor it so it kind of wanders and the pacing is rather frustrating but the incredible acting performances particularly from adam driver give this movie a catharsis to make it worth watching at least the first time
Jan 23 2020,negative,adam driver shines in an otherwise forgettable finale to some of my favorite films
Jan 23 2020,positive,absolutely wonderful  my whole family really enjoyed this movie  it was a great wrap up of a great trilogy and great sage
Jan 23 2020,positive,dialogue kinda annoyed me and there were some areas that were clunky but overall it was fine
Jan 23 2020,positive,i enjoyed this movie but it left a lot of unanswered questions im a star wars fan but not extreme i did see this movie 4 times in the theatre a lot because i loved the sound and special effects in the dolby theatre
Jan 23 2020,negative,i spent the entire movie being mad after the opening scene the first scene completely invalidates the last 2 movies in the postsqueal
Jan 23 2020,positive,great movie watch it like 6 times
Jan 23 2020,negative,dios mio as they say   what a mess i  still think tlj was the worst one but this film was a rushed mess clearly there was no plan to create a cohesive trilogy  what a shame and wasted potential i just stopped caring for this after tlj   im gonna completely ignore this trilogy going forwards
Jan 23 2020,positive,daisy ridley is awesome
Jan 23 2020,positive,this is an awesome movie great tie ins to all the previous films in the series a must see for any star wars fan hard core or just a viewer
Jan 23 2020,positive,i enjoyed the whole star wars 9 part series very much i know most people critique the last two really hard but i thought this one was a great ending to a great story its just good entertainment in my opinion
Jan 23 2020,positive,it seemed that towards the end they were grappling with how to end the skywalker saga it did not seem to flow organically from its 8 predecessors
Jan 23 2020,negative,it was entertaining watched it to finish off the trilogy but thats the only reason there were a lot of concepts that played well to the movie it not enough to redeem the series from episode 8
Jan 23 2020,positive,loved it though the stench of tlj is still there
Jan 23 2020,positive,the best since the original 3episodes 46 ties up a lot of loose ends
Jan 23 2020,positive,good movie throughly enjoyed it
Jan 23 2020,positive,its great because its way better than cats 2019
Jan 23 2020,negative,the rise of palpatine was a big disappointment wish i never saw it yes the last jedi killed the trilogy and i hated that but in retrospect i would also say the last jedi is the best movie in the trilogy it honestly doesnt deserve to be called a trilogy since that involves a written story and plan before you start the camera
Jan 23 2020,positive,fantastic as a star wars fan as a movie fan i absolutely loved it a great way to end a saga a hope for more to come if you read other reviews that knock it down they do so because they wanted it to be something it was never supposed to be fanboys that latch onto the voice of a few are why franchises struggle watch it and enjoy it
Jan 23 2020,positive,ive seen every star wars movie and i just got to say that tros was a perfect movie to end the saga i feel that it went full circle and what i mean by that is we got to see palpatine come back from the dead because we can all agree yes it started with anakin skywalker darth vader but we can also agree it started off with palpatine because we all see his point of view and how he became the most evil empiror and how he started everything yes possibly we dont see an explanation on how he came back from the dead but it was a great movie either way and i am happy on how it started and ended great job jj abrams
Jan 23 2020,negative,i can see the appeal of the film to fans however i felt this was a lazy ending to a potentially great trilogy it chose to retcon important parts of the last jedi instead of working with it
Jan 23 2020,positive,i loved every minute almost cried several times
Jan 23 2020,positive,i liked the whole movie i have seem then all really enjoyed it like the old cast that was in it also
Jan 23 2020,positive,brought the end to the skywalker story tied up loose ends
Jan 23 2020,negative,total garbage the whole movie is basically just an retcon of the last jedi for the worse and on its own terms its stupid and boring
Jan 23 2020,positive,includes components of the original trilogy which made this movie great
Jan 23 2020,positive,it was star wars so worth watching though was not the best of the trilogies
Jan 23 2020,positive,this movie is so true to the original that it was a pure joy to  watch please see this film because you will love it for its authenticity to the story
Jan 23 2020,positive,loved it would be 5 stars if i wasnt sad that the story is over
Jan 22 2020,positive,loved the full circle from the very first movie to the way this ended
Jan 22 2020,negative,such a horrible ending full of bad acting and a terrible script disney messed this saga up big time
Jan 22 2020,negative,wasnt not entertaining seemed cheap and simple not much effort in story telling and not enough risks in taking the franchise to a new level many of the escalations only the fighting and force abilities was way over the top and made no sense in the universe wish they would delete it and act like it didnt happen
Jan 22 2020,positive,everything i hoped for and more
Jan 22 2020,positive,it make you feel  there are two movies series that i will rewatch over and over again the first is harry potter and now the second is star wars  i was hesitant to say this until the end of the third trilogy but gladly do now
Jan 22 2020,positive,it was a good movie  especially for a conclusion people that want to hate on it on all these blogs are just looking for click bait
Jan 22 2020,positive,i found myself finally coming to care about this trio of characters that ive been told i should be caring about for the past two films the acting was solid and the action sequences were topnotch the script was a little derivative for my tastes even by star wars standards  but it is star wars after all i enjoyed it and after watching it i want to rewatch episodes vii and viii again i didnt think id be saying that
Jan 22 2020,positive,great end to star wars
Jan 22 2020,negative,not as bad as the last jedi but thats like saying a car crash isnt as bad as a plane crash you still dont want either of them are the people on here that are rating it high for real or did disney make their employees do it
Jan 22 2020,negative,a product clearly made checking surveys and trying to please the fans no plot no characters but anyway somehow its got rhythm maybe too much and great vfx
Jan 22 2020,positive,a great ending to the saga
Jan 22 2020,positive,it was the best of the new three movies  made up for most the mistakes of the first two
Jan 22 2020,positive,i loved it but was disappointed with the ending alluding to rey being the incestuous child of luke and leia
Jan 22 2020,positive,im a star wars fan till the end i dont want to give any spoilers about it just go see it
Jan 22 2020,positive,you just know that its going to be okay you just dont know how edge of the seat the whole way still amazed at how bad shots the white armored storm troopers are cant those guys hit anybody  great escapism and in the end i saw the 1st one when it first came out its a fitting conclusion
Jan 22 2020,positive,loved it me thinks we will be seeing more of some of these new characters
Jan 22 2020,positive,its a star wars movie theyre always fun to watch i do want to see a directors cut of the film disney would be very smart to give jjs initial cut of the movie to fans
Jan 22 2020,positive,from the first to the last a great story action and adventure thank you george lucas for the story and jj abrams for a great and exciting time
Jan 22 2020,positive,the special effects were vivid and a pleasure to watch  the characters were well developed the plot intricate moving and emotive  all in all a great movie
Jan 22 2020,positive,great way to end the series
Jan 22 2020,positive,for 42 years we have wondered how the story would end and the answer is with an obvious path to a completely new series all your favorites make an appearance either integral to the script or as cameos it is star wars  whats not to love and enjoy
Jan 22 2020,negative,a big dissapointment had the opportunity to connect the dots to previous unexplained prequel films while keeping an intricate story and completley dropped the ball i was very dissapointed that they didnt bother to pay homage to the skywalker legacy by explaining the master plan and how we got to this point another is for some reason spoiler rey and kylo ren create a dynamic that gives the emperor power who is snoke exactly still never was explained why was anakin concieved by the force or who did so and for what part in palpatines ultimate plan answering these questions with small aid from the books would have made for an amazing story that would have left us all satisfied this never happened although fun at times the story is a mess the characters have no genuine aid to the story or part to play the saddest part was the lack of any true link to the jedi of the past it felt rushed and it felt thrown together 
Jan 22 2020,negative,from the opening crawl onward i experienced despair and disappointment
Jan 22 2020,positive,perfect ending to a wonderful series
Jan 22 2020,positive,it tied the movies together it was cool to see young skywalker and leia
Jan 22 2020,positive,the rise of skywalker is freakin awesome i dont understand how it got 52 rotten tomatoes it was my favorite star wars movie to date as soon as it was over i wanted to see it again all the light saber battles were incredible the cast is perfect all the questions were answered and the ending was awesome everything about it this movie was right on cant wait to see it again
Jan 22 2020,negative,sad  and bad  the old characters are the only redeeming factor
Jan 22 2020,positive,it ties it all together
Jan 22 2020,positive,much better than the terrible episode 8 the last jedi but where is hayden christensen this trilogy takes a dump on the first 6 episodes and makes every story arc and achievement of our beloved characters meaningless
Jan 22 2020,positive,the best episode yet it tied in all the way to the beginning
Jan 22 2020,positive,great movie i grew up with the original movies and this brought back a lot of the old ones very impressed because i have never given a 5 to any star wars after the original movies
Jan 22 2020,positive,great way to end the skywalker legacy  great pace and actionwell done
Jan 22 2020,positive,great summary of a great series
Jan 22 2020,negative,bad story and script
Jan 22 2020,negative,i have never laughed so much at a star wars movie and i dont mean that in a good way the struggles this trilogy faced in terms of writing really showed and peaked in this movie
Jan 22 2020,negative,the worst of them all i cried and left early bc it was so bad
Jan 22 2020,positive,excellent movie full of actiondrama extremely entertaining nothing to dislike
Jan 22 2020,positive,amazing while there are a few minor things i would have liked better it wrapped the saga up with a nice bow without making it boring definitely one of the best films especially the last 20 minutes
Jan 22 2020,positive,a good finish to the saga but lacking in character development or surprises that would have elevated the material
Jan 22 2020,positive,it was awesome lucasfilm is my dream place to work at and i have to thank daisy ridley for playing rey
Jan 22 2020,positive,the movie was great there were a few times like when rey was healing the snake and ben that seemed over the top even for a fully trained jedi
Jan 22 2020,positive,i thought it a fitting end though not perfect
Jan 22 2020,positive,i was easy to follow and had closure
Jan 22 2020,negative,not in line with a star wars movie political ideas thrown in it  was not good at all
Jan 22 2020,negative,poorly acted with absurd sequences
Jan 22 2020,positive,35 stars for cinematography   it was cliche for the most part  the last 40 mins were the best  it would definitely be hard to follow if you never saw any of the previous installments
Jan 22 2020,positive,a great end to the skywalker saga
Jan 22 2020,negative,not a star wars fan only went to take my daughter  she loved it
Jan 22 2020,positive,the movie was engaging throughout no downtime or slow spot yawns some predictable moments but allinall a solid movie and a satisfying outing
Jan 22 2020,positive,it sure is a messy conclusion but its a good one as well star wars the rise of skywalker wraps up the franchise with beautiful visual effects and some really strong performers especially daisy ridley and adam driver jj abrams had a nearly insurmountable task to complete so i respect this film no matter how cluttered in exposition it is not as good as it should have been but a suitable welldone job  73100
Jan 22 2020,positive,i liked the fact that several old characters were brought back and the overwhelming odds were again overcome by the rebel forces the twists at the end were a nice touch too
Jan 22 2020,negative,absolutely nothing in this movie really connected the last two with it seemed to be a bad cloneremake of episodes 6 this entire trilogy sucked but this was the worse
Jan 22 2020,positive,this was a great continuation of the star wars story that has all the typical elements and familiar characters that you have come to know there are a few surprises so i wont be a spoiler here there is plenty of action and violence so i wouldnt recommend this episode for younger children
Jan 22 2020,positive,if you are first generation star wars fan youll appreciate all the nods to the original films  it was a fitting end to the saga with a few surprises along the way
Jan 22 2020,positive,not the best but close
Jan 22 2020,positive,i was pleased 2 c that they didnt just follow the exakt same plit line as so many of the other star wars films but there were some details in the film that lacked continuity minor as they may have been
Jan 22 2020,positive,loved the movie  was shocked about reys family affiliation but in the end she chose the right family
Jan 22 2020,negative,weak plot poor character development and haphazard cast of characters cinematography was all over the place  intense stare was way overutilized  they just had to throw in a lesbian scene no reason to  it was a mess  not the worst of the series but certainly not worthy of the last episode
Jan 22 2020,positive,the last trilogy from jj abrams starwars i feel its kinda rush enjoyable movie but its not really explain all the mess and fuzz about the character i feel like the real run time it supposed to be around 4 hours where is the rest of the scence they probably should make it as 2 seperated movie instead 1 part1 and part2 looks like jj and rian have different aproach of idea about this trilogy  i hope we are as fans can get all that it as deleted scene in dvd released
Jan 22 2020,neutral,while visually stunning this saga ending film leaves more questions than answers certain elements targeted to right some past wrongs and does so in underwhelming fashion however the franchise remains true to its galaxy far away inspiration and continues to awe its fanbase with new creatures and comedic relief
Jan 22 2020,positive,the rise of skywalker is an amazing end to the ultimate scifi saga
Jan 22 2020,positive,better than the last jedi action packed fun
Jan 22 2020,positive,cant fault the quality of the technical aspects of the movie the story line is a little too soppy felt like a soap opera at times nice to be able to run around in space with no spacesuit or oxygen i enjoyed the movie dont look at the details like reys white outfit never getting dirty until the last encounter just watch the action
Jan 22 2020,positive,i thought the chemistrydynamic of poereyfinn was better than earlier episodes  the battle scenes and fx were good maybe too much reliance on legacy characters speaking from the dead luke jedi yes han not jedi not sure why he can talk to kyloben
Jan 22 2020,positive,it was a great movie at a great theater
Jan 22 2020,positive,awesome watches three time already
Jan 22 2020,negative,what a way to end the saga
Jan 22 2020,positive,a good conclusion to the story liked it didnt love it
Jan 22 2020,positive,the movie was fabulous brought all the loose ends together cried
Jan 22 2020,negative,as i was seeing the movie there wasnt allot of time to think about all the stuff that was happening but the way the plot filled out left me very unsatisfied no anakin the fake killing offs of c3po and chewbacca and the whole ending with kylo rey and palpatine was a big letdown but when i came home and had time to think about it som more the structure of the movie didnt make any sense either things just happen so the movie can move allong not because they make any sense the dagger for one anyway a very bad ending that brings down all the movies that came before
Jan 22 2020,positive,i enjoyed the theme in which the team sticks together
Jan 22 2020,negative,this is the product of greed true star wars fans will be disappointed movie is illogical and full of plot holes subpar generic acting  this movie was made for one purpose to milk more money from a wellknown product  tldr dont waste your time
Jan 22 2020,positive,a fitting ending to a mediocre trilogy
Jan 22 2020,positive,i really liked this movie it had some funny parts and sad but kept me entertained throughout the whole film even though people knew certain things were coming in this movie watching it still surprised me and skill kept me intrigued the rise of skywalker is something that i would see again
Jan 22 2020,negative,if you made this far funeral music
Jan 22 2020,positive,while i felt it was better then the last one i felt that they were creating to many new jedi powers that i think spoils the mythos examples kylo ren being able to interact with rey through some sort of force projection ghost luke being able to interact with real world objects why wouldnt jedis be involved in all battles then just taking out opponents emperor palentine now being able to use his lightning touch to take out a whole fleet herring the voices of jedis rey never met it was a better mythos when not every jedi could do everything and they are falling into the trap many movies have where they think new characters need to be even more powerful i also thought it would have been better if lukes speech to rey had a little more of an optimistic tone i hated his character use in episode 8 it got better as it went along but didnt come across as the wise guiding voice that obi wan and yoda were for luke started more as a scolding rather then a questioning to make rey think on the plus i liked poe thought he fits the role going forward of the han solo type character that was missing in episodes 13
Jan 22 2020,positive,expected more but am satisfied i wouldve been happy with just the first trilogy special effects are fantastic
Jan 22 2020,positive,although it still had several characters with nothing to do due to a lack of will to kill off new characters earlier on in the series  for a more meaningful character arks with finn having nothing important to do with poe and double downing on its risk to kill off chewbacca however it did bring back the kick ass villain who started it all for an exiting end to the saga with great use of kyloren and rey and their forceconnection which is added on in more unique ways
Jan 22 2020,positive,plenty of action but it feels too rushed  its like one action sequence after another but not enough time invested in the dialogues and slower emotional scenes  the action sequences are not really well orchestrated as none are actually memorable
Jan 22 2020,positive,this film was epic to put it simply excellent quality and immersive acting has brought the star wars universe into ours once again the was so much excellent story covered in the film that i was surprised they were able to keep it as short as it is the general vibe of the film felt very different from any other star wars film but gave the same oh heck things are getting serious feelings as revenge of the sith my only problem was that the opening scroll glossed over some significant events that would have been good to see in the film but this was likely done to keep the runtime down and avoid too many unnecessary side plots  as a final statement this is truly a movie for the fans packed with enough fan service that anyone will be satisfied with rise of skywalker as a conclusion the creative team behind this film likely realised that as the final movie in a 9 episode saga who were the making the film for if not for the fans
Jan 22 2020,positive,worth watching a great ending to the series
Jan 22 2020,negative,great movie if episodes 1 through 6 dont exist can i get neuralyzed so i forget this movie or my money back would work 
Jan 22 2020,negative,final nail in the coffin  really ruined the luke skywalker character for me and now the rest of the franchise
Jan 22 2020,negative,plot holes every 2 seconds horses in on star destroyers that can be killed by simply tilting the ship killing major characters offscreen final order creating the most powerful military the galaxy has ever seen only to have them somehow all be killed by shooting down one ship ruining anakins legacy making his entire existence unimportant and somehow making the emperor an absolute idiot you think he would have learned not to zap people with lightsabers after windu but i guess not awful movie
Jan 22 2020,positive,very riveting very sad parts too
Jan 22 2020,negative,i am so disappointed this movie is so far from the star wars saga movies that i love too much disney in it 
Jan 22 2020,positive,i have watched star wars since the 70s the love of them continues i need to update the first 6 because i dont have a vhs player anymore
Jan 22 2020,positive,excellent end to my childhood love
Jan 22 2020,positive,first viewing i was hyped second viewing i was left wanting more thats a good a bad thing i believe they should have made this 10 movie saga cant wait to watch a third time 
Jan 22 2020,positive,a bit long but a great ending to a great series it was good to see some of the original cast brought back i will see it a again  
Jan 22 2020,positive,knights of ren was always shown but didnt really do anything
Jan 22 2020,positive,wished ben solo would have lived at the end
Jan 22 2020,neutral,fun lots of action suffers from lack of cohesive vision from the sequel trilogy
Jan 22 2020,positive,was just a good movie
Jan 22 2020,negative,this was deceptive advertising the subtitle is rise of skywalker the last star wars movie luke skywalker died or at least vanished i thought this would be about luke rising and kicking ass but he was in it for like 4 minutes and he barely does anything  it was heartbreaking to see han solo die then another blow to see luke killed off and then market this movie with a deceptive title sucks the visual effects were amazing and the music was great as usual but this was really deceptive advertising this was rise of rey or rise of kylo ren and why wasnt yoda and a force ghost of obi wan not in the last star wars movie lame
Jan 22 2020,positive,better than i expected some over acting storyline was sporadic as there was no clear vision seemed more like a made for tv movie than a big budget film could have been better ut could also have been worse a middle of the road movie would say see it to finish the trilogy else just watch a review and save the money
Jan 22 2020,positive,cool movie go to watch this movie today
Jan 22 2020,positive,after the disastrous collaboration of rian  johnson in the last jedi where characters can now fly in space and other nonsense that the critics loved for some reason the rise of skywalker give us a healthy althoug rush conclusion to this trilogy  abrahams understud that the characters and the whole myth belong to the fans and at the end he tries his very best to deliver
Jan 22 2020,positive,i liked the lightsabers
Jan 22 2020,positive,the best one yet the fight scenes were awesome
Jan 22 2020,positive,little cheese factor but great story lines
Jan 22 2020,positive,i think they did amazing job putting carrie fisher in the final film i loved how they surprised us with a few characters from the original films i think it was a wonderful resolution to the entire saga i enjoyed every minute
Jan 22 2020,neutral,honestly i dont think it was a good conclusion to the skywalker saga  the only reason im giving it 2 12 stars is because of the dedication the actors put in it  i honestly think that disney shouldve just made their own trilogy not connected to the pt or the ot in anyway  it ruined anakins arc it ruined luke   i dont feel any connection to the new characters and also its just a big load of fan service
Jan 22 2020,positive,still i dont understand why rey and kylo did that at the end of the battle minus 1 point
Jan 22 2020,positive,action throughout the 2 12 hours
Jan 22 2020,positive,kept me interested for 2 12 hours
Jan 22 2020,negative,it could have been so much more  lazy writing
Jan 22 2020,positive,good story and conclusion loved how it ended great series
Jan 22 2020,positive,absolutely loved it
Jan 22 2020,positive,good but could be great
Jan 22 2020,positive,it was an amazing movie  i like how the writers tied old movies into this one
Jan 22 2020,positive,awesome just awesome and very satisfying if so called fans balk at this then theyre not true fans go make your own version then i guarantee it wont like it and it will suck
Jan 22 2020,positive,fast paced conclusion to the saga fun ride
Jan 22 2020,positive,it was fun it was entertaining  thats all i ask for   keep the content coming
Jan 22 2020,positive,cinematography made the film feel small good story great acting from entire cast
Jan 22 2020,positive,great addition to the star wars series  enjoyed it very much
Jan 22 2020,positive,i cried it was so good 
Jan 22 2020,positive,a must see for any star wars fan wonderful way to bring characters old and new together for the grand finale
Jan 22 2020,positive,amazing movie kept me engaged the entire time
Jan 22 2020,positive,it took 3 movies to find out who she was the last fight was weak when kylo died it wasnt properly done it wasnt emotional it was like oh okay he died alright next scene
Jan 22 2020,positive,an interesting exciting funny shocking moving work of cinema maybe not an ideal ending to the saga but a damn solid one high rewatch value
Jan 22 2020,positive,this movie tied it all together episodes 7 and 8 i didnt care that much for but rise of skywalker clarified the aspects that didnt make sense and made me love rey and kylo ren
Jan 22 2020,positive,great and exciting movie  loved all of the star war movies  we now need to sit and watch all 9  from the beginning  a movie for the entire family  a movie even if you are not a star wars fan  action and suspense
Jan 22 2020,positive,if you have watched the entire star wars series than you probably already saw it for those that havent you need to so you can make sense of certain things that happen however if you just like movies with action than this is good for you too
Jan 22 2020,positive,best in the series since the first 3
Jan 22 2020,positive,so worth seeing glad it wasnt a preview movie and it was not drawn out was completely drawn into the movie the entire time
Jan 22 2020,positive,loved it great bow on top star wars geeks gotta layoff crapping all over it
Jan 22 2020,positive,it was action packed
Jan 22 2020,positive,i enjoyed the theme of accepting a name which brought honor to the bearer
Jan 22 2020,positive,action was nonstop  loved that they had many of the characters from the other star wars movies
Jan 22 2020,positive,poorly done actors were definitely not into this movie maybe too many sequels seemed like you should have stopped at the last one
Jan 22 2020,positive,great conclusion to the skywalker saga
Jan 22 2020,positive,all questions where answered
Jan 22 2020,positive,this is the first good star wars in quite a while a good one to end the saga what a great scifi franchise this has been
Jan 22 2020,positive,excellent movie  fitting end to the star wars saga
Jan 22 2020,positive,amazing everything was phenomenal
Jan 22 2020,positive,unfortunately the movie understandably had to spend a fair amount of its time fixing the damage done in the last jedi shows us glimpses of what the trilogy could have been if rian johnson hadnt been involved
Jan 22 2020,positive,a full five stars a must see for any serious star wars fan this movie nicely wraps up the 9episode series envisioned by lucas and begun with the release in 1977 of episode iv after some of the fumbles in the last 2 episodes i was a bit skeptical but this one well exceeded my expectations
Jan 22 2020,positive,great movie so fun this will be one of my all time favorite star wars movie
Jan 22 2020,positive,i loved the interaction between poe and finn  a really good bromance the scenes with leia were well done and seamless  could have done without the ewok scene not needed and the way the celebration on the ground seemed to drag a bit once the aircraft had returned and the reunions happened  all in all i loved all the action and the tieing up of all the storylines
Jan 22 2020,positive,it was a good conclusion to the star wars movies
Jan 22 2020,positive,i thought the movie was to long and in places seemed to ramble
Jan 22 2020,positive,as a fan of all the star wars movies the movie was good my issue is i felt as though i try to hard to be epic the producersdirectors shouldve just let it evolve
Jan 22 2020,positive,i loved this movie and cant understand why the reviews have been less than desirable i have seen all the a star wars movies in the skywalker series and feel this was a perfect ending and a excellent gateway into the next generation  go see it it before it is no longer in the theaters
Jan 22 2020,positive,the scene when c3po yelled they fly now
Jan 22 2020,positive,i disliked the predictable cheese disney parts this was more of a movie for 10 year olds than a movie for the whole family or adults
Jan 22 2020,positive,the movie suprised me the whole way through did not expect any of it
Jan 22 2020,positive,visuals were good acting was good storyline was just so so
Jan 22 2020,positive,better than expected but check it out yourself
Jan 22 2020,negative,i loved it fun to watch and a fitting finale to the star wars saga   predictable  sure it was  how did you think it would end  but fun to watch none the less   get past the drama of having to overanalyze  just sit back and enjoy  and try to remember it really is just a fictitious story
Jan 21 2020,positive,i feel like i was slapped in the face
Jan 21 2020,positive,good action movie seemed to hurried left many unanswered questions to many long stare downs dialog could have been better would not have minded 3hr movie
Jan 21 2020,positive,rea is such a good person and nothing sways her to the darkside
Jan 21 2020,negative,super predictable and cliche lacking deep dialogue and cinematography of original trilogy
Jan 21 2020,positive,loved it  great finish to an epic series
Jan 21 2020,positive,enjoyable movie must see if you enjoy anything star wars
Jan 21 2020,negative,by the end i couldnt remember if i was watching a disney princess movie or star wars
Jan 21 2020,positive,an epic end to a 40 year saga had a great sum up and opened the the doors to many opportunities to many more star wars moviestv show
Jan 21 2020,neutral,im someone who really liked the last jedi so to see such a jarring course correction in this movie is a bit disappointing i acknowledge that the last jedi has some flaws but i was genuinely excited to see the plot points that were explored in this movie to my chagrin they decided that the 42 fan backlash was enough to try to completely deviate from rian johnsons previous direction this movie just feels so angry at something its so reactive in its message the biggest problems of this movie are undoubtedly the pacing and the writing the movies breakneck pace makes it difficult to resonate with some of the movies more dramatic moments and the writing oh the writing yeah its pretty bad the actors and actresses do their best with what theyre given but charisma alone cant save this movie daisy ridley adam driver oscar issac and john boyega even though they treat his character like shit carry this movie   all in all i feel that by giving into the minority of fans hatred disney has shown its cowardice by giving into the backlash and not sticking to their original vision the result is a messy convoluted rushed and predictable reactionary piece that you can never really love and never really hate makes me sad
Jan 21 2020,negative,very repetitive   nonsensical story bad dialogue
Jan 21 2020,negative,it wasnt that great but also not terrible
Jan 21 2020,positive,loved the movie story line changed but if it keeps the franchise going it got my vote thoroughly enjoyed and will purchase when released on blu ray
Jan 21 2020,positive,felt like it was a movie that had to be made not one that anybody wanted to make almost as disappointing as the last episodes of game of thrones
Jan 21 2020,neutral,mehnot horrible but not great by any means this movie is trying to fix a mess and it is very clear that they had a hard time trying to keep it all cohesive from all the reshoots the first half is bad the second half is actually pretty good the acting is bad in many spots with just predictable linesediting yet there are some surprisingly wonderful moments but for every one those same scenes there is a counter moviemaking decision that just feels off this movie is all over the place but i give them credit its just a shame that these characters where not more developed and given more care i feel like i finally cared at end about rey and kilo but it doesnt matter the trilogy has ended 
Jan 21 2020,positive,great no  entertaining yes better than prequel trilogy and the turd that was the last jedi absolutely  the hate this movie has received is shocking its by no means perfect and has been accused of too much fanservice frankly thats fine with me since last jedi was a major fu to fans and changed things simply for the sake of changing things this movie is fine and now the series is over and the internet can get ready to complain about the next star wars adventure
Jan 21 2020,positive,awesome enjoyed the whole movie my son and i
Jan 21 2020,positive,rey is probably the best character weve seen yet in the star wars universe and this movie really brings her journey to the forefront
Jan 21 2020,positive,i enjoyed the story  just not as impactful as earlier parts of the saga
Jan 21 2020,positive,it was alright could of been better
Jan 21 2020,positive,not as good as expected
Jan 21 2020,positive,it looks like it should be the first movie of the new trilogy overall rating is good i liked it but not wow wtf happened here blow my mind it is just ok
Jan 21 2020,negative,it was very predictable and there is no new story it is just them doing the same thing over and over again
Jan 21 2020,positive,the movie wasnt bad and it wasnt great besides all the plot holes and having to stuff two movies into one at least we get an endingmaybe not the one some wanted but an ending to a saga we thought was done after the prequel trilogy perhaps if this movie was split into two movies then maybe we could have seen the answers that were missing all in all only worth a one time watch
Jan 21 2020,negative,total trash i was enraged throughout the film
Jan 21 2020,positive,so much fun heart racing tear jerking movie
Jan 21 2020,neutral,meh for someone who enjoyed the force awakens and loathed the last jedi i really had very low expectations for the rise of skywalker  those expectations were not subverted   the movie had to spend too much time trying to repair the damage done by the last jedi to skillfully tell a coherent story   however it is still star wars and i still have some lingering allegiance to the franchise   im relieved that we are done with the needlessly divisive final trilogy of the skywalker saga  if projects like the mandalorian are any sign of things to come then i have high hopes that star wars will have mass appeal again
Jan 21 2020,positive,it good but could of ended better
Jan 21 2020,positive,amazing slow start but the finale is worth it
Jan 21 2020,negative,the only thing i can say is that it was mildly better than the last jedi but that is not saying much  wow has disney and the new leadership at lucasfilm really screwed up star wars did not think it was possible but they actually made me hate star wars
Jan 21 2020,positive,a great movie and a fitting and emotional ending to the skywalker saga
Jan 21 2020,positive,excellent balance of action and drama characters were developed and expanded on from previous episodes storyline wrapped up beautifully
Jan 21 2020,positive,rise of the skywalker was a film that tries to wrap up the initial storyline  there are loads of easter eggs for the more than average star wars fan
Jan 21 2020,positive,pleasant surprise compared to other movies in the franchise it had substance and meaning and was a pleasure to watch one scene did not fit but everything else was good
Jan 21 2020,negative,the story was terrible
Jan 21 2020,positive,i think my expectations were high for this being the last installment i feel like the show the mandolorian is better thought out in regards to story lines it was a good movie but nowhere near what i thought itd be for the last one
Jan 21 2020,neutral,a fun experience for sure but its attempts to course correct instead of continue a story the plot is muddle and unsatisfying moving at breakneck pace that rarely allows the story beats to breathe or characters to develop naturally instead opting for an over abundance of fan service with little narrative pay off and a plot that feels more like a check list than a meaningful story
Jan 21 2020,positive,great cgi movie but zero plot like watching pacific rim 2
Jan 21 2020,positive,been a fan since the beginning  i loved it will see it again
Jan 21 2020,negative,first hour was pretty good the rest was pretty terrible plot twists that dont make sense and the ending is pretty bad as well this is the first sw movie that i wont be seeing again for me it all ended on return of the jedi
Jan 21 2020,positive,typical story seemed rushed to end the saga
Jan 21 2020,negative,really predictable rey skywalker really  i feel like they have ruined a perfect franchise ugh give up disney
Jan 21 2020,positive,its funny how different the critics see this movie from the general audience  i can tell you that the audiences rating is more on par
Jan 21 2020,negative,not to say that the effects werent beautiful but a movie shouldnt be about just aesthetics the plot was quite weak to be honest on this last trilogy and this episode was the worst of it its hard to say anything without spoilers but lets just say that they crossed a couple of lines just to get some shock value at least it felt unauthentic to me there were many more better stories to process from the comics i hope theyll experiment with the world and find its real essence again
Jan 21 2020,negative,the star wars theory subreddit come to life
Jan 21 2020,positive,the movie was good with some surprising twists but some of the scenes were just a rehash from previous movies
Jan 21 2020,positive,the best ending to the trilogy we loved it we cried we laugh it was amazing how they included princess leia and how they said goodbye to her
Jan 21 2020,positive,love the new cast of the last three movies but its the same old hackneyed formula that was slightly thrilling as a kid in the 70s but rather underwhelming as an adult in the 20s
Jan 21 2020,negative,spoilers rise of skywalker was unwatchable from the open sequence where darth sidious lifts a thousand star destroyers out of the dirt to the light speed skipping which felt rick  morty portal gun montage this movie is the final nail in disney star wars coffin fan service galore story zilch if all star wars is to you is xwings going pew pew and lightsabers going fwoom fwoom then maybe this movie is for you but if you care one iota about story and continuity stay away it looks like a star wars movie it sounds like a star wars movie but it is not a star wars movie
Jan 21 2020,positive,a fitting end to the skywalker saga dont listen to the criticsthe film is overall well done and will please most star wars fans there is a lot of fan service referencing characters and events from the classic trilogy with many surprise moments and cameos the mischaracterization of luke skywalker in the last jedi is somewhat redeemed here and leaves things open for the new expanded universe to fill in the holes the ending while not perfect fits the trilogy if you are a true star wars fan dont listen to a few critics tell you their grumpy opinions look at the audience ratings these are the people that matter enjoy it and lets all move on
Jan 21 2020,positive,excellent ending even if its not really the end
Jan 21 2020,positive,at least it wrap up some unfinished leads in previous films
Jan 21 2020,positive,all you critics are crazy this was an excellent movie rated lower than all the prequels what a joke ep 1  2 are completely unwatchable ep 3 barely so ep 9 was great expectations are way too unrealistic of course its not going to fix all the wholes and answer every question built up over the previous 8 movies what it did was fun and a very entertaining
Jan 21 2020,positive,roller coaster of emotions in a good way
Jan 21 2020,positive,great movie exciting and entertaining despite mark hamills horrible acting skills thank god hes not in the movie much he looks and sounds like a drunk homeless man when talking to rey  what are you doing sent me and my sister into hysterics and im pretty sure that was supposed to be a serious part daisy ridley is a great actress and pretty much carries the current series  ive always felt adam driver was miscast but at least hes a good actor  never liked finn but po is great overall a great action packed movie
Jan 21 2020,positive,the best so far is this series
Jan 21 2020,positive,i was expecting so much more from the story  a bit too predictable on too many occasions
Jan 21 2020,positive,the best of the final trilogy it had more of the feel of the original and brought closure in a satisfactory ending loved it
Jan 21 2020,positive,it was very good will definitely watch it again
Jan 21 2020,positive,this was a great way to end the saga its not a perfect movie but it is a lot of fun and as a lifelong star wars fan i was not disappointed
Jan 21 2020,negative,worst star wars movie yet too disjointed and jerky lack of a real plot or character development
Jan 21 2020,positive,characters felt real the battle scenes seemed much more realistic
Jan 21 2020,positive,this is one of my favorites of the full star wars series adam driver was phenomenal in this film i was not a fan of him as kylo ren before but he was the best actor in the screen in rise of skywalker i would definitely recommend
Jan 21 2020,positive,i loved the story line  i love the special effects  i love all the tie ins to previous star wars movies  i felt like this was the perfect way to end the story
Jan 21 2020,positive,the movie seemed a little rushed but all in all it was a worthy wrap up of the original story
Jan 21 2020,positive,loved the old characters very enjoyable
Jan 21 2020,positive,loved the movie didnt love the ending
Jan 21 2020,positive,what did you expect from this film as a life long fan and a reader of the books i came into this film understanding that there was no way to be satisfied i walked out feeling that i had seen an ending that i could live with and am excited to read the book in march that being said the film is solid well paced and ties up what needs to be tied up the expectation that this movie would tie up every fanboys dreams was ridiculous the expectation that this massive saga would please the casual fan was ridiculous this was a film that went face to face with nostalgia and was still standing at the end
Jan 21 2020,positive,great finish to the sky walker series
Jan 21 2020,positive,a little too disney for me too much of a happy ending is what i mean but not a bad movie overall
Jan 21 2020,negative,i didnt like the movie i was bored in the middle of the movie with those ridiculous scenes and those strange choreographies i understand that the last jedi delivered everything but they instead of just making a good script slowly they did it running  my note for this film is two stars the film is so frustrating
Jan 21 2020,positive,fun with lots of references to past movies
Jan 21 2020,positive,awesome loved the plot twists and the tie in of all the characters action thriller will this really be the last one
Jan 21 2020,positive,i loved that rey had to fight with her visions to become all jedi
Jan 21 2020,positive,great wrapup to the series
Jan 21 2020,negative,boring and predictable the writers seem to have to imagination and zero scientific vision lots of action but just lame the only thing that made it better than ep 1 was the lack of jarjar please at least try to create an actual story next time 1000 deathstars secretly created and enough of a crew for each of them where did the crews come from terrible movie
Jan 21 2020,negative,poor writing no conclusion was fan service and a lot of retcon of tlj i mean there was no where to go then rey steals the name of skywalker and shes a palpatine wow this was very dumb film palpatine died in rotj this film was awful
Jan 21 2020,positive,another excellent star wars installment
Jan 21 2020,positive,this movie was made for the oldschool fans of the original trilogy not the fans who actually like the prequels which i do not count as films let along star wars films yes these new movies were not perfect but they felt like star wars films they were enjoyable and paid homage to the films we watched a million times that our vhs tapes were worn out just watch the film and enjoy it for what it is
Jan 21 2020,negative,bad it broke all the concepts of the saga deplorable and disrespectful to the fans and the characters of the story
Jan 21 2020,positive,i think the basics of this movie are awesome it tied the knots on a lot of plot points but just felt so rushed to cram it all into one film im still a massive star wars fan and i left satisfied with the way the skywalker saga ended
Jan 21 2020,positive,too loud not enough dialogue just a lot of noise
Jan 21 2020,negative,when my 7 year old nephew tells a story he will change and adjust the plot along the way without making any sense because hes making it up and he doesent have a manuscript just like the rise of skywalker  ass licking fan service and awfull humor and forced stolen plot its disgusting i will do anything i can not to support disney with as much as a single dollar as a punishment for destroying star wars goodbye disney
Jan 21 2020,positive,not sure why everyone is hating on this movie so much  it felt more like a star wars movie than any of the other prequelssequels except maybe rogue one  fully enjoyable for anyone that grewup on the original 3 sw flicks it ties a lot of stuff up nicely  frankly i really disliked eps 1 2 3 7  8  han solo for a multitude of reasons
Jan 21 2020,positive,the movie had plenty of fight scenes but many of them were lacking in excitement it was a good movie but certainly not as exciting as previous movies
Jan 21 2020,negative,the only good thing i can say about this movie is that it was better than the last jedi i can see how they were trying to fix a lot of rubbish from the previous movie but they did it sloppy and boring the movie was rushed and the whole emperor return was stupid terribly stupid giant force lightening stopping all the ships  what was that and whats with all these jedi just dying for no reason geez if ghost luke can grab light sabers and lift xwings why doesnt he just go kill the emperor plant killing guns on star destroyers wtf thats a lot of ships and tech to pull out of one dead rulers arse i couldnt sit still through the end i had enough when rey was pretending to be dead let this trilogy be dead and forgotten just please dont let anyone that had anything to do with these 3 movies ever touch a star wars movie again
Jan 21 2020,positive,great job at ending the saga
Jan 21 2020,positive,true to the star wars series the latest star wars movie did not disappoint good plot great characters both old and new and unforeseen plot twists led to a movie that everyone can enjoy
Jan 21 2020,negative,an absurd and leaky story
Jan 21 2020,positive,the plot felt thin there were a lot of plot holes that were just filled with the force good special effects good action the big ending felt lime it should have been emotional but there was nothing there 57
Jan 21 2020,positive,the start of the story felt choppy until about the midpoint and that it overall relied too heavily upon nostalgia with former characters overall an ok movie
Jan 21 2020,positive,the movie was great it wrapped up the last 3 movies as well as brought the whole story to a close if a movie makes me cry like this one did it was worth seeing i love star wars
Jan 21 2020,negative,liked nothing about it   disliked everything about it
Jan 21 2020,positive,saw it alone today as i held off after seeing a poor response im a fan of it but its a full fan service pizza with the lot im bummed it didnt link with the rian johnson film and undidignored many threads however id rather pass my time in this universe than at work or with my family it appears too recommend
Jan 21 2020,positive,excellent close to the whole story line
Jan 21 2020,positive,connection to other sages possible but this film landing kinda hard wish lucas ex wife original editor of episode 4 had a hand in this film
Jan 21 2020,negative,duel of the fates should have been the best star wars movie but disney turns star wars to garbage
Jan 21 2020,positive,it was an amazing culmination to a great series
Jan 21 2020,negative,just like every other movie in this new trilogy everything is moved with coincidences that cause you to not care about anything anymore if everything moves in a super contrived way that has to move in a way because it is convenient for the plot i get bored there were some revelations that drastically changed the dynamic of the characters but they were not properly acknowledged and then forgotten about overall a terrible way to finish a new trilogy
Jan 21 2020,neutral,it made littletono sense it felt rushed under prepared and confused but id be lying if i said i wasnt entertained
Jan 21 2020,positive,uncharismatic actors below average plot line and intrigue the magic and the force have left star wars  this is what happens when youre only interested in the hypercommercialisation of even the most magical even mythical scifi cinematic story of all time  how sad
Jan 21 2020,positive,it tied up many questions i had
Jan 21 2020,positive,a great action story in the star wars genre purists may balk but it was a good movie to just sit and watch and be entertained isnt that what it is all about
Jan 21 2020,negative,really really bad last jedi is the cause of this movie fail
Jan 21 2020,positive,an enjoyable movie that doesnt get enough praise the goal of a movie is to make in enjoyable does it really matter how we reach that goal whether it be through fan service or plot this movie was a very good film that deserves more praise makes up for the last jedi
Jan 21 2020,positive,definitely can be at the edge of your seat shocking sympathetic experiences that only last a movie long i loved it
Jan 21 2020,negative,colin trevorrows original script for episode ix is the true one read it everything how it supposed to happen may be some little tweaks here and there only kathleen kennedy ruined skywalkers saga  im so mad and my heart is so broken that instead we got this
Jan 21 2020,positive,do not listen to the internet it was a perfectly fine movie and fits into the star wars genre could it have been more yes but  then that would make it star trek
Jan 21 2020,positive,it was a great plot
Jan 21 2020,positive,the movie was great the cinematics were great and audio was breathtaking but if you dont know anything about the episodeseries before it its hard to follow as to whats going on but overall a great movie
Jan 21 2020,positive,i saw it with my grandchildren  and we like it so much
Jan 21 2020,negative,jj did what he could to recover from rjs terrible direction but ultimately episode 9 just cant fix a broken trilogy nothing in this movie makes sense kylo turns good out of nowhere because he had a martha moment like in batman vs superman then we have emperor palpatine alive after being thrown down a shaft and the deathstar exploding with no explanations he has force lightning powerful enough to take out thousands of war ships but then is defeated by rey simple walking towards him with her lightsabers crossed like a crucifix to top it all off they have a herd of space horses lead an attack on the surface of a star destroyer that couldve just tipped to the side and shook them off and then at the end rey and kylo kiss because we had to force some kind of romance even though nothing from the first 2 sequel movies built towards it nor did the final movie itself this whole trilogy is incoherent trash
Jan 21 2020,positive,fun culmination  of all the star wars chapters i have been watching these since college over 40 years ago glad i was around long enough to see the skywalkers to the end
Jan 21 2020,negative,this is shit i like 13rd episode better then this
Jan 21 2020,negative,worst movie i have ever seen absolutely ruined star wars how in the world does the emperor survive oh wait they dont tell us frj
Jan 21 2020,positive,loved the movie it brought parts from the other movie to a full circle
Jan 21 2020,positive,loved it solid ending to the new trilogy disappointed with the fate of a certain character but overall really happy with how everything ended up i admit to crying as well this film definitely had the emotional impact of sending all the characters weve grown to love off
Jan 21 2020,negative,i was not expecting anything and still disappointed
Jan 21 2020,positive,its a beautiful love letter to all the fans
Jan 21 2020,negative,what a disappointing end to a promising trilogy too bad because i love the new characters and the talented actors that portray them and wanted a better sendoff for our heroes rey finn poe and rose as well as the villainous kylo  great star wars movies arent just an aesthetic they are a form of mythic storytelling yet jj abrams has managed to stitch together something like a flesh golem a zombie of a star wars movie that tries to win us over with cobbled together bits of nostalgia but is ultimately soulless and empty his unoriginality is stunning seemingly incapable of new ideas he hastily resurrects the emperor with almost no justification and introduces an arbitrary scale to his power remember the moon sized death star well he conjures up a fleet of mini death stars which appear infinite yet are summarily defeated when they need to be not as a payoff to a dramatic setup but because there are more of us  so much of this movie isnt working rather than build on the great character work done by rian johnson in tlj they seem intent on retconning everything from kylo repairing his helmet reversing an important character beat in tlj to reys parentage the movie is rushed relying on fetch quests and gooniesesque macguffins to propel the plot forward at a relentlessly frenetic pace as if mere acceleration was an acceptable substitute for character driven storytelling roses character is unfairly sidelined apparently the appropriate narrative partner for finn is just a female version of himself and many of the decisions make the previous movies less coherent such as the way they explain snokes origin which didnt really need an explanation in the films if you ask me  the best parts of the movie are the scenes between kylo  rey but even these lack the emotional resonance of tlj because tros never gives a scene room to breathe its too bad that they didnt have the courage to build on the great character and theme work done by johnson in tlj a more imaginative and bolder final act cold have been great a real missed opportunity
Jan 21 2020,positive,first viewing i see no issues with the movie i liked the last jedi more thats why 45 stars
Jan 21 2020,positive,an unlikely big bad is introduced followed by a highly unlikely fetch quest forcing an unlikely alliance culminating in a boss fight  the popcorn was ok
Jan 21 2020,positive,l loved it great storyline and ending if youre a star wars fan youre gonna love it 
Jan 21 2020,positive,it was entertaining and was a good ending for the srarwars series
Jan 21 2020,positive,i found it a satisfying conclusion to this trilogy and it leaves the door open to many more sequels okay it jumped around a bit but that didnt bother me and i loved the way it came full circle at the end lots of new characters and possible story arcs leia has been given her due and laid to rest and i thought they did a reasonably good job with her appearances im looking forward to the next trilogy
Jan 21 2020,positive,i for one loved this movie it made me grin like when i was 7 watching the speeder chase on endor do you need to suspend belief and be open to what the writers put before you yes but is that any different than when the weird movie the star wars debuted in 1977
Jan 21 2020,positive,terrific action very affecting and sweet in places and did a great job honoring carrie fischer   lots of fun too total satisfaction in completing all threads too will miss series but this was perfect end
Jan 21 2020,positive,i liked the blend of old story telling style mixed with the new cgi effects everyone is accustomed to now the only thing i did not like was finn never told rey what he was going to tell her not sure why the only thing i could think of was and im not surprised there is another movie coming to answer that question
Jan 21 2020,positive,a fitting end to a trilogy that started back in 1977 quite a feat to conclude a story that spans 42 years ive enjoyed the ride and look forward to what lucasfilm and disney will do with the franchise next
Jan 21 2020,positive,safe but after the disappointments from the previous films they really didnt have much room for controversy or braveness what you get is what star wars fans deserve after constantly complaining when every new film is held against the original trilogy a conclusion and nothing else i kinda love the simplicity of the story but mostly it just felt right
Jan 21 2020,positive,i think this is my favorite of the the new ones it has unexpected turns in the story and then it wraps everything up really well in the end
Jan 21 2020,positive,fast moving easy parallels to star wars 4 5 6
Jan 21 2020,negative,in an unexpected turn of events the rise of skywalker takes a shift in course from the events set in motion from its predecessor the last jedi but its new course isnt sure what its trying to do too much fan service even for this fan i wish they had tried to tell an overall story with the three new films and with ros it is apparent that the team at lucasfilm was winging it as they went along   rather than add fuel to fire the raging fanbase righteous indignation if you ask me ill just say i think the direction the franchise took with tlj was a mistake but could have been seen through to a satisfying conclusion however i think the creative team for ros didnt have any contextual ideas with where to take the story after tlj   pros pretty special effects nice soundtrack thanks john williams cool actors  cons nothing to enrich the star wars universe unearned horrible dbz esque finale with rey and palpatine pooped a hard one on the original and prequel trilogies made an enormous mess of preestablished lore not enough character development same problem as the last two films too long another fetch the item plot cmon jj you did that in the last one and no other star wars movies relied so heavily on silly macguffins
Jan 21 2020,positive,awesome movie loved every minute of it my son especially loved babu frik
Jan 21 2020,positive,it was a circle of history closing the book in the best way possible
Jan 21 2020,positive,i know that this movie was aimed at star wars fans who know all the back stories but it was like watching the movie in fast forward scenes were quickly put together then jump to the next no character building or even marveling at the scenery
Jan 21 2020,negative,i hope this is the last one
Jan 21 2020,positive,absolutely loved it answered all of my questions tied up loose ends related everything back to the original trilogy and almost made me cry
Jan 21 2020,positive,frankly i liked it it may have loopholes but overall it was a satisfying end im glad it has wrapped up so we can move on to see the other storiescharacters in the star wars world
Jan 21 2020,positive,terrific finish to a great series
Jan 21 2020,negative,the skywalkers are dead the palpatines live derp
Jan 21 2020,positive,pretty good the only issue is they just ignored the connection between finn  rose they had a quick lame mention of it like it was on the backbone they could have shown in the end them hugging or something they really missed the mark on that one the ending with ben  rey was fitting i definitely recommend if you have seen the other two in this series just as a finale
Jan 21 2020,negative,the ending was not my favorite
Jan 21 2020,positive,i loved this movie a satisfying wellcrafted finale to the skywalker saga after the stink bomb that was the last jedi this movie is a breath of fresh air bringing back palpatine was a great idea and a lot of fun some wellneeded retconning lots of fan service lots of cameos lots of tieins from previous episodes yeah its pretty great
Jan 21 2020,positive,weird plot twist at the end had me confused
Jan 21 2020,positive,entertaining good but not one of the best star wars movies 
Jan 21 2020,negative,on every level this movie failed i tried to find independently something to like  for examplewas it a good storyno  was there good new musical scoresno how about a real epic space battle  no great light sabre fighting scene again no how about a bunch of cool new weapons and ships again no just pay to win type power creep in the jedi force powers the worst by far of all nine movies
Jan 21 2020,positive,just a long cameo appearance by all the old favoriteswhy not just make a movie with the old favorites
Jan 21 2020,negative,rise of skywalker was just a rehash of the other movies it was all very predictable
Jan 21 2020,neutral,the story is almost similar to how the first jedai started
Jan 21 2020,positive,loved it but i have been a star wars fan from the beginning saw the original 17 times in the theater prices were alot cheaper thenlol
Jan 21 2020,positive,we thought it was a great movie
Jan 21 2020,positive,a nice job of wrapping up the saga masterfully done by jj abrams
Jan 21 2020,positive,great way to end the saga
Jan 21 2020,negative,after spending my entire life watching these movies it seemed anticlimatic for being the end
Jan 21 2020,positive,typical of the jj abrams vehicle weak story lots of action
Jan 21 2020,positive,definitely better than the last installment  gotta love a happy ending
Jan 21 2020,positive,absolutely loved it
Jan 21 2020,positive,if you enjoyed most of the star wars movies this is an excellent way to finish the skywalker saga
Jan 21 2020,positive,great end to the story arc
Jan 21 2020,positive,this movie answered several questions for me it was very touching at least 3 times plenty of happy moments as well i enjoyed the movie and am glad i got to see it on the big screen
Jan 21 2020,positive,epic ending  to the story
Jan 21 2020,positive,it was great seeing characters from the earlier star war films totally enjoyed the rise of sky walker from beginning to end
Jan 21 2020,positive,it was an excellent conclusion to the saga while adding interesting new pieces
Jan 21 2020,negative,3 i think we are just happy its over and we can move on to new star wars arcs  to bad they didnt use george lucass movie  help us jon favreau  dave filoni you are our only hope
Jan 21 2020,positive,i was just happy to be sitting in a theater watching a star wars movie however my wife thought it was the worst of the nine she thought it was predictable and lazy and not well acted not necessarily saying that i disagree but like i said before im easily amused and i was just happy to be in a theater watching a star wars movie
Jan 21 2020,positive,it was sad to see the original cast leave but a new generation knew they were  ready when they were called the new cast done a great job i enjoyed it
Jan 21 2020,positive,a rehash of a new hope
Jan 21 2020,positive,it was more of a traditional star wars movie nod to things of the past good fight scenes and campy parts  some parts dragged on to long but for the most part a good movie
Jan 21 2020,positive,finally a postlucas star wars movie did fell for the disneyfication of the previous episodes it is well made it is an end of an era clearly theyre closing it off i am curious what is going to happen next
Jan 21 2020,negative,oof it was so bad so generic key phrases repeated over and over again bad comedy and a mess of an edit this was an awful ending to the saga
Jan 21 2020,neutral,ghost luke was just laughable this franchise is past the tryhard stage
Jan 21 2020,negative,the worst bit of garbage i have seen in quite some time
Jan 21 2020,positive,great end to the skywalker saga lots of action and laughs super happy with the choices of abrams
Jan 21 2020,positive,great it brings together all the piecesit does it while at the same time putting together this last bit it makes it allsensationalits the icing on the cakerated aspinaltap11
Jan 21 2020,negative,star wars has been my favorite franchise since i was a little kid i have seen and owned every movie and many of the books i love everything about the lore and story but i have to say this movie was the worst piece of garbage i have seen in a reeeeally long time   the movie was all over the place nothing was actually set up in a way that made sense everything that happened was just given to you rather than it being earned by any of the characters the kylorey thing at the end was absolutely pointless the last 10 minutes of the movie was utterly incomprehensible if it were not for the great acting i would say this movie was worse than captain marvel   the only saving grace for this movie honestly were the scenes with palpatine they were cool and felt weighty like oh crap but even that wonderful bit was ruined by how quickly he was defeated he was defeated quicker than snoke and that i am all jedi line was such lame dialogue what little time it took kylo to change his motivations was laughable also rey saying what her last name was at the end made no sense  as many problems as people had with lucas directing i would much rather he had been the one to finish his story because it was so incredibly disappointing not even just from a star wars perspective but more from a writing perspective it just was not good and i hate to say it what is even more unfortunate is that many people will say it was good because we dont know what to look for in good film anymore we look for whether or not it checks boxes for explosions flashy effects and specific hollywood messaging but can no longer objectively see or say that something was not actually written well if it is a blockbuster film i defended the 1st 2 movies of this trilogy and really hoped this one would fix what those 2 lacked it didnt imho  i love star wars and i love movies usually if a movie has problems i simply watch it for pure entertainment value but in this case there was very little value in it at all i just left the theater completely and utterly disappointed and i just do not know what to do with that
Jan 21 2020,neutral,a desperate attempt that trie to do a lot and ends up doing so little
Jan 21 2020,positive,by far the best of the new trilogy the power level of rey explained klyo is a tough dude yes i like reylo  i would totally show up to the theaters for a finnpoe buddy movie of them hunting down bad guy throughout the universe
Jan 20 2020,positive,cinematography was just amazing and loved how the stories all came together incredible film
Jan 20 2020,negative,garbage total trash terribly hard to watch the forced scenes with carrie fisher cringe worthy to say the least
Jan 20 2020,positive,it was a pretty good flick and a closing of a story that was in need but the story felt empty was not the best of all the star wars movies still good to see the story come full circle to an ending
Jan 20 2020,positive,solid movie  nothing hokey like what happened in the last jedi but nothing inspiring either
Jan 20 2020,positive,loved how all the stories and characters came all together
Jan 20 2020,positive,no denying it was entertaining but not engrossing  it seemed like the writers  director were going down a checklist of star wars fave scenes because those are what long time fans love and want to see without much effort to bring something fresh to the story  like a 50th reunion tour of an old rock band that plays only their original ancient hits
Jan 20 2020,positive,great awesome finish
Jan 20 2020,positive,made me laugh and cry  good movie
Jan 20 2020,negative,i just dont understand how disney can consistently knock it out of the park with marvel but then allow star wars to play out like this
Jan 20 2020,negative,incoherent nothing makes sense
Jan 20 2020,positive,this was an exciting little romp through the star wars and a nice end to this trilogy there was some nice surprises as well and enough material to lead to other stories
Jan 20 2020,positive,its hard to wrap up a movie franchise like this which spanned so many different peoples childhoods the movie was good but i personally wish they would have done some things differently
Jan 20 2020,positive,this movie was for the fans it was the indiana jones last crusade to this trilogy it did a lot at a break neck pace but it had to  jj abrams finally showed that he could conclude a story well
Jan 20 2020,neutral,i thought the basic plot line was a rehash of old star wars and at some point got too syrupy sweet at end   it was a decent saturday night viewing and fun in that sense but it is time to call an end to these  i think the end was bit unbelievable  my wife left happy and i was basically disappointed at the lack or originality   the awe and wonder of the original series are gone and with all the main characters gone im just not as fully invested the heroine does a nice job and i was pleased with her character development   wren not so much
Jan 20 2020,positive,most star wars series are great except a few with disappointing endings this one was great
Jan 20 2020,negative,i had so much expectation for the outcome of the series and this just took all that downnot to say the movie was terrible but not one id watch again
Jan 20 2020,positive,movie was a great ride appealed to all my senses
Jan 20 2020,negative,formulaic and written for a 4th grade audience checking the boxes and cashing in on the franchise the special effects that used to be engaging are now prosaic  no hint of originality unless you count as yet unseen sidebar aliens the force is no longer with us
Jan 20 2020,negative,well the scoring and visual effects are amazing as usual for a movie with that kind of budget it still cant a movie built on one contrivance after another  the return of the emperor the prime example
Jan 20 2020,positive,loved it but would have been cool if kaylo ren lived
Jan 20 2020,negative,a lackluster wrapup to a story destroyed by the current creative regime sad that the last 3 movies are canon now
Jan 20 2020,positive,great movie cant wait to watch it again
Jan 20 2020,positive,i like how they wrapped up all major characters story lines
Jan 20 2020,positive,i gave it a 3 over a 2 just because it looked great the acting was good and jj did fix the helmet however there were no new jedi or siths and it just had no fire in it or imagination we wanted new but jj abram sent us back not good movie o er all not enough we just wanted more imagination and conflict
Jan 20 2020,positive,great continuation from the last jedi and concluded the skywalker saga in an amazing way truly nothing like star wars in the world this film brings the emotion and action and i could not be more pleased
Jan 20 2020,negative,when you create problems unresolved in the first two films by being as careless with a freshly bought franchise as star wars its easy to get drunk on how much money there is to be made like a teen aged boy left home alone with his dads sports car whos first gut feeling is to tear up the town with it only to realize its too late to roll the miles back or hide the fact you totaled it wait those were plots to good films unfortunately in real life there is nothing amusing about what abrams kennedy with disney have done which is cheapened the product relied on selling nostalgia and pitching  less character development and more action the result is in the third movie they need to answer for the mess who the hell is snoke whats the premise for the final confrontation whats up with rey why is she so overpowered what to do with weak and annoying characters so the result is to just tick off the boxes haphazardly as if they gave a crap in the first place go all in with doing anything it takes to close up plot holes and create a finale with far reaching ridiculous ideas that are so over the top you have to just suspend disbelief so if you cant tell the difference between a good paint job and one done for 9999 or instant coffee from fresh brewed a knock off chinese made rip off from the real thing then i suppose you are not to blame for thinking its as good as it gets
Jan 20 2020,positive,very good movie not great but very good
Jan 20 2020,neutral,it was a bad victory lap of sorts for this saga  sad
Jan 20 2020,positive,flawed but enjoyable
Jan 20 2020,negative,i really wish disney would just hit the hard reset button and do these trilogies over this movie was awful it created plot holes in the entire saga bringing back sidious just for rey to win was even more stupid the wacky abusive relationship between kylo and rey was dumb this was such a stupid movie im so sad about what they did to star wars
Jan 20 2020,positive,awesome movie lots of action
Jan 20 2020,positive,very disappointed i couldve wrote something better i wish i was lying
Jan 20 2020,positive,fantastic end to the series
Jan 20 2020,positive,while not as good at the force awakens its not nearly as bad as people make it out to be it is a convoluted mess but at least its a fun mess
Jan 20 2020,negative,honestly as a space movie its ok but as a star wars movie its trash
Jan 20 2020,positive,what movie would meet fans expectations its fine and adam driver as kylo renben solo is a thirst trap
Jan 20 2020,positive,much better second time around picked up on items that explained the movie better
Jan 20 2020,positive,i was interesting how they revised carrie fishers role  the special effects where good  the plot was a little thin a points
Jan 20 2020,neutral,i just dont care for how disney has come in and made the force to be a religion
Jan 20 2020,negative,bad there was so much that this movie could have been director rian johnson put so many cards on the table especially interesting themes like how the force lives inside all of us and if the force exists inside of all of us then rey didnt need to belong to a special family but for this movie to unravel all the work the last jedi did i just couldnt sit along for the ride
Jan 20 2020,positive,this movie was entertaining from beginning to end it had the action necessary for a star wars movie and though the challenge was great to wrap up the 9movie arch this was a fun movie to watch
Jan 20 2020,positive,action all the way no slow parts
Jan 20 2020,positive,my 10 year old star wars fan and i thought it was awesome  i put significantly more weight on what my kiddo and the audience thinks vs a critic review
Jan 20 2020,positive,perfect end to this sprawling star wars storylineloved it
Jan 20 2020,positive,did a great job of tying up the story was an extremely enjoyable and fun movie
Jan 20 2020,negative,nonsensical storytelling punctuated by an overdose of fan service
Jan 20 2020,positive,yes  meh it passed the time about sums it up would have hoped for a stronger story it had all of the visuals and cgi that you would expect some characters grew and developed but others went backwards with all of the conflict that rey went through to get where she did the completion of the journey and execution felt weak  it was okay im glad i saw it in the theatre i was not one of those who were hard  on about how the last jedi was not true to the story because it had a pretty good story and you saw how the characters were growing not so much this time i thought  when will the next star wars story come out
Jan 20 2020,positive,wrapped up the movie series rey gets closure
Jan 20 2020,negative,worst of sw saga i am very dissspointed and frustrated
Jan 20 2020,positive,considering the situation jj abrams was in limited time to tell a story carrie fishers passing questions from previous two movies tying up the whole saga etc he did a good job leaves more to be desired and its a lot of movie with no time to breath overall its satisfying
Jan 20 2020,positive,a little slow in a couple of areas
Jan 20 2020,positive,i think some of the negative reviews are due to the bar being set unrealistically high for these films that being said it was a really enjoyable movie  perhaps some of it seemed forced or trying too hard to please the crowd but overall i thought it was an excellent film
Jan 20 2020,positive,they saved the best for last
Jan 20 2020,neutral,visually splendid but the story arc was vanilla and just bloated and unwieldy i liked seeing some of the characters from days of old but the fan service and forced wrapping up of character story lines or the lack thereof with some was often painful to be a part of i just didnt feel that any of the gravitas was earned including the ending that was a very forced way to connect all the dots
Jan 20 2020,positive,a great ending to a marvelous reboot in a beloved series
Jan 20 2020,negative,how do the characters fight in the vaccum of space without any space suit illogical  the movie was all over the place and does not make sense
Jan 20 2020,positive,awesome  wonderful  and even better than expected
Jan 20 2020,positive,loved the fact that they brought back all the characters from the past movies
Jan 20 2020,positive,i thought the movie was tremendously entertaining and a valid end to the series  ive watched all of the star wars movies and this one is definitely in the top 3  i dont understand why the critics are tearing it apart  it feels very much like the original 3 which i love  and didnt have some weird wacky ending to make it better  i feel like it delivered perfectly for those true star wars fans that have supported the franchise from the beginning  definitely go see it on the big screen
Jan 20 2020,negative,despite some strange moments in the film that seemed out of place and or awkward i really feel it could have saved itself and this trilogy if the ending was different
Jan 20 2020,positive,one of the best stars wars i have seen and i grew up with the originals
Jan 20 2020,positive,great end to the series as well done as any in the saga fun and true to the history
Jan 20 2020,positive,i really liked this closing chapter of the nine movies it was similar to the star wars franchise that we all grew to love but new with some twists and turns which kept me on my toes thank you to all the star wars storytellers who captured our hearts for all these decades
Jan 20 2020,positive,so good i hate that kylo ren dies im a sucker for happy endings and that would have awesome if they ended together instead of one dying
Jan 20 2020,positive,a good ending to the saga 
Jan 20 2020,negative,ill be glad when making another star wars movie is no longer seen as a potentially profitable endeavor this has to end before it becomes impossible to even laugh at
Jan 20 2020,negative,crammed with a lot of fast paced sequences that distract you from the writing if you try and analyze the plot there are too many things that dont make sense half the movie involves them chasing after an object that makes gives me the feeling it only exists to fill time because the writers didnt know what to make the movie about in many scenes of dialogue the characters dont even matter because their only purpose is to explain what is happening it relies heavily on cheap nostalgia that doesnt make any sense from the perspective of the characters i enjoyed some parts in the ending but it didnt make up for the rest of the movie this movie is okay on its own but as an end to the entire skywalker saga it really falls flat instead of trying to build off the themes or ideas from any of the other movies it just pushes everything aside for a very shallow and flashy plot it doesnt feel like its wrapping up a 9 movie story but instead feels like a remake of the plot from return of the jedi but with even less depth if youre a critic of jj abrams style then you are going to hate this movie
Jan 20 2020,negative,enjoyable effects and a great end of a saga for fans of star wars but the script is lost during the development of  its narratives and history
Jan 20 2020,positive,i dont know why people are panning this movie i think theyre just upset that the series is over as am i i thought it was a great closeout of a great sagaand something that really needs to be seen  in a theater
Jan 20 2020,positive,loved it  great movie experiece
Jan 20 2020,negative,not entertaining at all
Jan 20 2020,positive,it was a good movie nothing to complain about
Jan 20 2020,negative,the movie feels like they were more concerned with pandering to the worst impulses of the fanbase than delivering a coherent story or building on anything established in the last two movies  while there are an abundance of well executed moments thatll no doubt please long time fans less fervent viewers will likely find it very hard to forgive the abundance of technical flaws in the script
Jan 20 2020,negative,the most illogical of the franchise instead of focusing on telling a good story they tried too hard to pander to everyone and didnt even succeed at that cool visuals but no substance the most unsatisfying of set ups and payoff   this pains me to say this because im a hard core starwars fan but this gives attack of the clones a run for its money as the worst in the franchise
Jan 20 2020,positive,the movie was kind of slow at first but picked up it was an emotional movie especially with carrie fisher in ot knowing she passed away i feel they honored her in the way leia died in the movie and was shocked when kyloben died but over all i liked the movie and as others want to know is how did palpatine survive the fall from return of the jedi
Jan 20 2020,positive,spoilers ahead i loved this movie because it brought in healing added more redemption and the stated idea of leading together its main flaws were that it wasnt long enough to wrap everything up and there wasnt enough of rose or of finn and rey whos dynamic i love i thought it flowed well from the last jedi i liked that rey and ben found a way to work together to make the emperor kill himself a lovely metaphor for people overthrowing oppressors
Jan 20 2020,negative,possibly one of the worst movies i have seen  it was long boring and confusing  no thought was given to reality in any way shape or form  it was lame predictable and had way too many cheesy attempts at dramanostalgia the whole movie could have been condensed into 1 hourand that still would have been too long  i remember how great the first 3 episodes were when they came out each subsequent one was worse than the previous  maybe this was just geared towards millennials
Jan 20 2020,positive,a satisfying end to the skywalker saga given that jj abrams had to rescue the plot from the terrible film that was the last jedi this resulted in poor story telling in places with a lack of explanation of key plot points good actions sequences and kylo rens story was excellent a must watch
Jan 20 2020,positive,i thought it was unpredictable and the special affects were great
Jan 20 2020,positive,unbelievable culmination of the series  couldnt have asked for more  so many unspoken references to earlier movies in the series  crazy good
Jan 20 2020,negative,amazing way to end a saga
Jan 20 2020,positive,loved every moment
Jan 20 2020,positive,absolutely a great wrapup of a saga that started when i was only 15 yrs old  the connecting links of the story line were nicely done and pulled together  jj abrams did a great job finishing the story that george lucas started so long ago
Jan 20 2020,positive,the movie plays with some interesting ideas that dont fall flat they have an interesting character arch for kylo ren and rey the ending is great and there is a lot of interesting twists in the movie the movie is a great watch if youre a star wars fan
Jan 20 2020,positive,i had no clue what was happening
Jan 20 2020,positive,an epic finale to the star wars saga one of the best star war films jj abrams once again does a great job creating a beautiful story with phenomenal character development rise of skywalker is a must see
Jan 20 2020,positive,it tied the originals with the finalloved that
Jan 20 2020,positive,it was very entertaining and exciting to watch i really enjoyed this movie a lot
Jan 20 2020,positive,must see for sw fans
Jan 20 2020,negative,it not good i am very disappointed it does try to redo what happend in the last jedi which i think could work but it was done extremely poorly they could have try to accept what came before it and build on it instead of redoing what happend in the last jedi if i need to rank this movie in the skywalker saga then it comes at last its my least favorite in the franchise to  but i want the jjabrams and george lucas cut  that exist release it disney that will redeem the movie and remove this bad version from canon
Jan 20 2020,positive,it was a good movie
Jan 20 2020,positive,the continuous action and special effects were outstanding  however some of the story line could have used a bit more work  looking forward to the directors cut of the movie
Jan 20 2020,positive,loved it its not perfect by any means but the third in a trilogy is always the hardest to get right the last jedi was cinematic and storytelling perfection and while this one doesnt live up to the same standard set with tlj in the story writing and mainly the pacing department its still an incredible movie with some incredible set pieces and beautiful heartbreaking and breathtaking moments no one is ever going to agree with all the story decisions or characters choices but overall it was done very well and im perfectly satisfied with the entire sequel trilogy as a whole its great
Jan 20 2020,positive,good overall movie some obvious tie up moments and some moments you just have to go with it but overall a very good movie and definitely worth seeing
Jan 20 2020,positive,if you are a fan of the original trilogy 4 5 6 you will love this one
Jan 20 2020,positive,the sequel trilogy has problems sure but i must admit i had a very good time with this movie especially after being disappointed with the last jedi  star wars is meant to be an escape and though the fan base is so divided there is plenty of fantasy for everyone to enjoy i clapped along with the audience as the opening crawl started and i cheered with them as rey proclaimed herself a skywalker this was a good time im as old as the original trilogy which holds a very special place in my heart i appreciated the way the story was tied up especially carrie fishers princess general leia
Jan 20 2020,positive,the last trilogy did a nice job of tying up the mega saga there were a few wtf moments but loved the sense of humor throughout also you have to be ok with the star wars curtain call throughout the movie i was and loved the adventure
Jan 20 2020,positive,i liked the story but the transitions from scene to scene felt off
Jan 20 2020,positive,it was much better than i expected
Jan 20 2020,positive,typical star wars movie
Jan 20 2020,positive,great action great plot
Jan 20 2020,positive,i liked the characters and how they acted it made the movie great
Jan 20 2020,positive,so good from the very start absolutely loved it
Jan 20 2020,negative,this movie just a lame copy of the original triology
Jan 20 2020,positive,all the action and spectacle you could hope for
Jan 20 2020,positive,speechless  bring hankies
Jan 20 2020,positive,the movie was unnecessarily long in some places  still a great movie
Jan 20 2020,positive,liked the pacing and action princess leis was weak
Jan 20 2020,negative,same story for the 9th time  evil empire with planetdestroying weapons with little rebellion support  how will the rebellion succeed  predictable outcomes  every time  meh
Jan 20 2020,positive,good movie some plot lines not developed as much as you would want and conclusion makes you wonder if this is the end but my nephew loved it and thats what matters
Jan 20 2020,positive,very similar to episode 7 in the way the movie felt however because it had to fix to many issues with episode 8 it was very erratic and extremely contradistinction to episode 8   while it was entertaining to watch to an actual star wars fan it had its own   horrendous blunders not to mention its fast pace   i am thankful they fixed the many issues in episode 8 however it felt like the entire movie was to overwrite and redo all the issues and plot holes it would have been better to just redo episode 8
Jan 20 2020,positive,a good story about a battle against good and evil who will win
Jan 20 2020,positive,i really liked this movie it wraps up the story of luke leia and han which is really sad for me but its by no means a conclusion to the star wars universe
Jan 20 2020,positive,i thought it was a fun movie
Jan 20 2020,positive,great ending to the saga
Jan 20 2020,positive,a great ending to star war
Jan 20 2020,positive,plot and effects were good definitely disneyfied could have been shorter too many extra little shots that definitely came from the disney influence
Jan 20 2020,positive,i fell asleep just more of the same love story
Jan 20 2020,positive,although i have seen all of the films the first time around and the second time around with my grandsons this film is the most understandable of the whos who and relationships in my opinion
Jan 20 2020,positive,action adventure that you expect from star wars i wish the plot was less predictable but a few twist made it fun nonetheless  i do wish they had explained some things like how the emperor survived vader throwing him into the reactor
Jan 20 2020,positive,it was an excellent finish to the sky walker saga
Jan 20 2020,positive,the think the cinematography acting and action were all great
Jan 20 2020,positive,while there were some continuity issues eg luke always knew who reys grandfather was yet somehow was shocked by how powerful she was in the second movie this was still a fun and exciting conclusion to the series yes it was completely predictable yes no major characters died except the couple i expected to die this did not match up to the scope of the villain but i cant help but to have liked it it was fun
Jan 20 2020,positive,solid conclusion to the skywalker story a little long but overall it was an entertaining film
Jan 20 2020,positive,excellent movie  well worth the ticket price
Jan 20 2020,positive,i thought it was great especially for fans nice story really care about the characters the pace is fast but still understandable
Jan 20 2020,positive,the movie never got boring had some awesome twist of events 
Jan 20 2020,positive,the movie has characters you care about a lot of great action scenes  its entertaining you dont feel the long length
Jan 20 2020,positive,engaging story great quirky acting which the star wars brand is known for the lead actress playing ray nails her scenes and makes a very believable story line shes becoming comfortable in her star wars skin highly recommended movie
Jan 20 2020,positive,a little far fetched force abilities for new users of the force however my wife and i enjoyed the movie it was fast paced and sometimes dizzying trying to keep up but we enjoyed all the fan service jj did
Jan 20 2020,positive,sad to see e d big part of my childhood
Jan 20 2020,positive,loved it at heart  a younger female epic force user  a similar earlier fallen male ex jedi one mythic princess leia presence character  some luke magic contending with darkest shade of sith emperor palpatine on the brink all mixed in with great moments with the force throughout the film call backs also to pt  other eu sw lore if into it while kept entertaining  dramatically tense enough throughout  all with a busy pace additional viewings still rewarding top big screen star wars
Jan 20 2020,positive,much better than the last jedi and it partly tries to undo some of tljs worst aspects good aspects include that finn comes back as a much stronger character bad aspects include that they didnt do the same with rose tico
Jan 20 2020,positive,best movie of the year
Jan 20 2020,positive,it was awesome and a great way to end the series
Jan 20 2020,positive,a celebration of the entire skywalker saga 
Jan 20 2020,positive,this is not a film for the cynical or the jaded this film is about friendship loss and healing this a sweeping epic that raises more questions as is races to answer others that is the point as in the original trilogy the camera quickly pans past creatures and characters who could be the centerpiece of another film hopefully this film appeals to your sense of wonder
Jan 20 2020,positive,its one of my favourite star wars movie i love every part the character are so dynamic and unique the love storyla the best
Jan 20 2020,positive,good end to a franchisei hope  if there are flaws its worth overlooking and simply go with the story
Jan 20 2020,positive,story felt rushed and some characters felt insignificant pacing was trash but the videoaudio was absolutely amazing that alone in a star qars universe mames it pretty ok
Jan 20 2020,positive,it is good movies and amazing
Jan 20 2020,negative,very weak plot bu far the worst star wars movie not a good way to end the trilogy
Jan 20 2020,positive,meh more like a violent childrens story than a good movie glad we went to a matinee
Jan 20 2020,positive,well made nice to see strong female characters as the lead
Jan 20 2020,negative,really bad pacing would rather watch phantom menace 10 more times than this
Jan 20 2020,positive,i thought it was a good time not very surprising but entertaining
Jan 20 2020,negative,the half star belongs to jj for doing the best he could with what he had to work with and still managing to disappoint
Jan 20 2020,negative,finales are difficult to pull off especially when the previous movie had done everything in its power to subvert a narrative plot rise of skywalker just goes through the motions of what you would expect from a final trilogy movie  2 hours and 22 minuets of box checking rehashed ideas and poorly contrived fan service make this movie a chore to watch if you spend anytime trying to think about what is happening in front of you if you do you are likely to miss a good deal of the movie scenes happen that fast watch if you just want a day out at the cinema and nothing else is on miss completely if you are a fan of the last jedi or star wars in general its not worth the headache
Jan 20 2020,positive,if you are a starwars fan must watch
Jan 20 2020,positive,it was pretty decent  the exact opposite of the terrible fanfic that was last jedi
Jan 20 2020,negative,hate that the purchase of my and my wifes tickets contributed to the success of this miserable movie tlj left me angry but at least i respected the artistry and competent direction even if i didnt care for the narrative  this movie was sooo fast and furious which is ok for that franchise everything seemed made up on the spot as if two five year olds were playing and they made a 200 million dollar movie from this play session just nonsensical and soulless i felt nothing whether there was death sacrifice or impossible victory it was just numb running around from one place to another never taking the time to take things in and feel this movie is a waste
Jan 20 2020,positive,this was my 2nd favorite star wars movie behind empire strikes back and i felt it wrapped up the series perfectly
Jan 20 2020,positive,outstanding movie  they have a lot of story to tell but jj abrams focuses on the parts that are most important  jedi vs sith being brought to a conclusive end relationship between rey finn and poe and reys relationship with kylo ren  kylo ren is finally a bad ass and reys power is understandable
Jan 20 2020,neutral,kylo rens cracked helmet bothered me more than any other element in a star wars movie overall ended a great series in a pretty average way
Jan 20 2020,positive,that was the best star wars battle ever rip leia and kylo ren
Jan 20 2020,positive,great special effects and some answers to long standing questions
Jan 20 2020,neutral,too fumbled balls to name as a stand alone film there action than actual explained story  as the finale of finales tros doesnt suck the landing
Jan 20 2020,negative,shoehorned in plot points all relationships felt forced disappointing ending to a disappointing reboot
Jan 20 2020,positive,too much time spent on tying up all of the loose ends and making a happy a jedi ending sorry doesnt end like that way
Jan 20 2020,positive,it was a good movie
Jan 20 2020,positive,totally awesomeexcellent finale to a successful series of epic films

Jan 20 2020,positive,not as bad as people say it was i enjoyed it
Jan 20 2020,positive,the best one out of all the movies too many cool things to mention that might be spoilers
Jan 20 2020,negative,so much wrong with it there were only a few scenes that were any good and that is only because of the actors this film was like a bad fan fiction on a hollywood budget i sat in a daze i never fall asleep at movies and i almost did several times they really ran over everyone and their character in this movie
Jan 20 2020,positive,it was very good story line
Jan 20 2020,positive,i love it star wars movies thanks good time

Jan 20 2020,positive,who cares what the critics say it was another kickass star wars film my son and i loved it
Jan 20 2020,positive,it was good a lot of nostalgia definitely had room for improvement though
Jan 20 2020,positive,unfortunately the last installment has been one of the easiest to guess what is going to happen next  special effects are extraordinary as usual but the script left something to desire  jj abrams kept this to close to the old formula as a refresh and new perspective may have done well  decent end but not what i thought would have happened given the lineage of this franchise
Jan 20 2020,positive,a fun time with friends but held little to no substance and threw a lot of unforeseen curve balls that had absolutely no foreshadowing at all
Jan 20 2020,positive,fantastic conclusion to the series  the movie masterfully connected the entire series bringing it to the final ending it deserves  wonderful acting and brilliant storytelling
Jan 20 2020,positive,didnt need to be so long  feels like at least two movies smashed together into one overall though its not bad
Jan 20 2020,positive,the movie kept my attention throughout even though i havent seen all of the star wars movies up until this one knowing enough of the back story you could easily follow along it was very well done and i would definitely see it again
Jan 20 2020,positive,wonderful conclusion to the final trilogy
Jan 20 2020,positive,this star wars movie was probably the best hours movie i have ever seen all of the references from all of the sauers movies may being really happy the end of the movie felt so complete and nothing felt rushed to me i dont know what the critics were thinking about giving this movie bad reviews and stuff if you go and see this movie i am telling you that you till love it because i loved this movie so much i highly reccomend it
Jan 20 2020,positive,one of the best star wars in a long time great effects and i care about these characters
Jan 20 2020,positive,it was a great movie a few surprises told everything about people over the years if people are a star wars fan they should go sect
Jan 20 2020,positive,i loved it everything was amazing except that i wish we got more time to experience the culture of the aki aki during the once every 42 year festival of the ancestors
Jan 20 2020,negative,a complete mess of a movie it was so much like endgame it wasnt funny with no clear direction for the sequel trilogy and the complete dump rian johnson created with the last jedi this had too much to do while derivative at times the force awakens showed some promise for the sequels but the wheels fell off with episode viii and crashed and burned with ix shame i used to love star wars
Jan 20 2020,positive,excellent movie well put definitely recommend seeing
Jan 20 2020,positive,star wars is meant to be action and cool special effects and it did that but i mean the plot was a little goofy
Jan 20 2020,positive,wasnt as good as i taught it would be
Jan 20 2020,positive,my family and i loved this movie  we all enjoyed it very much  it was very exciting and heartfelt
Jan 20 2020,positive,not the best of the series but pretty good
Jan 20 2020,positive,an amazing spectacle to watch  even if i disagree with story arc which i do
Jan 20 2020,positive,the ending of this storied franchise seemed disconnected and rushed
Jan 20 2020,positive,loved it critics were wrong about this one as a 50 year old fan it made me very happy
Jan 20 2020,positive,enjoyed it start to finish just sit back be entertained and over think it 
Jan 20 2020,positive,i think they did a wonderful job bringing the saga to a close from the original storycharacters
Jan 20 2020,positive,good plot great cinematography action packed
Jan 20 2020,positive,very good ending to the series tied in alot of back story
Jan 20 2020,positive,did not like the way things were wrapped up
Jan 20 2020,positive,full of questionable plot decisions but very entertaining nonetheless
Jan 20 2020,positive,i really liked this movie  i thought it was a good end to the skywalker legacy  a few surprises in the storyline  i highly recommend
Jan 20 2020,positive,i didnt hate the movie if anything it made me hate episode 8 for being so completely useless had this movie been two parts it would have been a lot more enjoyable disney messed up by letting jj abrams leave after episode 7
Jan 20 2020,positive,it was good i enjoyed it the way the story played out was mildly predictable and was generally without suspense however it was enjoyable
Jan 20 2020,positive,a shame to end a iconic series with such mediocrity 
Jan 20 2020,positive,not sure why theres so many people complaining i thought it was a very adequate way to wrap up the skywalker story
Jan 20 2020,positive,its a fun time just dont think too much
Jan 20 2020,positive,great ending to a story saga
Jan 20 2020,negative,i feel they squashed 3 movies in 1
Jan 20 2020,positive,solid ending to the series but not spectacular
Jan 20 2020,positive,probably the best star wars movie of all time absolute must see again
Jan 20 2020,positive,enjoyed it thought the language was modern talk rather then star wars language
Jan 20 2020,positive,great special effects and sound marred by a weak story and horrible writing
Jan 20 2020,negative,cheaply earned thrills that quickly pass  the film is basically a cynical corporate generated schlock script made with impeccable craft and a 250 budget  forced this is why it fails
Jan 20 2020,positive,it is a great action movie but still just a throw back to the original 3 movies the plot progresses with to much to fast try to watch it without the member berries if you can
Jan 20 2020,positive,i liked how all had han princes lea and luke all in the move
Jan 20 2020,negative,as a young child i was blown away by the original star wars movie in cinemas  the 2 that followed were next level  later the prequels upped the special effects  told an overall good story  episode 7 was was visually good but the story a rerun of the original  after that it was all down hill  the rise of skywalker was anything but  a magical saga ruined by mismanagement on disneys part  a disjointed direction team with ryan johnson going out of his way to his own story  not follow a trilogy path  ultimately leaving jj to pick up the pieces  make a silk purse from a pigs ear  an absolute train wreck of a movie bringing palpatine with no explanation  where did the resistance find a massive fleet  rubbish yet its made loads of money so disney will serve up more of the same  theres only one positive hyperspace skipping  just wished id thought of that  hyperspace skipped right out of the cinema  piss poor  thanks for ruining star wars george lucas must be spinning in his grave
Jan 20 2020,negative,i was very disappointed they try to appeal to everyone and every age its extremely predictable and not believable i miss the mystique and wonder
Jan 20 2020,negative,bad disjointed stupid script sad ending to the long saga
Jan 20 2020,positive,this star wars movie was awesome it had great action scenes and the special effects were amazing the entire cast did an excellent job and the story was well written its great that everyone that worked on this film appreciates the star wars franchise and continues to make it better and better i would recommend that people should see this star wars film but if you havent seen the previous star wars films you should watch them before you see this one
Jan 20 2020,positive,i likes how they brought everyone from the past movies
Jan 20 2020,negative,the only thing jj abrams should be allowed to write is his shopping list this two and a half hour long trailer is an unholy mess that relies on the audience not having time to digest what just happened before moving on to the next scene if nothing else the rise of skywalker is a masterclass on how to neglect character arcs undo previous story developments and contrive nonsensical plot devices
Jan 20 2020,negative,good acting good special effects good fanservice moments but bad writing lazy that seems to just want to please fans  without being deep contradicts the previous episodes of this trilogy including 7 a mess with little imagination a sad and even cruel end to such a beloved franchise
Jan 20 2020,positive,well rounded movie that brought the entire series together to an amazing ending
Jan 20 2020,positive,absolutely love how they concluded such an epic story
Jan 20 2020,positive,the writing wasnt very good the acting could have been the director did the actors dirty
Jan 20 2020,positive,this movie is just plain fun a little rushed at times but definitely a worthwhile end to the greatest saga in film history dont rely on the bias of the critics judge it for yourself
Jan 20 2020,positive,it was great to see luke leia han and lando again but i will never see how adam driver was cast as han and leias son  total miscast  that being said this final trilogy was better than episodes 12 and 3 but they cannot compare to the middle original trilogy
Jan 20 2020,negative,walked out 75 through was really really boring
Jan 20 2020,positive,this movie captured the threehero vibe of the original trilogy more than any of the others since the kylo ren character arc was satisfying as was the respectful treatment of carrie fishers general leia
Jan 20 2020,positive,jj did it again absolutely loved this
Jan 20 2020,positive,it was a nice wrapup to the saga while leaving some room for future films much better pacing than better action than last jedi
Jan 20 2020,negative,boringreally boring you have seen all this before i used a gift carddo not pay full price for this train wreck matinee only or wait for streaming not recommended
Jan 20 2020,positive,i enjoyed it old star wars fans might not so much tho
Jan 20 2020,positive,really well put together actions sequences  visual effects were amazing i enjoyed the movie over all
Jan 20 2020,positive,lots of action good triumphs over evil
Jan 20 2020,positive,it was certainly corny in places but very satisfying to this baby boomer who has been a star wars fan from day 1
Jan 20 2020,positive,a satisfying end to this epic saga  good pacing solid story good humor and great action and special effects
Jan 20 2020,positive,kind of boring same ole theme main characters are weak
Jan 20 2020,negative,for 8 movies weve been lead to believe that balance was coming to the force it could be argued that without any evilsith left as boogeymen hiding in the shadows the force is more unbalanced then ever i wouldnt say this was a bad movie it was certainly entertaining but asking more questions about how we got here has certainly not done star wars any real favors id watch it again but i wouldnt pay to watch it again
Jan 20 2020,positive,so freaking good i loved it
Jan 20 2020,positive,i loved how they chose to wrap up the skywalker saga they fit a lot into the movie but it left so much for them to build on in the future outside of the skywalker story
Jan 20 2020,positive,i loved it for bringing back some of my favorite characters with an exciting story
Jan 20 2020,positive,i liked how there were throwbacks to all the episodes it felt like closure to the current storylinea it had a nice mix of humor and seriousness i liked how it all played out i would say more but dont want to spoil it
Jan 20 2020,positive,overall a great ending but im not sure why i was a little confused i dont mind watching it again that should tell you something
Jan 20 2020,negative,if all you want is an action movie then youll enjoy it if you are looking for a continuation of some semblance of a story then youll notice an abundance of plot holes and will walk away with many of the same questions that you walk in with remaining unanswered
Jan 20 2020,positive,cheesy nostalgia but still entertaining
Jan 20 2020,positive,action packed with a great cast and characters exciting from start to finish we want to see it again
Jan 20 2020,positive,tied up all the loose ends
Jan 20 2020,positive,amazing story and special effects
Jan 20 2020,positive,the movie was everything we expected
Jan 20 2020,positive,it takes a lot for my husband to go to the movies and this movie did not disappoint cannot wait to add this movie to my library enjoyed it very much and will admit i cried more than once
Jan 20 2020,positive,how can you not like this epic movie shame on the bad reviews
Jan 20 2020,positive,great wrap up to the series  like sit a lot  touching family stuff
Jan 20 2020,positive,i am not a fan of the new series and this movie did nothing to change my mindnothing really new rogue one was awesome with a compelling and unique plot
Jan 20 2020,negative,a breakneck pace and a story that seems way too jumbled with many plot conveniences its reveals and the direction it takes does not feal earned whatsoever ultimately this movies detriment is the overall lack of a unified vision in the sequel trilogy as a whole and its attempt to change the past and throw fan service in the faces of viewers
Jan 19 2020,negative,this film has so much wrong with it that there is literally dozens and dozens of youtube vidoes which go into indepth explanations about all the things wrong with this film including that george lucas doesnt like it mark hamill doesnt like it most of the fandom doesnt like it and that it could well spell the end of kathleen kennedys run as president of disney  but enough about why other people dont like it here is what i think  i think that all a film needs to be any good is good acting good directing good pacing good musical score and a plot that is both internally consistent with its previous linked films and makes sense well rehashing john williams every five minutes was a mistake as clearly the musical director was absent for the cinema cut of the film and his undrestudy just applied a random clip everytime the movie shifted to a near scene even if the choice of music made no sense  the acting was in the most past appaling but i blame much of this on the terrible script the nonsensical plot that was more patchwork than a quilt and back room editing that seemed to want to just thrust familiar faces at us at every turn  so much of this film was unwatchable that were it not for the fact that i had already invested close to twenty hours in the overall storyline of skywalker from inception to its completion that i would have walked out before the film even reached half way  there were so many duff lines that i gave up trying not to wince when i heard one the stormtroopers had become so ineffective that i doubt they could hit a barn wall from the inside and rey was so overpowered after next to no training and just glancing at a few old jedi books that for her everything was just a series of small inconveniences to casually step over  the film has no heart no soul no love interest no moments that deftly plucked at my heart strings and if i never see it again it will be too soon
Jan 19 2020,positive,this is the way you end a saga they pulled from each storyline i was discouraged by the last jedi but this movie was good
Jan 19 2020,negative,yet again the new concepts and ideas from disney introduced in these new star wars films have ruined the entire story telling of the star wars universe  i hope they hire different writers and backtrack on some of the ridiculous implementations they put into the legacy that was built
Jan 19 2020,negative,omg what was that  this felt like 6 movies compressed into one  within a few minutes  you deep into a rapid series of events dont go to the bathroom as you might miss about 5 story elements rey is still overpowered i never felt that she could fail nor that she needed anybodys help the force is no longer used for combat but for healing and long distance communications and teleporting objects i guess  the stormtroopers fly now but only in one scene then never again  leia is there but not really aware of her surroundings think weekend at bernies  sorry im rambling but this not good at all  86 audience approval that seems fishy to me
Jan 19 2020,positive,its hard to top all thats gone before this last of the original 9 episodes but it held its own and still had a few surprises
Jan 19 2020,negative,the acting was good but i think what they were given wasnt as par if you like star wars you should see it to get closure but dont go in expecting a lot they tried to thrown in as much as possible spoiler when they brought back palpitine that undercuts vaders sacrifice in episode 6 by showing he didnt kill palpitine so when someone dies it isnt as impactful becuase hey han solo might live he might some how come back because palpitine did all in all it isnt to good
Jan 19 2020,positive,guess you have to be a star wars fan  descent action  thought the movie was too long for story line
Jan 19 2020,positive,what can i say i just plain like the series wondering if this is the end or will there be a star wars x
Jan 19 2020,positive,sad to see this era of movies end 
Jan 19 2020,positive,it was ok not great to be sure
Jan 19 2020,positive,all i can say is wow definitely a must see
Jan 19 2020,positive,longtime fan going back to 1977 i thought they did a good job ending the saga and filled some gaps that the last jedi painfully refused to fill while also alienating a lot of longtime fans with erratic political statements and a drawnout forgettable plot lesson learned i hope by disney that fans will not be happy with just anything with a star wars logo on it at any rate it was a good ending and worth seeing
Jan 19 2020,negative,275 000000 to make this piece of crap what is the world coming to 
Jan 19 2020,negative,garbage it broke all law and rule of jedi and sith  
Jan 19 2020,positive,it was everything i would expect and didnt expect in one great way to end the saga
Jan 19 2020,negative,i was petrified i have been a fan of star wars since i was born and i felt just empty after the end of the movie and the trilogy a complete collection of garbage without rhyme or reason i wonder if they actually spent any time at all thinking about a plot or how to link it back to the previous episodes
Jan 19 2020,negative,pacing was bad seemed to try and fit an entire trilogy in one film the planning for these 3 films was atrocious they do not connect well to the skywalker saga
Jan 19 2020,positive,meh captures the usual star wars glamour but the slightly messy story makes this feel like an unsatisfying end to the skywalker saga step down from jjs the force awakens partly due to the last jedi
Jan 19 2020,positive,ignore the haters  a great wrap up to the trilogy and worth seeing
Jan 19 2020,negative,the end of the story is terrible and ill be honest i hope they will stop making star wars movies disney ruins everything with there hidden agenda stuff
Jan 19 2020,positive,tied up loose ends very busy a good movie
Jan 19 2020,positive,i enjoyed the finished project far better than the last jedi if more time was spent i am certain jj could have ironout any discrepancies under the circumstances pressure behind the scenes course correction from the previous films plus embittered fans jj performed supremely well
Jan 19 2020,positive,great conclusion to the series abrams had to deal with many different constituencies and did a good balancing all of them i do think there was enough material to split the finale into two movies but i can understand the rationale for finishing in the manner that was chosen
Jan 19 2020,positive,star wars was worth the long wait my son daughter and myself enjoyed every bit of the movie
Jan 19 2020,positive,one of the best star wars of the new storyline 
Jan 19 2020,negative,was definitely a big build up to a great disappointment
Jan 19 2020,positive,very entertaining  that is why i go to the movies  the  critics want some kind of art statement  go see the movie and you will be entertained
Jan 19 2020,negative,when you find the pay off in this movie give me a call
Jan 19 2020,negative,stay tuned for the next star wars where somehow the sith will manage to make planet killing guns for each stormtrooper but somehow still lose whoever is writing the script at this point has completely given up trying
Jan 19 2020,positive,a completely solid ending to the new franchise so minor details for the more hardcore audience were left in the balance but the casual fan will definitely enjoy
Jan 19 2020,positive,critics off the mark yet again
Jan 19 2020,positive,its always great to watch a star wars movie there are little adjustments that could be made however overall i think the movie was awesome
Jan 19 2020,positive,best of the latest three largest negative is that the final 30 minutes seemed rushed as the film attempted and succeeded in wrapping up the storyline
Jan 19 2020,positive,ive been watching the skywaker saga since may 1977 when my dad took me to see the original for my 12th birthday   been an avid star wars fan ever since and i felt the rise of skywalker was a good wrap up to that story that left me with a positive feeling   looking forward to see what disney and lucasfilm have for us next
Jan 19 2020,negative,the last jedi left such a mess it would be impossible for this thing to have been good
Jan 19 2020,positive,a great ending to movies i have been watching since 1977
Jan 19 2020,positive,good ending to the skywalker saga good tie in to rise of the resistance ride
Jan 19 2020,negative,this movie was dumb and goofy in a mostly enjoyable way given that the first two movies did nothing to set up a conclusion this one had very low expectations going in like force awakens this movie was 90 nostalgia but for what that is worth it was passable i could never really recommend this movie or trilogy for that matter to anyone unfamiliar with the original trilogy and that in and of itself is a fundamental failure let this be a lesson for anyone going into a planned trilogy with absolutely no plan
Jan 19 2020,positive,as a fan i am truly grateful for this film with a balance of nostalgia and action i felt relieved that jj abraham had fixed the mistakes of the last jedi however i feel it failed as a stand alone film for people who are not fans of star wars but this film was made for the fans not for the critics or the people who know nothing about the deep lore although there are some minor errors with the film such as the pace i believe it did justice to the saga may the force be with you fellow fans
Jan 19 2020,positive,i enjoyed this one more than the other ones i was very pleased that adam drivers character wasnt as emasculated in this film he is an incredible actor and deserved better than the the previous scripts it summed up thing well
Jan 19 2020,positive,the movie was overall an enjoyable experience but if you expect anything more from it than any other action movie prepare to be mildly disappointed its still the best entry in the sequel trilogy and i would recommend it seeing it once if youre a star wars fan but its not greatjust good
Jan 19 2020,positive,loved that they brought all the main charters back
Jan 19 2020,positive,it was fine its not good its not bad its extremely forgettable but a fun two hours
Jan 19 2020,negative,bored to death worse star wars movie ever han solo which is a flop in the box office is a much better movie
Jan 19 2020,positive,as a movie great  as the close of the saga too many weird plot points
Jan 19 2020,positive,another star wars movie
Jan 19 2020,negative,feels like a step back for the franchise instead of following the darker path that rian johnson and colin t had created and wrote jj tried to patch it with a disney branded bandaid very poor writing numerous plotholes and bland character building finn is nothing in this film this is easily one of the worst star wars films to date giving it 1 12 due to the visual effects and john williams cool albeit lazy soundtrack
Jan 19 2020,positive,the saga to end all sagas this movie was epic
Jan 19 2020,positive,i found star wars the rise of skywalker to be an enjoyable final installment of the trilogy while i agree that some elements could have been better overall it was well worth the wait the trilogy as a whole was a great addition to the series of movies and i can only hope they have more in store for us in the future
Jan 19 2020,positive,this was the best of all the new generation star wars it was action packed exciting had lots of special effects  it was nice to see some of the original cast also all in all excellent movie
Jan 19 2020,negative,to be honest all three were okay i am a big star wars fan and i have to be frank about themthey seemed to be nothing more than a retelling of the original trilogy with different characters the only one that i would give a five star is rogue one
Jan 19 2020,positive,i am convinced john williams is master of the jedi mind trick and has programed pavlovian responses in every star wars fan
Jan 19 2020,positive,loved the storyline closure involving rey and kylo ren ben skywalker did not like the kissing scene between the two
Jan 19 2020,negative,i mean i still enjoyed it because its a star wars movie but so many plot holes and details confuse the hell out of me
Jan 19 2020,negative,as a lifelong fan of all star wars content and an avid supporter of the sequel trilogy against its haters i was very disappointed to find that i for the first time ever disliked a star wars movie though the directors who worked to make this movie avidly claim that they were not attempting to retcon established plot points and character arcs from this movies predecessor the last jedi this movie wasted over half the movie doing just that while the last jedi may have been divisive and controversial attempting to correct the socalled damage it did is simply not good writing and makes for an abysmal lack of cohesiveness in a supposed trilogy the particular point they made about the protagonists character is also a decision i am still disappointed about as a woman who very much enjoyed the last jedis point that not everyone had to have a powerful lineage to be powerful it made me feel very much that this decision was catered to loudvoiced men who called rey a mary sue which is an inherently sexist term to use not to mention the sidelining of an important female character from the previous movie by giving her just over one minute of screentimethis i can only attribute to an attempt to appease the men who expressed such hate for her character that they bullied the actress off social media no matter how much chris terrio blames it on the fact that carrie fisher died the ending of the movie lacks proper closure for a saga and left me with more questions than answers as well as a profound sadness for what they chose to do to the skywalker legacy the skywalkers endings are overwhelmingly tragic and have caused me to feel sorrow for their inevitable ruin even with a happy ending such as the return of the jedi the choice to have rey end on tatooinea planet which has only caused pain and suffering for the skywalker family if the directors had ever bothered to watch a star wars movie despite their claim that it is a beautiful and peaceful planetlacked imagination and a general understanding of any single character within these movies this movie was not characterdriven it was driven by fanservice cheap nostalgia and shock value that the creators chose to move characters into like chess pieces regardless of their individual goals or motives the only reason i give this movie more than one star is the outstanding performances by the castadam driver in particular though even he could not make the diabolical line you dont just have power you have his power sound naturaland the fact that i still love the star wars characters and world and the music of john williams
Jan 19 2020,positive,answered a lot of questions tied up loose ends glad they ended star wars
Jan 19 2020,negative,dissapointed disney should respect the original story
Jan 19 2020,positive,it was a movie not bad but not great hope the next ones are better
Jan 19 2020,positive,the movie tied up all lose ends and gave the characters i grew loving a good end the two houses went very quick very entertaining
Jan 19 2020,positive,lives up to the hype if youre a star wars fan you wont be disappointed
Jan 19 2020,negative,force awakens was like a glitter pill no substance but pretty easy to digest the last jedi was a giant steaming turd rise of skywalker is the glitter in that turd sorta pretty and the best you can expect from a pile of h1t
Jan 19 2020,positive,much much better than the last jedi  i enjoyed the movie and i thought it was the best out of this new trilogy  that being said i still think all of the previous six were better than any of these new three  i still recommend seeing this movie in the theater as opposed to waiting for video
Jan 19 2020,neutral,another collection of redone star wars scenes or perhaps a loose remake of return of the jedi but what else did we expect each movie was essentially a loose remake of the original trilogy at the same time there some good scenes and hilarious lines particularly the 3cpo stuff im struggling to be positive so i will say that daisy ridley was very good even if i didnt care for her character and she finally talked all in all im glad this mess is over
Jan 19 2020,positive,lots of nods  winks and i thought a fun way to end a trilogy of movies that were uneven to say the least
Jan 19 2020,positive,entertaining but too fastpaced and convenient storymoments bring it down
Jan 19 2020,positive,not the best of the franchise but certainly entertaining
Jan 19 2020,positive,i love the star wars series
Jan 19 2020,negative,absolutely nothing new was introduced in this movie it was just an other jj abrams generic action movie dont get me wrong  it wasnt awful but it was terribly disappointing
Jan 19 2020,positive,awesome awesome movie its phenomenal
Jan 19 2020,positive,felt rushed  barely closed the story arcs  title makes no sense with the conclusion  took characters with good arcs and made them terrible fin or removed them rose
Jan 19 2020,negative,this is one of the worst movies of all time it was phonedin i wanted to leave in the first five minutes
Jan 19 2020,positive,it was a good movie but i wish i would have waited to rent it rather than pay to see it in the theaters i found myself trying to fight falling asleep towards the middle and end of the movie i stood awake though thankfully so it wasnt a waste of my money overall id suggest waiting and watching it at home
Jan 19 2020,negative,absolutely terrible the writing is horrible with so many plot holes and unanswered questions bringing back palpatine was creative laziness and took a huge dump on the original trilogy with his return this movie also completely ignored the established rules about the force and its abilities the only positive i can say is its visually beautiful but thats it so much potential squandered and the worst possible way to end the skywalker saga
Jan 19 2020,positive,what an end to a 9 episode saga  fantastic and was well better than episode 8 of any of the first 3 episodes   46 still are the best
Jan 19 2020,positive,ending was great at times it dragged on in spots butt all in all a great movie
Jan 19 2020,positive,the rise of skywalker was the best way to conclude the new trilogy completely salvaging the wreck that was the last jedi for all the complaints about palpatine and the ending and whatnot its star wars its based on an imaginary galaxy if youre ok with lightsabers and hyperspace and stuff nitpicking about this movie is nothing more than whiny nonsense
Jan 19 2020,negative,i honestly thought is was a mess so many plotholes and terrible writing
Jan 19 2020,positive,the movie is made well  the story moves slow but the endings action although disappointing story line makes the movie worth watching  palpatine was a bad choice for villain and i missed rose she didnt get enough of a storyline
Jan 19 2020,positive,too many people cant handle the fact this movie was amazing for what obstacles were created from the last jedi  i believe the heroes all got the ending they deserve it was an emotional roller coaster for old school star wars fans and just a solid movie overall
Jan 19 2020,positive,amazing movie that was a fitting end to the series
Jan 19 2020,positive,i absolutely loved this epic conclusion to the skywalker saga amazing acting set pieces and story  this film is getting a lot of negativity for all the wrong reasons and its quite sad to see and read but hey its star wars the conclusion was always going to divide people but a resounding 1010 for me 
Jan 19 2020,positive,loved the interaction between the characters and story line loved the themes and a good wrap up for the 9 movies
Jan 19 2020,positive,its star wars at ist best
Jan 19 2020,negative,this movie was not good
Jan 19 2020,positive,liked it  it is the best of the new movies  comes closer to the quality of the empire strikes back
Jan 19 2020,positive,all story threads from episodes 1 to 8 were tied up story was consistent with previous movies daisy ridley is fantastic as rey i liked the way lines from previous movies were worked smoothly into ix po finally became the force he was destined to become i am so ready for the fourth trilogy
Jan 19 2020,positive,long but tied a bunch of family tree stories too for me
Jan 19 2020,positive,i thought it was a good star wars movie not the best one but far from the worst
Jan 19 2020,positive,the fact that kylo ren died
Jan 19 2020,positive,ive never been a huge star wars fan always greatly preferred star trek however ive watched all the star wars movies even the particularly bad ones and ive enjoyed most of them  i find this movie an enjoyable enough way to pass the time my only real complaint was the ending wouldve been nice to watch that character gradually redeem themselves but oh well
Jan 19 2020,positive,much better than the last one
Jan 19 2020,positive,disappointed more then anything so much potential for characters development that didnt really happen introduced new characters but movie moved so fast it seemed like they were only added to seek merchandise did not answer a lot of questions caused more however visually awesome the movie felt incomplete on story
Jan 19 2020,positive,with no expectations and emotional investment only in droids this was a more enjoyable film than either of the first two entries in the sequel trilogy much of it is sloppy writing and backtracking but nothing that offended me since i didnt like force awakens or last jedi i laughed i cried its the only movie i had fun watching
Jan 19 2020,positive,loved it great end to the sky walker saga
Jan 19 2020,positive,by the sound of reviews from professional critics it was supposed to be the worst in the series i went expecting complete disappointment  my fears went unrealised when i went to see it a totally entertaining and fulfilling end to a series that has had me captivated mostly since 1977 another example of how critics are paid way too much for what they doand in this case what they failed to do
Jan 19 2020,positive,this last addition of the skywalker trilogy was an enjoyable movie it was a little safely written in its attempt to tie together 40 years of star wars history but jj abrams did an admirable job in terms of character development and quality of filmmaking and now its time to look forward towards individual movies based on the star wars characters i remember seeing the original star wars movie at the ziegfeld theater in new york and its hard to believe that over 40 years have passed in the star wars trilogies a truly cultural and social phenomenon that is meant to be enjoyed by all
Jan 19 2020,positive,good action sequences  some of the scenes did not make a lot of sense and cameos were thrown in without purpose
Jan 19 2020,negative,a pathetic excuse of a movie even worse as star wars  this movie the last thank god skywalker story was the final nail in the coffin of this disgusting trilogy first movie had no aim second one was a generally enjoyable popcorn movie that should have never been a star wars film and this it tried to be everything this movie wanted to be a jack of all trades and it become a joke of all aspects i cant understand how could the audicence here give this movie anything above 10 half of the movie tried to give some depths to the story and the characters only to take all of it away 2 scenes later the movie itself made no sense to understand it disney published a picture book that tried to fill in the canyon like holes the story had a book the same day the movie aired why everything could have been told in 10 minutes and we all know that this movie could have used 10 minutes of peace becose the fulltime actionadventure was becoming very old real early after watching it i have spent 3 hours of my life in the pub giving a 25 hour long lecture on the many aspects this movie was terrible the other 30 minutes were used to order refreshments and to use the restroom nothing extra pretty much the same that you can find on youtube the rants on why the movie was awful in case you care about this saga if it was part of you childhood etc if you dont care about stories being destroyed and it had no meaning in your life then you migh even enjoy this show  will not give spoilers movie is shit male actors try their best female actors are mediocre not like they had any chance with the character they had to portrey if you like star wars don watch it if you want brainded popcron adventure look no further you found the perfect match for yourself perfect movie for a netflixchill marathon
Jan 19 2020,negative,first viewing i was relieved that it corrected the crappy last jedi its enjoyable and more respectful of the star wars legacy having seen it a second time however you see it with the other two films in the trilogy what a wasted opportunity what a hodgepodge of arbitrary ideas why did palpatine come back in this one just silly i think the main actors did a really good job with frankly poor material if i was george lucas i would be regretting my decision to sell to disney as theyve done a terrible job in terms of luke skywalker they pretty much chewed the character up and spat him out 
Jan 19 2020,positive,i loved it i thought that it was an excellent movie a very good end to the greatest saga ever
Jan 19 2020,positive,too much time spent paying homage to the original story hard to follow because of that
Jan 19 2020,negative,good performances and visual effects as well as some great cameos but the script sucked so fcking much it is still a bad movie the worst one in the whole saga disappointing
Jan 19 2020,positive,wish i could see it again cant wait for the dvd
Jan 19 2020,positive,a great way to wrap up the saga for the fans
Jan 19 2020,positive,tied everything together seeing its the last one a lot of bad reviews from a few bad scenes but we still enjoyed it
Jan 19 2020,positive,not only was the movie amazing but 4d made it that much more spectacular every theater should have a 4d theater
Jan 19 2020,positive,took back the most interesting parts about the last jedi the plot was overstuffed no time for the major plot points the really sink in just too bloated enjoyable if you turn off your brain
Jan 19 2020,negative,a franchise killer  mismanaged story  mismanaged characters  mismanaged mess
Jan 19 2020,positive,very good ending to this franchise
Jan 19 2020,positive,amaizing movie ties up all or most lose ends from all the other movies and so emotional connected with true fans and new comers as well my wife whi has only seen the last two movies loved it that tells you overall is a very well balanced movie great special effects and the emotions again run high in my opinion  i wish this wasnt the last one tho
Jan 19 2020,positive,i loved it best film in the saga how this has a lower rating than episodes iiii is a mystery its worth rewatching them all in chronological order starting at episode i and youll see how great this one really is plus yes i love the kiss
Jan 19 2020,positive,just right closing story
Jan 19 2020,negative,maybe its just too many star wars before  i found this one struggling to keep the story flowing up  down all over the place and i dont mean complicated it seemed dragged out and lacking in spot  if you like cinematography and special effects then go see this one it is not lacking in that area  after i beat this movie up and then told you of its strong points the bottom line is that it is a strong two stars but just couldnt make it to a 2 12 stars
Jan 19 2020,positive,was better than the last
Jan 19 2020,positive,its star wars im always entertained by star wars  if youve seen all the rest of the movies this one is a must see
Jan 19 2020,positive,great finish to an unforgetable series
Jan 19 2020,positive,great action packed movie
Jan 19 2020,negative,insult to logic abomination of the very idea of star wars tries to pace itself faster than you can think but fails even there babu frik was cool though
Jan 19 2020,positive,good for the sw fans jj abrams delivered with the footage he had to provide an enjoyable ride
Jan 19 2020,positive,thanks be to jj for wiping out most of rian johnsons crap show i only wish hed totally retconned a death that was completely unnecessary but oh well
Jan 19 2020,positive,forgot the naysayers its a great add to the star wars saga
Jan 19 2020,positive,excellent visual story line repetitive
Jan 19 2020,neutral,ok its a fun movie but this film is a total violation of star wars apparently there are no longer any limits to what the force can do theyve turned jedis into a mash up of the xmen harry potter batman the highlander and freakin sam wheat from ghost need out of a jam just make up some other stupid thing force users can do exactly when and how do they train to rapidly heal fatal wounds or send physical objects through the fabric of space and time maybe they discovered all that when leia was apparently trained to be a jedi ninja which is about as stupid as making jar jar a political figure no boundaries you fools the entire movie was on full throttle red alert from the second it starts oh no were in a horrible life or death crisis i know lets use the force done what now uhoh another mission critical crisis light speed skipping done shucks if only we knew how to figure out this meaningless dilemma that is also life or death mission critical i know lets decode a stupid knife and immediately solve every single riddle as though batmans super computer brain was right there with us but it doesnt matter because our poor directorial decisions ultimately make that entire subplot meaningless you know they could have learned a lot from rewatching the original trilogy and i do mean the originals not the remakes they were balanced like the force they let grow wildly out of control as though they wanted rey to become galactus there is just plain too much in these new ones and especially this last one which i do hope is indeed the last theres no comedy left remember hans witty charm not a drop of that made it this far but they did manage to straight up steal the big reveal from empire strikes back which only compounded the idiocy more they even zapped return of the jedi for that whole saving you through compassion thing all the while removing all relief be it comedy or just down time to show these characters actually live like normal people from time to time its a tragic joke what they have reduced star wars to and you know it wasnt for anything as noble as the story nope this was just to cash in before the original cast dies off but in many ways it might have been better off if the original cast didnt live long enough to see what became of their work in one of the greatest legends told in all its simplicity and complexity now reduced to a bad take on abracadabra and the general notion that bigger is better now it should by all rights get absolutely zero stars but it gets 25 stars entirely for this reason so mild spoiler alert there is one line in the movie that resonates even though i doubt anyone got it the fleet at the end is not a military it is just people not too far off the ideas behind rogue one this was a good decision and damn near the only one in the film that line is respectable even though they did nothing with it the other thing they get props for is the movie ends in the same exact way the original star wars begins before it was idiotically retitled episode 4 full circle life is a cycle this was a cycle hopefully never to be recycled but lets not go back into that so there yeah its not much to boost from none to half but remember that even through all my bickering its not like the movie isnt fun its well done well acted looks great just the story is so unbelievably stupid and the decisions they made on just how far the force can reach are preposterous and insulting to all who lived in an era where we got to see the originals on the big screen whatever circus this thing is it is not what star wars was to all of us back in the day we all tried to concentrate and lift rocks after seeing empire right back then that was the force spirituality and minorly moving objects around now the only thing we should be trying to do is use the force to move back in time and stop this nightmare from ever being made because apparently all we need to do to fix any problem is use the force in some new and totally made up way cool done right unfortunately probably not
Jan 19 2020,positive,it was time to put an end to this series story had a bunch of holes cliches and felt a bit rushed
Jan 19 2020,negative,i didnt like it at all it could have been good but its not 
Jan 19 2020,negative,everything was rushed story overall made no sense i dont care that this tried to clean up previous issues was a missed opportunity for a movie
Jan 19 2020,positive,i wanted to like it more than i did i kept wanting to feel emotionally impacted by what was happening but i never did i did not care for the last jedi when i first watched it but now i absolutely love it im hoping i will feel the same about this one
Jan 19 2020,positive,honestly i have no idea how rise of skywalker has gotten such poor reviews unlike the second movie in this trilogy it did not feel like i was dragging on every bit of this movie every scene help importance to the plot it was absolutely beautifully done the battle scenes were amazing to watch i was surprised for such a long movie it was over seemingly so quickly it has been a week since i have watched it and i am still thinking about how enjoyable it was
Jan 19 2020,positive,great story line and special effects
Jan 19 2020,positive,it was very good i always kept an eye on the movie the new character is a dream see the incredible special effects so they always stand out very well done in short i loved the whole movie super fan of the star wars saga
Jan 19 2020,positive,first parts of the movie were a little slow and confusing last half picked up and definitely tied the whole story together overall an entertaining movie though
Jan 19 2020,positive,this is the only good star wars movie
Jan 19 2020,positive,it was just okay the story was predictable
Jan 19 2020,negative,that was the worst of any star wars movie i have seen dont waste your money and find somewhere to watch it for free
Jan 19 2020,positive,very entertaining the movie was well done it used a lot of plays on the original scenes
Jan 19 2020,positive,it wasnt the best in the star wars franchise but it was a solid ending
Jan 19 2020,negative,the story line was weak and it seemed to drag  the attempts at comedy missed the mark unlike in the previous movies  this movie was a disappointment overall
Jan 19 2020,negative,this episode defies everything that made star wars great  it simply made the whole saga that precedes it pointless
Jan 19 2020,positive,it was better story line than the last jedi
Jan 19 2020,positive,the story line was underwhelming too many characters werent developed further it was entertaining but somewhat of a disappointment still an enjoyable way to spend a rainy afternoon
Jan 19 2020,negative,the special effects are the only thing that kept me from walking out of the theatre to do something more entertaining dont waste your money
Jan 19 2020,positive,very good lots of activity and surprises
Jan 19 2020,positive,the move was one of the best out of the last two i have recommended this already to many of my friends
Jan 19 2020,positive,easily the best star wars movie ever made you need to watch this now there was no point in the film where i was bored unlike every other star wars movie
Jan 19 2020,negative,completely undermines the developments previous star wars films made especially the sacrifices darth vader makes to end palpatine blatantly violates rules made clear in the lore complete lack of screenwriting proficiency poor humor to an extent that i personally did not hear one single laugh from the entire audience  failed fanservice broken writing poor pacing overshadowing the wellmade expertly crafted effectscgi to a point that the film should be redacted from canon
Jan 19 2020,positive,action scenes were good  plot line was pedantic with too many undeveloped subplots  the reyben love theme was not believable like a tiger changing his stripes tried to tie up all loose ends and put a bow on it  not a bad moviestory but not the depth and magnitude of the early films
Jan 19 2020,neutral,it comes and goes it dosent have a vibe attached to it it is unfortunately mediocre and un extravagant however the acting is great and of course its a beautiful looking movie
Jan 19 2020,neutral,very strange movie ive only seen it once but that should be enough it had a good start but became boring and quite ridiculous for a while way to much fan service to the force awakens fans palpatine alive is one stupid story idea the end was unsatisfactory rey had no real loss againben dying was meh if hes good now why not keep him alive ruined the franchise again in many ways only thing good about it was fixing stuff from tlj but even that was too much for a 2 hour movie lol should of planned the trilogy before tfa with gl as the story boarder you pinheads good one
Jan 19 2020,negative,well its over finally on behalf of the man babies thanks ryan for bringing us to this point what a mess for jj to inherit  essentially he had to restart the story in order to finish it there was no passing of the baton because as soon as ryan got it he ran from the stadium the movie is fast paced  to the point of silliness at some points  as jj has a lot to do in a very short time  but just as the force awakens was a reboot so too is the rise of skywalker  such a disappointment in this regard then there was the return of palpy and the quest to find him indiana jones style but at breakneck speed with entirely forgettable characters doing their bit for galactic equality with the smooch at the end i found the whole hidden underwater fleet of star destroyers sporting an oversized planet killing dingus slung beneath entirely unbelievable  but to respect your inner child endure it you must theres one final consolation in all of this bad lip reading will eventually make it memorable  watchable  in another form far far away im just overwhelmed with a feeling of pointlessness
Jan 19 2020,positive,after hearing about the negative reviews of the movie i thought for sure i wouldnt like it but after seeing the movie i was blown away and i was extremely emotional and now i think its one of the best star wars movies of all its one of the best next to the mandalorian tv series
Jan 19 2020,positive,best one of the recent trilogy and a great sendoff for the episodes as a whole
Jan 19 2020,negative,after watching this movie i felt like an idiot for having liked star wars i the first place
Jan 19 2020,negative,it is a complete mess  it sucks
Jan 19 2020,negative,ill say this it was the best piece of crap out of all of them
Jan 19 2020,positive,there is something for everyone in this i almost want to give this a four or four and half stars but it also merits five  you will experience desperation hope unrequited love loss love excitement distress mourning grief bereavement climax and joy
Jan 19 2020,negative,4050 plot holes just a pastiche  of epic visuals thrown together  the story makes no sense no sense of gravitas and the characters were utterly bland as per usual i wish i could erase it from my memory
Jan 19 2020,positive,spolier alert i will give up several things in the movie read on at yoru own discretion this movie was the type of movie i really needed to see twice so i saw it four times to be sure after the first viewing i left a little disappointed no miffed is a btter word and that was more a result of my expectations what i thought i should be seeing i saw it 2 days later and was a complete turnaround i had to ignore 3 areas of the film that i was disappointed in ok really just 2 major issues i have spoiler alert stop reading if you do not want to know so light speed skipping impossible light speed isnt like dusting crops boy then the ship in the middle of the desert has not been scavenged stolen or anything doesnt add up lastly docking and only a few stormtroopers in the bay to get past did not seem very realistic to me but i suppose it is possible in a new hope  they all were able to get off the falcon and i never really put that under a microscope so i can let everything else slide in the promotion of an open mind i found the movie was great after they reached kijimi so maybe a slow start but really awesome afterwards i do feel they packed too much into one movie some background in other areas would have been cool knights of ren emporers path the dyad i didnt even notice was mentioned until the 3rd screening etc etc should have been a tetrology if you ask me break the rules lucasfilms i subtract half a star for lack of focus on the entire picture to the audience i needed to find out more and then view again to really get it so seeing a few times really improved my enjoyment but all in all i loved it its a movie and it was entertaining all the way through even if i found some of the early scenes that i did not like as much
Jan 19 2020,negative,honestly a 2 year old could write a better plot with these characters
Jan 19 2020,positive,i enjoyed it jj did a lot to repair rians massively flawed movie and gave us back most of our star wars again it was very fun and i left with a smile
Jan 19 2020,positive,very suspenseful with a bittersweet and shocking ending
Jan 19 2020,positive,a wonderful conclusion to this star wars trilogy and nice recovery from the hiccup that the second film was rots had plenty of action beautiful sets and tied the stories of most of favorite characters to a satisfying closure i truly appreciated this film as a lifelong star wars fan
Jan 19 2020,positive,was entertaining and had alot of action  i was personally upset how the ending was
Jan 19 2020,positive,thr movie was perfect in everyway possible
Jan 19 2020,positive,i feel like this movie was a solid ending to this saga at pointe a bit of over dramatization but i came away likening it i feel like it kept the same flow from the first 2 enjoyed the battle scenes and plot would love to see again in the theaters
Jan 19 2020,positive,rise of the sky walker is a good overall movie but i feel like the main villain was killed too easily and it couldve been better
Jan 19 2020,neutral,crammed too much together i know theres no way to please everyone but seems like disney tried too hard
Jan 19 2020,positive,while tros is better than tlj and did find it enjoyable i am afraid that the whole trilogy was one massive missed opportunityone movie cannot fix a entire trilogy and while tros is better than tlj and does try to fix the problems from the previous film it does fall flat in some areas there were scenes i wished would happen in this movie and they didnt happen and also due to the fractured trilogy tros had to fix the mess in such a short amount of time that in reality it should of continued into another movie besides the criticisms i have i also did enjoy it and there was one scene in particular that gives the middle finger to a certain widely disliked part of tlj but overall tros is the better movie out of a bad trilogy and even though its not the best star wars movie it is enjoyable to watch
Jan 19 2020,positive,it aight incosistent and the overall arching narrative was all over the place but whatever the fight scenes were cool adam driver carried this movie
Jan 19 2020,positive,great movie you want star wars they give it to you fun ride with great visuals and great cast but once again the audience loves a movie with a woman lead that and gee the mostly male critics hate it wonder how that happened lame i give the movie 5 stars and the critics one star
Jan 19 2020,positive,was a good movie especially compared the last few newer ones that jj produced hard to believe its over though kind of sad too but it was a good ending to an amazing series of movies and shows
Jan 19 2020,positive,despite some sketchy plot points and a rather heavyhanded series of apparitions of the dearly departed i found it a very satisfying final film for the franchise i really enjoyed it and was repeatedly moved also thought visually it was quite beautiful lots of great character development and i liked the depth to the emotional story telling and basic arcs of the primary characters emotionally i think the deepest of all the films also loved the inclusion of a more diverse set of characters its about time
Jan 19 2020,positive,this the best star wars movies since the original star wars movies if you like the original star wars movies then you like this movie the movie was so good i think that they really nailed the story and it was worth the money 
Jan 19 2020,positive,loved the action scenes but i didnt care for the story line too many unanswered questions
Jan 19 2020,positive,i liked the constant action  i liked that a main evil character changed  i liked that several of the original characters appeared  gave the saga finality hence the rise of skywalker
Jan 19 2020,positive,a little rush but still very good
Jan 19 2020,negative,it was an entertaining movie but the star wars feel is completely gone
Jan 19 2020,positive,the end has come i enjoyed it some things though left me wondering
Jan 19 2020,positive,it was a good movie they left alot things unanswered tho from the previous film and the new one like how did palpatine survive
Jan 19 2020,positive,i have been with this series from the beginning its about hope and doing something extraordinary witt your life its about friends and family i loved this movie to the people out there who hate ityou have forgotten what star wars is about
Jan 19 2020,positive,i cried a few times 
Jan 19 2020,positive,fir the last series in the star wars saga it was ok  brought in a lot of things that you did not know before  the ending was kind of ok  a little disappointed
Jan 19 2020,positive,i love star wars and this one did not disappoint
Jan 19 2020,negative,the whole 789 saga is a joke
Jan 19 2020,negative,it was as good as it could be considering the aftermath of the last jedi which also sucked rian johnson singlehandedly ruined the entire sequel trilogy  even star wars itself  the biggest reason for it was killing snoke whos going to be a threat to the heroes then reys beat kylo ren every time well i guess we can bring palpetine back from the dead brilliant but wait how would that work i mean he fell an incredibly far drop  then exploded then the space station exploded how could he be alive well we can say the dark side of the force is the pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural  great but what does that mean it means get all the way off my back about it  never bring it up again  btw rotten tomatoes has frozen the audience score its been frozen steady at 86 since the first week it opened cheap shit to keep people interested in the movie it wont work
Jan 19 2020,positive,much better than i thought it would be 100  better than the last jedi which i hate
Jan 19 2020,positive,definitely wrapped things up if you loved the whole star wars saga youll love this
Jan 19 2020,positive,awesome ending to the trilogy
Jan 19 2020,negative,disney clearly does not understand star wars its not a terrible movie as a single movie but its a crime against nature as a star wars movie
Jan 19 2020,positive,the only thing i wish could be different is how many stories got tied up in a nice bow i really enjoyed the movie
Jan 19 2020,positive,i loved when rey stood up to emperor palpatine
Jan 19 2020,positive,story line was great nothing bad to say about it great story  emporer was creepy with no eyes
Jan 19 2020,positive,the movie wraps everything you know and love about star wars into one final masterpiece
Jan 19 2020,positive,great finish to an amazing trilogy
Jan 19 2020,negative,not infuriating like the last movie but still misses the mark too many new force tricks some of which dont make sense
Jan 19 2020,negative,it was absolutely especially seeing the cut stuff and the whole shoe horn redemption talk about a bland movie trying to be serious honestly the space battle well little bits of it and the fight on top of the star destroyer was cool
Jan 19 2020,positive,it was a good conclusion to the skywalker saga
Jan 19 2020,positive,critics be ded this movie is fun and heartfelt
Jan 19 2020,negative,i love star wars has a kid but the last 3 movies i hate them  i have no idea what they where think with the 3 movies
Jan 19 2020,positive,ive been a fan since 1977 and i hope the franchise stays alive forever
Jan 19 2020,positive,i felt like this movie encompasses more of what the star wars universe is about truly enjoyed hated the strobe effect but it was still cool looking
Jan 19 2020,negative,other than the fact that finn didnt have to mourn poe or rey that was an utter crapfest
Jan 19 2020,positive,as a star wars fan over many many many years and a reader of eu and new cannon bookscomics i absolutely loved this film it suffers from the same weaknesses as any of the other films in the franchise but it is star wars through and through
Jan 19 2020,negative,terrible end to the skywalker saga disneys new characters are one dimensional and boring the best part of the movie was that everyone in the theater was rooting for palpatine to win very funny actually
Jan 19 2020,positive,great wrap up for the franchise
Jan 19 2020,positive,it was epic was happy to see everyone again
Jan 19 2020,positive,i thought it was a very good ending to the movies was lots of action which was to be expected and i just felt it was a great way to end the legacy
Jan 19 2020,positive,i felt as though it could have been better but its still great
Jan 19 2020,negative,should have been edited to be much tighter it was very disneyfied  the droid smith was way too cutesy any edges to the film were ground down smooth we all knew the formula and how it would all turn out so any and all slop should have been removed for a more satisfying experience
Jan 19 2020,positive,may have been the last star wars but it is far far from over in that galaxy long ago and far far away        well done
Jan 19 2020,positive,a perfect conclution to my childhood skywalkers for life
Jan 19 2020,positive,loved it as a star wars fan my entire life it was excellent and a great way to end the original saga
Jan 19 2020,negative,it was just as bad as i heard it was going to be to be fair there were a few scenes that were nostalgic and reminded me it was a star wars movie however way too little too late so lets hope this end disney star wars mess we can all hope that maybe we might get some real star wars in the future if it ever gets out of disneys hands
Jan 19 2020,positive,a solid ending to the skywalker saga lots of action lots of surprises well worth it
Jan 19 2020,negative,this movie made the previous two retroactively worse which is an impressively bad accomplishment at least theres the mandalorian
Jan 19 2020,positive,loved the story line it was reminiscent of return of the jedi in some parts a wonderful ending to the story
Jan 19 2020,positive,great ending to great saga
Jan 19 2020,negative,im sorry that i have to give this movie a 2 star but the only thing that satisfied me the most is the cgi and the amount of editing and that is probably it the directors couldve worked better on the movie by adding more character development and not rushing the movie as the scenes keep switching which is making no sense i would probably like it if you took more time in making the movie and wait longer for it than watch this rushed unsatisfying star wars movie the fact that this movie has more bad reviews than the phantom menace should back up my answer most of the people when i was at the cinema hated the ending the most i could hear how at least 34 of the people said that they didnt like how rey called herself a skywalker and how ben solo wasnt added at the end scene i understand that it is reys decision to choose who she really wants to be but the fact that she doesnt link to them is really bugging the audience that ive been with at the cinema i personally didnt like the ending too as i felt lost and confused by what was going on and why did they have to end it here like that with such bad quality of work even the art concept looked better than the actual movie as it seemed there wouldve been more character development seeing one of the art concepts with rey in a dark cloak standing next to kylo ten who is sitting on his throne it also seemed more action based and more drama than the original movie  i dont want to keep this comment too long so ill end it here with other people explaining the further or missed details that i may have not said my original answer is that they couldve and they had a chance to make it better i wouldnt waste my time watching this movie especially looking for it in the theatres as around 1200 theatres were closed due to bad reviews have a good day
Jan 19 2020,positive,liked the story and of course cinematography along with the original music score great acting impressive
Jan 19 2020,negative,thank you disney and jj abrams for ruining my childhood heroes you turned this franchise into a joke stick to star trek jj and maybe poe could star in a dune sequel running spice
Jan 19 2020,negative,the people making these movies know nothing about star wars idiots
Jan 19 2020,negative,disappointing ending to the star wars series filled with plot holes and undeveloped ideas very cheesy and cringe worthy at many points in the film too much action without a break etc watch if your a star wars fan but do not expect anything great from this film
Jan 19 2020,positive,ok i liked this movie that does not mean i thought it was perfect i did mainly because i liked the way the rey and kyloben story was done i became intrueged with kylohis intensity and duality his sadness and anger in lonely isolation except when in the force dyad i saw the road of destruction caused by a misleading a powerful youth i liked reys development through it all her growth in strength defiance and power when trying to navigate a confusing mental dance with her friends as well as a menacing enemy with whom she has an irresistible and intense connection vasalating between fear and disdain attraction and hate i liked the nods to nostalgia seeing leah and luke and han again the references to previous characters and places were oh so satisfying as fan homage growing up with star wars as a child and looking at the prequels and sequels has been a fun ride we knew would end i left the theater sad for the loss of major characters but also the end of an era that said there were lots of plot holes and unanswered questions and unnecessary side stories too many minor characters without time to develop they tried to shove too much into this film the very ending was a contrivance for me i wanted more reylo more explanations and more backstory but that is a hard ask in a movie already bursting with exposition and palpatine out of nowhere we needed two more movies but they did not want to buck the trend of a trilogy of trilogies either that or suck it up and make the movie longer
Jan 19 2020,positive,it was what it was supposed to be
Jan 19 2020,negative,other than one or two moments the rest is a rehash of the old star wars
Jan 19 2020,positive,great movie  the critics are haters  i love rey and finn and think it ended exactly like it should have
Jan 19 2020,positive,if you love star wars you must see
Jan 19 2020,negative,hoo boy that sucked the writers had every opportunity to redeem the trilogy and tossed each one to the wind i get it rey is omnipotent couldnt they just have conveyed that in a single movie id say thanks for the fan service but obviously its just for disney to gloat and say look what im ruining
Jan 19 2020,positive,love the movie had a lot of heart  people need to get over their obsession with their fan fiction and just enjoy a movie
Jan 19 2020,positive,loved it also great to see carrie fisher
Jan 19 2020,positive,even though this movie wasnt perfect by a long shot it was still enjoyable to watch and a must see in my book adam drivers performance was legendary
Jan 19 2020,positive,the movie was great i liked the story line and it brought it all together  but i thought ren and noah were going to survive through it all but the sacrifice one has to make for the good of the whole
Jan 19 2020,positive,i love the relationships between characters great movie
Jan 19 2020,positive,people may complain about parts of the movie but all in all it was a fantastic movie experience and definitely made up for the sour taste the last jedi left i was happy and content with how the movie turned out and rather enjoyed the ending although i heard some people didnt if youre a fan of star wars ill bet youll atleast enjoy the experience this movie offers
Jan 19 2020,negative,terrible not just the worst star wars film but a downright horrible film experience from the script to the editing to the inconsequential plot lines that were just made up and stuck together it was like a nightmare it was a chore to watch my first thought once it was over was thank god i didnt buy popcorn
Jan 19 2020,positive,palpatine really this is like having the bigger death star in ep7
Jan 19 2020,positive,it was a fun roller coaster ride of a movie that left me buzzing at the end
Jan 19 2020,positive,not to bad hopefully they will leave it alone
Jan 19 2020,positive,good end to the story
Jan 19 2020,positive,star wars will forever be a complicated series this just adds to it i love all of the movies 
Jan 19 2020,positive,great like star wars movies always are
Jan 19 2020,positive,did not see the big reveal coming totally blown away action packed
Jan 18 2020,positive,die hard star wars fan who doesnt get joy from bagging new movies or disney get over it people
Jan 18 2020,positive,tros is a good movie but it has a ton of problems behind it but 100 times more memorable then the last jedi
Jan 18 2020,neutral,too muddied and lacked vision just felt like the mediocre ending to a mediocre trilogy based on the three most important movies in my life growing up it had a few moments of promise overshadowed by hours of brutal averageness most of all it squandered the potential of great characters doing heroic final acts for contrived and forcedly rehashed tropes and motivations of newly introduced characters
Jan 18 2020,negative,this movie is so bad i dont even know what to start actually i do what was that kiss
Jan 18 2020,positive,hey  i loved it star wars is always awesome 
Jan 18 2020,negative,a mess of a movie to end a mess of a trilogy its a damn shame
Jan 18 2020,negative,im just glad its over hopefully everyone will just forget about this embarrassment of a trilogy
Jan 18 2020,positive,star wars delivers again  any real star wars fan will like the movie
Jan 18 2020,positive,if youre a star wars follower since the 70s youll want to see the wrap up again that ties it all together sort of but mostly not a great movie but very enjoyable
Jan 18 2020,positive,nice setup for the continuation of the story good but could have been great
Jan 18 2020,positive,must see for star wars
Jan 18 2020,positive,seems like got season 8 and avengers endgame writers traded notes with tros writers
Jan 18 2020,positive,loved it  great action too bad its the last one i could keep going with all the movies  great tribute on the way there ended princess leigh
Jan 18 2020,negative,i guess im not a fan i was bored  chase fight chase fight chase yawn
Jan 18 2020,positive,jj did the franchise justing driver and ridley pit on a great performance compared to the last two episodes  ending could could of been a bit more exciting but all in all i believe it was a success
Jan 18 2020,positive,the ending was as it should be
Jan 18 2020,positive,a little bit cheesey at times some things i dont really like in terms of papaltine stuff but it is what it is  i wish they would have gone in some different directions that being said it was better than the last jedi
Jan 18 2020,positive,great story telling finally a good star wars movie do said it best happy
Jan 18 2020,positive,is it a fun movie yes does it destroy the lore to an irredeemable state yes if you ignore that disney has killed the star wars canon this is a fun movie just pretend dinsey wars is a different timeline and destroyed the ot and the prequels
Jan 18 2020,positive,awesome it was a perfect way to end this trilogy full of suspense and action from start to finish connects all the movies together
Jan 18 2020,positive,the movie was entertaining and the cgi was on point however  the story was lacking in many ways and felt unnecessarily convoluted
Jan 18 2020,positive,spectacular loved every minute
Jan 18 2020,positive,entertaining but nothing new here
Jan 18 2020,positive,i loved it it was very entertaining
Jan 18 2020,positive,visuals were good story can always be better but thats what the books are for
Jan 18 2020,positive,great film for the family
Jan 18 2020,positive,while its not as good as the originals i enjoyed it more than the last jedi
Jan 18 2020,positive,best movie in the series
Jan 18 2020,negative,they were so worried about walking back everything wrong with the last movie that they still didnt work out a compelling story with characters that i have any reason to care about
Jan 18 2020,positive,great ending to a great saga
Jan 18 2020,negative,terrible pacing nonsensical plot zero emotional depth and the most disappointing and anticlimactic end to a movie i have ever seen  nothing is ever actually explained and everything moves so quickly the characters much less the audience have no time to even react  the action is nonstop yet nothing ever actually feels like it matters  once it was over all i could think was what was the point  the legacy of the skywalker family is destroyed and ends in tragedy  every character and actor deserved better  the only good part of this movie and the best part of the whole trilogy was adam drivers portrayal of kylo renben solo and his dynamic with rey  daisy ridley also did a good job with what she was given but rey was never allowed to have any real flaws which made her less interesting as a character  this movie had so much potential and they squandered it
Jan 18 2020,positive,dont know why people dont like this movie it was seriously so fun and happy and exciting i loved it
Jan 18 2020,positive,love everything about this movie
Jan 18 2020,positive,considering the disaster the movie before this was they did a great job wrapping it up is it predictable yeah a bit but for a third part in a series it did a great job of tying it together there were no annoying useless plots like in the last jedi
Jan 18 2020,negative,very disappointing ending to a franchise that meant so much
Jan 18 2020,positive,excellent is all that can be said about this version
Jan 18 2020,positive,felt lazily written
Jan 18 2020,positive,they tied the story ends together nicely but left room for sequels
Jan 18 2020,positive,not perfect but brought back palpatine which was amazing
Jan 18 2020,positive,i loved it star wars fans are the absolute worst the single most toxic fanbase there is i really enjoyed the rise and the entire sequel trilogy for that matter
Jan 18 2020,positive,action packed surprise ending
Jan 18 2020,positive,i thought it was better than the last jedi i dont know if disney is going to be able to come back from that i dont think star wars will never be the same for me
Jan 18 2020,positive,loved it although i got a migraine afterwards would see it agin
Jan 18 2020,positive,it was good not great the vision that lucas brought to the original trilogy is absent and i think the biggest problem is that disney rushed these episodes out instead of taking their time and following lucass model of waiting three years between each episode this would have given writers more time and helped build the anticipation of fans
Jan 18 2020,positive,great end to star wars
Jan 18 2020,positive,storyline was great i was able to follow along you dont have to be a star wars junkie to understand what was going on
Jan 18 2020,positive,good movie but it feels like a remake of the last jedi good turns evil to the good side the ending was fantastic putting them to rest it ties all 9 movies together 
Jan 18 2020,positive,absolutely loved it  if you enjoy fun cinema all things star wars and dont feel the need to nit pick everything in life then this is a fantastic film
Jan 18 2020,positive,jj tried really hard to overcome the last movie  but the last jedi really messed things up  all in all not a bad movie but to close out the skywalker saga it could have been better
Jan 18 2020,negative,just when you thought it couldnt get worse it did
Jan 18 2020,positive,solid movie  nice appearances by the original cast members
Jan 18 2020,neutral,meh fell asleep 13 were the best star wars films imho nothing new to enjoy in this movie didnt like 79 missing natalie portman and sam jack to anchor the cast
Jan 18 2020,negative,that is a great way to ruin a series
Jan 18 2020,positive,typical just to past time
Jan 18 2020,positive,loved every part of the final sw film
Jan 18 2020,positive,could have been amazing everytime we hit a plot point of interest the story changed so many lose threads i felt like it was a pilot for 5 different disney tv shows  adam driver was amazing but needed more screen time as the main plot seemed rushed and sprinkled throughout the movie
Jan 18 2020,negative,makes the best out of the bad set up from the previous two films but its still an awful movie good action but characters are unlikable and apart from kylo i didnt care what happened to any of them
Jan 18 2020,positive,overall fantastic second favorite in the franchise nothing can beats episode 3 palpatine is the greatest villain of all time
Jan 18 2020,positive,simply awesome and best of the new trilogy especially in 3d
Jan 18 2020,positive,they played it so safe in all the frustrating disney ways and literal space fighting defies any logic that said it has all the elements that make star wars uniquely nostalgic and fun and that the hero this time around is a girl feels like awesome progress 
Jan 18 2020,positive,loved it ending in a positive way much better than episode 8
Jan 18 2020,negative,absolute horrible piece of trash not worth spending the money on wait for it to be streamed
Jan 18 2020,positive,loved every minute of it rey did another amazing job as did all the other characters amazing how they worked old footage of carrie fischer into the movie sorry to see the end of these characters in the saga
Jan 18 2020,positive,excellent end to the series 
Jan 18 2020,positive,i cant believe anyone would give this less than 5 stars if they did then they didnt like the original star wars movie and anyone who didnt like thatwell ive been waiting through all of the sequels and prequels for a movie that lived up to the original star wars movie which i saw live in the theater when it first came out people stood up and cheered at the end of the movie it was that good i had never seen an audience do that before this movie captured all of the spirit of the first one and was almost almost as good  i loved every minute of it and it gave me hope that the future movies would come back to this high level of quality and leave you feeling like you wanted to jump up and cheer it also had all of the quintessential sw moments and quips one liners etc that you expect and have come to love in sw films the audience in this new movie cheered and hollered and i was one of them it was fantastic the critics who didnt like it  my guess is they only like dark films with depressing sad endings as many critics do if youre looking for a great film with edgeofyourseat action honor heroes and hope and who couldnt use some of that now this is your movie absolutely loved it bravo
Jan 18 2020,positive,constant edge of your seat thrilling action
Jan 18 2020,negative,what a mess jedi can all of a sudden bring people back to life wtf
Jan 18 2020,positive,best we can hope for with the dumpster fire that was last jedi and the complete remake that was force awakens jj only had one movie to answer the questions he set up since rian johnson decided he wanted to make a solo movie and he did the best he could the moments with leia were rough to watch due to the cgi and the no explanation of olpalps was hard to swallow overall entertaining
Jan 18 2020,negative,a silly spectacle full plot holes with excellent visuals great for people who dont know or care about star wars and an absolute disgrace for serious fans of star wars
Jan 18 2020,negative,dumb end to a dumb trilogy
Jan 18 2020,positive,great story lots of action nostalgic moments reminiscent of first movie
Jan 18 2020,negative,felt more like a star wars movie than the last but they tried so hard to go in an unexpected direction that they ignored the nature flow that should have been the last two movies
Jan 18 2020,negative,its better than tlj but thats not saying much the first act of this movie struggles with plot exposition as it force fills hole in the plot created by the previous movie the return of spoiler felt like a cheap cash grab its clear this disney is using nostalgia to sell tickets  with the george lucas version of the ending this was salvagable however the ending we go was unsatisfying for everyone  fans of all of the trilogies will mostly agree it manages to end the skywalker bloodline take away any meaning to anakins story arc and provide an unsatisfying end to the new trilogy
Jan 18 2020,positive,i liked the movie  much better than the prequels  probably middle of the pack in the skywalker saga
Jan 18 2020,positive,nice close to the trilogy
Jan 18 2020,positive,best movie in the sequel trilogy checks every box for me though the main box for me was having anakin play an important part in the movie since the saga films are supposed to be his story and they halfassedly check that box by only having him spoiler alert appear as a disembodied voice they technically checked that box but there is an emphasis on technically other than that great movie
Jan 18 2020,positive,im a star wars fan i liked this movie so much i saw it twice great story  looks great on the big screen not to mention the music which is also great
Jan 18 2020,negative,very below average imho i am a star wars fan 
Jan 18 2020,negative,such a waste of such a great opportunity
Jan 18 2020,positive,awesome love it the ending is unexpected
Jan 18 2020,positive,best episode of the new trilogy
Jan 18 2020,positive,far better than expected
Jan 18 2020,negative,these three movies had potential for being good somewhere under the terrible writing and non engaging screenplay there was gold that could have happened but it didnt and this movie sucked it did have one or two funny jokes in it i guess
Jan 18 2020,positive,what an ending and yet they still left me wanting g another story
Jan 18 2020,positive,better than what i expected better than the previous one i laughed i was not thinking too hard abut the story and i have enjoyed it
Jan 18 2020,positive,liked the first one better  but was ok 
Jan 18 2020,positive,it was very good for what it was up against
Jan 18 2020,positive,finished on a strong note 
Jan 18 2020,positive,im a fanatic and i loved this ending the whole thing start to the rise of skywalker saw it twice once imax 3d and once plain 3d which is of the best quality ive ever seen  the movie is thrilling complete easy to follow and ties all nine episodes up beautifully it leaves plenty of room for rogue future movies without leaving you feeling things were left out in the three trilogies   the acting was terrific best of all 9 general organa  princess leia  carrie fisher masterfully lives adding what probably wouldnt have been less storyline than originally planned there were maybe just a couple of odd artificial forced scenes that were dupes from earlier episodes  too short to detract and im pretty sure the catch in her comrades voices when they addressed her were real for obvious reasons   maybe best of all for me whose friends and family are not sw buffs this is fully enjoyable as a standalone star force adventure without having seen any other episode or knowing much about the plot arc though it helps to know a little   it has all kinds of easter eggs and homages maybe more than usual look for references to dune twilight zone battlestar galctica 2001 a space odyssey hitchhikers guide to the galaxy triffidtrump star trek and all the other sw episodes among others   go before the postfinal order arrives and bans this from the big screen
Jan 18 2020,positive,satisfying end for this trilogy the movie revisits all actors and brings a fulfilling end even though carrie fishers scenes seem unnatural and out of context the movie deserves some credit
Jan 18 2020,positive,fantastic comeback from the abomination that was ep viii  its a solid stand alone film and utilizes the entire timeline  what the film needed was more story development  ep xi was not rushed persay but it felt like too much time was spent explaining everything that was going on  it would have benefited from a ep viii that built up to xi
Jan 18 2020,positive,i dont know much about movies film making wise but i do know a little about acting scene direction and overall screenplay this movie was indeed an extremely improved storyline over the previous episode there was no obvious evidence of political agenda in this movie and to an extent the outcome the characters come to doesnt make them foolish beyond measure what i did not like was the theme used about choosing your family with the specific character chosen for that message its just a pet peeve but a character should not look like a clone of another character and barely resemble the parents  i recognize with the loss of carrie there was some script tweaks for her character as well but it was amazing to see how far weve come with special effects and such it was also nice to see some of the original star wars cast return not just for a cameo but for a significant part of the plot line
Jan 18 2020,positive,absolutely loved it watched it in 3d that slow moving ocean though sad to see ben go as i loved his character rey is fantastic to look at in action will watch again
Jan 18 2020,positive,im among the few that has somewhat enjoyed the last two previous films but this overall was a bit disappointing has some great scenes and moments in it but just felt a bit rushed and disney didnt have a clear path on this new trilogy as a whole
Jan 18 2020,positive,it was an amazing end to one of the all time best movie series
Jan 18 2020,positive,wonderful story ending the star wars series great cinematography and music interplays with great acting and it was great to see old characters interspersed in it
Jan 18 2020,positive,plot wise a bit loose and weak however the story played heavy emotionally and thats where it all came together all in all i would give it a 78 out of 10
Jan 18 2020,positive,loved everything about it
Jan 18 2020,negative,let me start by saying i didnt just see the movie and come here to bash it i sat with it and thought long and hard about this to not have an emotional reaction and attack people so here i am weeks after i seen it with my thoughts so lets begin this mile they tried to use nostalgia fan service and a fast pace to hide and speed by the incoherent plot that was unbearable at times not having george lucas actually collaborating and overseeing these movies has hurt a great deal imagine in return of the jedi if key plot points were retconning empire strike back and not just retconning retconning in the way it comes off as an apology to the audience or just completely ignoring the previous movie you cant let fans dictate the art we arent filmmakers so what we want isnt necessarily going to be good this felt like the biggest budgeted fan made film ever and not a good one what they decided to do with characters i didnt enjoy or they would start to do something i was intrigued and hype and ruin the landing for me firstly lets start with leia shouldnt have been in this movie i didnt like the end of her character and trying to create scenes around scenes previously shot for other movies is stupid and not a good filmmaking decision palpatine made zero sense and i was excited going in but once i got him it felt hollow and like anakins sacrifice were disregarded i began to walk out of the film at the end quietly not to interrupt others movie watching experience but the audience i was in also wasnt too happy and stood at the exit to see the end a lackluster disappointing end that defacates on the star wars saga each trilogies fans and the new fans of this trilogy all in one i dont know if a jj cut would fix his decisions in what we did or just extend this shawshank redemption like escape from the saga walking through feces just to get to the mandalorian im not going to protest or attack people for enjoying a movie im not going to sign a petition to get the trilogy remade with georges vision the ship has sailed and this is our boat we sail into the future of star wars with its like if the titanic hit two icebergs and the captain is telling us the boats fine as you see the water pouring in at times i think its time to take that lifeboat and leave star wars behind disney has taken my life long love with star wars and in the process of trying to wring our every dollar from me have also squeezed my love out for it as well maybe because i stay because im stubborn or hopeful seeing how the marvel universe is run or even dave filoni and jon favreau making something that feels like star wars but also new and refreshing that pays homage and moves forward i guess they are my only hope since i cant count on the head of lucasfilm to understand and be able to steer this ship ill hang out by the band and enjoy these songs as the ship sinks
Jan 18 2020,positive,loved it saw it in 3d
Jan 18 2020,positive,my son and i absolutely loved it
Jan 18 2020,positive,it was a very fun movie  no great storytelling but if you enjoy the characters and like a fun popcorn movie this is for you
Jan 18 2020,positive,good story continue on from the past movies lots of action and great feel good moments
Jan 18 2020,negative,it was a weak entry for the trilogy i wish they didnt try to do what they did trying to one up what happened in the last film and trying to please every star wars fan was a bad idea i wish they had gone in a different direction but this is what we got and its an okay movie as is but one has to wonder what if
Jan 18 2020,negative,somewhere in there was a 3 star movie if it had been an hour or so  2 hours and 20 minutes was too long for all the dead people to resurrected and then go away without a plot
Jan 18 2020,positive,wow awesome loved it
Jan 18 2020,positive,wow what an ending had to see it go but damn
Jan 18 2020,negative,off track not enough action
Jan 18 2020,positive,id watch this at least 100xs  so great
Jan 18 2020,positive,honestly it is disappointing but exciting at the same time  although it is a shame that the skywalker saga ends in such a lazy way
Jan 18 2020,positive,i saw it in 3d and that just gave an extra dimension and depth to the movie
Jan 18 2020,positive,it was a great movie sad to see it end
Jan 18 2020,positive,a big lack of imagination and creativity but still a solid movie and a proper ending to this trilogy
Jan 18 2020,negative,the first half of the movie was just ok and the second half was just awful
Jan 18 2020,positive,best one in a long long time
Jan 18 2020,positive,it was fine i had more fun watching it than the last jedi overall this trilogy was disappointing 
Jan 18 2020,positive,lots of action a few surprises
Jan 18 2020,positive,very fun in its own right but has to throw at least two movies worth of plot and exposition in order to wrap things up  why they didnt plotscript the whole trilogy from the start is mind boggling
Jan 18 2020,positive,it was about as good as you could expect while trying to wrap up a series as large as star wars i think there were too many loose ends going into this last film to really expect it to be exceptional but it was well made and had some good moments
Jan 18 2020,positive,this is an amazing movie dont let socalled movie critics tell you otherwise great closing to the saga
Jan 18 2020,positive,me and my son liked it all he did was ask question about the old start wars movies so im buying all the star wars movies and me and him are going to watch so he can see how much these people have aged and see what there role played for these movies
Jan 18 2020,positive,im huge star wars fan  this is good  
Jan 18 2020,positive,as a movie it is good however as a saga it is awful
Jan 18 2020,negative,a desecration of the previous trilogies numerous plotholes  throughout the movie tragic ending no hope no happiness nothing at all
Jan 18 2020,positive,best star wars wrap up are we finally done now
Jan 18 2020,positive,i liked it more than i disliked it but i totally get why some people will hate this movie with a seething passion so many conveniences taken so many inconsistencies so many deus ex machina coming to save the day it wants to think its clever but its not  its dull and hamhanded and coasting on the good graces of our love of a franchise that deserved better than this that said beautiful to look at moving at points sometimes radiant with possibility and not anywhere near as bad as what some people are saying
Jan 18 2020,positive,great movie a little bit slow in story line at times
Jan 18 2020,positive,it was great loved it
Jan 18 2020,negative,terrible movie  half of it was a complete mess where i couldnt tell what was going on the characters ran after macguffin after macguffin stumbled into insane coincidences and in general made no sense  the other half was more coherent but made just as little sense  the movie does not just break star wars history it contradicts itself  characters forget their own abilities in the middle of the movie suddenly and conveniently discover brand new ones never seen before  entire subplots are lost altogether  do yourself a favor and wait for it to come out on streaming service or probably disney  if you must know what happens read the spoilers on the internet  you will be far more satisfied and its free
Jan 18 2020,positive,loved it loved the homage to carrie fisher and to the first movie episode4
Jan 18 2020,negative,worst star wars movie ever i dare say this was worse than the last jedi many of you may disagree so let me make my case at least the ep 8 was a well made movie but terribly made starwars movie it ignored everything from the past or the starwars world that george lucas created if you can ignore that it was a starwars movie it was a wellmade movie however this is a horribly made movie all it does is to clean up the mess from ep 8 and shove people with nostalgic moment and the way they go about it feels so artificial and doesnt flow naturally it feels like a fanfiction on top of all that this movie is trying to close this saga of starwars and tries to give each character its moment in doing so they put too much information in one movie of my entire life this was the first closeto3 hour flim that i watched that felt too rushed and short there are many more flaw that i or other can add to this flim but these are some of the main reasons why i hated this flim director shouldve remembered that this is a movie first and starwars second i can barely call it a flim the only people i would recommend this flim are the ones who enjoy large scale blockbuster scifi action with zerocare about plots oh actually adam drivers acting was fantastic disney just failed to use that in this flim
Jan 18 2020,positive,love star wars and kylo ren not crazy about the ending could have been better
Jan 18 2020,positive,a satisfying ending but glad its all finally over unless youre a diehard fan save it for netflix
Jan 18 2020,positive,honestly this is a 3 star movie however it gets an extra star for trying to fix what an atrocity episode 8 was and another star for making me not hate star wars anymore  being a long time star wars fan i was hugely disappointed by how the last movie almost destroyed 40 years of star wars canon  this movie which essentially has almost two movies worth of content crammed into one did an admirable job in both trying to finish the main story arc answer key questions built up from back in episode 7 and fix most of the damages done in episode 8  sure some of the new story elements really came out of left field but considering what a mess the last movie made it was a miracle this movie was able to accomplish and was able to mostly salvage the trilogy  i can unabashedly say that most of this movie was a fan service  and as a fan i thank the film makers for caring and listening to the voices and feed backs of true star war fans
Jan 18 2020,positive,even though it was the last movie in the series they definitely left it open for more prequels and spin offs
Jan 18 2020,negative,either you like it or you dont theres no middle ground on this one i didnt like it the only saving grace was the battle scenes thats why it gets two stars from  me if it was on tv i wouldnt have a problem getting up and getting something to eat or drink while it was on and not waiting for a commercial maybe its a generation thing due to the fact i was fortunate enough to see a young luke skywalker start this all off the wonder of it all the excitement it seems to be lost in this latest episode my wife literally read the entire movie as we watched  as if she directed it herself no surprises in this one no wow no that was amazing go in expecting nothing and youll be happy go in expecting something and sadly youll be let down just my humble opinion
Jan 18 2020,negative,too much flawed science logic suspension of disbelief can only go so far i was on board for the first half of the movie but once they got to the endor moon it went off the rails with ridiculousness
Jan 18 2020,positive,ive never been a big fan of the star wars films my main gripe being a lack of depth and an overromanticising narrative i felt rogue one cured that and thoroughly enjoyed its dark ending rise of skywalker sort of uses an old villain as a deus  ex machina to add a much needed sense of purpose and revelation visually amazing and great homages to the original trilogy one of which being the destruction of a planet  i totally stan but all in all lacking on its own direction of point and use of prestige characters that seemed in retrospect on death row
Jan 18 2020,positive,my favorite of the last three movies action packed and good story line
Jan 18 2020,neutral,this is definitely this trilogys return of the jedi for better or worse mostly worse its as much a disney theme park ride as a movie as we are whisked from one action set piece to another theres a little character development for rey but others such as lando are just putting in an appearance still its enjoyable enough if you dont think about it too much as is generally the case with anything star wars
Jan 18 2020,positive,a good movie a lot of storylines were wrapped up questions answered and a great end to the saga as long as they keep jj abrams on it star wars will do just fine
Jan 18 2020,positive,not sure what everyone disliked about this one i found it to be a great closing high stakes action sequences lots of drama i had a blast
Jan 18 2020,positive,its star wars you know what the restaurant is it has good food stop disagreeing the food and compliang that there is to much garlic and to litte arugala
Jan 18 2020,positive,like sewed a lot of things together and positive messages dislike loud and flashing lights a little over the top little too creepy
Jan 18 2020,positive,great movie definitely in my opinion a great end to an era hopefully its not the last star wars film ever because i still want to see more star wars forever
Jan 18 2020,positive,lots of good action  good storyline
Jan 18 2020,positive,lots of actionbut hard to follow
Jan 18 2020,positive,cinematography is superb characters are engaging colorful and believable musical score elaborates the whole filmthe film as a whole is well worth th time and price of admission
Jan 18 2020,positive,i loved how all the story lines throughout the galaxy far far away were wrapped up so satisfactorily this was the perfect finish to an epic series
Jan 18 2020,negative,take this movie to interrogation room 6 this movie is a joke
Jan 18 2020,positive,the storyline and the adaption of the deleted scenes with carrie fisher is exceptional  they were able to tie in so many previous locations and characters was great  the perfect way to end the skywalker story and i dont know if it could have been done better truly the end of an era
Jan 18 2020,positive,it was a little better than the other two but not by much
Jan 18 2020,positive,good movie too much fluffextra stuff too long wanted a little something more

Jan 18 2020,positive,loved how the film came full circle and closed the skywalker loop
Jan 18 2020,positive,better than episode 8 no doubt this is probably my favorite of the sequel movies its good but i felt that most of the movie was taken up with fixing the many mistakes of the last film
Jan 18 2020,neutral,there was nothing new in this movie they used the same old storyline
Jan 18 2020,positive,great conclusion to the saga
Jan 18 2020,positive,finally a real star wars movie  rise of skywalker provides an acceptable end to the trilogy which is no small task  it also effectively negates rian johnsons abomination
Jan 18 2020,neutral,meh is about the best i can say about it probably the best we could hope for after the last movie
Jan 18 2020,positive,the callbacks were nice and i personally liked the ending but everything felt too convenient im sad to see such a pivotal franchise in my life go out with a whimper rather than a bang
Jan 18 2020,positive,i liked this movie plenty of action and storey line
Jan 18 2020,positive,solid felt a bit rushed even in 25 hours interesting plot twists but safelyplayed in order to try pleasing everyone

Jan 18 2020,positive,solid finale to the series
Jan 18 2020,positive,visually stunning wellacted and heartwarming but not a satisfying ending to the iconic saga

Jan 18 2020,positive,best movie on the trilogy by far
Jan 18 2020,positive,love it excited to see if there will be more
Jan 18 2020,positive,could have been amazing movie instead it was a fast paced mess that gave the viewer 0 time to feel anything
Jan 18 2020,positive,i love this movie to me it was the best one
Jan 18 2020,neutral,im not one to say that the new star wars films ruined the originals but they have made it not fun to talk about star wars this film is ok its got good things and bad things i really cant say more because theres nothing else to say
Jan 18 2020,negative,ridiculous ruined return of the jedi
Jan 18 2020,negative,unimaginative and lazy a sad ending to a 9 movie franchise

Jan 18 2020,positive,loved it another hit in the star wars saga
Jan 18 2020,positive,i loved this movie it was a purely awesome closing
Jan 18 2020,positive,i enjoyed this movie i saw it in the 4dx version with the 3d glasses it was so much fun and be prepared to be pulled around hit with mist and tapped on the shoulder with every move and action scene in the movie the manager was great  this theatre which contributed to my overall experience also and i am going again for another action packed show you should too
Jan 18 2020,negative,at least it was better then the last jedi
Jan 18 2020,positive,really good action throughout storyline was easy to follow not a dry moment
Jan 18 2020,positive,better than the abysmal last jedi but story was too convoluted and convenient
Jan 18 2020,positive,like the story and good to see the skywalker legacy end as a beginning
Jan 18 2020,negative,as garbage as the last two
Jan 18 2020,positive,loved the subtle humor but not the deaths at the end why

Jan 18 2020,positive,the movie was really good
Jan 18 2020,positive,very interesting could actually make another to continue the saga
Jan 18 2020,positive,this was a good send off to a really great franchise it does and doesnt retcon the things from the last jedi the nostalgia callbacks are great and the effects look really great this will be a fun time for star wars fans
Jan 18 2020,positive,awesome ending and leading up to the end finished the story really well
Jan 18 2020,positive,completes the process
Jan 18 2020,positive,ignore all the haters it has very great moments amazing fights and that ship battle at the end was amazing still not as good as the empire strikes back
Jan 18 2020,positive,not a movie for those who have not seen the other movies in the series   even if they have been seen i would recommend going through the last few to pick up the threads could and should have been better
Jan 18 2020,negative,tries to be too many things
Jan 17 2020,positive,loved every minute intense and all the good feels
Jan 17 2020,positive,you could tell there were some issues with cf passing away to where she was gonna be used more  just go in open minded you will enjoy it i loved this movie definitely had to spend too much of it patching issues from 8 but i loved it  as an 80s kid it gave me the feeling i had when i saw the first trilogy   im not saying its perfect but i was a person that didnt hate 8 but i also didnt enjoy near as much  great story told imo and if people are complaining about this should think back to episode 1 when that came out  i think a directors cut of this will help some of the reasons people disliked it to make this right it could of been split into 2 movies go see it sit back it deserves a big screen
Jan 17 2020,negative,come on really that bad with so much money is a failure of humanity
Jan 17 2020,positive,didnt like the story line  felt sloppy  meh
Jan 17 2020,negative,complete mess of all the stories you could tell in the sw universe and this is the best they could come up with
Jan 17 2020,positive,it was amazing a little bit rushed i would like to see a directors cut im a huge star wars fan
Jan 17 2020,positive,the movie was absolutely amazing
Jan 17 2020,positive,amazing experience well worth the wait
Jan 17 2020,negative,so many unanswered questions ben solo and luke deserved better it was all over the place not organized ill pretend it never happened
Jan 17 2020,negative,rather sht in my hand and clap than watch this again not the worst of the trilogy though
Jan 17 2020,positive,loved it a true star wars movie if youre a fan its a must see
Jan 17 2020,negative,maybe dont kiss ben at the end and id hate it less
Jan 17 2020,positive,a bit corny and honestly im glad that series is over 5 sequels too many
Jan 17 2020,positive,it has been a long journey and it ended well i love the character of rey a smart twist to the story
Jan 17 2020,positive,it was really great
Jan 17 2020,negative,so boring  rinse and repeat story line   transparently injected pc nonsense into the film  how many times do rey and ben connect   ridiculous   completely threww away star wars cannon  bitter disappointment  worse than the previous film  id rather watch attack of the clones than either of these last two star wars films  still not as bad as the force awakens though
Jan 17 2020,positive,incredible amazing
Jan 17 2020,positive,i have watched each one in the theater and i liked this movie
Jan 17 2020,negative,clinically braindead storytelling
Jan 17 2020,positive,i truly enjoyed this movie  i thought it did a great job wrapping up the star wars series  the only issue that i had with it is how much they covered  there was definitely 2 movies worth of material in this one movie i look forward to seeing the directors cut i really dont understand what critics expected to see  ive heard some say they were pandering to the fans   well yeah rolling eyes its star wars
Jan 17 2020,negative,wholeheartedly disappointing this film works dubiously hard to assert that the sequel trilogy has no plan purpose or message for the series as a whole
Jan 17 2020,negative,everyone knew kylo would be redeemed but i always thought it would be because he learned something not because he got his ass kicked enough i thought these movies were building a new world but this one completely rebuilds the empire again with no explanation its like the sudden introduction of a massive clone army but with none of the explanation from episode 2 but also in addition to the army its the entire infrastructure of the army as well and massive technological leap forward with no build up its all of the worst things about the prequels with the shitty banter of the new trilogy worst of both worlds and i liked 7  8 i just thought they would eventually build to something other than the good guys killing a massive absolutely evil army
Jan 17 2020,positive,loved it amazing ending the an epic story
Jan 17 2020,positive,just ok not how i expected the franchise to end long time fans of the film might be disappointed 
Jan 17 2020,positive,good movie sound was bad at times
Jan 17 2020,negative,bad conclusion palpatine is worthless action is bad and boring

Jan 17 2020,positive,best one out of the last 3 for sure
Jan 17 2020,positive,it explained a lot and didnt explain some personally i loved it kidosnto the tech and graphics team the story line stayed within the saga all around great show im looking forward to seeing it again it also was a plus to see the movie then go to disney hollywood studios and visit galaxys edge  awesome
Jan 17 2020,neutral,the movie had some great parts but they were all mixed into a mess  too much going on and not enough real believable drama developed
Jan 17 2020,negative,felt like the movie tried both to erase the last jedi but failed to conclude a story they never began
Jan 17 2020,positive,entertaining and visually stunning flawed in some respects but it does not fail to keep me entertained throughout
Jan 17 2020,positive,critics smucks the lot of them listen to the audience its the film we wanted and an awesomely fitting conclusion to the saga storyline begun in the original trilogy loved it thank you jj and the cast
Jan 17 2020,positive,loved it great ending to the trilogy
Jan 17 2020,positive,loved it  visual effects deserve an oscar
Jan 17 2020,positive,best of the series  well done great story line

Jan 17 2020,neutral,it had some good scenerys but it was skip jumping mess all over the place rushed to fill the void
Jan 17 2020,positive,more of the same i still enjoyed though
Jan 17 2020,positive,absolutely incredible
Jan 17 2020,positive,it was a great movie it was a great way to end the series i think  the actors did a great job and carrie fisher was amazing
Jan 17 2020,negative,im sending disney my ophthalmologist bill for the reconstructive surgery ill need on my eyes after the most eye rolling ive ever performed in a movie when a giant snake is the saving grace to redeem one of the biggest plot holes in the history of movies you know you need to hit the writing room again
Jan 17 2020,positive,i thought it was a good experience special effects were amazing as always it was hard to follow these new characters being introduced with no back story to make me care about them scenes moved so quickly that i didnt have enough time to comprehend and think about what happened
Jan 17 2020,neutral,this was my least favorite of all the star wars sequel trilogy it is worth seeing just because it is such a big part of culture but wouldnt rewatch and didnt feel like it added anything to the series
Jan 17 2020,negative,i almost fell asleep it was boring and the parts with leia felt weird also i felt like kylo ren deserved a better ending
Jan 17 2020,neutral,it was ight kinda cheesy definitely not anything like the originals 
Jan 17 2020,negative,i love star wars but this movie was an overall big let down
Jan 17 2020,positive,i think the critics are crazy  this was a great finale to the trilogy  i know it wasnt perfect but i really liked the parentage twist the continued reykylo story and the way it all came together in the end  nicely done i went twice already and plan to go again  if there was a disappointing episode in this trilogy it was last jedi
Jan 17 2020,positive,fannostalgia driven film that can be at times quite predictable but genuinely an amazing culmination to a blast of a saga
Jan 17 2020,positive,slow at first but picked up towards the end
Jan 17 2020,positive,it was an amazing movie
Jan 17 2020,neutral,it felt rushed and not thought through like they had a deadline to get it out and they didnt really know what to do with the story didnt feel like the flow fit in with the other movies in the series
Jan 17 2020,positive,easily the best out of the sequels while thats not saying a whole lot it does offer much more interesting character development and original star wars throwbacks while the story feels extremely processed and exactly like a worse version of return of the jedi it still has very decent action sequences best sequel
Jan 17 2020,positive,it felt kind of rushed in the beginning but it had the star wars feeling i wanted to see it was a pretty decent conclusion to the sequel trilogy
Jan 17 2020,positive,i love predicting the next scene in a movie but my predictions when watching the rise of skywalker were way off base which is exhilarating  so fresh definitely a must see
Jan 17 2020,positive,absolutely fantastic especially considering how much story had to be told due to the middle films lack of story telling
Jan 17 2020,positive,it was a good movie it kinda felt rushed in some scenes they could have did better over all i liked it
Jan 17 2020,positive,a fitting finale to the skywalker saga plenty of action between the force and the dark side returns of favorites of original trilogy
Jan 17 2020,positive,a little corney in spots but still very good
Jan 17 2020,positive,great movie emotion from beginning to end
Jan 17 2020,positive,i thought this was the best of the new trilogy and i loved how they took a jab at last jedi what a mess  i loved it when luke says you need to treat a jedis weapon with more respect  overall lots of fun and it was star wars
Jan 17 2020,positive,great movie but i felt like it just had some unrealistic scenes which kind of took away the 55 for me
Jan 17 2020,positive,following up the narrative disaster of tlj that was infested with bad humor and lazyconvenient story telling i think tros was a good rebound for the franchise rather than try to run with the scraps that were left from tlj of protagonists we dont care about a cause we cant really get behind and antagonists we dont respect this movie scrapped tlj which i think was the right direction tlj felt useless as i watched it and indeed it was  moving to this movie in a vacuum i thought it was good but not great there were still some cringe moments but some of those just needed to correct tlj such as lukes reappearance and his lightsaber retort bringing palpatine back undermines the direction of the first two movies as well but i get they needed some conflict because snoke fell to peakaboo foolishness and kylo ren was made out into some laughable emo kid   its hard to review this moving in a vacuum actually because it was burdened by needing to start over and start fresh while also wrapping up a trilogy on its own its just a silly popcorn movie jumping from one action scene to the next there are some great set pieces and a ton of fan service to help set this apart from other popcorn flicks no deep thinking here and nothing adding to the mythology of star wars beyond maybe the sith auditorium that wasnt really fleshed out   it was a pretty fun low stakes movie that felt like a masterpiece given its recently soiled source material
Jan 17 2020,negative,predictable cheese fest with no coherent plot
Jan 17 2020,negative,the movie isnt worth watching its choppy relies heavily on fan service and tries too hard to please everyone
Jan 17 2020,neutral,convoluted and rushed and adds to nearly none of the plot lines set up by the previous film but it has some good star wars fun
Jan 17 2020,positive,quintessential star wars same story line different players good vs evil good wins over devils surrogate ultimate evil is defeated by good good rides off into the sunset that said the cinematography is grand the action mesmerizing and the acting awesome one of the better star wars bit not my absolute favorite worth the evening out for sure
Jan 17 2020,negative,stupid story again so cant recommend it but you already know if youre gonna watch it
Jan 17 2020,negative,not good no direction and unsatisfying
Jan 17 2020,positive,ending was bad but the rest of the movie was great  ben should have been the last living skywalker now that would have brought all 9 movies full circle with the perfect ending
Jan 17 2020,positive,love the franchise love the characters and cast great way to end the skywalker saga huge star wars fans even collected star wars rise of skywalker funko pops
Jan 17 2020,positive,good ending to this trilogy
Jan 17 2020,positive,i think this was a great ending  to the star wars legend lots of surprises
Jan 17 2020,positive,fun popcorn flick doesnt feel like it belongs as a skywalker film
Jan 17 2020,positive,could have been better and felt rushed but all in all i enjoyed the movie i never got into the characters so that has lacked since they came out with these movies still worth watching when youve seen all the others
Jan 17 2020,neutral,great visual movie but way too long and slow paced
Jan 17 2020,neutral,too many extra characters with very little main character development it was predictable and boring at times kylos character was nearly useless to the story especially since rey is completely overpowered overall i give this a meh mostly because of luke and kylo scene
Jan 17 2020,positive,great story i wish it would have been longer to fill in more gaps there was a lot to fix from the last jedi
Jan 17 2020,positive,the film brings the saga to a great ending while being authentic to its beginnings and to all of the characters we have come to love  the tribute to the late carrie fisher in the remembrance in the death of princess  leia organa was very touching
Jan 17 2020,positive,avid  sw fan that i am was a bit disappointed plenty of action but it seems like too much was put in to tie it all together  but still it was entertaining and ill still see it again to see what i missed in previous viewing
Jan 17 2020,positive,the skywalker saga ended and the end is good in my opinion it is a good conclusion to a 40 year old story some of the best star wars moments were picked up again a must see for a star wars fan this is what star wars become but i am fine with it excited to see more of it
Jan 17 2020,negative,disney has done what appeared impossibledestroyed the star wars brand this movie was a compilation of bad sword fights insipid dialogue and weak character development
Jan 17 2020,positive,jj did a great job with the movie it kinda fix the problem from the last jedi really happy with the film
Jan 17 2020,positive,kinda wish it would lead to another trilogy great trilogy and ending in its own right but nothing compares to the 2nd trilogy spoiler love the part when luke used the force and lifted his xwing fighter out of the sea so ray can use it i got chills cause it reminded me of the return of the jedi and yoda another passing of the baton
Jan 17 2020,positive,confusing at first ending just didnt feel right
Jan 17 2020,negative,why did you destory the legacy of anakin and luke for the sake of making ray who could have been one of the best female leads in modern history a mary sue and bland as heck   daisy ridley is a talented actress and you used her on this  i only hope star wars can cut this latest trilogy off and call it non cannon i certainly dont consider disneys films as sw cannon
Jan 17 2020,negative,i think its better to change the subtitle of the movie as a example rise of palpatine like something
Jan 17 2020,negative,it made the original 3 movies pointless
Jan 17 2020,positive,while the film falls prey to lazy writing tropes it is still very enjoyable the visuals are stunningly gorgeous the sith are darker and more frightening than ever before
Jan 17 2020,positive,awesome  wraps up nicely and left me wanting more
Jan 17 2020,positive,fun to watch good closure to the saga
Jan 17 2020,negative,hated it has nothing of what i loved about star wars
Jan 17 2020,positive,it was so amazing it had me on my toes i would watch again
Jan 17 2020,negative,there wasnt much character development
Jan 17 2020,positive,overall i think i enjoyed it  even though reys character couldve been more developed because of how impactful her being palpatines granddaughter was  big character in the series who himself still carries a heavy aura of mystique
Jan 17 2020,positive,i feel like everyone is extremely overly critical of pretty much every star wars movie the entire series of movies are steeped in predictable scifi fantasy tropes theyve never been amazingly profound aside from the darth vader revelation in empire sit back and enjoy it for what it is or dont and waste your time complaining about a space drama no skin off the backs of all of us that have fun with all star wars content
Jan 17 2020,positive,its a good movie feels very rushed  im disappointed with the ending but all and all a decent movie worth seeing
Jan 17 2020,negative,was terrible as the entire new trilogy
Jan 17 2020,negative,abject garbage the only good thing about this movie is that disney is finally done shitting on the star wars saga
Jan 17 2020,positive,i loved the special effects the completion of so many story arcs and the characters i was super sad the first time i saw the end and i cant say why because it is a spoiler i loved the surprises but that may be because i dont watch the adds i like to be surprised and to go on the journey of a fine storyteller so i go back to enjoy all the details and bits i am sure i missed the first time i saw it i think i will go again and take my friend who read all these bad reviews i told her it is great i was in college when i saw the first star wars iv in the movie theater when it first came out i loved star trek and when i saw star wars i was so immersed i cant remember who my date was it was a game changer in the scifi world thank you lucas over the years i introduced these movies to my children who passed it on to my grandchildren who are big time star wars enthusiasts thanks to all the actors designers writers computer whizzes and so many more who made all these movies possible
Jan 17 2020,positive,i absolutely loved it its star wars not citizen kane
Jan 17 2020,negative,space horses space ghosts and finger sky lightning screw disney
Jan 17 2020,positive,the movie felt rushed the kylo and rey storyline was the only believable part ending was great but the script could have been better
Jan 17 2020,positive,like most star wars properties this final installment of the skywalker saga did alot of things wrong however like its predecessors they did a lot of things right as well sprinkled in between the down right cringy moments mostly involving fin there were moments that remind you why this franchise means so much to so many people the story was predictable but in all the right ways the acting was passable and the action was digestible and not overwhelming all in all i would say its turned it place in the hallowed halls of the star wars empire
Jan 17 2020,positive,this is my favorite star wars movie out this far not compared to the older ones
Jan 17 2020,positive,mostly tying up plot lines from the previous 8 movies and leaving a message of hope for the future and likely disney spinoffs  but i did enjoy seeing the ole principals make a cameo or more  there are still a number of unanswered issues to keep everyone talking and guessing and waiting for the next movie
Jan 17 2020,positive,ok i will admit it needed some work but im not gonna go crazy like certain people who are too toxic some parts i say were good
Jan 17 2020,positive,best star wars movie so far 
Jan 17 2020,negative,although a complete mess i will give jj credit for cleaning up after johnsons epic fail of the last jedi    yawn
Jan 17 2020,positive,not even a die hard star wars fan and i loved this movie
Jan 17 2020,positive,a lot to digest but beautiful visuals great lightsaber fights and some epic plot twists i thought it was a beautiful film with just enough action and heart
Jan 17 2020,negative,well for one my review is not fake so theres that i hope disney doesnt delete this rating this film is just bad lol like theres no other way to say it they have stolen everyones money and time with this barely put together monstrosity this movie should be called star wars slapped at the last minute the cgi is really good though
Jan 17 2020,positive,i went into this with no expectations and walked away having really enjoyed it  there were some pacing and plot issues but that was to be expected since abrams was cleaning up the mess that was last jedi
Jan 17 2020,negative,pacing was awful if you are bored it can kill some time
Jan 17 2020,positive,brilliant ending to the series definitely going to see it again
Jan 17 2020,positive,thought it was pretty good for what they had to work with execution probably could have been a bit better but no movie is perfect
Jan 17 2020,positive,admirable job of trying to recover from the disaster that was the last jedi but there wasnt enough time to explore all of the new characters and themes introduced
Jan 17 2020,positive,critics said this movie is more of an apology for the mistake of the last movie apology accepted
Jan 17 2020,positive,what a turd being a kid when the original 3 came out really sucks how bad the newer star wars movies have been disney is partly to blame
Jan 17 2020,positive,much better than the last installment which almost killed the series for me  it tries to make up for story missteps in the last two films and almost succeeds
Jan 17 2020,positive,back to basics the rise of skywalker gives the fans a highly entertaining film
Jan 17 2020,negative,sad ending to a potentially amazing history should have ended this at episode 6 now i have a bad taste in my mouth every time i think of this last sad trilogy
Jan 17 2020,positive,it was just alright being a child of the 70s and a lifelong sw fan since 1977 ive never bought into the last trilogy it was too disconnected from lucas storyline
Jan 17 2020,positive,the storyline was an absolute mess and it didnt really make sense
Jan 17 2020,positive,i found issue with the pacing and poor acting at some points
Jan 17 2020,neutral,it was entertaining and fun a lot of fan service the plot went in a different direction than id hoped and really doesnt make sense at parts
Jan 17 2020,positive,i attended the premiere of the movie with my girlfriend and we enjoyed it despite all the hate the movie gets i loved it palpatines return made me wanna rewatch this movie 3 times
Jan 17 2020,negative,all three of these movies sucked this one sucked a little less the cinematography was great in all three but the story was just absolute trash if the prequels had this type of filming and at least a half way decent dialogue it would have been amazing way to screw the pooch disney make a kotor movie sad when a video game has a better plotstory
Jan 17 2020,positive,there is no such thing as a perfect ending but this hit so many perfect notes i cant wait to see it again and so sad that the original story has come to an end
Jan 17 2020,positive,great movie from walt disney
Jan 17 2020,positive,great movie dont let anyone tell you different
Jan 17 2020,positive,the end had it all for a fan dont over think it just enjoy it
Jan 17 2020,negative,first lets get this out of the way this is far and away the worst film in the whole saga and is certainly not the actors fault daisy ridley mark hammil adam driver carrie fishers edited posthumous material all give their all despite having no material to work with like the force awakens and pretty much every abrams film this film has no script and no director either nor any actors fault the vfx are as good as it gets so certainly neither their fault is jj abrams and chris terrios fault  before doing star wars jj abrams directed star trek into darkness a remake of the classic star trek 2 wrath of khan then when abrams jumped franchise he did star wars 7 the force awakens a remake of you guess star wars 4 a new hope his next film is this and you guess were i am going jj abrams has not a single piece of imagination or creativity in his mind this film is a remake of return of the jedi  but like all previous jj abrams remake films this movie missunderstands the film it is remaking is an antistar wars in that it betrays the themes of all star wars films by george lucas you see the conclusion of 6 is luke throwing away his lighstaber like he did in the best and only original film in the whole sequel trilogy the last jedi by rian johnson luke threw his saber away to prevent himself from killing his father anakin in 6 and later in 8 to prevent himself from killing his nephew ben solo in the lucasrian jhonson films by the time of luke older life for luke holding this saber is like frodo holding the ring of sauron from lord of the rings  abrams makes luke hold the saber again but you see the conclusion of the original trilogy was luke throwing that saber you see the point im trying to make is that by allowing luke to hold the saber in the way he did by saying aa jedis weapon deserves more respect abrams retconed away more than the last jedi abrams retconed away the conclusion of return of the jedi and the conclusion of george lucas life work  lucas went as far as having obiwan kenobi in ii attack of the clones tell young anakin this weapon is your life the saber because he wanted all the prequels to retroactively set up luke throwing that saber what does abrams do he makes luke advice to jedi succesor rey use that saber and actually gives her his sisters rey in the absence of a corpse for luke buries the saber luke hated so much and luke is fine with it being a representation of his life completely betraying all lukes life i felt that by asking rey to kill her grampapalpatine was yoda and obiwan morally wrongly asking luke to kill his father darth vader all over again sure luke didnt knew palpatine survived until ix but he still sorta asked her to kill him in cold blood without offering her further training or anything because for jj abrams the force is all about bloodlines  abrams tries to retcon the hell of that previous  film the problem is that to retcon something away you have to understand it and abrams clearly doesnt understand 8 nor 7 nor 6 nor 5 nor 4 nor rogue one nor solo nor 3 nor 2 and certainly not 1 and abrams clearly didnt bother to watch dave filoni and lucas cartoons that pretty much gave us what lucas sorta didnt managed in hia prequels  then dont even get in every single character fake dying and resurecting how are we supposed ultimate evil palpatine is defeated after so many fake deaths seriously is also a shame that rose ticos character was removed by not carrying the babage of a remake storyline by jj abrams and being of a working lower social class that like the apolitical hacker dj i could argue both are more original than any of the jj abrams character were he placed amazing actors in derivative remake plotlines  this film is so poorly done im not even sure if it will be considered canon or go the way of the terminator sequels where every sequel is an attempt at a terminator 3 is a shame because the actors and vfx are really good and deserved better im sure that the last jedi will age well and that any attempt at an episode x or yes at an episode ix retry has nowhere to go but the themes of viii the last jedi  everyone including me wanted to love this film is star wars i even got so excited about star wars returning in 7 that daisy ridley replied a comment of mine and basically begged my crush to go see the movie with me an instagram comment which didnt work out but you can see this saga means a lot to me  dont hire jj abrams all he does is lazy remakes that bring nothing new and abrams clearly misunderstands the franchises he touches abrams is killing cinema one franchise at a time this is a rollercoaster
Jan 17 2020,negative,reaches michael bay levels of nonstop bombasticity with additional incoherence for good measure yes it is possible if rian johnson took jj abrams positive but repetitive start in tfa and ignored it completely with his lorebreaking plotholeish crapfest then abrams takes everything johnson tried to build in tlj and ignores it with an even ridiculouser crappier crapfest i never thought id prefer the lucas directed sequels to anything abrams directed but i will say this at least george had a vision before he made a single movie instead of arrogantly throwing whatever garbage came to mind in his first draft and expecting everyone to eat it up just because the beginning crawl said star wars best lines kill the girl i need her alive and spoiler i brought you back to life kiss disappear at least daisy ridley is the cutest thing since the ewoks and the mains all hug at the end
Jan 17 2020,positive,the rise of skywalker is an absolute masterpiece a complete turnaround from the mistakes of the last jedi and an emotionally satisfying end to the skywalker saga
Jan 17 2020,negative,my guess is that disney was still overhyped on how much money avengers endgame made them so they wanted to do that again with this film because this movie is packed with fan service with lando making several apperiences emperor palpatine coming back from the dead which also makes darth vaders sacrifice in return of the jedi meaningless and overall nonsencical plot elements used for the sake of pleasing the audience which looking at the audience score it sort of did but not me star wars seems to have lost any kind of purpose in itself now even though the prequels arent all that good at least you could tell they had a story that someone acually wanted to tell and it wasnt all for the money im not saying any spoilers but you know theyre going to make a new trilogy soon after this if im right they might be even worse
Jan 17 2020,positive,a fun movie by itself lots of scenes happening very rapidly back to back who am i kidding is this movie review necessary everybody has seen it by now its a terrible conclusion with a terrible storyline im disappointed by how the movie concluded
Jan 17 2020,positive,i loved the way they incorporated elements of all episodes into the finale
Jan 17 2020,positive,it was a bit busy but it had a lot of ground to cover i liked how that resolved all of the characters and kept the focus on the new three
Jan 17 2020,negative,where do i begin the rise of skywalker is visually epic unfortunately thats the best thing i can say about it the dialogue is weak the fan service is obvious and clumsy at times the space horses wereoriginal in a cringey way frankly the skywalker saga deserved a better ending than the mediocre one it got in the end it was a jj abrams filmand i didnt really expect much to begin with
Jan 17 2020,positive,love all star wars movies
Jan 17 2020,positive,great star wars movie from start to finish
Jan 17 2020,neutral,structurally to many big moments with no build up leaves you bored
Jan 17 2020,positive,everyone is hating on it it is very good a must see for true star wars fans
Jan 17 2020,positive,the picture was good but im not a starwars fan 
Jan 17 2020,positive,it had everything perfect ending to the saga
Jan 17 2020,positive,a bit rushed in the beginning but tied the story up as needed
Jan 17 2020,positive,muddled plot okay action sequences
Jan 17 2020,positive,same theme as previous star wars
Jan 17 2020,negative,absolutely terrible the first two movies in this trilogy were amazing and they threw out all that hard work to pander to the masses as well as recycle themes of the original star wars franchise tragic that we will likely never see the directors cut which i would like to hope was better than what was released
Jan 17 2020,positive,i think that this movie was not as good as it could be jj abrams was given one of the greatest movie franchises of all time and took a massive shit on george lucases work and really i am all the sith and i am all the jedi thats just a cheap rip off of avengers endgames i am inevidable and i am iron man also this movie focused more on having emotional music and stuff to make fans think its good more than how much the movie accually made sense they saw endgames success and tried doing the same think but the only reason endgame is loved is because it has the emotional music that draws fans to it and it has a overall good story and good characters and good acting and the characters accually have a reason to be sad half of the friggin universe died in this movie thay just say the characters are sad but they dont say why wich makes know one care about the charactors like how many people went crazy when iron man died well when kylo ren died know one even cared and it made no sense you have to give a reason why to care about the characters and the rise of skywalker does not do that but with end game people grew up with these characters people love these charaters so overall i give the rise of skywalker a 55 percent rating because it was not nessisarly a bad movie but it was not a good star wars movie
Jan 17 2020,positive,my wife and i loved the movie
Jan 17 2020,positive,film review star wars the rise of skywalker  i was eighteen years old in the early summer of 1977 when star wars dropped like a cannonball into our laps both of my parents were still alive and my brothers mental illness had not yet shattered our family and sent my father to his early grave as a group wed watched the last episode of gunsmoke just two years prior my dads favorite show handsdown for most of its run only falling off during those jaded watergate years and our final disillusion with the vietnam war then suddenly star wars arrived unannounced with its clear water moralitylove not hate courage over fear loyalty to friends and common cause and an appeal for simple faith in the universal connectedness of all things it felt childlike beside that eras gritty american cinema verité films like chinatown 1974 dog day afternoon 1975 and report to the commissioner 1975   but oh how strong that simple appeal in star wars we found classic characters bound in common struggle against evil at high odds the kid the rogue with the heartagold the princessand we reveled in their unlikely success as they did reassured that faith courage loyalty and a little luck will stand against evil even at terrible odds still star wars felt like a simple rousing tale but for the empire strikes back 1980 which grounded the force in family all at once my fathers disappointment came clear as did my resentment and confusion over my new role as the familys savior in the aftermath of my brothers affliction a brother whose every step i followed like a trail blazed through adolescence the tears i saw flowing on my fathers face bewildered and the things i shouted over my shoulder and he at me stung as i stormed out unaware that i would never see him again  with the rise of skywalker director jj abrams understands one thing clearly forty years have passed since an american generation of young people marveled at those early star wars films he knows that those young people have grown into middle age and that many have confronted lifes hard equations that you cannot go back that some opportunities never recur and that you cannot unspeak harsh words you have said to those who have died the rise of skywalkers plot may feel derivative its conventions rehashed and its refusal to realize the story lines set out in the last jedi 2017 frustrating but such things are small beer they barely register next to princess leias final connection to and han solos recovery of their lost son bens reawakening to the love within him and reys final thrust to set things right while all the jedi speak within her   for those of us who cannot stand beside the force ghosts of our dead mothers and fathers and brothers in conversation and speak the loving truths we wish we could star wars the rise of skywalker rings our bell jj abrams knows well the film he has made for us bless his heart      michael d phillips
Jan 17 2020,positive,i didnt like that she ended up being a sky walker
Jan 16 2020,positive,for all the star wars fans from the seventies and eighties this is must see episode of this adventure it very gracefully moves us forward to the next generation go see the movie
Jan 16 2020,positive,i still think rey and ren should have banged one out
Jan 16 2020,positive,star wars the rise of skywalker is a very good movie but it has some details that lower its quality i liked it and i recommend it
Jan 16 2020,positive,pleasantly surprised enjoyed it
Jan 16 2020,positive,granted everything that happened in the last jedi i dont think jj couldve done a better job still a fun movie to watch just too much going on really feels like 2 movies in one and not in a good way it causes the story to become really congested and the way events unfold to just be really convenient however nailed the ending for the saga as a whole first watch is too much to process gonna have to give it at least one or two more views to grasp it
Jan 16 2020,positive,exciting from beginning to end  a mustsee if you are a star wars fan
Jan 16 2020,positive,great ending to the saga
Jan 16 2020,positive,good ending to a saga that needed to end
Jan 16 2020,positive,it was to much like the first star wars so it was to predictable
Jan 16 2020,positive,i am a fan of star wars all of it i can look at each movie see their weaknesses and strengths take them for what they are appreciate their worth and move on ive seen ix 3 times and loved it the most the third time there are a couple of things that could have been better explained and there are a couple of abrupt scene changes it also takes seeing it a few times to follow everything as its happening but i think the retcon complaints are ridiculous and overall it is a lot of fun and emotionally satisfying i love it more every time i see it
Jan 16 2020,negative,too many holes in the story story line too fragmented
Jan 16 2020,negative,these 3 movies need to be forgotten and remade by someone who actually gives a crap about the story and not just money i will refuse to pay for a disney product until something that is truly satisfying is done but i doubt that will even happen  star wars is not marvel you clowns
Jan 16 2020,negative,not a fan of the new stars wars
Jan 16 2020,positive,35 i like some characters in this movie but some are annoying af
Jan 16 2020,negative,really really terrible think a lot of the reason is the car crash that was the previous movie so much meaningless needless plot an awful end to the star wars franchise
Jan 16 2020,negative,worst star wars movie ever poor acting actually no acting just a lot of special effects i hope this is the last of the sequels couldnt take another one
Jan 16 2020,negative,not a fan of this movie it felt rushed and sloppy the acting was amazing and potential of this movie was endless a real missed opportunity that could have been fantastic
Jan 16 2020,positive,it was really powerful and had a lot riding on it which i think it withheld
Jan 16 2020,positive,this is a fitting end to the skywalker saga having the granddaughter of the emperor call herself skywalker was finally the end of the empire
Jan 16 2020,positive,it was a worthy ending to the series it made enough sense it tied up loose ends best they could and it was about as good as return of the jedi or revenge of the sith overall star wars has always been a messy creation behind the camera and sometimes onscreen as well and still is so when theyre able to make something where it looks cool it isnt burdened by pandering to children you can follow the story and theres not fifty thousand things all happening simultaneously that jerk your attention around too hard im happy its kind of a relief having the main story over i honestly didnt think that would even happen in my lifetime because before selling to disney george claimed he was going to legally lock up the story so nobody could ever touch it forever and ever so the new films are really just kind of bonus features to me and when theyre good hey i lucked out
Jan 16 2020,positive,the experience made the movie come to life in a whole new way the sound was perfect and the movie was a brilliant end to the skywalker saga looking forward to the new movies to come
Jan 16 2020,positive,the force is with us
Jan 16 2020,positive,i dont want to give anything away so all ill say iswe were not disappointed
Jan 16 2020,positive,i have no idea why the critics bashed this film it ties in the original storyline nicely and manages to wrap up all loose ends will definitely see again
Jan 16 2020,positive,the movie was solid but felt as though it was looking to fix a tonnage of mistakes from the past it would have been a superb film had the previous two not been such an epic disaster also be prepared for gimmicks tons of them peppered throughout the film to quote the liar in chief sad very sad
Jan 16 2020,negative,that was painful to watch
Jan 16 2020,positive,this movie has its great moments with what feels like a 45 hour movie condensed down into a 2 and a half hour flick the film starts off with a very quick pace and doesnt entirely drop it throughout the whole movie there are a few story choices that you will either be indifferent glad or angry about for the most part i was indifferent to them there is a fakeout on a character death that made me mad for the whatif death that it could have been the fakeout is revealed a little too early for the twist to have any feels or relevance that being said there are some really good shots and some jaw dropping crowd pleasing scenes the arc for kylo ren was easily the best part of this movie and the sequel series as a whole all in all minus a few decisions and tone issues the film is incredibly enjoyable as a fun family movie would recommend seeing this to see how the skywalker saga ends
Jan 16 2020,positive,i think it wrapped up the series very well  it could possibly have another movie but some key characters would be missing   would love to see how the rey poe and finn stories continue  very good movie
Jan 16 2020,negative,well phantom menace was bad but at least it was an attempt at a star wars movie this one is much worse this is just bad a bad movie with 0 plot and a specially a bad star wars movie  the moment when the massive random peoples fleet showed up is horrible why did they decide to show up now and not the last time what changed lando  like he is more popular and well known around the galaxy then lea and the ghost of han he is not even force sensitive how can he show up and many more reasons why this is the worst one so far
Jan 16 2020,positive,it wasnt a great conclusion to an incredible franchise but it was very entertaining if you go as a super fan looking for closer youll be disappointed if youre a casual fan and dont nitpick youll be very satisfied it was by far the best of the last 3 movies
Jan 16 2020,positive,this was a fine movie not terrible not great either i definitely dont agree that this franchise is dead which is a pretty meaningless statement in general it just needs a better story and to take its time more
Jan 16 2020,positive,my husband  i loved the movie  we enjoyed the camaraderie between rey finn poe chewie  the rest of the game  the fight scenes are amazing  well be watching it again
Jan 16 2020,positive,nicely wrapped a few loose ends good ending
Jan 16 2020,positive,stars wars was an awesome movie i highly recommend it
Jan 16 2020,positive,love it all the way through
Jan 16 2020,positive,totally fan service confusing to follow and some embarrassingly corny moments the action was cool but the story was so random and made no sense 
Jan 16 2020,positive,some things could have been better but overall i enjoyed it and would watch again without complaint
Jan 16 2020,positive,they had the potential to tell a new story  it fell short i like the kylo renben solo storyline the flashback about reys parents was forced and didnt help the story lots of action  little character development
Jan 16 2020,negative,terrible ending to amazing saga that built a franchise star wars was literally about anikin skywalker who was an emaculate child created by the force and his offspring disney ended the saga by killing off all of the skywalker bloodline unnecessarily yet keeping alive the descendant of an enemy and cheaply calling herself skywalker
Jan 16 2020,positive,i liked it a lot more the second viewing its overwhelming with very fast plot lines so it almost needs a second time to fully absorb it
Jan 16 2020,neutral,better then last jedi but thats not saying much
Jan 16 2020,negative,it made phantom menace look like citizen kane had absolutely no meat to it at all a lazy attempt to make money off the corpse off a long dead franchise
Jan 16 2020,positive,i thought it was incredible its hard work tying up the sequel trilogy especially since you had to go off what was done in the last movie limits your abilities lots of action great emotion highly enjoyable film 
Jan 16 2020,neutral,ben solo having no lines in the second half of the movie and being killed off was a mistake people can be redeemed without dying kyloben was the best character in the trilogy and it is sad he did not get a happy ending and rey is alone again
Jan 16 2020,positive,much better than last jedi but still left a lot to be desired if abrams has done the whole trilogy i think it wouldve make the movie a lot better great audio and visuals and a couple great moments but a lot of plot holes far from the best star wars movie but light years ahead of the previous movie
Jan 16 2020,positive,overall this movie feels like its suffering from lack of planning the story is all over the place and a lot of the movies twists and turns dont come across the screen as thoughtout plot devices the movie also suffers from a complete lack of character development something which i had been hoping to see after the the last jedi the only reason i am giving this movie so high a rating is that i enjoyed the soundtrack big music nerd here and it was a fitting farewell for the wonderful carrie fisher this movie felt like it tried to stuff an entire saga into one single movie
Jan 16 2020,positive,loved it i love the relationship between rey and kylo epic battle scenes awesome movie
Jan 16 2020,positive,too disney ish lots of overacting but overall entertaining
Jan 16 2020,neutral,the movies pacing is pretty awful beginning is way too fast and then the rest of the movie is slow only good thing out of this was the action which really kept my attention but this movie had so much potential especially being the last one but just didnt do it
Jan 16 2020,negative,it ruins the plot of star wars
Jan 16 2020,negative,it was choppy script blah reverted to old creatures ships etc  nothing new type face for intro to story wrong font music tinny without the williams  over the top orchestration
Jan 16 2020,positive,wont make some hardcore star wars fans happy but it wasnt hard to watch for me it misses some of the joy that the original trilogy had offered
Jan 16 2020,negative,it did not suck as bad as i thought it would be
Jan 16 2020,positive,i didnt dislike anything it was just a bit long but worth it
Jan 16 2020,positive,loved just about everything about this movie my only complaint is the ending redemption trope was a bit too obvious and disappointing
Jan 16 2020,positive,i saw so much in relation to the first trilogy 4 5 6 that i thought this movie was a rehash it was ok but nothing to holler home about i am still confused about her parents but overall b
Jan 16 2020,positive,pretty good story line  not real crazy about the cast
Jan 16 2020,negative,looking like an isolated franchise movie is a good movie  but its existence in addition to incoherent annuls all the first six films
Jan 16 2020,positive,actionpacked adventure but incredibly wellpaced perfect star wars movie made for star wars fans if you didnt like it you arent a star wars fan or you have a dump in your pants jj did a great job cleaning up the mess that was the last jedi and explaining the story in a way that made sense with the finite amount of time he had plus babu frik
Jan 16 2020,positive,after my usual star wars hype and nostalgia the movie became more kf and eye roll on my second viewing with good moments but many problems
Jan 16 2020,positive,best star wars episode after empire strikes back and new hope  great way they tied it all together and the throwback at the end
Jan 16 2020,positive,we have seen all the star wars movies and this proved to be just as good as the others
Jan 16 2020,negative,nope just nope star wars is dead
Jan 16 2020,positive,love it big shocker
Jan 16 2020,positive,it was a fun ride the best of the new star wars trilogy
Jan 16 2020,positive,good overall movie to conclude the saga
Jan 16 2020,neutral,a poorly written story that was only saved by performance from the actors  jj abrams was less worried about making a solid story that expands the star wars saga and leans more toward rewriting the original trilogy with a different set of characters
Jan 16 2020,positive,its a similar formula good versus evil there are a few nice twists in the movie the special effects are great if you like star wars recent movies youll like this version
Jan 16 2020,positive,good story great acting
Jan 16 2020,negative,this was horrible it had no depth to it and only part that pulled you in at all was the end however the end sucked palpatine managed to take over the galaxy survive death build an entire star fleet which apparently cant fight control the galaxy through snoke and so on but he is defeated by someone who cant even use a lightsaber properly noway   look at the prequels lightsaber battles and look at this series you can see she did no training for these shots i was actually mad when i left i will never go to see star wars at the theater again long time fan but hanging this up for good
Jan 16 2020,positive,in and of itself its a very entertaining star wars movie visually beautiful however as part of the trilogy and 9 part skywalker saga i was a bit disappointed  nothing new same old star wars reveals and battles cant wait for what they do next now that they do not have to connect so many dots from previous moviesshowsbooks etc
Jan 16 2020,negative,hated the entire movie ruined the franchise disneys corporate greed tried to remake the original trilogy and failed miserably if they had focused on making a good movie instead of making more money it mightve been actually okay
Jan 16 2020,positive,this movie brought all the loose ends together as a spectacular american epic spaceopera that will never be forgotten
Jan 16 2020,negative,very much a disney goodfeels movie essentially there was a handwavy conclusion and most of the screen time was wasted on nostalgia or flashy action and force powers rather than actually building a good story also this move has possibly the worst last line of any movie ive ever seen given the context of the story
Jan 16 2020,positive,it was awesome  a great way to end the series
Jan 16 2020,positive,anakin skywalker never showed up
Jan 16 2020,positive,as an individual movie i found this to be an enjoyable outing in the world of star wars as the final episode in a 9 movie saga i found it a little disjointed the force awakens reignited everyones love for the franchise the last jedi seemed to go out of its way to break away from the tone set in tfa and now tros seems to battle against the stories set up in the last jedi which is why many people have very mixed feelings about this movie  tros had some intelligent and eye catching action sequences and pulled on the heart strings of nostalgia filled with references to the original movies tros i found struggled to create its own identity unfortunately much of the humour did not land for me and most jokes fell flat on the audience   it gave us an ending to the skywalker saga but quite a predictable and unsatisfying one poe and finn were made side characters when they should have been pushed more towards the front
Jan 16 2020,positive,really good action sequences a nice conclusion to the latest arc and a good showing of someone who may not deserve it but still gets a chance at redemption its an interesting take on how human emotions van affect so many lives
Jan 16 2020,positive,everything was perfect lots of action
Jan 16 2020,positive,absolutely everything id hope for out of a star wars movie fun exciting funny inspiring a great ride from the opening moments and an incredibly satisfying finale
Jan 16 2020,positive,it started a bit choppy and disjointed but quickly became a satisfying story finally wrapping up a series i began watching as a 13yearold when the original premiered  highly entertaining
Jan 16 2020,positive,the story tied together loose ends from previous star wars stories
Jan 16 2020,positive,if you are a star wars fan you will enjoy it
Jan 16 2020,positive,it was a good ending to the initial story line that started in a theater far away  it brought together all of the different story lines and had several plot twists that i was not expecting
Jan 16 2020,positive,loved seeing the old cast members and drew a lot of things together
Jan 16 2020,positive,not the best film of the franchise or even from the latest trilogy but i was still entertained my expectations were pretty low going into it though as i knew there would be problems with wrapping up the enormous story and there definitely were a few but at the end of the day it is a movie so you have to suspend some disbelief   the biggest problem i have with everyone bashing the film is that so much fan energy has been poured into trying to make this a logical world where every small detail clicks into place it ruins the overall effect and ignores the reality that life is messy and not all loose ends are always tied up at the end of the day without getting into spoiler territory if you think certain major characters either got too much or not enough attention well yes that is what happens in the real life annals of history
Jan 16 2020,negative,what a piece of junk
Jan 16 2020,positive,well done and great movie
Jan 16 2020,positive,just simply amazing maybe im biased but i love every star wars film from the story to the special effects just go see it
Jan 16 2020,negative,its sadly enough a bad movie but if youre the type of person that enjoys the spectacle and not at all the storyline theres a good chance you can definitely completely enjoy this movie  because from a visual side of things like the previous movies its actually really good its a joy to look at its just not a joy to follow  characters are underutilized powers are finnicky being used one moment because its awesome and looks cool but then in a next moment where that power would be ideal it isnt even considered to artificially up the tension and stakes  a good example of this is seeing ray have difficulty climbing things when previously she was seen just floating around or jumping really far and high with ease  and theres a lot of moments like that that simply dont fit but have been done to either look cool or add tension where there is none  it was super disappointing the bad guys and their plan is ridiculous the good guys and their plans are stupid  but at least we still have the visuals hooray
Jan 16 2020,positive,i thought that it started out a little slow and clunky there were a lot of moments when i felt that the lines were forced once it got rolling it is hard not to get swept up in the drama of the story but it took a while to get there
Jan 16 2020,positive,it was great and i love it i want more and more
Jan 16 2020,positive,the length was long good mix of action and back stories
Jan 16 2020,negative,there is so much to unpack really didnt like the way they just zipped through to an ending felt like it should have been 2 movies
Jan 16 2020,positive,new wrap up to the saga
Jan 16 2020,positive,a very entertaining popcorn movie the visuals are amazing the story suffers from a lot of disconnected plot points and it could have spent more time focusing on the character development and their individual stories
Jan 16 2020,positive,very satisfying ending to the saga
Jan 16 2020,positive,star wars the rise of skywalker concludes the skywalker saga with a film that is full of fan service whilst also offering a fastpaced plot that will keep you on the edge of your seat and answers some of the biggest questions that we were left with at the end of the last jedi
Jan 16 2020,positive,good moviea little disappointed in the ending
Jan 16 2020,positive,some minor plot point holes but overall a good movie
Jan 16 2020,negative,it is literally the worst star wars movie i have seen even the phantom menace had a scenario
Jan 16 2020,negative,just kept jumping around all the time didnt have time to develop the characters or left a lot unanswered and so so many plot holes
Jan 16 2020,negative,this is a complete failure for me not only are there many plotholes but former interesting characters like finn are almost completely wasted and are just a shell of what they could have been i also find the return of palpatine very halfassed and seemingly out of nowhere and on top of it all rey is still the biggest mary sue i have ever witnessed in my life
Jan 16 2020,positive,its not half bad what i love the most though is the music by john williams
Jan 16 2020,positive,i love it the best movie i have ever seen
Jan 16 2020,negative,jon favreau needs to save star wars
Jan 16 2020,negative,all spectacle no story
Jan 16 2020,negative,i really love this movie series but its worst film of all the series worst ending no ideas characters are shallow star wars universe has fallen victim to disney politics money is everything 
Jan 16 2020,positive,great movie hope they dont let star wars finish here
Jan 16 2020,negative,it felt like two movies crammed into one didnt care about the characters except kylo ren story was all over the place this movie was a mess
Jan 16 2020,positive,visually a great looking movie too rushed though not enough character development and to many things that didnt need to happen happened throw that in with some pc culture and you have to
Jan 16 2020,positive,not bad not great but good
Jan 16 2020,positive,this moving was amazing
Jan 16 2020,positive,acting was exceptional
Jan 16 2020,positive,absolutely amazing and pleasantly surprised based upon poor critic reviews i grew up watching the original trilogy in the theaters and have shared my love of star wars with my now teenaged son hes been watching since he was 3 they blended this final movie with the 8 previous films wonderfully and tied up many loose ends i teared up multiple times and so did my 50 year old husband i would like to see it again on a different type of screen an absolute must see 
Jan 16 2020,positive,culminated the series well picked up the slack from the last movie
Jan 16 2020,positive,critics are wrong once again
Jan 16 2020,negative,somehow the emperor returned seriously this movie made me sad to be a star wars fan
Jan 16 2020,positive,amazing final movie the sheer epic ness of it all is mind boggling 40 years of memories thank you mr lucas
Jan 16 2020,negative,if you want good star wars watch the mandalorian   felt like the plot for this movie was slapped together in a day so that jj could focus on using too many special effects the amount of fakeout deaths in this movie is just disgusting and disrespectful to anyone with a brain stem
Jan 16 2020,positive,tied together all the episodes felt good to get closure
Jan 16 2020,positive,5 stars for star wars 
Jan 16 2020,positive,very good finale movie for the star wars series
Jan 16 2020,positive,loved it one of the best new star war movies
Jan 16 2020,positive,it was a good story to finally wrap everything up after 42 years
Jan 16 2020,positive,after hearing about the fans disappointments i was pleasantly surprised with the final star wars film some parts of the story were far fletched and not even close to being realistic howeverthis is star warswhere nothing realistic can be expected
Jan 16 2020,negative,poor screen writing besides the good cg probably the worst high budget movie i have ever seen
Jan 16 2020,positive,loved it a wonderful ending to the epic saga
Jan 16 2020,negative,the movie was incoherent
Jan 16 2020,negative,worst star wars film ever for a movie that had total support and relatively unlimited funds relatively unlimited resources except of course for the tragic death of carrie fisher there was no excuse for such a mess there are some neat ideas in it but if there is a saving grace its that the final chapter of disneys avengers endgame was fantastic as an example as to how to close out a franchise on the flip side compared to root canal this film was better than root canal hence better to schedule watching this film after a dental appointment
Jan 16 2020,negative,im a star trek fan now
Jan 16 2020,negative,absolute waste of money damn that was really something
Jan 16 2020,positive,not as good as the first ones like return of the jedi
Jan 16 2020,positive,critics are imbeciles i have watched this movie three times in theaters and loved it lots of nostalgia and great lightsaber scenes 910
Jan 16 2020,positive,the star war series continues to provide high quality movies with good casting and great stories  i hope there will be more episodes
Jan 16 2020,positive,a great way to end the saga  tried to tie everything up and for the most part didi
Jan 16 2020,positive,great movie to add to the series  lots of action 
Jan 16 2020,positive,very good ending to the saga
Jan 16 2020,positive,better than expected  after the last film i did not have high expectations but i was pleasantly surprised by how well jj abrams tied the series together
Jan 16 2020,negative,man this was not very good at all
Jan 16 2020,positive,this is the final installment of the classic star wars series it ended the best possible way you could of done it
Jan 16 2020,positive,best of the latest trilogy but it still could have been so much more
Jan 16 2020,positive,the plot felt rushed at first but everything turned into a masterful beautiful ending worthy of the skywalker saga
Jan 16 2020,positive,thoroughly enjoyed the movie
Jan 16 2020,positive,the chairs are tooooooo comfy
Jan 16 2020,negative,if the point of the movie was to make absolutely no sense then it was a good movie
Jan 16 2020,positive,a great ending to a whole new beginning i really loved it
Jan 16 2020,neutral,story jumps around a lot and tries to please fans way past an acceptable extent the only thing saving this movie is the fantastic visuals
Jan 16 2020,positive,clever funny and exciting a worthy conclusion to a story that no one wanted to end rather moving moments familiar faces and voices 
Jan 16 2020,neutral,the lack of originality seems to be the directors resented mark this particular movie seems to be a jumble of stuff drawn from previous films in this saga the adventure is good but the narrative is shallow
Jan 16 2020,negative,this movie is not star wars it more like female rey is the greatest ever no plot just running around doing nothing
Jan 16 2020,positive,this movie closed a lot of open story lines in the star wars movies but keeps open option for further films fingers crossed
Jan 16 2020,negative,couldnt wait for it to end
Jan 16 2020,positive,glad i saw it on the big screen
Jan 16 2020,positive,this might as well have been a star wars satire as the plot feels random and laughable i had fun wondering how choices were made in the making of this movie 
Jan 16 2020,positive,im not picky when i comes to star wars and i thought this was a powerful and moving film where the heroine becomes more established in her jedi identity and we suspect that others fin may also be discovering theirs
Jan 16 2020,positive,awesome great ending to the franchise
Jan 16 2020,positive,it was great to see all the original characters on the same screen or at least hear their voices
Jan 16 2020,negative,so far the worse star wars movie  very disappointed
Jan 16 2020,positive,i it was ok and i am a star war fan
Jan 16 2020,positive,so good i saw it twice and still cried amazing movie
Jan 16 2020,positive,great movie i cant believe how dope this was from start to end
Jan 16 2020,negative,the worst star wars movie ever
Jan 16 2020,positive,i really liked it seen them all and i cried because of it came full circle you have to see it for sure if you are a star wars fan
Jan 16 2020,positive,exactly what i expected it to be  great
Jan 16 2020,positive,relatable characters
Jan 16 2020,positive,my favorite in the the star wars sequel trilogy loved
Jan 16 2020,positive,loved it  it comes back full circlewell more like a indirect roundabout scribble that ends storyline where it began  i liked that  definitely could have gone in many diff directions  i weeped at how  why leia dies nice touch simple but powerful  i was surprised because i didnt know anything about it  i didnt watch trailer or read anything  cant please everyoneor even most people
Jan 16 2020,positive,well it was kinda predictable but still was amazing movie far as dislikes i got none
Jan 16 2020,positive,liked it great wrap up to the series dont agree with the haters it was fun visually stunning
Jan 16 2020,positive,great plot  fantastic cast  sad that most of the characters from will not return  hope they will make more movies
Jan 16 2020,positive,this movie excels at almost everything the last jedi did not i will say that the movie was a bit too fast paced and got too deep into the action too fast but the movie ended the star wars saga on a wonderful note i especially loved the ending and how the yellow colored lightsaber into star wars canon the ending was probably my favorite part in the entire saga my least favorite part of the movie is definitely how it just throws so much at you at a single time like how the movie just gets right into the action with kylo ren finding palpatine right at the beginning
Jan 16 2020,negative,should have been titled rise of garbage  horrible in all facets rushed beginning weird force powers weird lineages to give the movie a meaning a purpose   its sad when 7 8  9 make 1 2  3 better movies
Jan 16 2020,positive,generally good lots of action left many open questions not a smooth transition from prior movies scenes seem chopped up no smooth transition between scenes
Jan 16 2020,negative,it is impressive that the new trilogy of films managed to be worse than the prequels this third and final piece of the trilogy is a mess it has redundant characters bizarre scenes that hold no relevance to the plot terrible inconsistencies with the rest of the franchise and the pacing of someone speaking really quickly as they confess to messing up in the hopes that people wont notice   pros   the actors are all professionals and have clearly put in a solid effort into their roles giving good performances despite the plot putting them in odd positions and with poor motivations   the cinematography is good as you can tell time budget and effort were spent making things look good   sometimes theres a nice sound effect  cons   almost everything else literally from the very moment the film begins with scrolling text the plot makes leaps on bounds over logic to arrive at whatever destination it wants this continues throughout the entire movie the characters dont drive the plot in this movie nor does reason   i laughed out loud a lot during this movie but it was never at any of the many jokes that all fell flat it was at the hilarious twists and turns this movie makes characteristic of a poorly thought out fan film rather than a serious production
Jan 16 2020,positive,good movie for anyone who has seen the films episode 14 but wouldnt suggest to anyone new to the franchise
Jan 16 2020,positive,it was a good action movie but for star wars fans it left a lot to be desired  and the plot holes you could fly a death star through
Jan 16 2020,positive,too long too many battles
Jan 16 2020,positive,this is a great action movie i loved it
Jan 16 2020,positive,loved the story line and action
Jan 16 2020,positive,the critics to the movie really turned me off so i just saw it today  it was a very good surprise not the best of the saga but i think it is underrated it saves the mess left from the previous one
Jan 16 2020,positive,nicely done with some new and great old characters
Jan 16 2020,negative,disjointedhard to follow
Jan 16 2020,positive,movie was great a lot of action and emotion  wish the movie was a bit longer as there were times that a lot was going on at one time
Jan 16 2020,positive,star wars the rise of skywalker is messy in places has some questionable storytelling choices and takes a slightly odd pace but for a loyal star wars fan the film excels in providing a satisfying emotional and overall utterly enjoyable conclusion to an iconic saga
Jan 16 2020,negative,jesus christ i dont know where to begin so i wont
Jan 16 2020,positive,after hearing a lot about how some people liked or dislike the movie sometimes i believe you need to see the movie for yourself i felt that the movie was well put together and as always you can not compare the movie when other people not the original author is not in full control besides if the original person has anything to say then they may not be able to air it if he disapprove it other than that i thought this was well done
Jan 16 2020,positive,superb absolutely loved it
Jan 16 2020,positive,enjoyed it so glad i saw it on the big screen
Jan 16 2020,positive,this movie jumps right into the action and doesnt slow down loved the visuals the dialogue and the storyline the film had a lot of neat surprises i didnt see coming and some interesting cliffhangers im satisfied with the ending of this trilogy out of the final 3 films 78 and 9  i felt the best leaving the theater after the force awakens
Jan 16 2020,positive,this movie is so unbelievably bad that it actually goes all the way back around and becomes ironically good all of it is dumb and makes no sense whatsoever but at this point i dont even care im just glad this trilogy is over
Jan 15 2020,positive,being a lifelong fan of star wars i was well pleased with the last of the nine i was also happy that they found a way to keep carrie fisher as leia it wouldnt be the same without her
Jan 15 2020,positive,it was martin scorsese who said for mcu movies that theyre not really movies but theme parks the same can be said for the rise of skywalker when the force awakens appeared i really liked it i thought jj did a solid job although it still felt like a reboot  there comes a time when there are just one too many planet destroyers in a galaxy far far away when rian johnson took over i understand he tried to take a new direction but it felt like he carefully scrutinized every fan theory available online and gave the fans the middle finger dont get me wrong as a standalone movie the last jedi would have been awesome but this was part of a trilogy i expected at least some synergy between jj and rian im certain these guys were at each others throats and the fans were paying the price  in the end this was expected jj did try to please the fans and fix what rian has done it did neither the movie is a mess in many instances it felt pathetic the sequel trilogy should remain a lesson on how not to deal with a major franchise i gave the movie three stars as it is watchable just dont expect too much it didnt fail to the point that the franchise is beyond salvation thank god for that and mandalorian too but its walking on very thin line at the moment
Jan 15 2020,positive,loved the reprise of the original musical themes the humor the diversity themes  the friendships forged in adversity
Jan 15 2020,positive,this was a great film by far the best out of this recent trilogy and it goes without saying that its surpassed lucass episodes i ii  iii  there was plenty of action this time around with wonderful special effects and a nice amount of nostalgic throwbacks overall it was a great film and a wonderful way to cap off the star wars main story
Jan 15 2020,positive,its been like two weeks and i still dont know how i feel about this movie
Jan 15 2020,negative,the movie was garbage it bounced around like a ping pong ball on crack left more unanswered questions than it answered it failed on many levels the movie sickens me
Jan 15 2020,positive,i think it was one of the best ways to end the skywalker saga
Jan 15 2020,positive,pretty good finally gives a story to poe and finn after ignoring them both in the second film nicely wraps up rey and ben flawed simply because carrie fisher died but other than that a solid movie
Jan 15 2020,positive,jj abrams did the star wars saga great justice in this movie laughed cried and cheered throughout the film excellent movie
Jan 15 2020,positive,great movie great effects
Jan 15 2020,positive,its the best star wars movie but i rather see the mandalorion
Jan 15 2020,positive,a fantastic film alone a great conclusion to the sequel trilogy and a satisfying ending to the skywalker saga
Jan 15 2020,positive,liked the whole movie sorry it ended but it did leave it open i guess we will see
Jan 15 2020,neutral,just very bland there were a few bits i really enjoyed but ultimately i felt nothing and occasionally quite bored
Jan 15 2020,negative,cant believe this film has the audience score it has it all seemed so messy to me i just wanted it to stop so i could get out of the cinema way too much pointless action i felt almost claustrophobic watching a sensation ive never had watching a film
Jan 15 2020,negative,too rushed and too many potholes
Jan 15 2020,negative,so much about this movie was simply underwhelming  it really did seem like they were trying to fit 2 films into one  not to mention this movie is nothing more than a lot of fetch quests that are magically fullfilled  we need a ship  a ship appears we need a map  a map appears we need a key  a key appears
Jan 15 2020,positive,adam driver is amazing as always however the movie was poorly written it was cheesy and they completely cheaped out on the ending they couldve done so much more it seemed as if the writers were scared to mess up which they completely did sad
Jan 15 2020,positive,awesome movie loved it
Jan 15 2020,positive,first film i saw in 4dx and it might be the last  getting water splashed on your face and gust of winds do not seem like something extra to pay for when you watch a film  over all the film was what i would have expected not being a huge star wars fan  i however enjoyed seeing carrie fisher brought back to life for one last film for the big star war fans i am sure they will love the final of this trilogy
Jan 15 2020,negative,weak and frustrating  this actually with the other 2 prior poor movies destroy the original star wars movies  this should not be canon  personally i wont expect it 
Jan 15 2020,positive,i enjoyed the movie tremendously it keep me involved and excited wish the last segment would have had all the skywalker family show themselves to ray
Jan 15 2020,negative,so much has already been said about this movie ultimately its better than last jedi because at least it tries to be a star wars movie but its not even really a movie its really just a bunch of cut scenes from what feels like a good videogame this whole last trilogy has been such an abyssmal dissapointment
Jan 15 2020,positive,its a scififantasy movie and it delivered on all counts for me i dont go to see an action movie to watch academy award level acting
Jan 15 2020,negative,this is not star wars theyve taken a diamond and turned it into talc
Jan 15 2020,negative,took my 12 year old son to this last night  he enjoyed it  i did not  he did spot the many many gaping plotholes in it but said the explosions and action made up for it  sorry thats not enough for me  the story made no sense and was just the characters going from one mcguffin to the next often stumbling across the next plot point by chance and with not a moment for any story to breath   it was a huge shambling mess of a film in typical j j abrams style  if you like that you like that  if you expect to connect emotionally with characters beyond their nostalgic value and care about events there is very little here for you  if you expect your villans to have plans that make any sense whatsoever forget about it  if you like witty amusing dialogue again very little in that respect here id say on the whole it was slightly better than the last jedi  at least i didnt feel like i wanted my time and money back when i left the theatre  but what a disappointing wasted opportunity this whole trilogy has been
Jan 15 2020,negative,liked the strong female heroine not a star wars fan movie was too long jumped from place to place with no explanation how they got out of previous  9 yer old enjoyed it
Jan 15 2020,negative,definitely not a good movie but it did keep me engaged i dont like the implications this has on the greater skywalker story and i think it was given a bad hand with what the last jedi left overall wait till it comes out on disney and watch it on your friends account
Jan 15 2020,negative,it ran fearfully from any opportunity to be philosophical or artistic in the way the original trilogy was it decided instead just to be a cheap knockoff action flick that used all the names and faces from star wars but brought none of the heart every obstacle was easily overcome the major character turns were sub plots instead of main plots the good guys didnt need to do anything special learn anything special or confront anything deep within themselves to succeed they just had to show up and the plot delivered them the power to snap their fingers and solve every problem   it was lame boring and sad
Jan 15 2020,positive,i thought it did a great job with wrapping up the movies
Jan 15 2020,negative,complete waste of time
Jan 15 2020,positive,brought a certain amount of closure to long standing conflicts
Jan 15 2020,positive,probably the best one from this last trilogy cant wait to see it again 
Jan 15 2020,positive,it was better than the last jedi but thats not much of a compliment as i really disliked that movie  too much is left unexplained with the intention that we have to go out and buy a book to figure out why palpatine is back  if you heard complaints that this felt like a video game fetch quest those complaints are true  even the first orders motives for doing anything just dont make much sense  why go around blowing up planets all the time  its not like youll have anything to rule over if you keep doing it  granted i cant put all of the blame on jj as i feel like he was left with a pile of garbage and told to make something good out of it  in the end this is the weakest of the star wars trilogies  it was only propped up by nostalgia and even that was dumped on more often than not
Jan 15 2020,negative,made no sense  as a popcorn movie and if you just dont care about the lucas movies then you may like it but if you like luke skywalker your going to hate this movie with a passion i found this movie very boring and made no sense
Jan 15 2020,positive,the action was epic and felt meaningful the story was great and had a real relatable message about how the enemy tries to make to feel like youre all alone when youre not hit deep great to see there was way less political agendas the story of hope love friendship and redemption with a plot twist favourite star wars movie so far
Jan 15 2020,negative,it was a great comedy
Jan 15 2020,positive,second viewing  loved it as a part three  it continues the story well leaves hope for a new set of films our family is very appreciative of the sci fi fantasy world the whole genre created and continues to create
Jan 15 2020,positive,i liked it excellent film to put a close to the star wars saga
Jan 15 2020,negative,the rise of skywalker the 2 last remaining skywalkers die there is no skywalker left and thats just the problem with the title
Jan 15 2020,positive,dont listen to the haters this is the best star wars movie to come from the sequel trilogy i have absolutely love it
Jan 15 2020,negative,what i wanted and expected from this movie was a reasonably meaningful conclusion to the sequel trilogy my expectation was not met the meaning in the last jedi was ignored and thus tros feels disjointed from the other films and delivers an ending that doesnt follow through on the emotional arcs that were driven so far reys defining struggle was to find purpose and identity despite not knowing her family her being a no one who didnt inherit her powers was fresh and deeply resonant but all that was replaced with a resused reveal youre related to the villain that removes meaning from the character and brings nothing new the movie is also so crowded with plot that most characters dont get any actual payoff for their respective journeys it looks good though and the performances were great
Jan 15 2020,positive,i need more this was awesome
Jan 15 2020,positive,great movie and i love they were able to include carrie fisher
Jan 15 2020,negative,another creative drought of a film with the sole purpose to annoy as few people as possible and make as much money as possible no character arcs poor pacing bad writing and blatant retcons which cheapen the victories of the previous films
Jan 15 2020,positive,i particularly liked the way the loose ends were tied up
Jan 15 2020,positive,absolutely amazing all the haters gonna hate but at the end of the day disney wins guys 
Jan 15 2020,positive,good wrap up of the third trilogy some good plot twists and great action scenes
Jan 15 2020,positive,very good way better than the last jedi
Jan 15 2020,positive,i admit that the first time i saw this i walked out of the theater disappointed but after watching it again i really got to enjoy it its actionpacked full of emotion and a really fun movie a satisfied ending to this legendary saga
Jan 15 2020,positive,brought some closure to some areas of star wars  loved and hated the ending
Jan 15 2020,negative,final nail in the coffin worst of the three movies not because it was cheap or stupid but because they just backed down dumbed everything down and created a new definition for mediocrity while last jedi had its faults it tried something else it tried changing the formula but as expected mr abrams along with diseny execs used their power to destroy decent story
Jan 15 2020,positive,while the movie was entertaining it didnt meet my expectation for a star wars movie for me it was the best of movies 79 but not near as good as the first 6
Jan 15 2020,positive,was nice they tried up some loose ends but the villains for this one seemed to come out of no where makes it seem like the second movie wasnt in the same story line
Jan 15 2020,negative,lacked any sort of imagination more of everything running fighting flying shooting ships planets doesnt necessarily translate into a more compelling narrative  in the end i felt it necessary to see how the skywalker saga finished the finale was about as satisfying as a small bag of cold popcorn drizzled with butter flavored topping
Jan 15 2020,positive,i liked the movie very much i liked the scene where rey  and kylo ren are fighting on the remnants of the death star with the rolling waves in the backround
Jan 15 2020,negative,absolutely worthless excuse for a movie
Jan 15 2020,negative,that happened sw is ruined i grew up with it and now i never want to see it again thanks disney
Jan 15 2020,negative,what a  piece of garbage every trop from prior ones was somehow wedged into the so called story line even the ewoks we even have dead people appearing  awful way to end the acr but maybe fitting as after this no one will ever want to see another
Jan 15 2020,negative,so out of this galaxy missing too much to be a good movie
Jan 15 2020,positive,excellent movie old school star wars
Jan 15 2020,positive,very entertaining but a little long
Jan 15 2020,positive,haters are gonna hate this was wonderful with a great plot some dialogue was a little weak in a few spots but overall a terrific movie adam driver gets better and better every time i see him
Jan 15 2020,positive,the force is strong in this one
Jan 15 2020,negative,this movie is an insult to almost anyones intelligence
Jan 15 2020,positive,very enjoyable romp  great special effects  sad to know its the end of a saga 
Jan 15 2020,positive,good movie action and sfx go see for yourself
Jan 15 2020,positive,wonderful close to this series
Jan 15 2020,negative,rushed forced and unimaginative ending to the skywalker saga
Jan 15 2020,negative,i love me some star wars  but this left me confused at the end wondering what just happened
Jan 15 2020,negative,junk complete waste of time
Jan 15 2020,positive,ending left us wondering the future
Jan 15 2020,positive,this definitely makes up for the abysmal last jedi  but its still just an okay movie with so many plot holes that i dont even want to try and go through them because i will probably end up hating this movie  it does leave the star wars fan with some satisfying closure to this 9 movie saga   ultimately the only films that are really good are the original 3 episodes iv v  vi
Jan 15 2020,positive,really enjoyable  couple of changes in the story i didnt expect but overall it was an awesome movie
Jan 15 2020,positive,the story line progressed and ended well  there was quite a bit of action the ending was left such that there could be additional sequels
Jan 15 2020,neutral,proved once again that absolutely nothing original will ever occur in the star wars universe under disney  but the music was great it had its moments and the actors were good especially since all they had was table scraps of material from the predisney era to work with
Jan 15 2020,neutral,storyline absolutelys blew one want to believe the story but the characters did not convinced me 
Jan 15 2020,positive,great cap to the sequel trilogy the main characters story arcs are completed with promise for a hopeful future i hope to see this cast again soon
Jan 15 2020,positive,the movie was far much better than the last jedi but rey is still the bs main character who pulls new force powers out of nowhere ruining the death of anakins mother
Jan 15 2020,positive,i was pleased with how reys storyline was wrapped up but there were too many unexplained issues still  also there was one scene towards the end that was completely ridiculous  for casual star wars fans like myself it was worth seeing in the theater
Jan 15 2020,negative,beautifully shot claptrap  a mess of quick scenes for the first 45 minutes  its like two movies had a collision and this is the result  a tangled mess of scenes and ideas  having said that daisy ridley and adam driver carry this movie really well   its not the actors fault  the script is so overstuffed that it must have cost 10x more than what it needed to  has jj abrams never heard of script editing  the plot is hopelessly wonky a tired retread of return of the jedi but then abrams is not a creative person  hes knows where to put a camera but has zero creativity in terms of storytelling so his stuff is nicely shot gibberish  totally unfulfilling as a movie  its a mcfilm
Jan 15 2020,positive,we all really enjoyed it huge fans of anything star wars definitely the best of the 3 so much going on that it didnt seem almost 2 12 hours at all
Jan 15 2020,positive,it was a bit too disney
Jan 15 2020,positive,puts a bow on the skywalker saga nicely its beautiful and well shot lots of action first half is a smidge slow but it makes up for it  it has moving emotional moments light saber battles and star ship dog fights what more could you want from a star wars movie go watch it and enjoy yourself
Jan 15 2020,positive,i think weve learned that all star wars movies are fun to watch regardless of quality including this one the fan service here is top notch however as part of a trilogy this movie is very confusing it abandons almost everything the last jedi brought to the trilogy likely because that film received lukewarm audience reactions this makes this feel like a standalone film rather than part of a trilogy the plot of this film could be split up into a trilogy on its own since it pulls almost nothing from the previous two and that creates a lot of confusion throughout the movie palpatines return is interesting if not cliche but the film doesnt have time to stop and explain the parts of this story that are really going to eat at you once youve left the theater the emperor the main antagonist of the entire main series having a son is revealed in such an oh by the way manner that you could almost miss it this isnt explained in any more detail and should be a much bigger deal than it is made to be just throwing it in as a minor detail makes it feel unimportant and also makes it clear that this is just trying to quickly cut what rey was told in the last jedi and paste the youre actually related to this powerful bad guy trope from the original trilogy his return is explained in the same oh by the way manner and this keeps these things from feeling real you have to be able to suspend disbelief in these kinds of movies but when things are thrown into the plot in this fashion its clear that its scuffed writing thats responsible for this and that takes you out of the experience completely i understand much this was an attempt to undo what was done in the last jedi but deviating from the core plot of the film that this one is supposed to conclude creates a broken story this could have continued to expand upon those plot lines and made them more satisfying rather than trying to delete them potentially leaving both films in a much better light that film was the only one in the trilogy to try something new and not trying to work with what it did makes this one feel like it doesnt belong
Jan 15 2020,positive,lots of action great story fast pasted and entertaining
Jan 15 2020,negative,rushed nonsense they took everything that made starwars great and ran it into the ground
Jan 15 2020,positive,a satisfying conclusion to the skywalker saga
Jan 15 2020,negative,the first 25 minutes of this movie will leave your head spinning as it attempts to do what the second movie in the trilogy completely failed at setting up a final and epic conclusion to arguably the worlds most recognizable and beloved franchise   between quickly reintroducing a villain that was used in both the prequels and original films suddenly reopening the issue of rays parentage and beginning the final arc of kylo rens story your left a bit overwhelmed 30 minutes into the film  when the film does finally settle into a rhythm it feels as though the rules are completely thrown out the window suddenly the force has no limits kylo  ren are more powerful than any of their predecessors and everyone else is just along for the ride with no real stakes that they can influence   ultimately all the reveals in this movie feel hackneyed the movie resembles a star wars film for the middle hour and then in the final climatic scene goes completely off the rails  the powers of life death and the ability of a single individual to destroy an entire army are thrown in with minutes counting down in the movie kylo rens arc is the only story that felt complete and satisfying no one else gets a real conclusion after nearly 9 hours of run time   overall  this will be a spot in the timeline in disneys generation spanning franchise that has only just begun because remember this was all a long time ago in a galaxy far far awaydisney has plenty of years to fill until were in a galaxy far away today
Jan 15 2020,positive,the ending was not good
Jan 15 2020,positive,all i can say is that it was better than the last jedi
Jan 15 2020,positive,good recovery from a less then stellar episode 8 this was a good movie overall
Jan 15 2020,positive,went to see in 4dx which really added to the on screen action liked the darker tone
Jan 15 2020,positive,the plot line wasnt as focused as i would have liked and the absence of carrie fisher was painfully felt in that regard the cinematography and performances of the cast were well played i guess im in the minority but i liked the ending apart from some plot inconsistencies it was a great movie and conclusion to a story thats been a part of my entire adult life since high school farewell old friends
Jan 15 2020,positive,the movie was some and good close to a new entry into the saga yes could have been better but it returned to what mad star wars star wars the best part was how with the version of rey looked badass but i am biased as i at nothing but within swtor
Jan 15 2020,positive,i thought it was the best one of this trilogy hands down  the storyline was fantastic  superb ending to the skywalker saga  dont listen to the haters  go see it
Jan 15 2020,positive,the critics can fuck off as a lifelong star wars fan i loved this movie
Jan 15 2020,negative,a shameful disgrace
Jan 15 2020,negative,disney i hate you for doing this movie so dirty the predictability the terrible attempts at making the audience laugh i would like a refund for your exploitation of an original where you bought the story to resell it back to us disappointed
Jan 15 2020,negative,not the best worst of this triology
Jan 15 2020,positive,i liked it a lot thought it had a pretty good conclusion to the trilogy
Jan 15 2020,negative,this movie along with the rest of the trilogy is a disgrace i have long been a star wars apologist supporting them through the ups and downs but disney messed this up real good it is clear that the movies were separate stories without knowledge of what happens next all made up on the spot ive seen better improv shows   the revival of palpatine was a massive slap in the face to what the original trilogy stood for everything they did was put to absolute waste  thanks disney and thanks to the directors that made a story like a bunch of kids playing pretend and not agreeing with anything
Jan 15 2020,positive,you can tell disney attempted to fix it  unfortunately they still failed to do so
Jan 15 2020,positive,first off i enjoyed it i think it was a clunky love letter to fans as a movie not so good however there were so many individual scenes that made my star wars fan heart happy they showed leias force training made reference to kotor explained a lot of things from the original trilogy by deepening the lore and followed through on a lot promises theyve been subtly making throughout the sequel trilogy something the new trilogy has consistently delivered on is the relationship with rey and kylo kylos transformation being particularly well done i enjoyed watching it once and will likely buy it someday
Jan 15 2020,positive,not a perfect movie by any means but closes one of the greatest sagas in a fitting way a definite watch if you have enjoyed the skywalker saga
Jan 15 2020,neutral,meh another c movie from a c director abrams has no originality he just delivers fan service from previously successful franchises this is exactly the movie youd expect from someone that spends all of his time making up ideas but then doesnt think about how the realistically develop any of them so he slaps something passable together at the last minute
Jan 15 2020,negative,so many plot holes you could fly a death star through  bringing the emperor back invalidates everything anakin sacrificed  horrible end to a screwed up jumbled mess of a trilogy
Jan 15 2020,negative,the actors in this film gave it their all and i want to say that right off the bat i feel the cast and crew did everything they could with what they had this film however was awful with a series like this there was so much to pull from and its clear that studio interference destroyed this franchise like the death star taking out planets this is the point where we part ways starwars i hope one day you see the light and escape the shadow of the mouse
Jan 15 2020,negative,not a very good movie weve seen similar digitally enhanced special effects in previous star wars films theyve become tedious actors frequently mumble their lines and i more than once asked my wife sitting beside me what did heshe say none of the plot themes were original or surprising for example reys being a granddaughter of palpatine was just a reworked version of luke skywalkers being the son of darth vader the last jedi was a better film with some actual depth and i regard the last jedi as being the true final movie in the star wars series
Jan 15 2020,positive,i thought it was better than the previous episodes  i did like rogue one a lot i really liked how they wove the reys and kylo rens pathsstories not quite disconnected from the big story
Jan 15 2020,positive,a lackluster and overpacked but adequate finish to an operatic and concocted saga while the storyline is nothing to speak of many satisfying moments were contained nonetheless
Jan 15 2020,negative,made an account specifically to give this movie the lowest score possible its the most back peddling predictable and disappointing star wars movie ive ever seen i think the only reason people seem to like this movie is how much they had to rely on nostalgia
Jan 15 2020,positive,as a standalone movie it would be 4 even 5 stars  as it is glaring plot holes that dont mesh with the rest of their established reality
Jan 15 2020,negative,this movie is not very good while it has its moments that i really enjoyed the entire story falls flat in a lot of places for me especially with the handling of reys backstory my main gripe with the film though is its continuous devaluing of tlj taking everything about that movie and grinding it away into the most fan service film of the year what about broom kid that sentence completely sums up my feelings on tros because everything that tlj stood for is stripped away into a little of the road experience instead of creating interesting tension with new ideas we get tired rehashes of better movies in the saga
Jan 15 2020,negative,the sequel trilogy has become so disjointed that its become pretty tough to go back and watch this film does not help the tonal continuity i dont see it as a continuation of the series but rather a fixing of the last film which ruins both films utterly disappointed at what disney has done with what was seemingly the most important part of star wars for this generation
Jan 15 2020,negative,if you like any ounce of this movie you are obviously not a star wars fan everyone i have encountered whove liked or loved this actually have never seen the older films new fans are posers if you havent figured it out disney only cares about money
Jan 15 2020,negative,jj abrams doesnt have a creative bone in his body he just leans on the original trilogy for every idea
Jan 15 2020,neutral,eh what a mess only because i like the overall shtick could i care about this random toss of references and characters the story logic is deeply flawed but heh 
Jan 15 2020,positive,though nothing new is brought to this final installment in the sequel trilogy and bringing in more holes its hard to admit the entertainment value of this installment brings old and new fans a fun time with action and special effects though the rise of skywalker is heavily flawed with these problems it is a somewhat decent way to end the series or perhaps bring on a new one in the far future
Jan 15 2020,positive,i was able to overlook the films problems through the emotions that were drawn out of me even though i enjoyed ep8 some course correction was applied and the emperor as villain was as good as any other
Jan 15 2020,positive,decent as anyone would expect not a perfect ending to a 4 decade saga but an average movie on its own fans would be delighted for what they have got but as a moviegoer it would not seem pretty astonishing
Jan 15 2020,positive,absolutely loved this movie obviously trying to encompass a whole saga has its difficulties and everyone is going to have their critiques but i think the movie got the job done its a story about good versus evil and how hope prevails against fear the effects were second to none the acting writing and screen play was great there was some scenes with carrie fisher that seemed forced no pun intended but they did a nice job with implementing her role creatively im glad she was in this film many reviews i read complained about how this was a nostalgia flick well hello its the last movie what else would you expect i highly recommend this film and im a good movie watcher
Jan 15 2020,positive,went with a friend who wanted to see it i liked it
Jan 15 2020,positive,a few questions left unanswered but i still enjoyed the movie
Jan 15 2020,positive,if you delve too deeply into star wars canon and try to overthink all the plot intricacies and character arcs this movie will be ruined for you if you just relax suspend your disbelief a little and enjoy the ride you will have fun watching this its visually stunning quite dark and scary at moments and moves at a breakneck speed something i believe benefits a star wars movie contrary to popular belief im just glad i lived to see the the conclusion of such an epic series that spanned 42 years something that will probably not happen again in our lifetimes was it perfect no was it worth seeing definitely and imo it was a perfectly acceptable conclusion
Jan 15 2020,positive,great movie  amazing effects 
Jan 15 2020,positive,i did not like that they killed off kylo was hoping to see more of him and the changes he decided to make
Jan 15 2020,positive,great movie to all the critics that are rating this bad you cant satisfy them the star wars franchise has older fans and then die hard fans who envision the movie a certain way those who have an envision for it are the ones down voting this movie has everything action great story line  breaking gender roles and a good ending if you love star wars go see this
Jan 15 2020,positive,the main characters in the cast are not strong enough to support the movie like the originals did 
Jan 15 2020,positive,this star wars movie was way better than the last two i enjoyed every second of this one perfect ending extended fight scenes muah
Jan 15 2020,positive,satisfying ending to the sky walker saga surprisingly dark
Jan 15 2020,positive,great movie enjoyed every bit of it 
Jan 15 2020,negative,disney messed up the sequel trilogy by rushing to production with no overarching story arc and treating the movies like batons to be passed from one director to the next this movie makes it perfectly clear that there was no plan whatsoever going in to this trilogy disney treated it like some highbudget action serial like fast and the furious rian johnson wrote them into a corner and jj abrams did an admirable job considering the state of what he was handed the missed opportunities were legion disney could have made something incredible but they squandered it in a rush to make a quick buck ive been a fan since 1977 but i no longer feel connected to this franchise disney has shown that they dont care about the franchise and now neither do i
Jan 15 2020,positive,i loved everything about it great ending to a great movie series
Jan 15 2020,negative,not original did not wow me
Jan 15 2020,negative,bad for people who ask why or who dont want exposition front loaded into your face in a tell dont show
Jan 15 2020,positive,was kind of predictable no surprises didnt expect kilo ren to turn his back on the dark side  quality film fun to watch
Jan 15 2020,positive,loved it action packed from start to finish
Jan 15 2020,negative,absolute garbage but watchable once
Jan 15 2020,positive,it was best of latest trilogy was a little far fetched but also unique about the emperor definitely better than last the last trilogy just seemed all together a little rushed like they made it up as they went along
Jan 15 2020,positive,the movie was awesome
Jan 15 2020,negative,i have to go with the critics on this one pacing at important moments was so fast i couldnt properly respond to them before the movie had moved on without me theres fastpaced action and then theres facepaced narrative this narrative moves so quickly at times you almost dont notice just how sloppy the writing is  honestly it feels like abrams tried to remake last jedi and then make rise of skywalker in one film it was too much content  and any progress you thought the films had made in terms of showing mixed race couples  forget about it   expect sloppy tropic writing pulled from other star wars films pasted together without enough time invested to make it work  spoilers rose and finn dont really get roles in this film in fact lets give finn a samerace love interest  really okay i guess i feel like we just spent a whole movie getting to know these characters i had to agree with the critics on last jedi as well  structurally and functionally it was a good film even if you hated what it did to the fandom
Jan 15 2020,positive,i think it was a great movie probably not what you expected if you are a big star wars fan it was long but i really enjoyed every single moment of it
Jan 15 2020,negative,honestly it was incredibly predictable and boring it walked back and dismissed every interesting and original story point from the previous movie and its slavish devotion to fanservice sucked the life out of much of the rest of the film strong performances from several of the leads were its only redeeming quality i went to see it using a free ticket and i still felt like i overpaid truly a waste of 2 hours
Jan 15 2020,positive,the family really enjoyed this episode
Jan 15 2020,positive,it was satisfying but i wanted more
Jan 15 2020,positive,fantastic a fitting end to a great saga bravo
Jan 15 2020,positive,brings closure to the series like most of the previous installments it rehashes a lost of the original trilogies ideas not in a bad way but has that been there done that vibe worth seeing in the end regardless
Jan 15 2020,negative,first star wars movie that less than an hour into the movie i was checking g my watch
Jan 15 2020,positive,it was good very disney i will say
Jan 15 2020,negative,horrible storyline  this movie brought together a horrible storyline
Jan 15 2020,negative,well that was a waste of time and  even my 8 year old daughter who i brought up on star wars left the theater disappointed and confused the originals prequels clone wars rebels rouge 1 solo it lost money and the force awakens are all enjoyed by the two of us this production stinks of corporate meddling by disney and a feeble attempt to retcon  the dumpster fire that ryan johnson gave us over the top fan service and a plot that felt like it was missing at least 45 min or an hour release the jj cut left the story feeling flat and mashed together if you are looking for amazing star wars this is not it go binge watch the mandalorian on disney  and cancel your trial when you are done
Jan 15 2020,positive,cinematography was so on point and it was an amazing close to the series just see it for yourself ignore what anyone else says about it make the decision for yourself
Jan 15 2020,positive,the way benjamin transformed for love even though he knew he was dying
Jan 15 2020,positive,great conclusion that made sense
Jan 15 2020,positive,i quite thoroughly enjoyed the movie
Jan 15 2020,neutral,visually stunning acting no let down script horrible as one who saw episode iv on opening night 42 years ago to see where this ended is supremely disappointing fifteen minutes less of action filled by story building or extending the movie time by fifteen minutes to tell the story would have helped in the end disney executives messed up
Jan 15 2020,positive,i thought it could of been done a lot better but it was at least better than the last installment im also hoping we get back to making movies not agendas
Jan 15 2020,neutral,first of all i loved the animations and the sound effects however i think the movie was to predictable the only things that made me go woah where the effects im not saying that absolutely everything has to surprise me but the movie could have been better
Jan 15 2020,positive,a fitting ending to the story that has been rocky but it does fix the issues in the last jedi
Jan 15 2020,negative,two stars deserve two wordsplot convenience
Jan 15 2020,positive,superb movie if youre going to see it as a once off storyline wise thought the trilogy still so many questions so is she a skywalker or a palpatine 
Jan 15 2020,positive,fun conclusion to the star wars saga
Jan 15 2020,positive,a great end to an awesome legacy
Jan 15 2020,positive,family is all of us very powerful and moving
Jan 15 2020,positive,as a serious fan of the series i found it pretty good however much like other modern star wars films it was geared more toward serious fans and less toward casual fans
Jan 15 2020,negative,is the worst movie of star wars franchise skywalker darth vader legacy forget this dont start again
Jan 15 2020,positive,i believe you either love this movie or hate this movie the people who have problems with it are nitpicky white dudes who take star wars to their own level and it fails them
Jan 15 2020,positive,star wars is not shakespeare  it is big loud fun escapism and the film delivered in spades  leias arc was tied up nicely and the ending was very fitting  my only gripe is that i wish they had decided to make the runtime a bit longer  being that this film is intended to wrap up a 9 film saga they should have released a 3 hour film  some of the plot threads and newer characters and needed a little more room to breathe  overall im extremely pleased with it and look forward to seeing it again
Jan 15 2020,positive,by far my favorite recent star wars the grand visual effects the marvelous acting the heartfelt storyline this movie tugged on every heartstring and made me cry and cheer and had me on the edge of my seat hungry ford east my eyes upon the excellent journey the film took me on simply an amazing final chapter to the trilogy thank you
Jan 15 2020,positive,very long  and  no  real  surprises
Jan 15 2020,positive,i liked all of it it mightve rhymed a bit too much with the original trilogy but whatever if theres one thing these movies have taught me is that you cant please everyone nor should you try  great movie and what an end to the skywalker saga
Jan 15 2020,neutral,my analogy of episodes 79  episode 7  jj abrams bought all the groceries but had to step out and leave the dinner prep to riann  episode 8  riann completely missed on the entire meal prep  episode 9  jj came back to the ruins of rianns failed dinner and whipped up a passable casserole with the leftovers choppedstyle nothing to put on the menu as a feature entree but sufficient for a thursday night on a hard week when the family has to eat something 
Jan 15 2020,positive,loved the bookend to star wars 1977
Jan 15 2020,positive,was decent  could have been written little more better  but entertaining
Jan 15 2020,positive,i know they had to finish this nine movie series but they left as many things open as they left closed a bit abrupt for the true diehard fan
Jan 15 2020,positive,for me it rounded up the whole story of star wars  i have been a fan since 1977
Jan 15 2020,positive,a lot of action but not a lot of heart ok end to the series but nothing worth writing home about
Jan 15 2020,positive,most of this film faults come from the fact that jj abrams was racing against time trying to undo some of the previous installment deviations nevertheless its a fan focused film that does justice to the star wars awe as a cinema enthusiast youd be disapointed as a fan youd be most likely satisfied
Jan 15 2020,negative,terrible premise  scattered jagged story telling  all complication and no plot  compelling previously important characters reduced to scenery  a very disappointing ending to an epic
Jan 15 2020,positive,excellent overall  closed a lot of plot lines going back to the beginning of the series
Jan 15 2020,positive,if you like star wars you will like this film you can tell how much though went into filling those plot holes from the previous film disaster in my opinion the best star wars since the original trilogy
Jan 15 2020,positive,nicely finished satisfying finish to 42 years of force filled excitement great visuals with sensible story  i glad i didnt miss it in the theater
Jan 15 2020,positive,really intense and suspenseful
Jan 15 2020,positive,10 times better than the last jedi
Jan 15 2020,neutral,rey is palpatines granddaughter what a terrible idea
Jan 15 2020,negative,if tlj is michael scott persistently pulling out a gn in improv class this movie is the other actors failing to adequately compensate for the colossal derailment of their scene except those actors are a theme park ride its blinding stupid gut wrenchingly inane there are now officially twice as many terrible star wars movie than good ones but whenever i get frustrated i just tell myself thats star wars baby im done
Jan 15 2020,positive,maybe its a good time to end up any sagas until some script writers come with new ideas not involving death stars aka starkiller base bring back people from the dead or the main character being the unknowingly descendant of a sith lord not to mention ewoks jar jar binks or porgs please
Jan 15 2020,positive,not bad tied up some loose ends it could have been a lot worse considering its a disney movie
Jan 15 2020,positive,great movie had me in suspense and a little tear jerker great way to end the saga
Jan 15 2020,positive,a fitting end to the star wars saga
Jan 15 2020,positive,loved the movie brought tears and happiness
Jan 15 2020,positive,all you could have wished for if you are a star wars fan lots to unpack
Jan 15 2020,negative,lots of exciting action and gorgeous visual effects that didnt tell a cohesive story i spent the first hour of the movie wondering what the heck was going on and why i should care not only did the story undo most of the last jedi it also contradicted parts of the force awakens and even itself glaring plot holes undermined what little plot there was the characters were handled so badly that they were often unrecognizable even reys character was portrayed in a way that actually made me dislike her in this film she comes across as vicious and cold the most bizarre decision was what was done to kylo renben solo the last skywalker and heir to all the legacy characters it makes no sense for the final film of the skywalker saga i walked out of the theater angry and disgusted that the filmmakers and producers thought this was a fitting end to a 40 year saga
Jan 15 2020,positive,incrediblei loved the story and the emotions that the movie made me feel as a true star wars fan since my 6 years old mada me cry laugh everything
Jan 14 2020,positive,kept you in the edge of your seat wondering and the feels lol
Jan 14 2020,positive,would give it 5 if it had more porgs and more ewoks
Jan 14 2020,negative,this film is representative of a more farreaching evil  visually stunning mediocrity  in a world of the social media persona and the neglected meaning of the self this is the movie you make  it looks indisputably beautiful  it has no substance  no core  no courageous aspiration  none  theres nothing for the child viewer to aspire to except just being awesome not earning awesome  it has a rag tag bunch with no common purpose or discipline beating a regimented military force with an ideology  dont worry teenagers you dont need to make anything of yourselves just jump on your ponies and you can ride right through authoritarian ordnance  no  you cant do that  it has entitled discord with the previous films  all of them  nothing for the adult viewer to allign with their own relationship with star wars  its like your partner going away for a year and coming back with a traumatic brain injury tlj and then she goes away for another year gets another tbi in a vain attempt to fix the tlj she comes home staggers through the door and yells hehhhh hannnyyyy  im hommmme       drool and voids ber bowels giggling  this film is frivolous  it treats the source material as frivolous and reaps the whirlwind
Jan 14 2020,positive,excellent end to the most recent edition of the star wars saga
Jan 14 2020,negative,if you love explosions and cheap thrills then you will probably love this movie from where im sitting no amount of talent from the actors and other creators can compensate for bad writing and an illconceived plot
Jan 14 2020,negative,much of the movie didnt make sense and did not go along with prior jedi powers
Jan 14 2020,negative,unoriginal lazy writing just when you think disney cant make the saga any worse 
Jan 14 2020,positive,this was the best star wars since the original over 40 years ago  really enjoyed it
Jan 14 2020,negative,writing is very lazy plot points dont make sense random new force powers ignores points of the previous movies characters do things without motivation feels like the movie was made to look look first but nobody thought character motivation mattered
Jan 14 2020,positive,im a massive star wars fan but this one was not the best highly recommend watching the mandalorian instead and wait for this to come to dvd or streaming few decent moments but nothing to have you on the edge of your seat ending was a bit lame too
Jan 14 2020,positive,better than i expected
Jan 14 2020,positive,the ending is thrilling
Jan 14 2020,negative,this whole movie felt like a redo of other star wars films the dialogue was stale and the story was very weak this is supposed to be an epic story epic i think of the odyssey the iliad the lord of the rings this one does not hold up  it felt like they were writing the story as they were filming honestly  i didnt care about what happened to any of the characters good or bad totally not vested in any of them  this film is called rise of skywalker meh totally failed to deliver and now ben and rey can heal other people what  it is a known fact in all science fiction that if you bring someone back from the dead they do not come back whole zombies frankenstein anything
Jan 14 2020,neutral,more star tours than star wars the movie is like a series of cut scenes put together than a coherent movie but like the ride it is fun in the moment if you dont think about it to hard
Jan 14 2020,positive,great movie  much better that the last jedi
Jan 14 2020,negative,this whole new trilogy was terribly derivative and disrespectful to the legacy of the original trilogy and its heroes so sorry we missed so many opportunities here 
Jan 14 2020,negative,pretty much an effort to undo what happened in previous movies due to that and poor character and word building it creates a story that does not make sense or follow its own rules very pretty though
Jan 14 2020,positive,loved it helped bring the past star wars movies together without closing it all out
Jan 14 2020,positive,fan service and shortcuts taken but packed with plot and action was fun
Jan 14 2020,positive,wow that is allimaxlaser
Jan 14 2020,positive,we loved it definitely kept my attention and i liked that you were all caught up if you hadnt seen any of the others
Jan 14 2020,positive,star wars never disappoints this one is in my opinion is the best one yet full of action and suspense excitement and emotion
Jan 14 2020,positive,a little long  scene with the emperor near the end could have been shortened
Jan 14 2020,positive,as often the movie money mongers behind a project gutted the script resulting in a movie with hollow character development and poor storytelling which is bloated with cgi and attempts to push the merchandise they forget again and again that great storytelling is the one true basis of every successful movie
Jan 14 2020,positive,there was a lot of material covered for the movie length and it left some questions to be answered elsewhere but thats one of the great things about the star wars universe  plenty of open ends to explore through books series other movies etc
Jan 14 2020,negative,just a lot of flash bang with nothing new  same old same old  the good guys have the old stuff and the bad guys are state of the art but it is all garbage  could be all the clips that were cut out of old versions  a good one to skip
Jan 14 2020,neutral,not a bad addition at all a good way to continue the legacy
Jan 14 2020,positive,have been a star wars fan from a young age after seeing episode iv in 1979 this movie i believe was a fitting end to a beautiful story
Jan 14 2020,negative,after weeks of thought this is my review the conclusion to the skywalker saga is filled with plot holes and bad writing there are things that happen in this film that have never happened in star wars before with zero explanation you walk in with questions yet walk out with more than double what you walked in with the writers are to lazy to build a word or character they cant grab your attention for more than 5 minutes which mind you 5 minutes is about all youll get before the movie cuts to something else entirely this movie is so poorly written and badly paced the only reason i give it 1 star is because of the visuals this movie looks great other than the sloppy use of the light sabers and saber fights also theres a blaster that disappears in the film mid fight but that cant make up for how awful the story is this movie along with the last 3 before it are not cannon for me very sad about this as well life long star wars fan and hate to see bad writing and poor management on disneys part has led to this monstrosity of a film to have the name star wars in front of it
Jan 14 2020,positive,entertaining but not as amazing as i thought it would have been
Jan 14 2020,positive,living up to the star wars legacy is virtually impossible i think they did a wonderful job of coming as close as they could this movie is visually beautiful evokes all the feels and nostalgic emotion tied to the original series and decently ties up story arcs and relationships set forth in the trilogy is it perfect no however i have complaints about most of the complaints the force should be allowed to evolve and new people should be able to channel it in new ways the relationship between poe and finn was sufficiently beautiful without being romantic the plot holes are to be expected in most movies of this category and i didnt feel that they were drastic enough to warrant a bad review 5 stars to combat the barrage of what i believe are unfair ratings give it a chance 
Jan 14 2020,positive,told a great story and filled in the  history of the characters
Jan 14 2020,positive,good ending a little cheesy in parts but for being written back then all good
Jan 14 2020,positive,doesnt feel like a star wars movie but its a must see for a star wars fan
Jan 14 2020,positive,ros finished the skywalker saga perfectly there were minor flaws and some of the dialogue was weak but overall the movie made me laugh made me cry and it made me very very satisfied definitely recommend
Jan 14 2020,negative,completely underwhelming a mess of different ideas that are underdeveloped not to mention ripping off the original trilogy and bringing back characters that are dead for no reason cough cough palpatine george lucas shouldve been allowed to be involved atleast as a consultant because the whole trilogy is without direction and frankly pointless 
Jan 14 2020,negative,awfully poorly written in general painful to watch
Jan 14 2020,positive,rounded the story well great ending fear makes you feel alone you are not alone
Jan 14 2020,positive,loved it wrapped up all the years of star wars in an epic way
Jan 14 2020,negative,tried to wrap up too many things
Jan 14 2020,positive,i liked it and i loved the closure
Jan 14 2020,positive,keeps the continuity of the original trilogy lots of cameos and great special effects as usual
Jan 14 2020,positive,it was ok not great and not bad the special effects were very good but i think the story was flawed
Jan 14 2020,neutral,there are parts of this movie i absolutely adored and other parts i absolutely loathed as a massive star wars fan id say this film was fun while it lasted but forgettable and full of wasted potential
Jan 14 2020,positive,i saw it in 4d terrible  the stupid chair shaking  cold air blasting  water being emitted onto patron was totally unnecessary it took away from trying to enjoy the actual movie  the movie was definitely descent id see it again  but not in 4d ever
Jan 14 2020,positive,had flaws but appropriate way to end the main movies
Jan 14 2020,positive,loved it more the second time
Jan 14 2020,positive,dispite its flaws felt the characters arcs were fufilling and the end battle entertaining enough for me to enjoy the movie
Jan 14 2020,positive,it was a starwars movie
Jan 14 2020,positive,a visual spectacle but a lackluster conclusion to the new trilogy
Jan 14 2020,positive,palpatine was creepy as a zombie but rey and the rest of the resistance were as always  amazing
Jan 14 2020,neutral,to quote another film that expresses my feelings exactly here is my review of the rise of skywalker  ill tell you the problem with the scientific power that youre using here it didnt require any discipline to attain it you read what others had done and you took the next step you didnt earn the knowledge for yourselves so you dont take any responsibility for it you stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you could and before you even knew what you had you patented it and packaged it and slapped it on a plastic lunchbox and now youre selling it you wanna sell it  a film so fearful of its fans it basically gives up on a consistent story and provides apparently wanted ideas and shoves it into the story it is fun on its own and extremely safe   i honestly believe the last jedi is the best film of this trilogy its the closest one that echoes the feeling of the star wars universe and has the heart of the franchise the rise of skywalker is a film that has been edited way too much and so in the end the feeling is lost this trilogy barely featured the name skywalker and that was fine with me but then it pushed itself into a corner and decided to say the end of the skywalker saga we were all bound for disappointment   i really enjoyed force awakens and especially last jedi but rise of skywalker was a terrified child saying yes to everyone just to make friends but in the end it shows no spine or conviction i do not think that it was jjs fault it was just too many cooks in the kitchen
Jan 14 2020,negative,i have watched it two times in two days and i have come to the conclusion that i dont like it
Jan 14 2020,positive,loved the action and thought disney did a great job but when it comes to the star wars story there seemed to be a pattern in plot with return of the jedi
Jan 14 2020,negative,hot garbage just like the other two movies
Jan 14 2020,positive,loved the movie some scenes dragged a little but overall the story was great glad i saw it
Jan 14 2020,positive,i would recommend watching this movie it was better than 7 and 8 and though it can be frustrating at times it is a masterpiece
Jan 14 2020,positive,last jedi was better but i enjoyed this
Jan 14 2020,positive,excellent closing to an epic adventure
Jan 14 2020,negative,weak plot but better than the last jedi
Jan 14 2020,neutral,family movie night and not my choice
Jan 14 2020,positive,i think it nicely wraps up most open items from the first 8 episodes
Jan 14 2020,positive,loved it  better the 2nd time around recommend seeing it 2nd time if you are not sure the first time the movie went to quickly and i missed many things  dont try to analyst the movie  just enjoy it  it is a star wars movie
Jan 14 2020,positive,fun  not the best film in the franchise but a satisfactory ending with nods to previous episodes
Jan 14 2020,positive,it was awesome a great ending for a great saga its a pitty there wont be any more chapters
Jan 14 2020,positive,besides a few small issues i loved this film 
Jan 14 2020,positive,liked where the story went and how it ended entertaining with some humorous and sentimental parts
Jan 14 2020,positive,forced romance at the end not in line with the story
Jan 14 2020,negative,has potential but they fucked it up again
Jan 14 2020,positive,absolutely loved the ending of this trilogy one of the better star wars episodes
Jan 14 2020,negative,i saw the first movie in the theater in 1977 i wish i didnt  see this  one at all nice job disney thats whats called screwing up a free lunch
Jan 14 2020,positive,it tied up a lot of loose ends but the story line kind of felt tired tired tropes fun evening though
Jan 14 2020,negative,worst of the new movies  very predictable  lets take everything from the old movies and recycle again
Jan 14 2020,positive,great movie  very entertaining
Jan 14 2020,positive,such a great movie talk about a plot twist with rays family line    sorry its the end of the star wars series
Jan 14 2020,positive,great ending for the series it was fun seeing so many of the cast from the original three back to end the saga
Jan 14 2020,positive,could have been a little more generous with the ending i mean it was the end dont short change us otherwise it was all the good stuff you love about starwars
Jan 14 2020,positive,great movie and very surprising ending
Jan 14 2020,negative,a sloppy story with way too many contrivances doesnt stand on its own doesnt gel with any of its predecessors what a shame way to go disney
Jan 14 2020,positive,at times it almost takes you back to the magic and feel of the first films but i guess its just me being nostalgic stilla good movie
Jan 14 2020,positive,absolutely phenomenal
Jan 14 2020,positive,i waited so long to post this review because i wasnt really sure how i thought about when i first saw it opening weekend ive since come to realize i have mixed feelings about the movie maybe its just me but i like it when i see like a rebellious hero that looks they are heading towards the dark side rey the plot and character developments are not as good as the earlier films but this movie is still fun to watch none the less if you are a fan of the franchise and dont mind less character developments more albeit not amazing action and some twists and turns than youll probably enjoy this movie and i think it was a fine finale to this beloved franchise
Jan 14 2020,positive,i am not a diehard fan of the star wars sagas so i didnt know the story line with that being said it wasnt done very well  it felt too rushed  the director tried to push to much into the time he had  even the fight scenes with the swords looked staged  it was good to see the originals cast though
Jan 14 2020,negative,this felt like 2 movies being forced into 1 the who thing felt like a course correction but were already at the end i didnt like the last jedi but trying to retcon everything at the end just made it feel fake
Jan 14 2020,positive,it was ok but not great
Jan 14 2020,negative,ruined so much of the franchises history and lore
Jan 14 2020,positive,loved seeing the original cast great action
Jan 14 2020,positive,best of the sequel trilogy
Jan 14 2020,positive,dont listen to the critics great movie
Jan 14 2020,negative,rotten tomatoes doesnt let people write negative reviews for this movie so who knows if anyone will ever see this if you manage to come across this comment and you consider yourself a star wars fan do not see this movie any selfrespecting star wars fan looks at this trilogy and asks how they get away with doing this to such a beloved ip the force awakens was a shot for shot remake of a new hope the last jedi had more writers than good scenes should have never happened the rise of skywalker tries to erase tlj from history while also beginning and ending a story jj tried to make a trilogy into a quadrology he wanted to make star wars into guardians of the galaxy this trilogy will go down in history as what happens with big money tries to buy movies you cant buy a good movie you need to actually put in the time to make one
Jan 14 2020,positive,meeting personal expectations for static predictability and brand name cheese i was surprised to find that i wasnt overwhelmed by disappointed  c  64
Jan 14 2020,negative,the same thing as last time only less entertaining there was no reason to make this movie
Jan 14 2020,neutral,so many plot holes were there things i found enjoyable about it for sure was it a satisfying end to the skywalker saga definitely not just one mans opinion
Jan 14 2020,positive,ok movie just didnt have the punch i was hoping the last movie would have
Jan 14 2020,positive,if you are a star wars fan this is the movie for you it perfectly ties up the skywalker saga with enough emotion action and humor to satisfy any star wars fan
Jan 14 2020,negative,what a terrible way to end the saga felt like watching mulan in space definitely a disney movie hard to relate to the star wars story line at all entertaining but not for star wars fans
Jan 14 2020,negative,the movie was predictable and completely lacked in creativity where the old movies had a least some percentage of mystery that caused interest this movie did not although it was clear they had a large budget it was seemed to be all spent on pointless fight scenes after the first few minutes the entire rest of the movie was fight scenes following periodic witty comments the classic logarithm for which they produce every single marvel movie with this means that there was no character development of any sort no twists and the only conversing that was featured was all extremely cliche i was fairly disappointed because after all of these years the main audience is clearly older with this system the only people who end up thinking these movies are cool are children who would probably be satisfied either way it is just sad that the final movie in the series had to be ruined and as disney slowly grows and takes over more and more probably so will many more of the franchises we have previously enjoyed
Jan 14 2020,positive,used to the effects so was hoping for a better plot
Jan 14 2020,positive,great as always not the best in my opinion i thing the previous one was actualy better
Jan 14 2020,positive,lots of inconsistencies tbh
Jan 14 2020,positive,the editing was awful so much plot lost
Jan 14 2020,positive,great movie that is if youve havent been a diehard fan since the beginning to his credit the last jedi was such a mess that he wasnt left with much to work with the damage had already been done but as a standalone movie i thought it was tremendous
Jan 14 2020,positive,i dont usually do 3d movies but i will say that this movie in imax 3d was amazing the visuals jumped off the screen and really made an impact thank you lucasfilm
Jan 14 2020,positive,loved it the story just keeps getting better which  the other movies more significant starwarsfan4life forcebewithyou
Jan 14 2020,positive,it was a good movie tied up some loose ends left a few more out there was almost a fancy 2020 version of return of the jedi plot like sequel
Jan 14 2020,positive,i like everything about star wars the plot  action was great
Jan 14 2020,negative,if you watch the entire series of films none of tros makes any sense visually it is stunning but intellectually it is vacant they made all three sequel films up as they went along independent of one another of he original trilogy   dreadful
Jan 14 2020,positive,loved every minute sure you can dissect and find flaws if youre inclined but i was highly entertained
Jan 14 2020,positive,let me start by saying i am not a sw groupie i do not know the ins and outs of sw in fact i go in knowing i will be utterly confused i go see sw for nostalgia and entertainment i thought it was good i am a fan of oscar isaac but poe is not the character for him to play
Jan 14 2020,positive,they should have brought back vader why not they brought everyone else back
Jan 14 2020,negative,this movie did for me what fox did for hardcore xmen fans just trash i almost went and threw away all my star wars merchandise  the leadup to the climax was about as enjoyable as watching paint dry the climax itself was predictable and dry and the ending well no spoilers here but wtf
Jan 14 2020,positive,completely satisfying 
Jan 14 2020,neutral,what was resuscitated with such promise in force awakens ends in a hot mess with nonsensical plot twists and meh performances all around just about every performer was better in awakens 
Jan 14 2020,positive,perfect culmination of the series which ive been enjoying since childhood
Jan 14 2020,positive,great movie acting was excellent and the story was really geared toward hardcore star wars fans
Jan 14 2020,positive,as a huge star wars fan i absolutely loved this movie
Jan 14 2020,positive,a great conclusion to the current trilogy they handled the death of leia well i thought there were some campy moments that im sure bother people but star wars has always been like that the movie was super dark at times and redeemed the last jedi
Jan 14 2020,negative,exciting actionbut the development of the characters plots were weak  i didnt feel anything for them because every time the dialog was about to get into a characters story linean action scene breaks out and we never return to that story line  the movie just keeps moving forward without taking a second to build on someone   alot of actionalmost want to say that its only action
Jan 14 2020,positive,im a huge star wars fan especially the original trilogy and i loved this movie easily the best out of all the ones created with these characters 
Jan 14 2020,positive,i have gone to this movie twice in the theater once in 2d and once in 3d the 3d does not make the movie better the only good thing about this movie is that it is better than the last jedi at least it did not quite make up for the last movie but it tried
Jan 14 2020,positive,certainly not the worst in the franchise excellent visual effects makes up for some of the stories shortfalls an enjoyable end to an era if you watched the first movie 4th in the series in the theaters back in the late 70s you should be required to watch this in theater if you can recapture your childlike wonder you will love this one too
Jan 14 2020,positive,absolutely loved it if only the last movie was done better and answered more questions this one could have been even better
Jan 14 2020,positive,this was an excellent ending to the amazing skywalker saga packed with action and tons of surprises it fulfilled everything i wanted to see to complete my journey i started in may of 1977
Jan 14 2020,positive,it wasnt the best film in the trilogy but it explained a lot of open questions about who was with who family the action was ok but there were some run ons with scenes that could have end quickly but at least this episode leaves the door open for side stories like solo
Jan 14 2020,negative,the fall of star wars
Jan 14 2020,positive,a welcome return of characters from the original star wars movies
Jan 14 2020,positive,great closure to the series very well done
Jan 14 2020,positive,epic finish to the greatest story of my lifetime
Jan 14 2020,positive,an ok film at times it nearly captured the feel of the first 3 films but that might be just me being nostalgic
Jan 14 2020,positive,good attempt to save the sequel trilogy
Jan 14 2020,positive,it was assume watching it on the big screen with 3d glass  the surrounding sound  it felt like you were there in the moment
Jan 14 2020,positive,loved the film i felt like i was watching star wars again it takes you on a ride with some bumps along the way but it was a fun ride through the galaxy
Jan 14 2020,positive,the ending though predictable brought closure
Jan 14 2020,positive,i loved how all the characters reacted to each other
Jan 14 2020,positive,liked the whole thing  the message in it  never too late to redeem yourself
Jan 14 2020,positive,its star wars whats not to like
Jan 14 2020,positive,great story lots of action
Jan 14 2020,positive,great saga ending hope to see more from this series
Jan 14 2020,negative,sad ending to something that inspired generations to be better  just too much going on that makes no sense and laden with plot device after plot device
Jan 14 2020,negative,imagine taking every terrible fan fiction idea of star wars and then jamming it all in a film with terrible pacing and awkward plot development  the lack of continuity insults all the story development that was created in the original trilogy  jj abrams literally pulls things out of his anus in this film  casual star wars fans who just want something entertaining would probably enjoy this film but passionate star wars fans who actually wanted a deep plot development and new exciting ideas brought into the star wars universe will probably watch this film and stop caring about it mid way
Jan 14 2020,positive,great story telling loved that they we were able to see our princess leia
Jan 14 2020,positive,while panned for its amount of fan dedication the rise of skywalker is an emotional action packed adventure that still has its dull moments and plot holes but forgetting all that it sticks the perfect landing for the last minutes of the film that couldnt have been done better which concludes the skywalker saga with the fans in mind rather than the critics
Jan 14 2020,negative,one of the laziest soulless most nonsensical  star wars movies i have ever seen more than half of the movie is spent backtracking decisions made in the previous film while inserting as much pandering as they possibly could to appease an audience who hasnt been the target market of these films since 1982   jj ensured that the sequel trilogy characters will not be able to stand the test of time and delivering incomplete arcs for each of the main characters that are anything but satisfying he even has rey ending the movie on the very planet where lukes journey began making the film feel like it hasnt actually concluded she is left wandering and aimless with no hint of what will happen to her now  this film asks nothing of the audience treating them like they are imbeciles who will not pick up on all the contradictory writing decisions these two selfproclaimed star wars aficionados jj and terrio have conjured up they sloppily hide the fact that they had no real plan for any of these characters beyond turning them into hollow versions of themselves that have no character development in this film  this film bastardizes the legacy of the ot characters presents no original ideas and blatantly steals from the previous movie at many points rey and kylo playing tug of war the i know who your parents are holdo maneuver etc whats more they are objectively worse versions of these scenes giving us none of the emotionality that made those scenes so memorable   never is there a sense of urgency and the final order fleet and palpatine fail to seem like an actual threat at any point with the former very much being yet another rehash of starkiller base and the death star  this movie greatly misunderstands the fundamental message of star wars being about hope compassion love and the nuance of the force and instead forces its characters into these grim little boxes and told them to pick a side   maybe next time around they will get it right
Jan 14 2020,positive,enjoyable and satisfying end to the series  amazing feat after the disaster that was the ep viii the last jedi  thank goodness
Jan 14 2020,negative,this movie is a fast paced war movie in space so it could be called a star wars movie but the thematic redundance cant be outweight by this name instead of character developement we got long dead archetypes one of those is well alive and cuckels instead of a focus on the new characters of kylo ren rey finn and poe we got a series of hommages paid to previous movies these hommages are so cheap and forced that they feel like a waste of screen time not like compliments instead of an end for the new trilogy we got the absurd effort of repeating arcs that were closed 37 years ago instead of killing of the old characters in an epic battle against either kylo rens reformed first order or general hux overthrowing kylo ren and leading the first order against the resistance as well as kylo ren together with his knights of ren we got even more old characters back instead of explaining more about the established factions their differences and similarities we got a third faction which is presented as a threat to both the resistance and the first order just to be the first orders overpowered clone and ally this movie rose more questions than it answered which would be okay if it was the first or second movie in a trilogy but is just bad for the ending chapter of a saga
Jan 14 2020,positive,the new star wars films have proven to be incredibly divisive with fans  the force awakens does take a lot of beats for echoing a new hope but i really enjoyed it in fact i loved it and it is the only film in ages that i went to see twice while on its original theatrical run it felt like i had seen a star wars film i have gone on record as saying this before i have seen it many times since and i still enjoy it  i walked out of the last jedi feeling like i had wasted a few hours of my lifei walked out of the rise of skywalker feeling totally and utterly confused as to how i felt as quite honestly it is a mess of a film a total and utter mess  with the sad passing of the wonderful carrie fisher the creators were left with unused footage of her from the previous films to use and it really shows the dialogue is exceptionally clunky and it is a little uncomfortable to watch there is however a distinct feeling that you got to give the a pass on this as it is what they had to work with i found myself uncomfortable with how awkward it was but also forgiving for this was the material they had to make work it really doesnt  on the same subject of dialogue prepare yourself going in for heavy exposition  as above mild spoilers ahead but if you have seen the trailers then you already have massive spoilers this does not help when the film is already predictable there is a very early scene where rey is asked a question and her answer made me think  oh  so that is how they are going to end this  and they do  the last jedi hangs around the rise of skywalker like a lodestone and its obvious jj abrams is back peddling desperately to undo some of the flaws of of the previous film there is an ever present feeling that he has got back from holiday to find the office junior has made a mess of things and he is doing the best he can to engage damage limitation  so is the movie a total mess yes is it a good movie no is it a bad movie  weirdly  no  unlike the last jedi there are many scenes that stick in the mind and i really want to see it again i want to see it again unencumbered by guessing what is going to happen and slumping with disappointment when i find out i was right  it does feel like it has many elements of a star wars film without being a star wars film and yet many of the elements alone are actually enjoyable i could mention many scenes that stuck in my head but kylo ren who was never one of me favourite characters has a blink and you will miss it moment of such awesomeness i could have cheered whilst the film itself never feels epic on its own it does feel epic as being part of the franchise it is held up by its own mythology and roots  and because of that it does feel like it bookends the skywalker saga not totally and utterly satisfyingly but not disastrously there in lays the strangest feeling of all and why i was so confused when i left the cinema as a star wars film in itself it does not feel like one of the franchise but looking at it as a whole it does  i did not so much as enjoy the film as witness the ending of a story i had followed since i was a child  it did not leave me empty and it did not leave me fulfilled  it did however leave me wanting to see it again soon and on the way home i almost popped into a toy shop to buy a lightsabre  so a mess  but not a total failure
Jan 14 2020,positive,liked it but felt like scenes where missing still
Jan 14 2020,negative,i just feel like this series fell and with it my love for star wars with the events happening as they do maybe in the future we can get a better story and my love shall return the effect were nice but everything else just didnt do it for me i say skip this movie and read some of the old novels
Jan 14 2020,neutral,wooden characters chaotic plot a sort of creepy cgi leia and a very confusing interpretation of the force on the other hand there were many callouts to other plot points and characters from throughout the series it didnt quite live up to my skyhigh expectations for the end of the series but my kids said they liked it better than other star wars movies
Jan 14 2020,positive,great storytelling ending of episodes nerding out when lightsabers came out 
Jan 14 2020,positive,good for nonoriginal series fans i guess the ending really let me down the message conveyed was that you should discard your origin if it does not seem to reflect how you view yourself and that it is ok to usurp the origin of those that you do identify with this shows a complete lack of selfpride perseverance and rebirth into something new from the origins from which you forged yourself totally a wrong message for kids and young adults
Jan 14 2020,negative,glad that disney has finished ruining the skywalker geore lucas saga im just gonna pretend episodes 79 didnt happen
Jan 14 2020,negative,it was as good as anyone could expect  and still it was terrible if you want to learn why just go to youtube  there are tons of videos that do a wonderful job explaining how this sequel trilogy was doomed from the get go  the cast is wonderful they did the absolute best they could with the material they had  jj did his best to attempt to make a movie that felt like star wars unfortunately the writers and producers of this movieand all of the sequel trilogyjust didnt understand what made a star wars movie a star wars movie with time we can let this fade into the past  we can let it die  kill it even  if we have to 
Jan 14 2020,negative,too all over the place smh a true disappointment on have a terrific saga ended
Jan 14 2020,positive,the movie was entertaining but the story didnt make me care about any of the characters or what was happening to them
Jan 14 2020,positive,slow beginning great ending
Jan 14 2020,positive,the acting of adam driver and the music of 87 year old john williams makes it worth the time especially if you are a fan of the series
Jan 14 2020,positive,its good entertaining and wrapped it all up just like i wanted got me to see it twice its star wars so always a must see
Jan 14 2020,positive,kept my attention throughout the movie good visuals and computer graphics

Jan 14 2020,positive,hmmmmmm enjoyed it but would definitely change things no spoilers lol
Jan 14 2020,positive,sound was too loud and the movie was silly
Jan 14 2020,positive,look this film expects you to just go with the flow and believe certain aspects without being introduced prior i decided to just go with it and i found myself having a much better time to me the ending was pretty sweet and it kinda sets up a future check this one out and make up your own mind
Jan 14 2020,positive,the movie was amazing it was weird that there were commercials before the movie
Jan 14 2020,negative,set your bar low and you probably wont be disappointed story has so many holes in it its sad more of a bon voyage movie than anything else too bad
Jan 14 2020,positive,great movie a must see for all i do recommend seeing all previous star wars movies first
Jan 14 2020,negative,starwars is dead the movie was terrible but not as bad as the last jedi and thats not a testimony to how good this movie is its a testiment to how horrendous the last jedi is
Jan 14 2020,positive,a perfect finale for the series i actually saw a new hope when it came out originally and have been a fan ever since
Jan 14 2020,positive,enjoyed the movie a little too long
Jan 14 2020,positive,an entertaining movie with the sometimes overshadowing weakness of having to correct its  predecessor and tendency to hide this by using an insane amount of fan service the first act was messy but the rest of the movie exceeded expectations well worth a watch
Jan 14 2020,positive,we loved the movie it was an emotional movie with lots of action it was a great conclusion to the skywalker saga
Jan 14 2020,positive,it finishes the nine films with a bit of confusion but a satisfying conclusion could it have been better sure it could also have been a lot worse
Jan 14 2020,positive,im a casual star wars fan i left the theatre feeling highly entertained with stunning visuals and great action story was okay but all in all it was a great time in the theatre  
Jan 14 2020,positive,loved it this one was more emotional and the end left me with questions saw it in xd glad we did big explosive scenes rocked the walls one of my favorite of the series
Jan 14 2020,positive,it was as if i were eating my favorite pie and it needed a little more something to make it taste like i like it  but i still wanted to keep eating it and was eventually satisfied when all was gone
Jan 14 2020,positive,they forced lando into the movie made it kwirky and dumb at times
Jan 14 2020,positive,i loved it i know a lot of people were disappointed but i feel like whatever the last one was would be disappointing because its the last one it was consistent with other episodes as far as action and story
Jan 14 2020,positive,i wasnt planning on seeing this in the theater but after friends and family commented on how much they liked it i just had to see it for myself i was not disappointed so much better than i expected be sure to see it on the big screen
Jan 14 2020,positive,loved how it all came full circle
Jan 14 2020,positive,pretty good ending for all of the original characters apparently jj abrams had additional storytelling that disney cut out i would have liked to see jjs full version
Jan 14 2020,positive,waited 40 years for this movie  it was great  absolutely loved it  watched it with my son on opening night dbox and with my daughter almost two months later after we bingewatched all the other star wars movies she had not seen   perfect way to end the series
Jan 14 2020,positive,i thought the movie was great
Jan 14 2020,positive,good job all around
Jan 14 2020,positive,what a great ending to the skywalker saga as a star wars fan that was hurt by the poor writing and direction of the last jedi i felt like the fun and mystery were finally put back into star wars thank you disney also if you have a chance to see this movie in a 4dx theater its worth every penny what a ride
Jan 14 2020,positive,ok but rushed with many plot holes
Jan 14 2020,positive,great movie  wonderful tribute to all the previous star wars movies we only wish for ben solo to live
Jan 14 2020,positive,great movie true to the starwars epic
Jan 14 2020,positive,it was much better than i had expected based on other peoples opinions however it still left something to be desired something hard to put ones finger on
Jan 14 2020,positive,i was entertained and on the edge of my seat every minute  every t was crossed and every i was dotted  every star wars fan should have felt closure i laughed i criedi will never forget
Jan 14 2020,positive,great ride clear finish
Jan 14 2020,positive,i thought it was a beautiful love story about love winning against hate a fitting tribute to the old star wars with amazing special effects fun from beginning to end best light saber battles
Jan 14 2020,negative,spoilers  totally and utterly incoherent   an absurd plot that spends its entire time trying to actively retcon the complete and utter massacre of the intellectual property that rian johnson carried out in the las jedi but in doing so forgets to actually develop any characters in any meaningful way   the whole series of events is entirely predicated on nothing more than luck theres no way for characters to know where the other is yet absurd turns of events happen that just luckily put them in the right place at the right time daggers that just happen to be the exact object that they need one object on an entire planet are found in random pits they fall into when being chased   a complete and utter disregard for the wider world of star wars with the force becoming the ultimate deus ex machina plot device  something that is repeated over and over ad nauseam from a wider plot point of view bringing back palpatine makes the entire original trilogy and all those characters completely pointless luke failed and turned into a total idiot imagine turning luke skywalker into an absolute scrote  the horror vader never beat palpatine and never brought balance to the force his sacrifice was meaningless and the only person who actually could beat palpatine was rey who is a palpatine all the skywalkers are dead and in the ultimate piss on their grave moment she a palpatine decides to call herself a skywalker after she beats him   what a complete mess script writers of the future please take note you need to plan your characters and stories meticulously making shit up as you go along is not writing
Jan 14 2020,positive,good ending to the saga
Jan 14 2020,positive,saw it in 4xd sonawesome
Jan 14 2020,positive,taken from the perspective of a long journey of movies in the series and expecting a feel good movie and youll be okay  die hard fans will analyze and point out the plot holes and the what the moments
Jan 14 2020,positive,this movie is stupid but i loved it
Jan 14 2020,positive,really great movie that is fan service know that going in only complaint was the acting at certain portions that lead to a loss of emotion in certain spots star wars fans are hard to please i believe they did a good job 
Jan 14 2020,positive,loved it hated to see it end will see again
Jan 14 2020,positive,went in with high expectations and they were met
Jan 14 2020,positive,not a very good plot but i had a fun time watching it they did too many pump fakes where they make you think somebody died but then surprise theyre still alive just a few pretty cheap plot moves light sabers are still cool though and i like some of the characters
Jan 14 2020,positive,loved it fixed what the last one messed up nicely wrapped up everything and a nice ending to the skywalker films
Jan 14 2020,positive,loved that ben became a jedigood in the end
Jan 14 2020,positive,this movie pulled the last 2 together so it all worked
Jan 14 2020,positive,this film was amazing it help fill the gap fans felt after the release of the last jedi it leaves the end of the skywalker saga on a high note this movie was imaginative and will appeal to all star wars fans it had references to the original trilogy from locations to music so get your wookie copilot and jump to hyperspace this will be the best two hours of your life
Jan 14 2020,positive,i really enjoyed this movie i am not a starwars expert but for the love of movies and excellent entertainment this movie is worth your money
Jan 14 2020,positive,highly entertaining however the ending falls flat and jj takes way to much liberty with the force for the final movie
Jan 14 2020,positive,great movie acting was off
Jan 14 2020,positive,dont listen to all the bad reviews people look for things to complain about the movie kept me interested with lots of twists and turns good flick
Jan 14 2020,positive,i love all star wars
Jan 14 2020,positive,as a lifelong star wars fan i couldnt be happier with a conclusion to the story so far daisy ridley and adam driver are electric each character gets a logical arc  the cinematography is incredible and the movie is just phenomenal seen it four times in theaters with my wife so far
Jan 14 2020,positive,good solid storytelling visuals are fantastic proper conclusion to the tale of the skywalkers
Jan 14 2020,positive,great ending to a 43 year epic saga
Jan 14 2020,positive,a fantastically entertaining and emotional end to the trilogy and the series overall within the movie chronology
Jan 14 2020,positive,great finale if you dont like it you just dont like star wars
Jan 14 2020,positive,answered so many questions great movie
Jan 14 2020,positive,the story line was a bit weak the story would get set up for an awesome action fight and the action would just fizzle
Jan 14 2020,positive,very good movie i guess it was a decent ending for the saga
Jan 14 2020,positive,i liked everything about it
Jan 14 2020,positive,star wars the rise of skywalker is one of those special things were the sum is greater than the parts  there are huge things about this movie that i didnt like but in the end it didnt matter it was still star wars  it was a fun breakneck ride that didnt stop for air it just kept going and going  i could nitpick lots of things to death but judging it overall instead of this thing and that thing and that other thing it was amazing  but as its star wars  there is going to be plenty to dissect and pour over and nitpick to death  right i am reveling in the glory of star wars
Jan 14 2020,positive,star warsy and iconic
Jan 14 2020,positive,its a great movie for what we were dealt with from the last jedi i think jj did the best he could

Jan 14 2020,positive,i really enjoyed it
Jan 14 2020,positive,entertainment and fun graphics were exceptional
Jan 14 2020,positive,didnt like the ending tried to wrap up too many story lines
Jan 14 2020,positive,there was plenty of action and special effects the story line followed with the previous episodes which help make the movie more interesting the movie is a bit long though
Jan 14 2020,positive,fantastic ending to the skywalker saga
Jan 14 2020,positive,movie had stretches of dead slow action otherwise a great star wars story
Jan 14 2020,positive,this movie was waaaaay better than the last jedi and did everything it could to fix everything it could with what narrative was left from someone did not like the last movie i did say i can appreciate this one it was a good movie overall not perfect but made me feel just a slight bit better about starwars as a whole after i swore i would never watch a disney starwars again
Jan 14 2020,positive,fantastic sequel loved the cameos from prior characters  held my interest all the way thru
Jan 14 2020,positive,great movie sad that its the end of the saga 
Jan 14 2020,positive,loved it will deff see it again and again
Jan 14 2020,positive,too long but entertaining
Jan 14 2020,positive,as star wars fans since the very beginning we are pleased with the way the series was wrapped up
Jan 14 2020,positive,movie was dark literally plot was on the go during nonstop actions  needed some downtime to develop charactersrelationships etc and a little humor inserted wouldnt have hurt
Jan 14 2020,positive,as a star wars fan from childhood  i felt that this movie was a fitting end and completely satisfied me as a conclusion to the story i began when i was a child i absolutely loved it and would go see it again in a heartbeat
Jan 14 2020,positive,dont listen to the naysayers i really loved it of course anyone could pick it apart but i think it fits in well to the overall story arc go see it
Jan 14 2020,positive,an amazing way to end this movie saga so beautifully filmed liked the added new characters and the wonderful way the most loved characters luke leia and hans were back just an awesome awesome awesome film thanks so much
Jan 14 2020,positive,fun movie good dialogue entertaining story stayed true to the original star wars storyline some plot holes yet still enjoyable
Jan 14 2020,positive,imax entirely tooo loud my apple watch has a decibel  meter on it a lot of the movie had sound levels greater than 82 and topping to 96 lots of noise levels around 92 decibels could not get emotionally involved with most of the characters too many sky battles and light saber battles not many people in the theater either
Jan 14 2020,neutral,stupid plot poorly written and bad acting the franchise just continues to go in the wrong direction rogue one was excellent but the last three star wars movies have been trash
Jan 14 2020,positive,story was good   special fxs good just enough humor for all
Jan 14 2020,negative,the movie is extremely poorly paste causes many plot holes in previouse movies destroying the cannon set by george lucas it felt like jj tried to make his own tlj while also making ros twice the movie double the disappointment
Jan 14 2020,positive,excellent incorporation of old stars and focus on the new rising stars  wrapped things up nicely and even left a crack open for another trilogy
Jan 14 2020,negative,it was better than last jedi at least
Jan 14 2020,positive,one if the greatest star wars movie ever
Jan 14 2020,positive,entertaining movie if you can turn your brain off while watching it but it gets worse the more you think about it 
Jan 14 2020,positive,good flick good job bringing billy dee williams back
Jan 14 2020,positive,enjoyable movie even though the story was insulting as a huge star wars fan
Jan 14 2020,positive,only if you have seen the rest and filter out how insane suffering and death of hole civiliasations is marginalised by focusing on some lucky heroes
Jan 13 2020,positive,it was ok not nearly as bad as the last jedi it did help tie things together in a bit of a rushed way
Jan 13 2020,positive,its a good fun time its absolutely in line with the star wars franchise dont expect some amazing intricate plot or nomination worthy acting just sit back and enjoy
Jan 13 2020,negative,this franchise is becoming less of a parody than spaceballs   adam driver is the only reason to see this movie or because for some reason everyone myself included considers every starwars release a must see 310
Jan 13 2020,positive,amazing special effects as always good action the whole movie
Jan 13 2020,positive,i really enjoyed it its not perfect but its much better then the previous two and ties things up in a pleasing manner
Jan 13 2020,positive,loved the scenery and story best one of the new star wars
Jan 13 2020,positive,the critics are idiots  amazing exciting and worth seeing multiple times
Jan 13 2020,negative,i enjoyed kylos arc and surprisingly his dynamic with rey but the story was way over the top rushed and sloppy very disrespectful to george lucas and would have to loved to see a fitting and respectful end to the skywalkers
Jan 13 2020,positive,an entertaining movie with flaws
Jan 13 2020,positive,i loved the end of the skywalker saga  i love learning the origin story of rey the use of carrie fisher posthumous footage was great i look forward to seeing the extended cut later on 2020
Jan 13 2020,positive,i personally really enjoyed this film as a starwars fan despite popular belief and reviews it of course had its problems but those are inevitable as it is such a complex franchise i was very hesitant to see this film due to how incredibly horrible the last one was but i was pleasantly surprised i loved seeing new characters as well as old i think they ended the saga as good as they possibly could have with what they have set up for themselves in the previous films the actors all did amazing especially adam driver i would enjoy seeing it again
Jan 13 2020,positive,dont listen to the critics was a good movie it had to live up to the 8th movie which was awful but they did very well with what they had good job jj
Jan 13 2020,positive,excellant movie a must buy on blu ray 
Jan 13 2020,positive,i liked the movie overall but it didnt wow me the storyline was ok but i did not like the dialogue this felt more disney than star wars
Jan 13 2020,negative,this was the biggest movie disappointment ive had since the blair witch project in 1999 its such a pathetic end to the saga that i wish i could wipe it from my memory it was chalk full of poorly written downcycled back pedaled plot points and an ending that seemed like it was pulled straight from jjs overrated ass
Jan 13 2020,positive,whether or not youve liked all of the previous 8 star wars films this has been an epic series that said i was somewhat disappointed with the lack of a coherent climactic close to the story it feels like it should have been bigger but the story over the last 3 movies did meet a welcome conclusion
Jan 13 2020,negative,very disappointed by far the worst star wars movie made the story was way to far fetched and just flat out ridiculous would have been better as a video game but not a movie its a shame
Jan 13 2020,positive,i am not a robot this movie was to close out the saga were mistakes made yes was i entertained yes would i see it again yes do i still hate jarjar and the last jedi yes
Jan 13 2020,positive,loved it  i went in with low expectations and i have my gripes about how disney has handled the final trilogy but jj abrams did a great job trying to wrap up not only this trilogy but a 9 movie saga  it was a fun movie that brought back some old characters in a way that finished the story in a satisfying way  the critics are dumb  go by the audience scores and that will tell you more about a movie than anything  its good  go see it you wont be disappointed
Jan 13 2020,negative,incoherent plot committed completely to giving unearned fan moments instead of even attempting to make an interesting movie or trilogy no convincing character arcs whatsoever a failure not just on the part of abrams but on the part of kennedylucasfilmdisney for failing to come into the whole trilogy with any plan whatsoever
Jan 13 2020,positive,same type story line as the first  good against evil nice bringing back actors to do history of family  nothing really new and endearing oh  maybe the little cycle creature
Jan 13 2020,positive,great conclusion to this major epic some questions werent answered but the movie itself is great
Jan 13 2020,negative,its truly difficult as a major fan of science fiction to sit thru another jj abrams film filled with loud unnecessary action and a ridiculous absurd plot im tempted to write a great deal about how very much i hated this film but no one cares what i think this nonsense will continue to dump buckets of money into the disney barrel and im sure will be repeated far into the 21st century with more and more drivel the only way to short circuit that depressing future would be for audiences to some how realize how much damage these films inflict on ones ears eyes and brainand stop paying money to further destroy a once venerable art form lotsa luck
Jan 13 2020,positive,loved it answered a lot of questions
Jan 13 2020,positive,like a tale from ohenry plenty of twists and turnsi am so glad i did not watch any trailorsi was totally ready for anything in the film
Jan 13 2020,positive,love the visual effects
Jan 13 2020,negative,fan service doesnt make a film automatically great you have to tell a compelling intriguing and though through story as well abrams must have missed that part
Jan 13 2020,negative,trash movie all about fan service jj strikes again
Jan 13 2020,negative,worst movie ever fell asleep at the end
Jan 13 2020,negative,trash  better than the last one but thats not saying much
Jan 13 2020,positive,compared to the last jedi this one is worlds ahead but its far from perfect i still feel lucass story wouldve been much better but this is what we got and it is star wars so i love the franchise but this trilogy just wasnt what it needed to be
Jan 13 2020,positive,amazing movie in almost every way a million times better than tlj cant wait for directors cut
Jan 13 2020,positive,cinematography was very good lots of action  all the characters were well represent
Jan 13 2020,positive,pretty good my mother liked it
Jan 13 2020,positive,cinematically impressive however very let down by the storyplot it was cliched and inconclusive seeming as it was supposed to be a finale
Jan 13 2020,neutral,was it entertaining yes was it a fitting finalé to the skywalker trilogy well it was a finalé of sorts  having really enjoying the force awakens and quite enjoyed the last jedi i was really looking forward to discovering reys backstory and how the empire would be destroyed this time but my hopes were left unfulfilled yes there are funny moments in the film mainly provided by c3p0 and cheesy oneliners and nods to the fans the overall plot is muddled there are twists and turns in the plot that just seem to be thrown in there without much thought and some of these just feel plain wrong  i cant blame the actors  i thought they all did a good job really it was just the script and plot became overly complicated and unnecessary  by all means watch the film youll probably be entertained by it just dont be too disappointed by the last line my god that was irritating
Jan 13 2020,positive,unlike most fans i can simply enjoy it for what it is
Jan 13 2020,negative,watching jj abrams undo most of the last movie ideas is heartbreaking
Jan 13 2020,positive,completed the story  rushed at times had its good moments  left unfulfilled
Jan 13 2020,negative,already did a review but it was somehow erased  just to keep it simple the movie has no story  edit typo
Jan 13 2020,positive,ignore the critics  this is everything star wars fans could ask for  fantastic
Jan 13 2020,negative,this movie brakes so many things we know about sw universe it is still better than previous part but it pains me how much plotholes were created jj did what he could but movie seems assembled in a way that makes no sense i really hope it was not intentional maybe there is something im missing but as last movie in this series it is just stupid in some places also i would be more than happy to speak with someone that is able to give this movie 5 starts i would really like to know how it keeps score over 85 oo it is just baffling for me
Jan 13 2020,positive,well from the start the movie felt forced the scrolling storyline at the begin felt rushed and as if the writers had given up  then the story  well all the special effects and action doesnt help bad acting and forced funny moments  the writers have lost focus on the original story and by using the original cast to help  get the story to the original is very poor  mark hamils performance is getting worse as he gets older  i always maintain they should have left the original movies alone and started a whole series from scratch  the casting has always been a issue too  ive never liked adam driver as kylo ren  he just looks wrong for the part and has to be one of the worst actors in the series  disney should have gone the way of 3d animation for its movies as some people have done with gaming clips on youtube atleast the special effects are better  
Jan 13 2020,positive,dull devoid of creativity but still having its enjoyable aspects star wars the rise of skywalker cements its place alongside the godfather part iii spiderman 3 and the dark night rises as the meh third movie that serves as a fitting end to the saga yet an unsatisfying an rather disappointing movie if look at on its own
Jan 13 2020,positive,predictable but in the best possible way  loved it
Jan 13 2020,positive,basic great star wars story with unbelievable production
Jan 13 2020,positive,good transition from older generation to younger of star wars fans
Jan 13 2020,positive,its pacing is strange and 95 of the scenes are recycled none of the characters have a real story other than rey supposedly being related to palpetine because of vague reasons
Jan 13 2020,neutral,at least i didnt came out of the theater mad that time but still
Jan 13 2020,positive,yes this movie has plot holes yes it has plot conveniences and yes it is rushed it is also obvious now that jj abrams and rian johnson had two very different visions and that there was either no outline for this whole trilogy or two very different onesbut as someone who adored the force awakens and hated the last jedi this film feels like a cinematic apologydaisy ridley and adam driver were both phenomenal and were never better as rey and kylo ren the adventure vibe of the first act is a love letter to spielberg classics like indiana jones and 40s serial adventures one of george lucas biggest inspirations for star wars finally we get to see our new leads rey finn and poe go on an adventure together they have an amazing chemistry and this should have happened before the old crew returns as well and every single one of them acts as a mentor figurejj treats luke han leia and lando with nothing but respecteven the emperor who to be honest came out of nowhere surprisingly works once again as the single most evil person in the galaxy the action is amazing  the acting terrific and the finale satisfyingnot perfect but satisfying to me the end of the skywalker saga will always be return of the jedi but as a conclusion for this new trilogy it does workand it gets way too much hate in my opinion the set design the cinematography and john williams score must also not be ignoredmay the force be with you
Jan 13 2020,positive,star wars the rise of skywalker was fun from beginning to end the number of old friends that come back to bid us farewell was a treat unto itself the new characters introduced blended right into the story the rise of skywalker moved me to tears many times aside from one totally unnecessary romantic moment i loved this movie though it is mixed with the sadness of saying goodbye
Jan 13 2020,positive,this movie was surprisingly good i liked it despite many people hating on the new trilogy
Jan 13 2020,positive,it spends a lot of time trying to make up for the disaster of the last jedi i wasnt expecting much so in that respect it over delivered the sloppy writing continues a good amount of dialogue recycled from previous star war films but on the whole the story is entertaining in retrospect i wish this film could have been split into 2 films with more attention paid to the story in general and get rid of the last jedi very aggravating to sit through
Jan 13 2020,positive,suspense the battle the dialogue graphic
Jan 13 2020,negative,this movie was a riskless pile of horse manure script was terrible and completely ignored the second film it was confusing it was awful
Jan 13 2020,positive,many problems were present but it was a very watchable movie
Jan 13 2020,positive,i believe this is my favorite episode of the star wars saga it was full of action and drama with a special twist and just the right amount of comedy
Jan 13 2020,positive,loved the many cameos of so many sw characters the treatment of leia was beautiful there were some plot holes dont star destroyers have shields but overall the movie was well worth it
Jan 13 2020,positive,ending should have been better but i enjoy it
Jan 13 2020,negative,sinopsis the wizard did it  terrible
Jan 13 2020,positive,loved it liked how loose ends tied up
Jan 13 2020,neutral,fun butkinda pointless bringing back palpy was always going to be an eh move for me the pacing was terrible and too many characters to actually be capable of focusing on any of them enough for there to be any development among my least favorite star wars movies im good on star wars movies for a while now
Jan 13 2020,positive,excellent we really enjoyed the movie a must see
Jan 13 2020,positive,i finally saw star wars the rise of skywalker last nightin dolby at amc vernon hills  i liked the movie and seeing the ninepart epic starting in 1977 completed  the picture and sound were awesome and the movie had the fun and adventurous vibe of a new hope   the first onethird of the movie was cool but didnt totally grab me  but those plot surprises in the middle the ghosts of han and luke really kickstarted things for me  the last twothirds were stupendous especially the space battle and confrontation between rey and emperor palpatine  im glad poe was named general i liked the various alien characters introduced too  i think rey and finn had their strongest performances in this movie
Jan 13 2020,positive,pretty good star wars movir
Jan 13 2020,neutral,while infinitely better than tlj this is largely because they retcon that movie and actively try to fix its mistakes the take away from this movie is that the skywalkers dont matter vader is little more than a footnote in the galactic history the first two films of this series could literally be completely done away with and have no consequences on this film this would have been a great first film in the trilogy if you add about 10 minutes of introduction material to familiarize the audience with the characters rise of skywalker is entertaining on its own and unlike tlj will not enrage the serious fan however this entire trilogy was mishandled from the start and is a very disappointing ending to a legendary series and a huge disservice to the first family of the star wars universe
Jan 13 2020,positive,i really enjoyed the movie i thought it was better than the two previous one a lot of action fast paced
Jan 13 2020,negative,this would be nothing more than a scatterbrained scifi film with an often baffling plot if it werent the last movie in an epic saga thats touched generations but it is which makes it an egregious reversal of the works that came before it and a slipshod ending to the series that makes you wonder  what did the sequel trilogy add to the star wars story at all
Jan 13 2020,positive,it was fast paced and interesting  i didnt fall asleep
Jan 13 2020,positive,i really liked thought that jj abrams did a great job of wrapping things up the small touches were the best like chewie finally getting his medal he was cheated out of in a new hope
Jan 13 2020,negative,honestly this movie is a mess jj abrams who im generally a fan of seems more interested in kowtowing to the loudest and most obnoxious corners of the star wars fan base than he does in actually crafting the best story and best ending to the skywalker saga also his attempts to undo much of what rian johnson did in the previous film feel both disjointed and petty i give it two stars in that it was fun to watch for its visuals and its humor but the story is a mess
Jan 13 2020,positive,i loved this movie i understand that it was a bit fast paced but it still hit all the marks im looking for in a star wars movie
Jan 13 2020,positive,it was pretty cheesy like the original and having all evil summed up in one bad emperor has all the moral depth of a batman tv episode from the 1960s but i liked the idea of rea becoming a skywalker
Jan 13 2020,positive,absolutely fantastic movie
Jan 13 2020,positive,i think it was justice to what rían johnson did with star wars  the force awakens was beautiful to me and set up millions of possibilities with the new trilogy then rian killed all of the story and meaning of star wars in the last jedi and what ji did with the movie i personally think it does justice for everything that happened
Jan 13 2020,positive,great finish to the starwars series an emotional rollercoaster with twists and turns and the most heartpounding story and action
Jan 13 2020,negative,what a complete mess the passing of this film is all over the place very over done on the fan service massive plot holes jump cuts and terrible acting they fly nowthey fly now after last jedi i thought this would be a train wreck and i was right stick with the original 3 films
Jan 13 2020,negative,after 23rds of a trilogy with no overall arc or direction rise of skywalker tries to fit three films worth of storyline into one it doesnt work  rife with plot holes and inconsistencies its a bunch fast action sequences stuck together with minimal room for character development or interaction  messy and incoherent
Jan 13 2020,negative,terrible jj abrahams is a star trek fan and he fucked up star wars
Jan 13 2020,negative,i am so disappointed what a way to make the franchise take several steps backwards pointlessly undoing the progress the previous entry made and that kiss what
Jan 13 2020,positive,always dependable for an entertaining movie unique imagery not usually in a star wars movie
Jan 13 2020,neutral,nothing new just closed old stories
Jan 13 2020,negative,split in the middle on this film  beautiful and epic its action packed and continually trying to push you to the storys end  at the same time it is sloppy  storytelling is all over the place with incomplete neglected story lines   i love watching but hated following along and not hearing a story  its difficult to discuss with friends so we dont talk about it  so disappointing to not be able to share this with friends
Jan 13 2020,positive,i really enjoyed how they tied the whole series up in the end  i found it totally enjoyable and thrill ride
Jan 13 2020,positive,they did a great job finishing the loose ends 
Jan 13 2020,positive,great movie recommend
Jan 13 2020,positive,great movie didnt expect to see some of the twists and turns this movie offered  special effects were great probably one of the best star wars movies to date  cant believe this is the last one ive been watching this series since i was much younger
Jan 13 2020,positive,all the kylo ren and ben solo scenes were my favorite but the pacing was too fast i cant believe too much action in a sw movie was too much for me daisy did great i loved john isaac was perfect
Jan 13 2020,positive,much better than the first two sequels
Jan 13 2020,negative,the film was honestly just what i expected the mess of a conclusion that stems from not having a thought out plan or directorial view for the trilogy the first film was a new hope rip off the second film really pulled away from a lot of the tropes and did a great job of stripping star wars down to what is really important not lineage or generational power but good will and hope this third film ruins all of the good work of the second film and backtracks to a very underwhelming conclusion it makes a couple of brave storytelling decisions but never has the balls to stick to them and retcons them in the later scenes it really is quite tragic there is also a horrifically forced love story at the very end that is never set up or justified in any way
Jan 13 2020,negative,the original star wars were amazing but now ep 79 have no point its only a lot of beauty pictures no actor playing no scenario disney filmed it only for making money its desgusting
Jan 13 2020,negative,disgusting no story mary sue bs paplapatines return makes no sense
Jan 13 2020,negative,it seemed that all of the writers had their own agenda and it showed this movie like the last jedi looked thrown together to make the most epic fight scenes but lacked any real depth fin doesnt show any signs in the first two movies to be force sensitive and then all of a sudden he is in this movie there are too many things to type out that i found wrong with this movie
Jan 13 2020,positive,4dx is the way to go
Jan 13 2020,positive,it was true to the original trilogy lots of action dont want to say more and be a spoiler
Jan 13 2020,positive,its very enjoyable and gives the saga a satisfying ending but like most of jj abrams work it isnt very original
Jan 13 2020,neutral,star wars rise of skywalker is just fanservice it isnt bad it isnt good its just mediocre the worst part about the movie is how it completely just tries and forgets about episode eight and it should have stayed on the track that ryan johnson set it on you may think last jedi was bad or good but you should at least not get rid of a whole movie plotline someone worked on in the end the movie made me say leaving the theater i did not just watch the last star wars movie
Jan 13 2020,positive,it was enjoyable  very questionable decisions made by abrams but enjoyable
Jan 13 2020,positive,already long movie but some plot points needed more bows on them  didnt like that certain characters died  liked the feel of the movie  the ending of the bad empire feels incompelte
Jan 13 2020,positive,very entertaining throughout the visuals and special effects are excellent the story line was good my wife and i liked everything about it i think the critics are being way too harsh enjoy it for what it isepic star wars
Jan 13 2020,positive,a satisfying conclusion to this particular trilogy this committeemade film has enough to satisfy every star wars fan whoever their favorite is
Jan 13 2020,positive,i thought it was a fitting end to the saga  things were tied up a little too neatly everything ended the way we all wanted it to unless you were a fan of the sith lords but i liked it a lot
Jan 13 2020,positive,it was a very moving storyline the characters were well developed and the acting was very good i would watch the movie again
Jan 13 2020,negative,poor ending for a poor trilogy  there were so many problems with this films story  the return of palpatine was a huge let down  so many lame story points  it did not end the skywalker saga at all  stupid
Jan 13 2020,negative,they failed very disappointed i have never not liked and endorsed a star wars movie till now
Jan 13 2020,positive,i always enjoy star wars movies and this was no exception that being said it fell far short of its potential potential the story felt too rushed with important plot points completely unexplained and the stakes didnt seem real it was also pretty obviously trying to undo some of the bold and interesting storytelling choices of the last jedi on the other hand the completion of the character arches for rey finn poe kylo and even c3p0 were satisfying for me   aside from the plot this movie excelled the cinematography and the choreography of the fight scenes were mesmerizing the music was incredible probably my favorite star wars score to date though it disappointingly didnt include duel of the fates as the trailer led me to believe it would   overall probably one of the higher of the lower tier of star wars movies it could definitely be better but that didnt stop me from enjoying it nor will it prevent me from seeing it again
Jan 13 2020,positive,lots of action and some surprises
Jan 13 2020,negative,this was pretty terrible my husband who likes all movies actually called it awful the acting was incredibly poor and it oozed with cheese i really enjoyed the past star wars this one couldnt get over soon enough 20 bucks and 2 12 hours we definitely wasted
Jan 13 2020,positive,deus ex machina followed by diabolous ex machina lead villain comes right the hl out of nowhere jedi powers unbelievable even in the universe lore at least 6 beloved characters robbed of their agency pros lots of action plenty of meaningful interaction new toys to buyi guess
Jan 13 2020,positive,i thought the movie was a fitting and grand conclusion to an epic saga tied up a lot of plotlines and heavily had callbacks to the previous films  however i thought you could see this movie in a stand alone way without its companions and it would work well   this isnt an art film it wont challenge you on an intellectual level but its a great film for fans and people who like compelling characters and great story
Jan 13 2020,positive,i felt there was a bit too much swashbuckling type action samo samo story got to destroy final order fleet impossible to have a thousand bad guy ships hiding for many years after 9 movies we still dont know exactly who was anakinsdarth vaders father or who are reys natural parents
Jan 13 2020,positive,as a lifelong star wars fan i thought abrams did the best he could with the material he had as a fan i dont agree with many of the plot points but the action was spectacular and would recommend that you see it if you like scifi action or the force i am glad to be taking a brief break from the movies but i am looking forward to the next series outside of the skywalker saga for those of you who have heard about the jj cut i truly hope they bring it as i felt disappointed by the mindblowing ending that was promised
Jan 13 2020,positive,everything you want in a star wars movie
Jan 13 2020,positive,there were some holes or things that didnt make sense in the movie that i didnt like but with a new director i get it there were a few things that happened that didnt need to but again i get it the graphics were great and overall didnt make sitting through a 25hr movie terrible
Jan 13 2020,positive,i love it jaw dropping and a lot of action
Jan 13 2020,positive,loved the action and all of the fight scenes star wars in general can be a difficult movie to follow because of the movie plot language involved however the action was amazing
Jan 13 2020,positive,i liked and disliked the ending where ray claims to be a skywalker because it was sad to see the true skywalkers go yet awesome that she took up the name like taking up the torch for the jeddis
Jan 13 2020,positive,the rise of skywalker is interesting the editing is so erratic and quick that you can tell they wanted to put as much as possible in this film im honestly exhausted from it it would have benefited from longer run time to let moments breathe it really felt like they tried to cram two films into this one for one reason or another i really hope there is a 3hour directors cut released at some point i cannot confirm this but i dont think they abided by the conventional star wars pacing chart google it and therefore it doesnt have the cadence of a regular star wars film  that being said welp its very hard not to say anything without spoiling it like endgame or infinity war you cant talk about the content even vaguely without spoiling it cause it moves so fast however id say that the film gave me whiplash reveals happen so quickly that its hard to take in the last thing that happened so quick that some setups are immediately paid off within a single scene it has no time to pump the breaks at all there isnt really an a and b plot but a superstrong a plot that just plows through the story  as a star wars fan there are some moments that i almost loathe but also some moments that i really love its a fastmoving mixed bag but it finishes the saga adequately old lines and quips come back full force and are nestled into the fabric of this movie definitely see it for yourself and talk to me about it
Jan 13 2020,negative,very glaring flaws but it just managed to cover the bare essentials of what makes a star wars movie the script is entirely reliant on luck and no plot point really feels earned not to mention how many unexplained new abilities are granted to the protagonist overall the scriptwriting was atrocious and the damage control from its predecessor could have been managed a lot better but in the end it was an enjoyable movie 410
Jan 13 2020,positive,unexpected and exciting i loved this one
Jan 13 2020,positive,great finale to the trilogy plenty of action  vidual effects lots of suspense and a good plot twist
Jan 13 2020,positive,brainless but not as outright offensive as the critics seem to suggest
Jan 13 2020,positive,solid star wars movie my daughter and i both enjoyed was not expecting too because of poor ratings
Jan 13 2020,positive,as a stand alone film i thought it was great it had  great visuals and brilliant lightsaber duels and i really enjoyed watching it but i didnt think it lived up the plots of the original trilogy and prequels on the whole though it was pretty good and id recommend giving it a watch
Jan 13 2020,negative,nothing more than one fight scene after another violence for the sake of violence poor plot with too many holes ridiculous movie i went to see it because it was rated as no bad language but it was a really bad movie
Jan 13 2020,positive,loved the action and the plot
Jan 13 2020,positive,they tied up loose ends by making new loose ends
Jan 13 2020,positive,certainly the best of the trilogy  abrams tries to remedy some plot holes created in previous episodes  the end result is a film that is enjoyable but which in my opinion is not star wars
Jan 13 2020,positive,story line was great  a lot was left open for more stories in the future
Jan 13 2020,positive,nice wrap up lots of ambiguous plot movement but great action i would definitely recommend seeing this film
Jan 13 2020,positive,good movie overall  a lot of action  my only letdown was why they had to go to so many places to accomplish their mission   otherwise this was still a well done movie
Jan 13 2020,positive,took my grandkids so they could experience what my kids did when i took them to the first star wars in 1977 no one was disappointed
Jan 13 2020,positive,before going i had heard mixed reviews from star wars fans regarding the plotstory line no one told me any spoilers just that they either liked or had mixed feelings about this movie personally i thoroughly enjoyed the movie i felt that it was good mix of action and story line even in places i didnt necessarily agree with the story line direction i dont want to give away any spoilers but it felt a lot like return of the jedi
Jan 13 2020,positive,im one of the few that enjoyed the curve ball rian johnson threw with the last jedi although it would have been nice to see jj abrams make the occasional bold move in the rise of skywalker he unstitches and resews plot points from the predecessor the pacing in the first act feels rushed and could possibly be an entry in to the saga on its own however it serves as a perfect ending for the disney trilogy
Jan 13 2020,positive,for me it had it all all the good stuff we already know but what made it more like six star was the clear direction hence fully understandable plot well placed light humor and the same with touching moments balance and direction outstanding
Jan 13 2020,positive,everything expected from a star wars movie
Jan 13 2020,positive,this movie was an epic conclusion to the skywalker saga jj abrams perfectly ties the skywalker saga in a neat little bow with this enjoyable film some minor flaws here or there but the best star wars film to date
Jan 13 2020,positive,since 1977 to 2020 ive enjoyed the skywalker saga im satisfied with the last chapter  ties up everything nicely
Jan 13 2020,positive,the critics are idiots on this one  its a kids movie and it was fun  my 10 and 14 year olds both loved it and so did their old man who was a teenager for the original  best of the new series of star wars films and far superior than any of the reboot  rey and ren were both awesome together  loved it  and i only cried a little bit when leia died onscreen
Jan 13 2020,positive,definitely the best of the new trilogy this movie had everything a good star wars film needs and with great payoff too i dont understand why people are hating on this film as it was greatly enjoyable and truly brought the viewer on a rollercoaster ride of emotions
Jan 13 2020,negative,i have seen the rise of skywalker finally mostly nothing wrong with the acting but the story line was over extreme i understand from reading that jj abrams appears to have a hohum attitude towards peoples critique of his work  i suppose from his point of view he cant please everyone  that is rather a defeatist attitude to adopt  i saw star wars and the empire strikes back in cinemas on their first runs  i was a child and was blown away naturally nothing had ever come close to this new franchise  i saw jedi a little later around 1993 and loved it  i was in my 20s by then and had enough time lapse to have an opinion beyond that of a child six years later comes the phantom menace and i was caught up in the media frenzy  internet was a new toy to most of us and i loved it  however reflection occurs and i despise the jar jar binks character  my kids enjoyed the prequels especially the revenge of the sith  what an awesome movie so my kids then saw  the original trilogy and were in awe  they preferred them and for good reason then years later my eldest daughter doing her masters degree in digital animation and effects  she sees the farce awakens and enjoyed it mildly very much a critique of the dire acting the forced coincidences of the movie and she actually opened my eyes to the mess of the story  the ridiculous notion that a planet can be formed into a base and still contain seasons and life whilst sucking the fuel from a star  then the carbon copy of a new hope action as a fan of the movies i am always interested in peoples opinions a talking point naturally   my opinion is that rian johnson should have been watched carefully  i see he has become a scapegoat for the crap he turned out  jj abrams was involved i saw his name in creditsso why didnt he do something about it the force awakens was a mess plastic acting daisy ridley over acting john boyega apparently poe dameron can fly an xwing in gravitational forces and not pass out he can also shoot down everything all around him  the last jedi was rian johnson giving the main protagonist a personality makeover ruining everything george lucas created  the last jedi is utter crap as a movie and as huge waste of money and resources yes it sold tickets because its star wars  but it doesnt rake back and pay for the loans disney took to purchase lucas film ticket sales bombed and didnt make the profit and lost money after paying the loans back the rise of skywalker  i will admit abrams had the shite task of mopping up the bloody mess rian johnson left behind  heres a clue boyo when you produce something make sure you keep an eye on what is being churned out  the salkinds did with superman the movie firing the director for over shoots  george lucas did with the empire strikes back and return of the jedi not that irvin kerschner needed help why didnt you  oh because its your name and you expect it to sell  bottom line mate your movies stink and youre rich   if you were my employee losing money youd down the road in the dole queue of course much like paul feig and ghostbusters you cant complain because people like kathleen kennedy accuse you of being sexist racist or what ever else is the fanciful name calling of the day fans were so upset with the last jedi they tried to raise money to have it redone  rian johnson laughed at them  what a complete tosser  johnson upset the core people then laughs in their faces this latest instalment is full of the same nonsensical character change rubbish  palptine same actor same voicebut what  talking in a way that just isnt reminiscent of previous movies  you cant do that it raises eyebrows and people hate the continuity errors when mark hamill is telling you something is wrong you would do well to listen everything has gone wrong i dont know where to start with this movie  it was the worst idea in the history of bad ideas there wasnt even breathing space character reflection a feeling of purpose  actually speak to fans get a feeling for a loved franchise before you destroy their hopes in turn for your own vision which lets face it its your vision and it has nothing to do with the lore palpatine taking out entire fleets of ships alone i cant say anymore  let this one get flushed into the river with the rest of the turds
Jan 13 2020,positive,good ending nice to see old characters
Jan 13 2020,positive,loved loved loved this movie  we were sitting on the edge of our seats with all of the action special effects laughter and crying  a lot of emotions were brought up in this movie so it was well worth the money time and effort to go and see it  we also didnt notice how long the movie was since we were so into the movie
Jan 13 2020,neutral,short on depth of story line could have had real depth but left it wanting
Jan 13 2020,positive,the best that could have been expected after tlj  i have been to the movies to see every mainline star wars film since the original but i was highly disappointed after the last instalment  critics will pan rise of skywalker as having too many reused plot points and callbacks but thats kind of the point a set of three trilogies each about a different generation but each facing the same battle of light and dark one finds darkness one light and finally one balance  the stories should be similar abrams understands star wars in this context kennedy and johnson do not  i watched this film and enjoyed myself no out of place jokes to take me out of the story no heavyhanded social commentary paired with pointless side missions and no attempt at creating a new star wars without finishing the old  yes the pacing was very fast and a good bit of deus ex machina use but i enjoyed it and did not come out of the theater having to convince myself that i liked it like i did after a phantom menace or utterly despondent like after the last jedi  i came out of the theater feeling like i had seen a star wars film a real star wars film
Jan 13 2020,positive,excellent movie good wrapup to the original star wars thread
Jan 13 2020,positive,i thought this was a pretty good film  nothing is ever perfect but this is a good installment in the star wars  series
Jan 13 2020,negative,this film was just a total mess the pacing was way too fast and all over the place the plot hammered too much stuff into it and it was trying too hard to please everyone in the fandom say what you want about tfa and tlj at least they had a steady flow and pace to them its obvious that disneylucasfilm was desperately trying to win back the fans who hated tlj and didnt see solo but also didnt have a planstructure for how this sequel trilogy would pan out i didnt hate this film but as the final instalment to a 40 year long saga that changed the face of scifi and cinema it just doesnt live up
Jan 13 2020,positive,loved it felt very nostalgic
Jan 13 2020,positive,i liked how it was a happy ending but it was a little predictable
Jan 13 2020,negative,brilliant visuals but no stakes blow up the one thing and everything is defeated with no real cost a forgettable entry to star wars and a wasted opportunity imo
Jan 13 2020,positive,really dont understand the hate im a lifelong star wars fan and i loved it for me it tied up all loose ends it answered all my questions and there were enough laughs and feel good moments that left me smiling all the way through the action is spectacular and the space battles are breathtaking i was looking forward to this and i wasnt let down bloody brilliant
Jan 13 2020,positive,at this point if youve seen one youve kind of seen them all formulaic to the point of predictability
Jan 13 2020,positive,this was the perfect ending to the perfect saga
Jan 13 2020,positive,a excellent final conclusion to another controversial star wars film see you next trilogy when everyone hates it all over again then we wait 15 years and go eh maybe it wasnt that bad
Jan 13 2020,neutral,too many stories crammed into one movie lazy writing whenever anyone was in peril there was an immediate solution to the problem i still liked it because its star wars and it was great for the kids they loved it whoever wrote rouge one should write them all
Jan 13 2020,positive,loved it was never a star wars fan till my husband sat me down and we watched every single one and im hooked this movie was amazing cant wait to see more star wars movies
Jan 13 2020,positive,more dialogue and screen time regarding reys parents would have been nice but great way to end the saga that ive loved for over 40 years from the very beginning
Jan 13 2020,positive,outstanding  i believe that they tied up any and all loose strings a great way to cap the 9 movies
Jan 13 2020,negative,messy story fast paced to avoid giving you time to release how poorly written it is
Jan 13 2020,negative,does too much this film desperately tries to save the car crash that was the last jedi but fails
Jan 13 2020,neutral,two much like fan fiction tell me a story show me a good film mainly appeals to nostalgia
Jan 13 2020,negative,unfortunate i find it truly hard to believe how one could make such a mess out of a movie even by incorporating so many characters from different trilogies the abrupt yet unsurprising revelation of reys origins turned out to be quite a substantial disappointment along with constant scenes with close to zero correlation with each other whatsoever everything in this movie is sudden the most frustrating point is that the movie doesnt care less in explaining certain phenomena no reasoning is shown for anything the characters do besides the typical concept of hope   now incorporating hope is great and all but when its mentioned in every last second of the film not everyones favorite choice jj abrams did a marvelous job in adding on a nasty tail to the great star wars series with the most typical dialogue and story lines that define the lack of creativity and organization the new trilogy movies have
Jan 13 2020,positive,i like the ending even i have questions about why emperor palpatine is in this movie again
Jan 13 2020,positive,kept you on the edge of your seat
Jan 13 2020,negative,a mess of a film bad dialogue bizarre and pointless plot lines reliance on fetch quests and macguffins characters given next to no development whatsoever only thing it has going for it is it looks pretty  all in all not a satisfying end to this kerfuffle of a trilogy
Jan 13 2020,positive,somewhat entertaining lightsaber fights were disappointing actors done alright abrams deflected most problems the last jedi left but the trilogy is somewhat pointless short and uneventful pulling sidous out of the hat is a joke disney wiped the extended universe created by like 40years worth of books only to cherry pick elements from it and underutilize them those are still the most interesting parts of the trilogy creative bankruptcy 100 abrams competently made it for sure but i dont feel id lose anything if i have not watched any of it which is probably the worst kind of feeling one can get by watching star wars disney for the love of god have a plan and let creative people do what they are good at like with the mandalorian
Jan 13 2020,positive,ok its not a great movie but after the mess that was the last jedi ill take it its a sci fi movie that is supposed to be fun it honors all the characters new and old that we fans care about job done
Jan 13 2020,negative,way to crap all over the star wars legacy disney
Jan 13 2020,negative,youre doomed from the 1st second when the main antagonist of a storytrilogy is introduced to the trilogy in the opening crawl of the 3rd movie this is what you get when youd rather please a group of people fans than actually tell a story  i love star wars i love this universe but after 9 movies and 4 decades and ending these stories like this is just disappointing
Jan 13 2020,negative,i cant stand this trilogy anymore after seeing the rise of skywalker for a movie that has this much going on i have never experienced such an anticlimatic ending for a story with a plot twist straight out from star wars theory subreddit disney managed to destroy everything that had been built by the two previous episodes and to think about that we had to sacrifice the star wars eu for this halfassed junk
Jan 13 2020,positive,i truly hope that we havent seen the last of rey and ben solos relationship or the whole squad for that matter please disney
Jan 13 2020,positive,i absolutely loved this movie it is the first star wars movie that had truly emotional impact it had really funny moments moments where i had tears running down my face and moments where i wanted to cheer out loud i am a true star wars fan however i dont get so wrapped up in expectations i truly believe that rise of skywalker is the best movie out of the 9 i know it is sacreligous to say that but i also truly love the prequels too many fans are all wrapped up in only liking the 45and 6 well they are great movies but so are the prequels last jedi is the only one that i would say that i think is good but not great
Jan 13 2020,negative,the movie is absolutely awful start to finish from the terrible pacing to the nonsensical plot to a terrible character arc for rey this movie makes the whole sequel trilogy worthless and in desperate need of being removed from canon all disney has to do is recreate the great stories from the many novels like darth banes trilogy or the stories of revan and darth plagueis yet they allowed jj abrams to single handedly ruin star wars by doing a remake of a new hope and then this latest disaster
Jan 13 2020,positive,the critics are crazy  great movie one of my favorite in the entire series
Jan 13 2020,positive,who cares what the critics have to say i really enjoyed this film
Jan 13 2020,negative,they cut my boy anakin skywalker out of the movie to focus on rey ok funny i was sitting here thinking the movie was called the rise of skywalker
Jan 13 2020,positive,continues to relive my childhood with each succesive movie episode ix did not disappoint
Jan 13 2020,positive,i seemed to enjoy it at the time but 12 months later i have no real memory of the movie
Jan 13 2020,positive,entertaining i recommend it
Jan 13 2020,positive,it was a great story and well done the actors and actresses were amazing it definitely parallels lukes story and there were a few times i got a harry potter vibe
Jan 13 2020,positive,i loved it  great way to end the skywalker saga
Jan 13 2020,positive,it is an end of an era for those of us who were among the first ones to see the originals
Jan 13 2020,positive,i cant wait to buy this movie and watch it again
Jan 13 2020,negative,the star wars movies seem to all be the same the same plots same bots same scenes same old characters wandering in and out of the story  this franchise is tired
Jan 13 2020,positive,i was a little lost ive never been a big follower of this series but my son who is 13 loves it and seeing how excited he was and the way it ended was really really awesome 5 stars no question
Jan 13 2020,positive,completely awesome
Jan 13 2020,negative,a disappointing end to a franchise it did not do the story any justice what so ever
Jan 13 2020,positive,does what a star wars film is meant to do  fun action packed and not to be taken to seriously
Jan 13 2020,positive,i am a huge star wars fan and watch everything thats canon i didnt like episodes 7 or 8 but i loved 9 it gave me all the nods to the originals that i wanted the only thing i wish it would have included was anakin at the end with luke and leia because after all he is the original skywalker
Jan 13 2020,negative,likes core cast  daisy ridley john boyega oscar isaac  had good chemistry babu frik dislike everything else regardless of how anyone felt about the last movie the fact that so much of this movie is spent undoing tlj is at best counter productive there is zero logic or internal consistency i counted at least half a dozen character deaths that were quickly undone within the film while it can be hard to gauge the intent of a filmmaker they probably didnt want me laughing out loud during their big dramatic moments and yet here we are   the difference between an error and a mistake is simple anyone can commit an error but it doesnt become a mistake until you refuse to correct it the sequel trilogy thus ends as a huge pretty looking and very expensive mistake
Jan 13 2020,positive,by far the best star wars movie ever made
Jan 13 2020,positive,best star wars movie ever one critic said it lacked emotion he is devoid of it  obviously story and graphics top notch saw it twice and loved it as much the second time
Jan 13 2020,negative,212 hours i will never get back recycled dialogue disguised as homage incomprehensible relationships idiotic plot devices baffling storylines i started timing the intervals between explosions which devolved from less than 3 minutes to nearly constant i give it 112 stars only because i pity the otherwise fine actors involved
Jan 13 2020,positive,i took my 13 year old twin grandsons who are all about everything star wars they enjoyed the movie however i found it interesting they only gave it a 7 out of 10 i really expected much more from them than a 7 as someone that doesnt know much about star wars it held my interest and kept me on the edge of my seat it was really long
Jan 13 2020,positive,absolutely amazing only thing was if your a true star wars fan you would notice a fue errors but still an amazing movie
Jan 13 2020,positive,good ending to the series
Jan 13 2020,positive,im confused about the story line  i have lost track of all the characters
Jan 13 2020,positive,i felt it was a good movie  was not expecting a block buster  just a good movie  i was not disappointed
Jan 13 2020,positive,i loved this star wars i think it was one of the best ones
Jan 13 2020,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed the movie  i didnt go in with my notepad ready to pick it apart  i went in with the desire to be entertained  you know sit down with pop corn and a soda and get taken somewhere else for a couple hours  and rise of skywalker did just that  the humor was fun the action was fun the character interaction was well done  and ill be honest i thought the acting was well done  when the characters had dialog among themselves it seemed natural  it is easy to see that if these were actual individuals in actual times with these personalities and relationships this would be how they act and react   when i watch a scifi or fantasy or action blow em up style flicks im looking for entertainment  i do not need huge emotional development or payoff or commentary or reflection on modern times  if i wanted any of mommy or daddy of family tragedy and drama well hollywood still makes oscar contenders for a few million a pop  but star wars that is for fun and rise of skywalker delivered
Jan 13 2020,negative,an absolute mess of a film jj abrams tros is riddled with bad acting an even worse story line and cheap fan service this film is truly an insult on a long list of insults to the original trilogy while george lucas himself has done many disservices to this beloved franchise on his own jj abrams disneylucasfilm and last jedi director rian jonhson have massacred this conclusion and final trilogy as a whole the main issues of the film are simple 1 a single film cannot fix the mistakes of the previous two films even if it were 5 hours long 2 jj abrams has and possibly never will learn how to end a story that leaves audiences feel truly satisfied or even wrap up the narrative in a precise fashion with the immense responsibility of ending such a beloved franchise mr abrams ultimately fails and its not a pretty sight 3 the first act of the film is such a mess of unfinished story lines there is no way to redeem this film you can paint a pile of shit gold with flashy cgi and cheap fan service but its still just a gold smelly shit
Jan 13 2020,positive,great goodness i watched it twice i loved it
Jan 13 2020,positive,lots of action enjoyed it
Jan 13 2020,positive,the story had so much heart and i honestly did not what know what to expect i loved the ending of course there are always a few small unexplained things when did the force start doing  but overall it was a great story and true to the series
Jan 13 2020,negative,pure garbage disgraceful to the starwars legacy
Jan 13 2020,positive,when all is said and done the film is magical but sometimes in ways that require you to believe in magicyou know as in in fairy godmotherswith some characters appearing out of the blue to help resolve old wounds  and yet when all is said and done i did have loads of fun watching this movie taking in its grandeur its a hell of a ride nearly from beginning to end just dont expect the ride you are taken on to always make sense
Jan 13 2020,positive,i liked it better than the reviews said i might cant miss it if youre a a star wars fan
Jan 13 2020,positive,great  star wars fans will not be disappointed
Jan 13 2020,positive,the ending wish it couldve been more to it
Jan 13 2020,positive,for fans i believe it was a fulfilling satisfying end to the story  a winning stand alone movie with enough easter eggs and parallels to make even the most hardcore fan smile
Jan 13 2020,positive,it was good a few corney emotional parts at the end but i liked it
Jan 13 2020,positive,best of the recent three and perhaps the best new character of the recent three
Jan 13 2020,positive,the best one in the latest trilogy
Jan 13 2020,positive,story felt rushed too much flashbang and extras that didnt have a lot of value to the story
Jan 13 2020,positive,better than the last 3 star wars movies with more story and closed all the less clear issues a must see for anyone that has watched this series
Jan 13 2020,positive,we thoroughly enjoyed it
Jan 13 2020,positive,the movie was very entertaining and better than the last one
Jan 13 2020,positive,i loved every second of this movie and in sorry for anyone that wasnt moved by it i was looking to be disappointed but i felt the complete opposite wonderful directing and acting i should mention i did not like the last movie lol
Jan 13 2020,positive,finally watchedspeechless i found and excuse every weekend to not go but deep inside i really did not want to watch the end of these series since it meant the end of what truly awaken my love for movieskinda sad to say goodbye but the movie was absolutely beautiful
Jan 13 2020,negative,unnecessary ending for an unnecessary continuation of the saga money spoke louder than artistic need not logical not believable and not original a forgettable movie that should not have have happened after the original unforgettable trilogy from the 80s
Jan 13 2020,positive,enjoyable film the story was super rusb but the action kept the story moving forward and there was always something happening which made the film not drag
Jan 13 2020,positive,everything about this movie was awesome i couldnt want for anything more so much action everything was summed up so many years as this series ends
Jan 13 2020,positive,loved movie everything you expect from a star wars movie and more  minor quip they had technical difficulty starting move but told us it would play but be a little late  i think they did every thing they could to keep on time
Jan 13 2020,positive,this review is coming from someone who hated episodes 7  8 i made peace with 7 but 8 was a disaster that being said jj abrams did a marvelous job concluding the skywalker saga im a diehard fan of star wars and though 7  8 were absolute travesties but jj did a good job i made a rotten tomatoes account just to leave this review yes it feels jumpy and there are some awkward things in it but jj had to fix the screw up rian johnson did and if you can understand that the movie becomes that much better if you have reservations about the film its worth it its better than the last two and was done right  thank you jj abrams
Jan 13 2020,negative,from reverting the climax of the original trilogy to more shitting on the skywalker name by having rey even vaguely associated with it this film isnt just a lacklustre film for the modern series but also feels it has to drag lucass orginals with it
Jan 13 2020,positive,to be honest its the best one to watch for a casual fan
Jan 13 2020,positive,loved the action and the excitement the story was great to finish the three trilogies looking forward to more star wars stories not an ending but a beginning
Jan 13 2020,positive,the first half was all over the place and sadly how our princess was treated in the film was really bad after the half way point however it became the star wars movie it should of been
Jan 13 2020,positive,loved it suck it nerds
Jan 13 2020,negative,the worst of the whole series even without jarjarit was horrible i wont go into specifics dont want to put out any spoilers but this movie was just not entertaining to watch at all it was a huge let downfrom the plotscreenplay to the acting and the way too numerous one liners that were thrown in there to try to liven up the script i almost didnt go see the movie because jj was in charge he killed transformers with the last few he didnow he has done the same to jedi i left before the movie was over i couldnt take it after we found out rens family heritage etc
Jan 13 2020,positive,it was amazing  ive already seen it four times  i cried like a little girl with a skinned knee
Jan 13 2020,positive,i loved this movie i dont break down every aspect i just enjoy it wrapped up the series that ive enjoyed since 1977 i try to forget episodes iiii in a very satisfying way
Jan 13 2020,positive,f the critics the movie was fantastic
Jan 13 2020,positive,loved star wars the rise of skywalker  it keeps you on the edge of your seat  very entertaining
Jan 13 2020,positive,i thought it was a good film  there are a few minor issues for example we see a pilot climb into an awing but when hes shut down we see an xwing crash  over all i really enjoyed it
Jan 13 2020,positive,no comment  it is a good movie
Jan 13 2020,positive,great movie comfortable seats and environment tickets were very easy purchase
Jan 13 2020,negative,if you hated the last jedi youre not gonna like this one either this movie is pretty cringe with everything they try to force in to fix the mistakes made from the last movie just wait to see it in disney
Jan 13 2020,positive,although a little cheesy bringing every character back in one form or another that also made it very satisfying the themes of love of family there was only one bad apple to the end and hope to overcome a dangerous legacy have universal appeal
Jan 13 2020,positive,its a star wars movie so that gets at least 3 stars   nothing new or exciting so no additional stars  the mandalorian storylines are much better  solorogue one were better than any of this trilogy  very disappointed in disney for not giving the fans a better product
Jan 13 2020,positive,even with some story issues this is a phenomenal movie and great way to end the saga never a dull moment
Jan 13 2020,negative,really great visual effects and adam driver is great but other than that its way to fast pace and bloated and there is no development or heart in any of the emotional subplots or any plot at all because of that the ending was stupid to its just a bad conclusion to trilogy
Jan 13 2020,positive,it was awesome still think there is more 
Jan 13 2020,positive,absolutely amazing from start to finish
Jan 13 2020,positive,one of my favorite star wars movies i am so grateful to everyone who brought this story to us and these characters who i will miss so much we love rey this movie was made with so much care love for the source material and and absolute attention to detail that left me so satisfied and teary eyed
Jan 13 2020,positive,enjoyed every moment
Jan 13 2020,positive,script should have been written and directed by george lucas to complete the 42year vision
Jan 13 2020,positive,amazing film best of this series a little hear wrenching
Jan 13 2020,positive,loved it although theyll need to start a new evil somewhere for continuity sake
Jan 13 2020,positive,yea i didnt need my heart you can have that amazing movie
Jan 13 2020,positive,what an amazing movie
Jan 13 2020,positive,great addition to star wars  nice way to tight it all together
Jan 13 2020,positive,so hood i watched it twice
Jan 13 2020,positive,great conclusion to the 43 year old series
Jan 13 2020,negative,it should have come out at thanksgiving right along side of all the other turkeys  ghosts of star wars past swoop in for a final cameo with the possible exceptions of darth mar and jarjar binks  dialogue is one cliche after another each overacted and incapable of generating any emotion or sympathy  all in all its more of an effort to get this thing over with instead of a real plot
Jan 13 2020,positive,really enjoyed the movie suspenseful exciting and just great fun  hard to believe its been 43 years since the 1st star wars
Jan 13 2020,positive,hoping this isnt the last we see of skywalker   we loved all of it
Jan 13 2020,positive,it kept me entertained but as a conclusion to the sagapretty bad overall
Jan 13 2020,positive,it was ok the ending couldve been bettter but the pace was good story was ok the main bad guy was lazy in concept but thats star wars for you
Jan 13 2020,positive,great movie to watch in 4dx
Jan 13 2020,positive,i loved the storyline and plot  well written ending
Jan 13 2020,positive,thought it was a great movie didnt like the way it ended with ren and ben
Jan 13 2020,negative,id rather stick an broomstick up my ass than to watch this stupid piece of shit movie again just sayin
Jan 13 2020,positive,great movie first time to this theater since its been changed to amc it was actually nice and reasonably priced
Jan 13 2020,positive,the imax sound experience was very immersive  i was impressed
Jan 13 2020,positive,if you are a casual starwars fan you will like it as the characters are actually interesting for once in this saga and its visually beautiful but the whole saga has no good coherence furthermore there are some decent plot wholes in this move that will make you shake your head for the starwars fans its a slander of the original trilogy
Jan 13 2020,positive,fitting ending to this trilogy
Jan 13 2020,positive,from what jj had to play with amazing
Jan 13 2020,positive,one of the best  kept me engaged from the first scene
Jan 13 2020,positive,great movie action scifi and even romance brilliant
Jan 13 2020,positive,this movie brought back the older characters luke leia and hans solo in interesting storyline twists  i enjoyed the way they ended the movie  there were some very happy parts and some very sad parts
Jan 13 2020,positive,my favorite star wars movie of them all
Jan 13 2020,positive,special effects and production
Jan 13 2020,neutral,i wanted to like it more but pacing is terrible and really rushed 90 of the movie was spent fixing the last jedi mistakes to appease angry fan boys
Jan 13 2020,positive,fun and great way to end this trilogy star wars charactersnot a star wars movie but still entertained
Jan 13 2020,positive,predictable but fun
Jan 13 2020,negative,what a waste of an amazing cast the plot was nonsense it was so busy retconning and heteronormalizing everyone and everything that the already squicky relationship between rey and ren felt hamfisted and forced it wasted great new characters instead of writing engaging scenes for already established characters it writes them out completely rose is treated horribly hux is thrown away our heroes are less charming and more mean at times unbelievably ren is dull rey is frustrating only finn remains even remotely adorable what even is going on with that plot its emotionally manipulating and so hackneyed i cant actors and characters are treated horribly in a nonsense bloated film that thumbs its nose at millennials and diversity
Jan 13 2020,negative,whoever decided it was a good idea to make a 40 year old story almost completely inconsequential deserves to be fired
Jan 13 2020,positive,no it wasnt perfect but i believe this was still a great ending to this modern trilogy despite what the purists have to say  in my opinion if youre going to the movies to be entertained then this is for you  if youre going to just go to critique it to and gripe on what you would do instead then just stay home and continue playing with your star wars action figures  my kids loved it and my wife and i enjoyed it  it was worth the money and we will most likely buy it when its available to stream
Jan 13 2020,positive,it was ok it felt like a lot of it was rushed through to get to the end
Jan 13 2020,positive,the writing has shakespearean moments with some wooden dialogue overall it was ok but not as engaging as the last jedi 
Jan 13 2020,positive,it was pretty awesome
Jan 13 2020,positive,loved it movie had me interested from beginning to end may the force be with you
Jan 13 2020,positive,it was ok repetitive
Jan 13 2020,positive,a great film critics of this film are so offbase they themselves are in a galaxy far far away time to see it again
Jan 13 2020,neutral,failed to impress not the best ending for the series
Jan 13 2020,positive,it was ok much better than last jedi so thats a bonus it just felt like they left some things unanswered because of missed opportunities in the last jedi
Jan 13 2020,positive,buttons up almost every question you could have for the entire series
Jan 13 2020,positive,loved it id goce it 2 thumbs up as a great way to bring a long loved saga to an end
Jan 13 2020,positive,i was shocked at how much better this was than the previous it should have been the 2nd of 3 instead of the last
Jan 13 2020,positive,abrams did a great job rapping up the loose ends
Jan 13 2020,positive,emotional exciting and true to the star wars legacy established in the other films  overall very satisfying end to the series
Jan 13 2020,positive,they kept the original cast of people
Jan 13 2020,positive,i walked out of the theater feeling satisfied but the nagging issues took root over time and it seems like a slapdash effort to finish the sequel trilogy fueled mostly by nostalgia
Jan 13 2020,positive,amazing special effects closure for previous movies and possible sequel
Jan 13 2020,positive,amazing keeps with the heart and soul that star wars has carved out in our lives for the last 40 years
Jan 13 2020,positive,better then expected  but theres no reason star wars should have been better then expected
Jan 13 2020,positive,i thought it was a great ending to the storyline
Jan 13 2020,positive,redemption is always a good story theme
Jan 13 2020,positive,critics want the perfect ending for everything your not going to get it but between plot twists you werent expecting amazing battles awesome scenery and a little bit of inspiration to fight the battles inside you this movie deserves a lot more credit then the bombing reviews they have been receiving the rise of skywalker is easily one of my top three favorite star wars movies and ill be buying it as soon as it releases may the force be with you
Jan 13 2020,positive,a movie made for star wars fansa great conclusion to a story that has captured hearts and minds for 42 years not perfect plenty of storyline holes but satisfying jj paid homage to the star wars saga
Jan 13 2020,positive,there was never a dull moment great movie loved it
Jan 13 2020,positive,i feel like there was so much more they could have done with it felt super rushed just forced honesty expected more from starwars
Jan 13 2020,positive,epic  very good  fast paced
Jan 13 2020,positive,nice wrap up to the saga
Jan 13 2020,positive,nicely done they could stop making movies  with this one and i would feel like they answered all my questions
Jan 13 2020,positive,watched it a 2nd time and loved it even more  caught so much more detail this time around  the beginning isnt perfect because the last jedi served as a poor setup  but it picks up perfectly about 20 minutes in
Jan 13 2020,positive,my son and i loved it
Jan 13 2020,positive,eh better than the last jedi didnt take any creative risks and had way to many new characters to care about every needs to get their 15 minutes of fame reys character deserved more than daisy ridleys angryconstipated face the entire time kylo rens arc was the only thing the movie seemed to care about although i believe it was executed fairly very touching moment when he threw his saber away hats off to adam drivers performance at its core it was a carbon copy of return of the jedi
Jan 12 2020,negative,this film made me cry if i want a watch a film where there is little plot or a pointless andor convoluted plot then i wouldnt watch star wars disney took the biggest brand in history and turned it into something people now mock and got bored of  that takes real talent
Jan 12 2020,positive,did a great job of wrapping up the story a must see at the big screen the floor wont shake at home like it will in the theater
Jan 12 2020,positive,enjoyed very much  only drawback was lack of clarity in establishing raes heritage
Jan 12 2020,negative,not my star wars i dont know what has happened since disney has taken over but wow this is just really trashed on all levels
Jan 12 2020,positive,as someone who saw the first one before it was called a new hope at age 13 in the theaters this was an awesome conclusion to the story  i dont get all the hate but if you enjoyed all the movies its ok to love this
Jan 12 2020,positive,overall an enjoyable movie that unfortunately had to cram far too many plot points into its time due to the terrible mess that was left by tlj the movie was also worsened by watching it in 3d please producersdirectorsetc never ever do 3d conversions they almost always make the end product worse it actually made tlj even worse in retrospect impossible as that may seem  it had some nonsensical moments though theyre mostly excusable because of the previous reason and at least it got the overall feeling right for me i kinda wish they didnt kill off the one character that would have made the ending surname scene make sense but oh well  just like tfa it again makes me tentatively hopeful for the starwars franchise despite the flaws in tfa and tros
Jan 12 2020,positive,it was good other than daisy not taking me to the premiere or to see it made  also imax was good but not as good as the 3d in knoxville
Jan 12 2020,positive,easily the best of the three sequels a decent repair job after the dreadful mess of episode viii the acting was excellent c3po was a legend in this film best outing hes had since the 1978 expanded radio edition of star wars and thats saying something
Jan 12 2020,positive,i liked everything about this movie the cast were great stunts were great im very satisfied with the ending
Jan 12 2020,positive,great movie love the 4dx seats
Jan 12 2020,positive,it was not the ending to star wars i wanted
Jan 12 2020,positive,the storm troopers need to be better shots
Jan 12 2020,positive,i loved the special effects especially the sea scenes
Jan 12 2020,positive,loved it didnt even know princess leia would be in itand she was a major player
Jan 12 2020,positive,answered a lot great movie and great ending to the skywalker story if thats the end
Jan 12 2020,positive,thought this was a perfect star wars movie not a perfect movie but it was indeed a perfect star wars movie
Jan 12 2020,positive,a bomb resolution to star wars
Jan 12 2020,positive,great ending to a great saga
Jan 12 2020,positive,it did good to close the series
Jan 12 2020,negative,movie was aight rey is a palpatine but said she was a skywalker pretty much the only thing that made sense in this movie
Jan 12 2020,positive,such a great addition to the series
Jan 12 2020,positive,saw this with my friends pretty good not a lot wrong but it feels bloated at times but the charecters are amazing and the dialogue is natural and flowing
Jan 12 2020,negative,the title is misleading because they shouldve titled it the rise of palpatine as that is exactly what took place nobody wakes up one morning  says gee i think ill change my name to full in the blank because genetically youre still whoever it is you are that yo ur e trying to disassociate yourself with
Jan 12 2020,neutral,ok some parts are really good most is just ok
Jan 12 2020,negative,what a massive let down such a shame they couldnt be bothered to plan a 3 movie arc considering the source material 
Jan 12 2020,positive,this was one of the best star wars yet in my opinion if not the best such good pace and action throughout the movie and the acting was terrific all around it was a terrific movie 
Jan 12 2020,positive,i was so happy to see how they honored carrie fisher and the rest of the old guard excellent wrap up
Jan 12 2020,negative,this one was very disappointing the movie had a  lot of missing holes and often dragged a lot of scenes felt thrown together and too often reys daydreams went on too long action was descent but just overall poor writing
Jan 12 2020,positive,it was all right not my favorite of the new three probably number two after force awakens kind of disappointed
Jan 12 2020,negative,this movie was the av equivalent of eating a soggy saltless saltine
Jan 12 2020,positive,worth every penny amazing
Jan 12 2020,positive,i loved the way it rekindled my memory of being a 13 year old in the summer of 1977 and seeing what would eventually be known as episode iv a new hope for the first time
Jan 12 2020,positive,good ending to the saga humorous and very enjoyable dragged a bit at times but overall a great movie to watch in theaters
Jan 12 2020,positive,while theres certainly plotholes and problems with this film it certainly rose above the last jedi to offer us an satisfying conclusion  jj could have done a much better job im certain if hed been in charge of all 3 films but it is what it is  maybe someday well be given a bigger peek into how lucas really planned the last 3 films but in the meantime this will do as an conclusion
Jan 12 2020,positive,i loved it i loved the the themes and characters i had a great time watching it
Jan 12 2020,negative,embarassing piece of abysmal quality cinema badly written terrible story boring and meaningless undescribable garbage no emotional involvement can be achieved seems written by a child with unlimited funds at his disposal
Jan 12 2020,negative,the movie was like a really bad ending to a sequel that should have never happened not only was the story kind of a patch to the last jedi but it didnt even bother to try to creat something original but instead felt like a terrible recap of the return of the jedi the sequels in general were just a terrible mimic of the original three
Jan 12 2020,negative,just set your expectations to low its not horrible
Jan 12 2020,positive,bad editing example lando and young girl at end
Jan 12 2020,positive,great ending to a incredible series
Jan 12 2020,positive,usual exciting star wars movie
Jan 12 2020,positive,if you dont like this star wars movie youre not a true fan and you probably enjoyed the last jedi way more then you should
Jan 12 2020,negative,its lucky to get two stars the fact that they had to spend a third of the time making corrections due to the failures of the previous film hampered an already heavily laden movie that needed to waste no time in getting its work done and out the door i dont blame the director the writers or the actors for this i blame the ceos and company heads that should have seen this coming and should have known better thanks for making a trilogy ill only buy out of a bargain bin
Jan 12 2020,positive,a decent enough conclusion to the new trilogy  a bit over the top in some ways but it is star wars  ultimately its a kid series that happens to still appeal to a lot of adults  so theres going to be a bit of that  mostly its just solid work with some nice surprises and gorgeous set pieces  im happy to be done with this trilogy though so hopefully disney can move on from old characters and make something new with the setting
Jan 12 2020,positive,sad that the producers didnt follow the last movies iideas and plot for a more fanservice kind of ending
Jan 12 2020,positive,its was a great movie i hated the last jedi but this movie wasnt boring and i enjoyed the plot
Jan 12 2020,positive,good effects but predictable which was expected  but hey its star wars and it wasnt ike i was expecting a high brow murder mystery
Jan 12 2020,negative,star wars has been distoryed by bad writers directors and poor story telling
Jan 12 2020,positive,yes there were a few cheesy moments and yes some of the ending was somewhat predictable however jj abrams was tasked with buttoning up a 9episode movie series that started in the 70s survived through a horrible prequel series and was left with numerous odd story line issues following the last jedi he managed to pull it all off with a clever fun interesting and exciting movie while recovering from a lot of odd decisions made by rian johnson the actors had more to work with the script was better the storyline was good the characters were used better and the ending was solid given everything im not sure what would have satisfied the negative critics but i do recommend it as a solid conclusion to a fun series of movies
Jan 12 2020,positive,loved it wife loved it daughter 15 loved it highly recommended 75 out of 10
Jan 12 2020,positive,the movie was riveting from start to finish we were on the edge of our seats throughout the movie never an empty space i wanted more a
Jan 12 2020,positive,one of my favorites so far
Jan 12 2020,positive,ive got a feeling ive seen this before film looks really good all three do but this one is certainly the weakest one  it feels like theyve recycled the same themes etc from the original trilogy
Jan 12 2020,positive,enjoyed bring back all the old stars still the best is original
Jan 12 2020,positive,best movie by far finally got the ending ive wanted
Jan 12 2020,positive,really really good loved it
Jan 12 2020,positive,the special effects were supercrazy with nonstop action idk it was entertaining and tiring to watch at the same time but worth seeing on the big screen
Jan 12 2020,negative,complete nonsense fanfiction not to be considered canon
Jan 12 2020,positive,i very much enjoyed the movie some twists some obvious outcomes but a fun ride and a pleasant closure of the trilogy im glad they didnt just throw away characters just because they could
Jan 12 2020,negative,if your not super into star wars i can see you liking this but as a long time fan this movie was god awful the best part is that it ended this trilogy finally
Jan 12 2020,positive,i disliked that this is the last of the saga i loved all in the series well see what the next series will bring
Jan 12 2020,positive,definite end for the saga
Jan 12 2020,positive,entertaining despite the plot holes
Jan 12 2020,positive,good story and action fun to see some familiar faces at times felt a little forced and overdone but enjoyed the end to the saga
Jan 12 2020,positive,good acting good action great special effects great movie
Jan 12 2020,positive,good ending to star wars
Jan 12 2020,negative,wish i wouldnt have wasted the money
Jan 12 2020,neutral,not enough relevant plot
Jan 12 2020,neutral,better than last jedi i appreciate jj trying to save the series the emperor coming back is dumb the plot is terrible it was fun though
Jan 12 2020,positive,i dont care what the critcs say rise of skywalker was a fast paced worthy ending to the skywalker saga long live star wars
Jan 12 2020,positive,love the effects and action story line was excellent
Jan 12 2020,positive,seemed a little rushed in places always a fan but not the best weve seen
Jan 12 2020,positive,really good mostly because of the fact that its the last one
Jan 12 2020,negative,it seemed rushed the store was all over the place and the writing was lazy  its a shame that jj had to follow up the last jedi and try to make a good story out of it  the fault is with disney  the executives are more concerned with making money then producing good quality content for people to enjoy  if jj would have had the entire trilogy to do i think he could have done a good job but having to follow the last jedi screwed that up
Jan 12 2020,positive,way better than tlj not up to lucas standards but an enjoyable movie nonetheless
Jan 12 2020,positive,absolutely stunning great story in the time constraints will see again
Jan 12 2020,positive,i absolutely loved the movie it was amazing the end makes it seem like there is gonna be a continuation but we never know because to me it seems like there is and the movie was just all a 1010
Jan 12 2020,positive,great watch excellent addition to the star wars movies dont listen to the bombers its a great movie
Jan 12 2020,negative,good cinematography acting score but none of that can save the convoluting plot that makes no sense terrible dialogue and over abundance of cringe worthy fan service 
Jan 12 2020,positive,too long  too much imagery too little acting
Jan 12 2020,positive,shallow copied schemes from old parts
Jan 12 2020,positive,it had throw backs to the old movie and new stuff that was entertaining also
Jan 12 2020,positive,i liked the story line and how everything played out the movie could have been about 30 minutes shorter it seemed a bit predictable but that was okay or it wouldnt have been a star wars movie
Jan 12 2020,negative,it was all over the place and extremely predictable felt like they just tried to retcon everything that happens in the last movie instead of trying to build an actual story
Jan 12 2020,positive,get off your highhorse peoplegreat movie
Jan 12 2020,positive,star wars rise of skywalker was disappointing because it could have been so much more it should have been so much more  the final film of such a beloved series should have had me laughing weeping and screaming throughout kind of like avengers endgame and infinity war it didnt even come close while it wasnt awful tons of fan service does not a great ending make if you love star wars watch it if not skip it you arent missing a lot
Jan 12 2020,positive,this was one of the most epic of the star wars saga i cant wait until it comes out on bluray was i can have the full collection
Jan 12 2020,positive,it was ok not a movie ill be watching more than once
Jan 12 2020,positive,loved it i was gripped throughout and it didnt dissapoint
Jan 12 2020,negative,this movie is a miss a complete miss of what is sw there is no concrete history no logic in the actions of the caracters an no rason for the comeback of palpatine a complete garbage
Jan 12 2020,positive,it is so excellent 
Jan 12 2020,positive,great chapter in the franchise reviewing a star wars movie is like any genre you know pretty much what youre getting going in little darker themes this time around which made for excellent drama
Jan 12 2020,positive,5 because it is star wars and is a family favorite thru the years  character development for this trilogy was 3 stars
Jan 12 2020,negative,visually stunning and another john williams masterpiece for the soundtrack however the movies pacing was chaotic lack of coherent plot and a complete deficit of character development no fault to the actors at all daisy ridley is amazing as rey but the character as well as finn and poe suffer from poor writing and an unbelievable story arc disney and lucasfilm have forever ruined the star wars franchise with the incredible amount of plot holes and inability to connect to previous star wars films the last jedi made me feel ill the rise of skywalker completes my loss of enthusiasm for disney made star wars feature films 
Jan 12 2020,negative,if you never watched star wars before disney bought them then you might like them they are determined to kill off everyone from the first six movies of star wars their story line for these last three movies had potential in the first one but they just go all over the place with the story if i never see any of these movies again i will be alright and wont miss them i am sorry that george lucas sold the rights to this series to disney
Jan 12 2020,positive,enjoyed it start to finish very well done
Jan 12 2020,positive,nice movie but it was too much predictable and without brandnew things better than ep 6 for me
Jan 12 2020,negative,you will go see it because its star wars as i did  but a nap would have been a better use of my almost 3 hours dreaming of what a star wars movie and trilogy could have been  if you have to watch it wait till on tv and there are commercials as they will at least provide some entertainment  if you hated the ride at disney this movie is almost worse
Jan 12 2020,negative,this was just not that good still it was better than the 8th and the prequels
Jan 12 2020,positive,one of the best star wars ive seen it covers all the bases from acting to the way it look to the stunt work great fight scenes
Jan 12 2020,positive,amazing star wars movie went in with no expectations my friends and i all had a great time enjoyed every bit its a movie people just enjoy it
Jan 12 2020,positive,definitely a better movie than the previous one but still more of a fan service than a masterpiece
Jan 12 2020,positive,this was so much better than the last jedi and a perfect ending im a huge star wars fan and i dont understand how someone could not enjoy this movie ive seen it 7 times in theaters already and plan to watch it again today
Jan 12 2020,negative,written and directed by dudebros
Jan 12 2020,negative,same old story told worse than previous with less interesting characters after seeing this movie i could care less if they ever make another star wars movie or tv show
Jan 12 2020,positive,lots of action great story line went out with a bang
Jan 12 2020,positive,it wasnt the best of the star wars movies but it wasnt an awful ending
Jan 12 2020,positive,star wars fan here need i say more
Jan 12 2020,positive,a satisfying wrapup to the skywalker saga
Jan 12 2020,positive,a good story and great way to end the original series
Jan 12 2020,negative,i am an absolute star wars fan and considering that this movie was supposed to end the saga it was really disappointing  during the whole movie there is no real bad guy  palpatine was weak and kylo never turned into anything close to a darth vader character which was really disappointing although this was kylos best movie of the saga  i never really liked any of the characters in this movie and another disappointing thing is the creature babu frik  that was supposed to be cuter than baby yoda from mandalorian didnt live up  overall this movie was the worst of the star wars saga in my opinion
Jan 12 2020,negative,a mess from a storytelling and filmmaking standpoint the rare combination of boring and seizure inducing
Jan 12 2020,neutral,liked rey and kylo scenes and the little alien mechanic mostly boring a handful of scenes were awesome and should be seen on the big screen
Jan 12 2020,positive,better than the first two
Jan 12 2020,positive,much like the last two films of this final trilogy i wont be rewatching it beyond maybe a 2nd and 3rd viewing     both rogue one and the han solo moviewere fun and worth seeing again hell i rewatched the prequels more than ive desired to wanna see any of the last 3  its not that they are bad they just lack a charmwhich is so much more apparent now that we have the mandalorian which doesnt shy away from telling a classic story and rewards audience based on lore and narrative without just assuming we care  as others have said these films have made us stop caring  so while i would say yeah go see this new one in theatrei wont be collecting the action figures from it i wont get a poster i wont dive into the tech and craft of it was made  and i will still watch the original trilogy over and over again because they are like fine wine instead of this fast food disposable media which is now these movies  i really prefer the direction of the oneoff films and what looks to be a great show w the obi wan series coming soon too  so the universe of star wars isnt over but i sure hope the story of the characters from these 3 films is put to rest
Jan 12 2020,positive,it was a good ending to another star wars trilogy
Jan 12 2020,positive,soooooo much better than the last space wizards at their finest
Jan 12 2020,positive,to start off this movie is basically split into two parts part one is director jj abrams addressing all the mistakes missteps and conflicting plot lines that exist between what he set up in the force awakens and what rian johnson developed in the last jedi the second half is abrams now building on what he created and set up in the force awakens to excellent climax right off the bat its the best of the sequels its got its issues like pacing this movie definitely needed an extra 30 minutes to iron out the wrinkles and some questions still left unanswered however its magical and captivating like any good star wars film should be it possesses the right balance of fan service and originality that the force awakens couldnt reach in new material and what the last jedi absolutely lacked in nostalgia any fan of the originals and the prequels will love this movie its without a doubt a shining gem in the pile of fake diamonds and cheap stones that make up the sequel trilogy
Jan 12 2020,positive,it was kind of the same all thing was star wars it was entertaining but i got tired of watching it halfway through
Jan 12 2020,positive,the best star wars movie ever however we didnt like the 4dx in the theatre as it  disturbs the movie focus the regal city north team were great and accommodated us to move over to the imax hall
Jan 12 2020,positive,good movie  massively underrated
Jan 12 2020,positive,the supposed final chapter in the main star wars saga was enjoyable it unfortunately had the dubious task of following a film which did next to nothing to further the story the last jedi thus this film tried to do too much abrams once again pays a lot fan service through out and the film much as the force awakens used the first star wars as a template uses return of the jedi with a dash of empire the film is uneven in pacing especially towards the end but it is much more satisfying the previous entry i could dissect the flaws of the film but i wont it was enjoyable i just had a hard time getting too excited for any one character it was a somewhat satisfying conclusion to the disney trilogy but missing the magic of the originals and the spark of hope that the force awakens started
Jan 12 2020,positive,i loved the action and the storyline was genious
Jan 12 2020,positive,if you need closure this movie is excellent a little vague on the reason for certain events such as the return of a familiar foe nonetheless a very enjoyable watch
Jan 12 2020,positive,the conclusion to the series was excellent
Jan 12 2020,positive,was the best of the final 3  ending should have been longer but overall a good movie
Jan 12 2020,negative,they desecrated the entire star wars saga what an utter shame how can these fools be given the reins to such a franchise it was like i was watching a fairytale for kids all mumbo jumbo palpatine has so much power he can destroy entire fleets what bollocks
Jan 12 2020,positive,i loved this movie compared to last jedi not sure why such a big critic and fan divide it was great go see it on the big screen
Jan 12 2020,positive,awesome and astounding film dont listen to overexpectant fans about the story its a sequel story enjoy it
Jan 12 2020,positive,so rey kills emperor palpatine with that much ease yeahokay
Jan 12 2020,positive,i saw the movie with my so who is a huge star wars fan i enjoyed it although in my opinion the ending was cut off he said it was ok and had too much fan service id see the movie because it is a nice ending to the series
Jan 12 2020,positive,total surprised on some of the charters death and reyes last name choice in the end i am happy how the whole star wars story was wrapped up evil is defeated
Jan 12 2020,positive,super entertaining and loved seeing carrie fisher again the costuming and special effects were so realistic and mesmerizing it could have been a little longer to wrap up some of those loose ends but still so good
Jan 12 2020,positive,nice wrap up this trilogy of trilogies
Jan 12 2020,positive,it was great i enjoyed watching it
Jan 12 2020,positive,one of the best in the series  the whole family loved it
Jan 12 2020,positive,to long story line predictable
Jan 12 2020,positive,like they way they incorporated elements from the previous movies   well done    only one odd moment at the end involving a kiss  still dont understand that but everything else was great
Jan 12 2020,positive,i loved this movie i have waited for this movie and feel it was a terrific ending to a legendary story happy sad exhilarated all feelings being sensed throughout the movie a must see for anyone
Jan 12 2020,positive,it was really emotional the first time i watched movie  the movie is ok but kylo ren is excellent
Jan 12 2020,negative,unfocused mess such potential wasted
Jan 12 2020,positive,loved it i thought it was a perfect way to end the saga and move into another future chapter
Jan 12 2020,positive,it has some small surprising moments but was mainly predictable had both good point and bad points and never really succeeded getting me to the edge of my seat although it did satisfy me and i would accept it as a end of the saga
Jan 12 2020,negative,destruction of star wars achieved with this one
Jan 12 2020,positive,i like the story line always hope
Jan 12 2020,positive,spoilers ahead i was never bored watching this movie good cgi and special effects acting was though no oscar winning performances plot was a little all over the place the movie was set up as an episode of downton abbey once something interesting starts cut away to something else i hope the star wars franchise stays a science fictiondrama stays away from action series and stays away from social commentaries because it will make it dull to many new characters not enough lando or r2 c3p0 and chewie get a chance to shine rey still emotes and has overdone facial expressions ben kylo still acts depressed  a lot of the plot borrows from return jedi and ignores last jedi misplaced humor here and there how it should have endeds villain pub gave away the ending and ending i thought left open another movie  if you want to see it ignore what everyone has been saying and go to be entertained if you are a fanboygirl there is a lot for you
Jan 12 2020,positive,i really liked this movie even as a star wars fab
Jan 12 2020,neutral,it felt incomplete in some areas the flow wasnt as smooth as the others
Jan 12 2020,positive,ive seen all the star wars movies that was my favorite by far
Jan 12 2020,positive,life long star wars fans may most likely be upset by most of the decisions jj abrams and the lucasfilm folks made here however for what its worth the saga ends on a striking note even if the film felt sorta unfinished and rushed at times not all plot lines were resolved unfortunately and there was a lot of stuff that was not explained that should have been explained i really do love a few things they did with this movie however i do wish that things such as already established character romances werent ignored and i wish we got an explanation on how anakins lightsaber was all of a sudden fixed i also have to somewhat agree that this film does negate a few trilogy plot elements that was set up by the last jedi the big standout here and one of the very great moments of the film is the surprising return of ian mcdiarmid as emperor palpatinedarth sidious it was also just incredible seeing billy dee williams play general lando calrissian again if carrie fisher was still with us today she would have been very proud of how the story of princess leia ended 
Jan 12 2020,negative,there were some fun scenes but the movie felt disjointed and all over the place  its like jj took 2 separate movies cut them in half then mashed them together    it was also a terrible way to end the series  they left out way too many details and it was full of plot holes i recommend waiting and just renting it  honestly i was bored 95 of the time at the theater when watching this movie  its full of groan moments  they fly now  uhm they have been able to fly since the original trilogy lol
Jan 12 2020,positive,as much as i hate to see the saga end this was a great tribute to the entire works  now anxiously awaiting more from disney on star wars breakouts like mandalorian  keep em coming
Jan 12 2020,positive,this is a solid movie and i enjoyed my time in the theater there are a few weaknesses to watch out for some first attempt at humor and some forced throwbacks to moments in the original trilogy but on the whole a good story well told
Jan 12 2020,negative,it was simultaneously bloated and thin its hard to understand how experienced filmmakers dont seem to reread their screenplay to be sure a compelling story is being told  heck to be sure it makes sense sad ending to a once enjoyable series
Jan 12 2020,negative,disney killed star wars
Jan 12 2020,positive,i was surprised there were a lot of nods to the old movies that really made it for me the last jedi felt like it was made by someone that hadnt really seen star wars but this was made for the geeks it does basically gloss over most of the last jedi but its better for it
Jan 12 2020,positive,i thought this was a very well done movie as always the special effects were great  the story line was good the battle scenes were a little drawn out but to be expected for star wars  all in all i really enjoyed it and would recommend
Jan 12 2020,positive,its star wars  in recliners
Jan 12 2020,positive,the skywalkers dont go out with a bang but with a whimper disappointing
Jan 12 2020,positive,it was just all over the place expected more
Jan 12 2020,positive,i liked how this installment tied up most of the storylines from previous movies also it was packed with witty humor it was quick and subtle yet very effective an all around good show
Jan 12 2020,positive,it is better than rian johnsonss abomination last jedi
Jan 12 2020,positive,certain details but it wasnt too bad was very entertaining and funny
Jan 12 2020,neutral,the first half of the film moved too fast and the scenes with leah felt unnatural and awkward the second half of the film was better although it still had moments that made me go wtf and not in a good way either it was definitely better than the last jedi but not as good as the force awakens in the end i didnt hate it but i also didnt like it either it was just kinda meh
Jan 12 2020,positive,a fitting ending to a remarkable story
Jan 12 2020,neutral,its ok to be angry on the movie but epis9 is much better than the 7  8 it is not a copypaste of the others movies  its original  good in the same ways but unfortunetly this star wars is not good enough the save this new trilogy better was the 6 films before and spinoffs 1 to 6 anyway im satisfied of this filmfor once but this new trilogy is the bad thing in star wars universe
Jan 12 2020,positive,hard core fan of starwars here since day one back in 70s and this is a good movie mat be hard to swallow for this old guy but yes its a good movie the end of the original generation and the beginning of a new one very good transition bring tears to me eyes this switch but this is like real life 
Jan 12 2020,negative,a bloated mediocre soulless mess waste of the potential of the force awakens made me appreciate the last jedi
Jan 12 2020,positive,great end to the sky walker series
Jan 12 2020,positive,as a lifelong star wars fan i thought the movie filled in a lot of holes the story completed the character development where some old school star wars fans may have questioned where disney was going with this franchise it was the fastest 220 minutes that i can recall in some time i would see it again and will definitely add this to my collection  if i have a negative comment a couple of the nuggets were cheesy however my overall review of this film awesome
Jan 12 2020,negative,its just not good at all
Jan 12 2020,positive,seen it 3 times in the theaters love it more every time already purchased in itunes a must see if you are a real star wars fan fast full of action amazing visual effects lots of laughs good story and superb soundtrack 1010
Jan 12 2020,positive,thoroughly enjoyed the movie
Jan 12 2020,positive,i have a new favorite star wars movie i didnt think anything could top my old original series favorite but this did it neatly tied the whole saga together and gave it a satisfying conclusion i laughed i cried i had good nostalgic memory moments as they brought back old favorite characters i have seen it in theaters twice already love that they stuck with the central theme of star wars hope we hope
Jan 12 2020,negative,the movie is boring and nothing really happens during most of it while the secondary characters seem completely useless and never really do nothing rey somehow became overpowered and after some training she looks like the most powerful force warrior ever existed in 9 movies talking about this the finale is something terrible did i actually see palpatine the whole star wars line biggest antagonist who can see in the future and in the heads of enemies cheated death discovered cloning yodalike lightsaber warrior die in a 5seconds fight because his force lightning couldnt overcome a second lightsaber and instead bounced on it and killed himself the most intelligent character of the entire saga resurrected with plans to move his spirit in rey body got all of his power back as he shows with a tremendous force lightning in the air and just then dies because it looks like rey helped by the jedis is by far stronger than him  i didnt like kylo ren story in the movie hes super weak as he cant beat anyone and makes a deal with everyone he meets in the end he basically comes to die for nothing we just see the interesting lightsaber telepathic transmission kylo ren getting lifeenergy sucked and being thrown away from the fight die by saving rey wow i can see the rise of the skywalker
Jan 12 2020,positive,im not a big star wars fan but i took my daughter who really wanted to see it  i really liked it action packed didnt have  to know all the background to enjoy
Jan 12 2020,negative,the last few star wars movies feel like the same movie over and over again
Jan 12 2020,neutral,when did leiah learn how to fight when did she get a light saber where did the heal powers come from who had that power
Jan 12 2020,positive,i thought the movie was a little slow in its pace the flow of the movie was slower than previous movies
Jan 12 2020,negative,too much same old and dependence on special effects
Jan 12 2020,negative,some nice ideas like palpatines return but overall it was rotten 
Jan 12 2020,positive,really inspiring in times when the people need to unite
Jan 12 2020,positive,as many of the star wars movies the plot makes little sense but it has to be like that in order to look cool still i like to watch them
Jan 12 2020,positive,rise of skywalker is a messy but fun send off to the skywalker saga
Jan 12 2020,positive,a perfect end to an incredible sagavisually stunning  but the storyline was even better may be my favorite movie evera must see
Jan 12 2020,positive,when i noticed elements from the old legends books in this movie i knew id love it abrams did what he could with what he had and i think he did a great job i was happy to see references to the legends lore of the 80s and even some of the things talked about in lucenos book on darth plagueis i was also relieved that there was no side mission to distract from the meat of the story my wife and i were both very happy with this movie its our favorite of the new trilogy i hope that future movies in the franchise will be more willing to incorporate some of the elements from the old hit legend books as well nice work jj abrams and all those involved in the making of this movie
Jan 12 2020,positive,chopped up into scenes without a transition of any kind spent too much time trying to figure out that what is on second
Jan 12 2020,negative,too kuevenilepoor actingcrappy story line
Jan 12 2020,neutral,this movie is the climax of a trilogy that was entirely improvised and that is entirely evident in the nonsensical plot and spotty characterisation if you have to watch this turn your brain off and watch the awesome lightsaber fights without thinking about if it makes sense
Jan 12 2020,positive,fantastic movie  never fails
Jan 12 2020,positive,a total rip off of the return of the jedi no more new story ideas
Jan 12 2020,positive,i dont care what you think the movie was great as well as the sfx
Jan 12 2020,positive,not the biggest star wars fan but i thoroughly enjoyed this one good story and brought back a lot of old characters
Jan 12 2020,neutral,marginally better than the disaster of the last movie rise of skywalker had numerous a lot actually of plot holes and open ended story arcs that were simply ignored and never explained somehow there there were very few lessons learned from the previous movie in introducing new technologies and force powers that have never been part of star wars the script was very lazy and at times chaotic having many wtf moments of not understanding why or how certain characters magically appear in places the actual story was a mess of incredible coincidences and all scenes seemed to presented on a plate to the audience without allowing for any sort of thought or imagination at this point star wars should stick to tv shows only and come back to movies when they have real think about how they can be done in a satisfactory way as other franchise have proven you can please both the fans and the masses
Jan 12 2020,positive,storyline was great i enjoyed every minute of it
Jan 12 2020,positive,visual and audio effects were perfect but lightsaber fights are what let this movie down it looked like two children swinging sticks recklessly at one another cliches have become a recurring theme since the new trilogy started definitely not bad but couldve been better
Jan 12 2020,positive,me and my girlfriend loved the movie  much better than the 7th and 8th this movie feels like its found its way to the level of the first movies theres the right amount of light sabers fun and action  great job 
Jan 12 2020,positive,great visuals  special effects thats to be expected from a star wars film though isnt it but apart from this honestly its kind of a mess the story feels rushed and theres just too much theyre trying to cram in its certainly better than the last jedi but thats really not saying much as the last jedi was terrible i suppose it this film is entertaining on a surface level so audiences will probably enjoy it but when you get to thinking about it it just doesnt make much sense i give it 3 stars for not being absolutely terrible but it is predictably considering the previous 2 films muddled an unworthy end to the skywalker saga but after decades of desecrating star wars i must say im kind of glad its finally over put star wars  and us  out of our collective misery and just let dead dogs lie for christs sake let it be
Jan 12 2020,positive,a fitting way to end the saga yes not particularly clever or groundbreaking but an enjoyable and emotional ride
Jan 12 2020,positive,jj did what he could disney needs to create a trilogy and plan it out before actually making the first film also why hire the same screenwriter that ruined dc for two years the lack of originality and the movies laughably painful way to undo its predecessor and its controversial themes actully hurts the film and leaves the skywalker saga ending on a meh note while episode 8 was divisive at best this movie should have been brave enough to continue with what was given to them this movie is cowardly yet entertaining unoriginal yet captivating underwhelming yet not terrible they should no better 
Jan 12 2020,positive,excellent nonstop action and suspense perfect conclusion
Jan 12 2020,positive,i wish the ending included the force ghosts of the light side of the force  the movie shouldve been longer and was really fast paced i still really enjoyed it
Jan 12 2020,negative,rushed and slopped together with huge spectacle that much like the plot and story of this film is inevitably meaningless
Jan 12 2020,negative,so utterly disappointed by this uninspired conclusion that tries to cram in way to much and make everything so big that the rest of the saga becomes utterly ridiculous in its light utterly loveless plot like you would not even expect in a video game
Jan 12 2020,neutral,there are good things about this movie palpatine and driver among them but anytime youre about to enjoy something they throw another forgettable sacrifice or fanservice moment at you and break any immersion you might have felt it isnt the culmination of anything and it doesnt take a single significant risk beautiful art and sound design cant carry the burden of myriad untraceable storylines and forgettable dialogue it was pleasant but forgettable
Jan 12 2020,positive,it was pretty good i saw the force awakens but i never watched the last jedi because everyone said it was terrible so i went into this movie wondering if id be able to follow what was going on without having seen the second movie i knew that luke died but pretty much nothing else i didnt have any problems i actually started to wonder what they did in the last jedi for two hours because like it seemed like there was nothing i missed or was supposed to know before walking into rise of skywalker it was cool its so accessible though if anyone else missed the last jedi you can just go right to the last movie youll be fine it was cute they did the carrie fisher stuff pretty well and the characters were fun to watch together
Jan 12 2020,positive,had the same warmth humanity and drama of the original series great return to form ridley is absolutely epic in her role
Jan 12 2020,positive,its a fun movie for the star wars fan ive loved these movies since i was four and im 42 now so this movie was fun i felt like it was too short and there were some clumsy plot threads that got lost not nearly as good as the last jedi which made me more excited than any star wars movie had since i was little but a proper closing entry for this trilogy if not for the entire saga
Jan 12 2020,positive,lives seeing everyone in it good battle scenes fun  night out for my teen son and i
Jan 12 2020,positive,i thought it was good
Jan 12 2020,positive,absolutely amazing movie my second fav star wars of all time behind empire saw it 5 times in theaters love the characters the plot the legends elements they brought in all of it couldnt have had a better ending to the saga absolute must see
Jan 12 2020,positive,great addition to the franchise
Jan 12 2020,positive,story was good till they got till about half way threw then nothing made sense disney really screw this up
Jan 12 2020,positive,ten thumbs great ending to the saga
Jan 12 2020,positive,seems like jj abrams was in for full damage control after the disastrous the last jedi part 9 is satisfying but raises the question how much more the trilogy could have been if jj would have directed part 8
Jan 12 2020,positive,it was really great so many inspiring lines or scenes and in between trying to remember the episodes of so long agodefinitely watching again
Jan 12 2020,positive,i enjoyed this movie very much
Jan 12 2020,positive,starts out great but runs out of gas at the final show down
Jan 12 2020,positive,i really enjoyed this never a dull moment ive really loved how this latest arch has come together
Jan 12 2020,positive,over the top special effects
Jan 12 2020,positive,as a life long star wars fan i can say i have had mixed feeling about the latest trilogy the last installment i thought was decently entertaining and enjoyable as long as its not taken too seriously its not perfect and yes there are plot holes and discrepancies but all in all it says true to star wars franchise it made me feel like a 10yr old boy again
Jan 12 2020,positive,i had lowered expectations from what i had heard but i enjoyed the movie   it was a little too complex trying to check too many boxes reprising too many characters
Jan 12 2020,positive,a lot of exciting things i loved the movie though
Jan 12 2020,positive,fights scenes were great
Jan 12 2020,positive,hurray the jedi fans win over the seth critics outstanding film
Jan 12 2020,positive,the best kind of rollercoaster ride in a movie
Jan 12 2020,positive,they definitely saved the best for last  loved everything about this movie
Jan 12 2020,positive,fastpaced action adventure liked it
Jan 12 2020,negative,not the worst film in the latest trilogy but it really leaves you questioning how did this entire trilogy start with so much promise only to end up adding zero value to the sw franchise overall perhaps the better strategy for disney would have been to stick to origin or prequel movies like rogue one and completely left the original cast out of the new story line
Jan 12 2020,positive,i loved the whole movie from beginning to the end it was a wonderful movie
Jan 12 2020,negative,even its uncomfortably fast pacing and wellcasted characters cant save star wars the rise of skywalker from being another throwaway scifi franchise feature it genuinely surprised me how boring most the movie was to watch even with an even opener mind on the second viewing see the movie get your star wars credits and be thankful there are other movies in theater worth your time and money
Jan 12 2020,positive,loved everything about it
Jan 12 2020,positive,for all those who say they wont go see it because they believe that jj abrams ruined the story or some other rumor about the film i say balderdash having been a fan of star wars since 1977s original seeing it brought to a close the way it was brought tears to my eyes with a smile on my face the way it ends with rey returning to lukes home on tattoine when asked her name and she says reyskywalker was perfect it was a fitting ending and tribute to carrie fisher as well i will most definitely see it again before it leaves the theatres if just to catch things i missed the first time
Jan 12 2020,neutral,not the best but ending was good
Jan 12 2020,positive,for those that said the last jedi was awful i dont disagreebut not 100 to that end  for those that say rise of skywalker is worse i absolutely do disagree 100  but heres the thingits not all one person either making or breaking the film  franchise  its a family effortand we all know what family i am referring tocough  cough  while my two minor issues with last jedi the mentioning of running out of fuel for the first time ever and shells fired in space arcing as if there is gravity pulling them downward and the major issue i had with rose her character existed solely to provide conflict and that whole canto bight scene could have been totally omitted and the film would have been better for iti felt none of those same issues with rise of skywalker   no minor issues nagging me aside from finn never saying what he needed to tell rey and no major issues bothered me   so what do i think of the film as a whole   i felt it was a very triumphant way to bring closure to the skywalker saga  but lets dive into some of what makes this movie tick  time  theres a lot of time passed since last jedi  so much so that we see rey now near luke levels of ability in the force and has leia as her master  peo apparently flies the falcon as good or better than han and for me that is a huge admission as a life long han superfan and finn has become a confident and capable soldier of the resistance in so many ways  and speaking of the resistance has been pushed up against the wall here  palpatines return threatened the entire galaxy threatened with an entire fleet of mobile death stars but perfecting the planet killer technology by making it fit on a star destroyer he has had 30 years of uninterrupted time to work on it so sureill go with that    so now we have that a mole in the first order rey still seeking answers about her parents benkylo ren still trying to get rey to his side a quest to find a sith artifact to help get rey to where palpatine is to kill him and basically an all or nothing space battle that is one of the best i have seen put to film  ben becomes ben again he and rey face off against palpy lose rey gets a second wind palpy loses rey and ben do their thing together the galaxy is saved everyone calls it miller time  rey goes to the lars not skywalker homestead to return luke and leias lightsabers to where their story sort of began and declares herself a skywalkerroll credits    and by the end of the film the 3 predictions i made immediately after force awakens were actually confirmed   rey was a palpatine kylo ben would get killed by rey and finn would be discovered to be forcesensitive  there were minor details off in how my predictions were accurate but never the less i felt very vindicated  but while this film succeeded in so many ways its shortcomings were not absent  however the faults of this trilogy as a whole can largely be laid squarely at the feet of disney despite so many wanting to lay blame on rian johnson and jj abrams  let me explain  jj was brilliant is brilliant and i feel is one of the better directors in hollywood currently in terms of creating compelling stories and original ideas him and christopher nolan who i darn near idolize now  rian johnson while not having as long a track record as jj still turned out a great film prior to last jedi with his offering of looper and has now put out the great ensemblecast film knives out   so a lot of the ideas put to film that get attributed to them arent really coming from thembut rather disney    example onemighty not mickey mouse  when force awakens was greenlit and jj met with the house of mouse over how it should go he was given explicit instructions as was rian for last jedi to kill as many of the original characters as possible because disney didnt want to pay the licensing royalties to george lucas for han luke and leiawhich is why only a handful of characters had screen time from the original trilogy  and even then they were barely there at all  c3po and r2d2 had more screen time in rise of skywalker than the last two films combinedand quadrupled    lando had all of like 3 scenes the entire film and chewiewell chewiei feel bad for how little they used him but still tried keeping him there  each director was told to use allnew characters in favor of the original trilogy characters  i know this was star wars for the new generation but are you honestly telling me that none of the original characters could have beenm spared to see the galaxy officially rid of the worst threat it ever faced which they also faced themselves in their youth  apparently disney didnt feel that they needed to stick around for it  so they essentially flexed their mighty disney muscles and did theior best picard impression and told them make it so  example twothe force is all over the place with this one  the force  ohthe use of the force is there in abundance but now apparently there is nothing someone cant do with the force  sure rey and kylo ben have their own special little quirk going with it but rey now has what i call superman syndrometheres apparently nothing she cant do with it  she can jump really high float float other things mess with peoples minds push something away or pull it to her heal anything and anyone do a lightsaber baton handoff to someone else not even in the room with her  i mean seriouslythats why i think superman is the most boring superhero in existencehe can do anything   boring   and at that point so was rey  and i felt truly bad for daisy ridley  she is such a talented young actress but rey was extremely undeveloped as a character compared to finn who i felt was actually the most interesting of the new characters from the word go  problem was it was planned that way  planned  so we were intentionally given a character that just felt bland and expected to embrace her  big problem as one of the staples of great film making and what made the original trilogy so effective is that we were given characters we could empathise with and relate to  we related to luke being bored on tattooin and wanting to go learn to fly at the imperial academy but what is there to relate to with rey  poe is essentially the new han and developed as much as han was originally as in not at all and finn was a breath of fresh air all around  but these were not character development idea made by wither abrams or johnson  example threeall the things they said by not saying anything  for everything done in rise of skywalker the majority of it is accomplished by actually not telling you anything  and thats an issue  likewhen did leia every study enough with luke to be able to train someone else  rey is supposedly learning all she needs to from books  c3po has some supposed block in his programming to prevent him from telling anyone what the sith dagger they found says rememberhe was built by anakin who at the time didnt know what a sith was and barrely knew what a jedi was either kylo ben can now have his little conversations with rey at will despite being told by snokepalpatine in last jedi that it was him doing it all along so when did kylo ben figure it outi could go on  dont get me wrong sometime timegaps need to be done and forced exposition just feels unecessary in some cased to catch people up to speed but fo so much to happen and give no explaination and just say just go with it can often lead to audience dissatisfaction  and that was the road disney advised jj and rian to take a lot of times    when it comes down to it rise of skywalker in my opinion is the second best star wars film coming in just behind empire strikes back  rogue one is high on the overall star wars galaxy list as well but not part of the skywalker saga formally  could it have been bettersure  but all films could say that at some point  but for me i loved the film and am glad to see so many stories given meaningful closure    now if i can just get disney to greenlight my boba fett short film
Jan 12 2020,positive,lots of noise and special effects that were very well done  as usual  but the story line was at times harder to follow   entertaining but other choices might have been better
Jan 12 2020,positive,fun and satisfying end of the saga
Jan 12 2020,positive,a great and fun adventure to end the saga
Jan 12 2020,positive,by far the best out of the new trilogy the only problem that i had was a few wasted character moments but other than that its worth every penny
Jan 12 2020,positive,absolutely loved this satisfying finale dont know why these great actors arent nominated for awards dont pay any attention to those awful unenlightened negative reviews theyre crazy
Jan 12 2020,negative,i couldnt even clearly tell you what i did like the whole movie is a mess it ignores canon from other movies characters miraculously gain powers when the writers couldnt think of something else the whole movie is we gotta up the ante storytelling but that was their only trick the only scenes i enjoyed were scenes that called back to the other movies predisney if i thought it would work i would ask disney for a refund on my time and money as is ill have to settle with disney stop it just stop
Jan 12 2020,positive,eh it was alot of information in one film
Jan 12 2020,positive,i loved the movie and the action was awesome
Jan 12 2020,positive,good job of tying the story to a close
Jan 12 2020,positive,real good story this time and the special effects were great
Jan 12 2020,positive,bit of a mess but it is the most entertaining of the disney trilogy
Jan 12 2020,positive,the movie did a good job turning the franchise around  i personally loved it  the reviews were so bad i almost didnt go see it but really glad i did  coming off of the previous star war movie that was basically trash i think you could not have hoped for a better close out
Jan 12 2020,positive,i dont care what other people think i had a really good time with this movie
Jan 12 2020,negative,tedious boring one good scene does not make this a good movie
Jan 12 2020,positive,nostalgic for sure great seeing past characters brought closure and answers to the star wars saga
Jan 12 2020,negative,do not spend money to see this movie
Jan 12 2020,positive,it was pretty good but still couldve done better i guess
Jan 12 2020,negative,i just miss the first three original this movie was lame all over i was happy because my daughter rested her head on my shoulder that was heaven
Jan 12 2020,negative,plot line seems disconnected not enough development of character changes way too convenient ways out of trouble suddenly happen i think children may enjoy it for the scenes and action acting special effects world design and dialog seemed good
Jan 12 2020,positive,left with some unanswered questions but overall a great movie
Jan 12 2020,positive,the balance was finally reached i loved it
Jan 12 2020,positive,an excellent ending to the star wars saga 
Jan 12 2020,positive,i really enjoyed the whole moviemy favorite part was seeing princess leia
Jan 12 2020,positive,cameos referenced to past films the way carrie fishers death during filming was treated in the final cut the special effects the ending
Jan 12 2020,negative,what a boring mess of a movie not a single wilhelm scream either
Jan 12 2020,positive,ive never watched star war movie but my daughter made me do it today and it was pretty good to say
Jan 12 2020,positive,slightly predictable but very good
Jan 12 2020,positive,its better than the last jedi
Jan 12 2020,positive,epic space battles unlike any ever seen multiple lightsaber duels rich with emotion  breathtaking visuals a star wars film for the ages
Jan 12 2020,positive,not a huge star wars fan but it had enough to keep me watching nice to see blasts from the past alongside the new heores
Jan 12 2020,positive,the movie had a lot of action
Jan 12 2020,positive,really loved this movie  it actually made me revise my opinion of the last jedi which i hated the first time i saw it  my only gripe was that the film couldve stood to be about 3045 minutes longer and im afraid i may have played a part in them not giving it the necessary time as i was a committed boycotter for awhile after tlj and i think disney was worried the boycott wouldve had more of an effect than it did and did not want to chance a bomb with a 3 hr film   i dont believe this is a spoiler so ill add i was very glad they brought back palpatine as it makes the story as much about him as it does the skywalkers and they have hinted at his resurrection since ep 3 at least
Jan 12 2020,positive,the music was spectacular but there wasnt enough  time to tell all the stories that needed to be told after 40 years this franchise deserved a better ending
Jan 12 2020,positive,i loved it not a fan of the franchise but i did see the first movie back in the 70s i was blown away by the way this movie was brought together must see
Jan 12 2020,positive,fantastic end to a series of science fiction
Jan 12 2020,positive,great movie i thoroughly enjoyed it 
Jan 12 2020,positive,let me say its a wonderfully great story considering our present political turmoil illustrating what heroics are defined as reys sacrifice to safe the rebellions purpose without regard for hers was a good lesson
Jan 12 2020,positive,definitely a well worth movie to see i really enjoyed the faceoff between rey and palpatine
Jan 12 2020,positive,jj abrams tried his best to end the skywalker saga and did a good job even though it felt really fast in some conversation scenes it was a worthy conclusion
Jan 12 2020,positive,i wish rey would have been more tempted by the dark side
Jan 12 2020,negative,the movie and mike strantz watching star wars theres a lot of things that were brought back such as the death star that first of all never was sunk into an ocean it blew up there is no existence of it jj abrams should have stuck with doing what he enjoys doing and left the star wars movies to george lucas now i understand why george lucas to not want to go see this film and did not like how this film and it up the movie does sort of describe a little bit of how palpatine stayed alive but altogether if you look at the movie as a whole jj abrams screwed up and he screwed up big time with this movie im watching it here at home and unfortunately i cant walk out of my bedroom because i cant leave my bedroom because im sick so if jj abrams ever watch this the comments on rotten tomatoes for reach them jj abrams stick to doing what you enjoy but stop making star wars you destroyed the legacy that george lucas created
Jan 12 2020,positive,uh its star wars hello
Jan 12 2020,positive,jj did the best he could with what he had and honestly did a great job is it perfect no but it was satisfying
Jan 12 2020,positive,after the profound disappointment of rian johnsons insulting episode 8 jj abrams brought this alltime scifi epic to a satisfying epic conclusion  no spoilers  go see it on the big screen in imax 3d if possible  i saw episode 4 in theaters in 1977 when i was 8  im 50 now and in episode 9 abrams did a masterful job of tying up all of the loose ends left by johnsons disaster as well as the overall story arc beginning with episode 1  well done disney lucas and abrams
Jan 12 2020,positive,action packed from start to finish dont miss it
Jan 12 2020,positive,its star wars  funny corny fun story if you a fan you will enjoy it if not dont bother
Jan 12 2020,positive,this was a family date enjoyed it a lot
Jan 12 2020,positive,great  movie dont leave your seats the action never stops
Jan 12 2020,positive,the storyline connected back to the original star wars movie great special effects and chemistry on the big screen i might go back and wat h it again
Jan 12 2020,positive,the sound and display was awesome just made the movie that much better
Jan 12 2020,positive,the rise of skywalker makes up for the mess they call the last jedi but i still have mixed feelings about it
Jan 12 2020,positive,i really enjoyed this movie i definitely had somewhat low expectations based on the reviews i saw but then i went and saw it i truly enjoyed myself great cast the effects were awesome and i felt like the story came to a good resolved place its not deep thinking film but just pure entertainment which is what i expect from this franchise i loved it
Jan 12 2020,positive,loved it a beautiful culmination of the entire saga i loved them bringing back stuff from the first movies and going back to places from the very beginning
Jan 12 2020,positive,a very predictable ending to a predictable series
Jan 12 2020,positive,loved it stands on its own special effects score sound story characters costumes pacing all great will see it again c3po was a riot highly recommend
Jan 12 2020,positive,fantastic movie awesome way to wrap up the movie series
Jan 12 2020,positive,it was awesome loved the movie
Jan 12 2020,negative,i cant put the blame solely on j j for this mess of a film after the last jedi director rian johnson selfishly cast out every plot device midway through a trilogy in an effort to make himself seem interesting j j had nothing to work with rise of skywalker is an attempt to bring in a new main antagonist after snoke was snuffed fixing mistakes left behind by rian and tried its damndest to give ot fans a reason to watch this movie
Jan 12 2020,positive,excellent job wrapping up the storytough to please everyone but the story was interesting and the movie was very entertaining
Jan 12 2020,positive,it was a great ending to the story
Jan 12 2020,positive,i love everything in the movie for star wars that have watched all but havent seen this movie its a definitely recommended to watch
Jan 12 2020,positive,movie was for the most part good  there was a lot to answer from episode 8 and a few things beyond their control that they couldnt get right
Jan 12 2020,negative,the whole movie is so obvious not even entertainment
Jan 12 2020,positive,before this is a great movie im not a super star wars fan by emma star wars fan this is the second best of the six episodes there are no slow parts and lots of action with great dialogue
Jan 12 2020,positive,i thought this was a fantastic end to the whole series it explained the second movie good enough and did a great job with the story line some parts were on the cheesy side but not enough to lower the score 
Jan 12 2020,positive,the opening 45min is inexcusable but the remainder does tie a nice bow on the story adam driver delivers possibly the best performance in any of the nine canonical movies
Jan 12 2020,positive,not as awful as episode viii
Jan 12 2020,negative,vomit with a dash of still water
Jan 12 2020,negative,what a mess interesting ideas and plot elements rush past with no time for consideration or development with a proper editing pass this might be a decent movie
Jan 12 2020,positive,awesome fantastic amazing
Jan 12 2020,neutral,movie was too long and lacked action
Jan 12 2020,positive,daughter of  she seemed quite weak as well as the son of leigha   weak ending buts fits a goofy goofy disney type story  would have preferred to see more jedi spirits in the end
Jan 12 2020,positive,better than i expected a good end to the trilogy
Jan 12 2020,negative,completely derivative felt like i was watching a big budget fan fic play written by an alien who thinks they understand how to create a human story disney should have never been sold this franchise
Jan 12 2020,positive,movie was great ending to  glorious rein
Jan 12 2020,positive,absolutely breathtaking
Jan 12 2020,negative,a very convenient predictable and neatly wrapped typical jj abrams film spends more time trying to fix the many errors of rian johnsons the last jedi while speed running you through the rest of the story for whats supposed to be a conclusion to a 42 year old franchise the visuals are fine as should be expected but the writing just desperately tries to please everyone still not as bad as the last jedi but that doesnt say very much
Jan 12 2020,negative,finally the rey fillet arc is over
Jan 12 2020,positive,loved it cant wait for next one
Jan 12 2020,negative,barely passable as a standalone space adventure terribly disappointing as a followup to one of the best films of the saga and as the finale of that saga
Jan 12 2020,positive,could have been just a tad better but one of the best of the star wars films since empire
Jan 12 2020,positive,a fitting end to the series that ive been watching since 1977  i  would place it after the original empire and force awakens but better than return of the jedi
Jan 11 2020,positive,i would have given it 4 stars maybe 45   im in different that its the end of the trilogies    i still feel they could have done with kylo ren    but it was a good ending 
Jan 11 2020,positive,it was a great  skywalker story loved the shockingly story weve been waiting for
Jan 11 2020,positive,great close out of the series
Jan 11 2020,positive,star wars fast and furious style
Jan 11 2020,positive,fun to see the old gang and some new warriors im also glad the good guys win     again
Jan 11 2020,positive,loved the whole movie cried a few times imax is a must i saw it twice so i obviously liked it sad its over for now 
Jan 11 2020,positive,cinematography music
Jan 11 2020,positive,liked the movie great conclusion to the series
Jan 11 2020,neutral,it was fair rather underwhelming for the conclusion of a trilogy and despite the fact that it was nonstop plot for the entire 25 hour runtime it still felt like it dragged on towards the midpoint of the movie
Jan 11 2020,positive,classic star wars just what you would expect and the ending was decent
Jan 11 2020,positive,finally a good star wars in this trilogy there may have been some elements that could have fixed the major issues with the last jedi as we were utterly bombarded with new characters and plot points however all said and done it had the laser sword fights and the scenery to make add this to my top 3 star wars films of all time
Jan 11 2020,positive,loved this version to close the series seemed like there was some rushed writing but it came together nicely 
Jan 11 2020,positive,they pretend that most of last jedi doesnt exist and made a much better movie best of the new star wars movies
Jan 11 2020,positive,from a fan watching the original trilogy as a young kid i thought it was outstanding i had a tear in my eye most of the time and i thought rey was the stand out star of the show
Jan 11 2020,negative,i dont regret paying money to go see this movie but it was entirely forgettable  actually it would have been forgettable but i keep thinking of things that were just ridiculous or nonsensical  however im sure i wont care in a few months
Jan 11 2020,positive,fantastic movie i feel that disney redeemed themselves quite well with this one
Jan 11 2020,negative,very disappointed predictable  bad acting  nothing new  bad ending for the star wars saga
Jan 11 2020,positive,i avoided spoilers and went in with low expectations and i wasnt disappointed took my son who is 9 and hasnt seen all the originals and he thought it was good too
Jan 11 2020,positive,much better than i thought it would be i had very low expectations after the last jedi but i was pleasantly surprised its not perfect but given the mess the previous movie caused im thoroughly satisfied
Jan 11 2020,positive,perfect ending ties everything up nicely
Jan 11 2020,positive,i think it was really good but the ending was very disappointing because of the kiss it felt forced to satisfy the reylo fans because they set up rey and finn in the force awakens when rey kissed finns forehead while he was unconscious at the end but they got rid of that when they added rose which i hoped they would kill of in this movie but they didnt sadly thats it thats the only thing i didnt like but everything else was super good yall should check it out
Jan 11 2020,positive,nice way to end the saga
Jan 11 2020,positive,a great end to a long series a must see if your a true star wars fan
Jan 11 2020,positive,very good action packed movie luv star wars
Jan 11 2020,positive,sith history chewy was funny unlike the force awakens the plot in this movie was unique and not repetitive in the process
Jan 11 2020,negative,a travesty disappointing in nearly every conceivable way  the amount of adults i know that enjoyed this movie is flabbergasting to me   i could pick this thing apart all day long but the majority of my points are shared eloquently in so many reviews already   suffice to say the movie feels rushed and contrived and is basically a neon billboard that shouts at no time during this trilogy was there anything resembling a clear or consistent vision   it feels like going to a fine chophouse and having cold old pizza slapped on your plate   its not the actors fault im not even sure its jjs fault though im not sure hes capable of creating a true cinema masterpiece in the first place   ultimately it smacks of corporate greed run amok  the movie is contrived and seems to have been made by committee and either hubris or cowardice precluded common sense   i suspect if they had allowed the deadline to slip this movie would be much better than it is   whoever is ultimately responsible for this mess should be held accountable
Jan 11 2020,positive,our family enjoyed this one the most love all the good vs evil applications to life
Jan 11 2020,positive,rise of skywalker ties off the series the best way it possibly could i truly believe that it is a beautifully shot well written and heartfelt entry in the franchise and deserves its praise dont listen to critics this movie is pretty good
Jan 11 2020,negative,huge plot holes rapid fire story progression and lack luster dialog huge missed opprotunity here
Jan 11 2020,positive,enjoyed it but felt very little meaningful dialog and mostly special effects tried to bring back old images to remind the original fans of the journey characters lack charisma of the original cast
Jan 11 2020,positive,some generic but overall a good movie
Jan 11 2020,positive,a pretty decent way to end the series
Jan 11 2020,positive,a fitting end to the saga the kind of movie george would have made
Jan 11 2020,positive,despite all of the critics reviews the rise of skywalker was an epic ending to the skywalker saga
Jan 11 2020,positive,the story made me tear up a couple of times
Jan 11 2020,positive,i love it it is a satisfying end to the star wars saga
Jan 11 2020,positive,i wish we would of seen more of fen  lightsaber action
Jan 11 2020,positive,best of the most recent trilogy
Jan 11 2020,positive,the real point of the movie was to basically explain a lot of unanswered questions
Jan 11 2020,positive,the best star wars film disney has ever made by far my favorite since theyve taken over
Jan 11 2020,positive,excellent one of the best
Jan 11 2020,positive,i like clearing up the origins of the cast members i like that the relationships and that they all came together to be important to understanding the new series
Jan 11 2020,positive,fantastic ending to a fantastic series not going to lie i shed a lot of tears in this one carrie fisher about broke me loved the unexpected hero at the end 
Jan 11 2020,positive,great movie ive seen it 23 times now and its definitely my favorite of this trilogy episode 8 lacked a lot of the action that im used to in a star wars movie but episode 9 did not disappoint with plenty of epic lightsaber battles and plenty surprising events occurred throughout the movie that i did not expect 
Jan 11 2020,positive,fun movie but somewhat predicable and over done
Jan 11 2020,positive,story is a little messy but the film is still so much fun great ending to the saga
Jan 11 2020,negative,horrible and completely made all the other films void of meaning thanks for the destruction of the legend of the chosen one and the skywalker saga
Jan 11 2020,negative,as a fan fron the very beginning 1977 very disappointed with the conclusion
Jan 11 2020,positive,it has some good moments  but the plot and the story felt rush i have mix feelings about it
Jan 11 2020,positive,the acting superb and the special effects were stunning storyline has a few gaps and a lot of history rewrite for the star wars universe theres less of a feminism push in this film which was refreshing the film was rushed in the end and it wouldve been better if it was longer all in all its the best out of this trilogy considering episode 8 committed the greatest error of cinematic history in killing off luke skywalker and making him a recluse there wasnt anything jj abrams couldve done worse than that its a somewhat satisfying end to these 3 films
Jan 11 2020,positive,great movie but not the best conclusion of a 42yearold saga
Jan 11 2020,positive,loved it great summation of the in entire series
Jan 11 2020,positive,i dont understand how this movie got bad reviews the rise of skywalker ties in beautifully with the star wars franchise and makes the viewers and fans have incredible adrenaline rushes throughout the movie if you are a fan of star wars just as i am then this movie will have you sitting at the end of your seat and have you asking so many question either in your head or out loud the lightsaber duels as all star wars movies have no spoilers in this review  are miraculous and bring in new fighting techniques that we have never seen before in the past star wars movies there are major plot twists throughout the movie that will make you scream what at the screen and any movie that can physically make you scream or talk to the screen deserves a 5 star rating this movie made me not want to take my eyes of the movie theatre screen for even a second and made the excitement in me in flow like crazy i really hope you enjoy this movie as much as i did if not more see ya
Jan 11 2020,positive,main characters were well cast and enjoyable to watch the ending was great i just got bored in the middle and almost walked out
Jan 11 2020,positive,i liked the actual and taking progressing the force abilities but i didnt like the similar struggles it is as if she is the new luke
Jan 11 2020,positive,i like the fact that the season was wrapped up
Jan 11 2020,negative,i dont even know where or how to start so ill just simply say that the world was a better place before the new trilogy ill never forgive disney and ill never watch one of their movies again
Jan 11 2020,positive,overall good movie entertaining and a nice way to tie the saga together
Jan 11 2020,positive,best star wars episode of all time
Jan 11 2020,positive,absolutely loved this film
Jan 11 2020,negative,it makes every other film in the skywalker saga pointless the legend of the chosen one and the sacrifices made by past character are now meaningless what a waste thanks disney
Jan 11 2020,negative,i didnt like the movie at all
Jan 11 2020,positive,star wars rise of skywalker was an okay movie this installment was entertaining but leading up to the release was so incredibly overhyped that no matter how good it actually was it was never going to live up to that hype this star wars movie had too much going on and never felt cohesive enough to flesh out the characters and tie off the many unfinished character archs the ending was too predictable in this good vs evil plot line while the star wars lore music sounds and familiar characters new and old were evident this star wars installment and final film of the skywalker saga could never live up the lofty impossible to reach expectations set before it this is an average and ultimately safetoafault jump through hyper space type movie fun and entertaining but average at best
Jan 11 2020,positive,just saw it glad i didnt listen to the critic reviews my son and i were on the edge of our seats the whole time this was the best of the new trilogy to sum it up in one word without spoilers epic  cant wait to watch it again 
Jan 11 2020,positive,the visuals of this movie were pleasing to see of course with disney pulling strings the closure was climactic and left you wanting to see more there was a disappointing amount of potential left on the table but an acceptable formal closure to the final trilogy
Jan 11 2020,positive,love the movie 25hrs flys by with this movie and the chairs are really comfortable
Jan 11 2020,positive,we liked the movie action and were not disappointed  hope there is another movie made
Jan 11 2020,positive,to my surprise i would not actually go and see this movie but i have a client that wanted to see it and it was very very good action pet store it was rich and i enjoyed it
Jan 11 2020,positive,i thought it was better than 7 or 8 some odd points here and there but overall a good movie
Jan 11 2020,positive,plot feels rushed but i had fun
Jan 11 2020,neutral,i had no headcanon going into this but i liked what was set up in force awakens and was amazed by the depth and subtletly of the very substantial and beautiful last jedi  in contrast rise of skywalker makes little sense and being an ot kid ive seen ros three times to try to make sense of it  evil wins in the end despite love and compassion and selfsacrifice and redemption  the bad guy wins the long game  rise of skywalker taints the entire saga  let alone incredibly poor characterisation finn rose maz  only saving grace is more chewbacca more poe and much more c3po  really wish one director had done all three films to give us something bareminimum coherent
Jan 11 2020,positive,loved every minute of it
Jan 11 2020,positive,jj abrams does as good a job as can be expected at polishing the turd left behind by the last jedi the rise of skywalker is fun exciting and engaging but clearly the story was rushed since any semblance of a cohesive storyline established in the force awakens was obliterated by its immediate sequel  the movie also falls back on the cheap thrills and humor used in the last jedi but somehow manages to make it palatable through good writing  in summary as a standalone it was decent but as the third episode of a trilogy it falls woefully short
Jan 11 2020,positive,great last star wars movie  go to see it
Jan 11 2020,positive,it was a little to cheesy and political along with a boring story line and a few things that happened that made little to know sense
Jan 11 2020,negative,a disastrous end to the skywalker saga if you took all the worst parts of the star wars movies and jumbled them together youd get this movie bloated incomprehensible storytelling corny dialogue poor characterization datadriven plot choices i thought the prequels were the worst that could be done to the franchise but no this was much much worse id rather watch phantom menace ugh
Jan 11 2020,positive,the movie was a great way to cap a 9 part franchise absolutely cant wait for the next 9
Jan 11 2020,neutral,to touchy feely for a star wars movie
Jan 11 2020,positive,i loved it i thought it rounded out a lot of the whole story very well put together
Jan 11 2020,positive,amazing thats how you make a movie
Jan 11 2020,positive,epic ending a little rushed due to a lack of arc from episode 8 jj did a really good job
Jan 11 2020,negative,its very unorganized and almost seems thrown together if youre looking at this as the third installment of a trilogy  i believe it would have made more sense and had more direction if it was a standalone film this movie was your typical scavenger hunt adventure film the acting was great and the visuals were awesome as typically inline with every star wars film  however the misses were major the storyline was jumbled and certain scenes made no sense horses running on a spaceship midflight  overall trilogy lost its direction after the first film and never could recover
Jan 11 2020,positive,the movie is about what i exspected looking forward to the sequel it maybe awhilebut there will be another star wars
Jan 11 2020,positive,im not even that big of a star wars fan but i totally enjoyed this movie adam driver as ben makes me swoon a little 
Jan 11 2020,positive,absolutely incredible ending to a series of movies that mean so much to so many people
Jan 11 2020,positive,thank you john williams
Jan 11 2020,positive,best one of this series
Jan 11 2020,positive,ayeeeeeee if you know you know
Jan 11 2020,positive,resolved story lines great performances will see it over and over and over and wish its not the last one
Jan 11 2020,positive,it was definitely a good movie with some turns that were very well done but as the culmination of a 43year culturedefining legacy it was disappointing its a mustsee and your effort will be rewarded but it could have been so much more heres hoping they make an episode x to really get it right
Jan 11 2020,positive,awesome it was exiting  funny and sad
Jan 11 2020,positive,satisfying end to the 40 year arc even for an obsessed sw fan according to family plot holes yesbut acceptable at least for some
Jan 11 2020,positive,action pack easy to follow storyline
Jan 11 2020,positive,i thought it was an amazing movie i started jumping out of my seat in the movie theater when i saw all the ships come from space great movie
Jan 11 2020,negative,its too disney and not enough star wars
Jan 11 2020,positive,5 stars for those of a certain point of view  if you did not grow up with the original trilogy you will not get a lot of the referencing in the rise of skywalker and will probably think this movie is okay at best you will probably also be in the camp that loved the previous movie in the series the last jedi   however if you grew up with the original trilogy and dont care to pick apart all the plot holes just content to enjoy the ride you will love this film as nostalgia and will probably be in the camp that hated the last jedi you will probably also look forward to the plot holes being filledin with the inevitable star wars expanded universe of books tv projects and video games   for me i absolutely loved it it is fastpaced emotive and ticks all the fan boxes that were unchecked in the previous movie  so 5 stars it is
Jan 11 2020,negative,great respect to the tech part no respect to the story and those who attempt to cheat with the audience
Jan 11 2020,positive,as an older person star wars was released when my children were 10 11 years old  i never tired of the movies  loved this movie
Jan 11 2020,positive,it was star wars all the way cameos by leia luke and han the only disappointment was the lackluster performance by mark hamill he sounded like he could not care less about being in this film lots of action and space battles i liked adam driver and daisy ridley as the new stars of the last 3 in the series ive seen all of the star wars movies in the theater as soon as they were released so yes im an old fan the only ones i didnt care for were the clone wars phantom menace and revenge of the sith  im just sad that its all over but glad that george lucas got to realize his dream of bringing the whole story to life even if it did take 42 years to do it
Jan 11 2020,positive,not as bad as the tamatometer would make it out to be as a non star wars fan all of the fan service got annoying because i dont care for fan service
Jan 11 2020,negative,to begin with your time andor money is entirely yours of course to spend but here you are warned this movie does not worth it trust that that said if you did oh dear what a way to destroy a legendary franchise true this trilogy started bad and it was ruined completely with rian johnsons the last jedi so theres no much left for jj abrams to do to try not to let this ship go down nevertheless the film is an disaster in its plot story and script not to mention the questionable editing and the decissions taken to resolve this rise of skywalker without any skywalker alive all in all this trilogy is as well as this film is a diserved failure if you have good memories left of this franchise watch this at your own perilrisk
Jan 11 2020,positive,predictable but good special effects were great as was the acting honestly its a really good story but i wouldnt go in to watching it with the mindset and wanting your mind to be blown if you want an all out good story of light vs dark then this is your movie if you want a massive storyline filled withplot twist and shockers try something else and come back when you just want a good tale
Jan 11 2020,positive,as a star wars movie  its pretty good as an actionadventure movie  pretty good id see it again
Jan 11 2020,positive,not enough action at the end and a lot of unanswered questions
Jan 11 2020,positive,good conclusion and appearances
Jan 11 2020,positive,a fairly good ending to the 3 trilogies  a few plot holes but theres always a plot hole in such a large story   glad they could wrap it up in such a nice neat little bow
Jan 11 2020,positive,the movie was really good but disney kind of made it worse with the movie
Jan 11 2020,positive,i have gone to the theater and watched this movie 3 times so far what do you think that means
Jan 11 2020,negative,so there is finally something worse than the holiday special
Jan 11 2020,positive,great way to end the last trilogy a lot of fun and feeling well done disney 
Jan 11 2020,positive,excellent ending of an era
Jan 11 2020,negative,offensive to all that preceded it cheap and clearly directed at those who lap up fast paced action with no heart the answer the haters wanted
Jan 11 2020,positive,every star wars movie i see manages to outdo the previous one i loved this movie more than most others ive seen although im not super duper involved in the star wars universe i thoroughly enjoyed it
Jan 11 2020,negative,this movie was such a disappointment the way the story was told how it was told the script just everything they focused more on look this is so cool rather than the actual plot imo judge it for yourself but not worth the money and not worth the time never wanted my money back for a film before until i saw this
Jan 11 2020,positive,it was entertaining funny and enjoyable
Jan 11 2020,positive,great conclusion  terrific score really enjoyed it
Jan 11 2020,positive,loved this movie teared up a bit 
Jan 11 2020,negative,it destroys the character arc of anakin skywalker  force healing creates tremendous plot holes for the saga  palpatine kills himself i guess he didnt learn from the encounter with mace windu kylo ren should have never been redeemed  continuity is nonexistent and it disrespects everything that has come before it this is not star wars  my single star is credited to the actors and artist
Jan 11 2020,positive,give them credit for trying to fix the dumpster fire that was the last jedi it was just too much damage to recover from they really did try to make things like rey being awesome at everything make sense but the characters are just not very likable
Jan 11 2020,positive,i loved it but its great that my kids will be able to grow up with star wars like i did
Jan 11 2020,negative,disappointing  sour taste to end this beloved saga the film was rushed course corrected  too much fan service the plot was a hot mess biggest let down in cinema of 2019 possibly 2010 decade
Jan 11 2020,positive,a perfect and fitting goodbye to the characters and story weve known for most of our lives  both of abrams chapters were successful in capturing the spirit of the tale with which lucas originally captured so many of us
Jan 11 2020,positive,i enjoyed the movie from start to finish it stood to the standards of the star wars saga loyally although political correctness has liberally shown its ugly head that treatment is to be expected in the story lines of today 
Jan 11 2020,positive,story 35 acting 55 visual and audio 55 fan service 55
Jan 11 2020,positive,while it tied up some loose ends it felt cobbled together and provided an ending that is pretty formulaic
Jan 11 2020,positive,if you are a fan of star wars this movie is for you as far as being a good movie it falls short the story is a mess it makes no sense even in the rules if the star wars universe
Jan 11 2020,positive,loved it great to see the old and new characters bring this story to a conclusion
Jan 11 2020,positive,it has everything you love in star wars and more
Jan 11 2020,positive,i thought it was a good ending to the skywalker saga
Jan 11 2020,positive,i liked the action and the filming was great it closed a number of questions but also raised a few
Jan 11 2020,positive,clichebut entertaining
Jan 11 2020,positive,jj had a lot to overcome  he did an excellent job all things considered
Jan 11 2020,positive,great movie a perfect way to end this over 40 year old story 
Jan 11 2020,positive,suspenseful all the way through highly recommend
Jan 11 2020,positive,loved this movie and that is what it is a movie dont dissect it dont get caught up in flawswatch it and enjoy it for what it is i thought it was a beautiful movie with fun and laughter but also powerful action and drama and everything cheesy about star wars saw it 3 times would see again
Jan 11 2020,positive,i liked that the story of star wars was concluded without remaining questions i liked the appearance of the three main characters of the original movies even though all of them were dead by this time it gave a finish fo the saga of the wars and answered all the questions remaining
Jan 11 2020,positive,characters are good the just seems like it was missing something like rushed like it couldve been two movies and plus give a little more detail on some things and it was just weird them trying to go back and hit and show things and characters from the previous movie just to kind of like summarize the entire series it was little off  its like they take you back to someplace that maybe was in the first movie or what are the others and then its almost like this feeling of hello and goodbye forever
Jan 11 2020,positive,amazing film great sequences of action development of characters themes of redemption and love and moments of laughter and tears many beautiful surprises and a great mix of characters new and old dont know which movie the critics saw but ros was brilliantly made
Jan 11 2020,positive,dont overthink it and its fine
Jan 11 2020,positive,i was there in 1977 for the original if your like me this is the perfect end  dont get caught up in the social media hype  i think the uber star wars geeks love to hate the movie that is out for some reason  fun action packed and i loved it as much as the original episode four when i sat in the theater as a kid  you will not be disappointed dont wait to see it on dvd see it where it sounds great and is the most fun in the movie theater
Jan 11 2020,positive,highly engaging at times a bit corny but overall riveting
Jan 11 2020,positive,i loved itbig star wars fan
Jan 11 2020,positive,this is a fantastic film that resurrects the failing sequal trilogy and repairs some of the damage left behind by its unfavourable predecessor for all fans alike though it does have its faults throughout they can be forgiven by its action packed scenes compelling story and its interesting finale a marvelous way to end a lovable and unforgettable franchise
Jan 11 2020,positive,more of the same i wasnt awed this time around
Jan 11 2020,positive,this was a good ending to the skywalker chapter of star wars we know and love
Jan 11 2020,negative,this movie was a big joke
Jan 11 2020,negative,10 years ago star wars was just 16 it already had an ending and this movie contradicted everything it contradicted the plot that anakin alone was to destroy the sith and bring balance
Jan 11 2020,positive,in my opinion jj abrams tried to walk a very tight line  in most places i felt he succeeded in doing so the film is fast paced and exciting for what star wars is  a popcorn munching popculture phenomenon  this entry is a perfect nostalgic sendoff for the main saga of films it will surely leave this generation with just as fond memories as those films which came before it 810
Jan 11 2020,positive,i enjoyed the movie  im not a hard core sw follower but have seen all the movies  i only wish the scene where rey had the forces of all the prior jedis with her had been a tad more climactic  i was left feeling very underwhelmed for something that seemingly should have been a much more powerful part of the movie
Jan 11 2020,positive,an amazing and epic ending of a saga that has made such an impact on the movie industry and on popculture i loved star wars from the very beginning and this ending is perfect
Jan 11 2020,positive,typical star wars  cheesy but totally entertaining
Jan 11 2020,positive,i thought they worked in carrie fisher beautifully as well as mark hamill and harrison ford but i missed obwon and yoda
Jan 11 2020,positive,it was a replay of episode 4s storyline
Jan 11 2020,positive,best of the newest movies
Jan 11 2020,positive,overall i think that star wars the rise of skywalker was a great movie  it was well made and boasted amazing graphics along with the development of the star wars characters we all know and love  the movie also featured lightsaber battles and an inner conflict between rey and kylo ren  although the movie is great in all of the areas you would expect this kind of movie to be great in i do have a couple gripes about the movie  first of all throughout the whole movie you knew what was coming next  for my taste the movie was too predictable something you just dont see in a billion dollar movie  lastly the movie did a very bad job implementing palpitine  having him as the ruler of the dark side with the same manipulative abilities but without the power you would expect from his former self  while this movie shined in most areas the movie is too predictable and emperor palpatine is not what you would expect which irritates me
Jan 11 2020,positive,spectacular movie with an amazing ending at tatooine
Jan 11 2020,negative,could of been fun but it felt like two movies crammed into one it felt like several versions of scenes were made then cobbled together to see which order of then would offend the least amount of people
Jan 11 2020,neutral,shallow brain dead superficial fun  you certainly leave the theater with the realization that nothing is accomplished with the final three movies and also balancing the force was never actually a thing
Jan 11 2020,positive,while i definitely had my issues with it overall i enjoyed the movie and had a fun time watching it
Jan 11 2020,positive,thrilling end to a nine film saga
Jan 11 2020,negative,just when you thought it couldnt get any worse they  totally destroyed the franchise with the worst star wars movie of all time lazy writiing inconsistency and pure nonsense disney and abrams seemed  to be more interested in diversity than a good story the writers and director must think the audience are complete imbeciles if they expect us to swallow this it does not deserve to be called a star wars film shame on disney and jj abrams for doing this to the franchise
Jan 11 2020,positive,nice end to the latest trilogy but the pacing of the movie was a bit strange and at times seemed too predictable  but thats star wars probably the worst of the latest films but having said that it is still enjoyable to watch a wasted casting for john boyega screaming rey for three films isnt the best way to use such a great actor
Jan 11 2020,positive,action packed  and well connected to previous star wars movies  if you liked the previous movies this is a must see  you will not be disappointed
Jan 11 2020,negative,bad story broken canon and even bad visual and audio compare to others movies the only somehow working character is ren other  is more than just bad
Jan 11 2020,negative,some truly amazing scenes muddled with a very rushed pace and lack of emotion throughout needed to be a twoparter to feel at the right pace and allow you to think about what youve just witnessed without questionable plot devices and the strong feeling of missing scenes throughout ending sequences are hilariously bizare and frustrating makes the prequals a better experience
Jan 11 2020,neutral,it was a hood movie just not as good as some of the other star wars glad we went to see it
Jan 11 2020,negative,underwhelming poorly edited they forgot the trademark lfl scene transition effect for the entire thing with a incoherent story that recons the last jedi as well as their own comic books and canon material released in 2019 i was annoyed and at the end i wished i could unsee it
Jan 11 2020,positive,must see for sw fans has its faults but loved the homages to the original characters cgi enhanced rather than hindered and cast on fine form
Jan 11 2020,positive,i cannot comprehend why people are so intent on hating this film it was a brilliant end to the saga and finally tied up loose ends and fits the star wars story yes its fastpaced and theres fan service but please dont hate this film because its too star wars
Jan 11 2020,positive,as a star wars fan i went into this movie hoping for the best i had heard the negative reviews but chose to ignore them and create my own conclusion the reviews have been a bit too harsh but not far from the truth the beginning of the movie is so scattered and i could not understand the plot because of the fast changes in the scenes i felt the ending was very confusing and left me wanting more but not in a good way if one can ignore all the plot holes and just go for a fun time then it will be a great movie as a fan however i was a bit disappointed
Jan 11 2020,positive,visually the movie was fantastic the story is struggling
Jan 11 2020,positive,i am not a star wars fan in fact these movies are really boring to me but i enjoyed this one a lot
Jan 11 2020,positive,had fun watching the film and liked the fan service overall  there is so much to process and will need a second viewing to see what i missed  the movie needed more time to develop some plot points and characters  hope there is a directors cut  this is why the future of storytelling is on tv shows and video games if done right you can develop characters and stories with more detail  2 to 3 hours is not enough
Jan 11 2020,negative,the writing was horrible the plot made no sense canon was destroyed repeated storylines and everyone is always related done with it
Jan 11 2020,negative,full of plot holes disrespectsnodestroys luke and anakinvaders story arcs logic definitely flies off to another galaxy far far away
Jan 11 2020,negative,i came into this movie having the bar set so low and yet i still find myself disappointed i will admit i loved the first 2 minutes of the movie after the title roll the cinematography of kylo and his search were well done after that it was a downward spiral the film moves so fast its hard to keep up they easily packed 2 maybe even 3 movies into 1 each subplot is immediately solved in a matter of minutes sometimes even seconds this movies honestly seems like it was made for trailers everything you see in the trailer makes absolutely no sense when youre watching it its so messy i appreciate jj trying to appeal to fan service and i did love how he basically gave rian johnson a big middle finger to the previous film other than that i hated the rest of this film if you love pretty visuals in movies you might enjoy this however if youre a fan a star wars you will be insulted disney is insulting the intelligence of its fans
Jan 11 2020,positive,plot twists sequence effects and character arks thats all i have to say
Jan 11 2020,negative,for the amount of breathless action in this film it was pretty dull lots of mcguffins lots of getting from one place to another lots of winks to fandom and digs at the last jedi lots of crises immediately defused lots of forcerelated abilities that dont make much sense
Jan 11 2020,negative,full commercial shit
Jan 11 2020,positive,regardless of what anyone says movie is fye
Jan 11 2020,positive,i liked whowhatreally rey is
Jan 11 2020,positive,the new characters are still cringy tone them down a bit and you have something definitely a penalty flag for excessive celebration near the end loved the the young luke and leia scene touched on what i really wanted out of this trilogy the first exegol scene was good as well all in all this was a decent movie but the trilogy as a whole is a giant missed opportunity
Jan 11 2020,negative,what a dumpster fire of swiss cheese plot problems and a lets just try everything blind swings 
Jan 11 2020,negative,it poised more questions than give actual answers
Jan 11 2020,negative,it seems like they didnt have any story here i was watching a playstation game where random characters provide clues to keep the story going  lets not even start with the force  1 ability to heal now is wide spread 2 the force can hold back a spaceshipreally why didnt darby vader do that to the millennium falcon  3 palpatine can disable an entire fleet of rebel shipsseriously this is god like  4 communicate across the galaxy and be able to grab objects  wow disney
Jan 11 2020,positive,great movie i saw it in 3d  it was worth it
Jan 11 2020,positive,good movie little bit of fan service in parts but altogether my favorite of the sequel trilogy felt like a nice way to end up the skywalker saga
Jan 11 2020,positive,i actually really loved it
Jan 11 2020,positive,one of the best star wars movies top three
Jan 11 2020,positive,a good conclusion to the latest star wars chapter
Jan 11 2020,positive,liked answered all the questions that lead up to its final installment story is awesome interesting and intriguing disliked wish there was alittle more lightsaber battles and i felt that the ending fight couldve been added more to as well
Jan 11 2020,positive,42 years of my life wrapped up in 25 hours it was not perfect but it wrapped up all the stories while adding some twists i enjoyed the tension between kilo  rey and where that went who rey is not what i saw coming but it follows the whole timeline there are still place to go with the stories so it will be interesting to see what comes out of it
Jan 11 2020,positive,i honestly enjoyed the movie i also think it could have been a 9a and 9b the reason why because of plot i would have love to have seen what happened to palpatine leading up to the final showdown even how snoke was made the explanation of the diode would be a added bonus the movie itself is great from what time they had left to pull this off
Jan 11 2020,negative,this movie was very enjoyable i loved watching it everything that happened in the film where the story was taken and how it inevitably ended the saga was just pitiful i couldnt tell if abrams was creating something new and unique for star wars is if he was just trying to provide damage control to a movie that die hard fans despised disney did really well with this movie regarding the visuals and the music was just spectacular i found that the main villain was wasted and all the other small villains were just boring or misused a lot of the supporting roles and the main roles were basic and dull adam driver did a good job i guess  he did as good as anyone could do with what he was given its unfortunate force awakens was a blast last jedi was shocking evil and skywalker was just sad
Jan 11 2020,positive,i wish ben didnt die  great movie though
Jan 11 2020,positive,i wasnt disappointed liked  how the story developed
Jan 11 2020,positive,star wars was awesome made me cry made me laugh  i wouldnt change s thing  absolutely loved ever part of it i am 70 now and i still as young as i was at26 watching a new hope  
Jan 11 2020,neutral,not that exciting of a story fairly predictable and by the end all the ghosts of the past had been dredged up to bring the goodness back to the screen
Jan 11 2020,positive,great finish to the series glad i saw it
Jan 11 2020,positive,while better than the last jedi the story was still overly derivative of the original trilogy and tried to cram too much into one film the pacing was too frantic and crowded leaving little space to care about what happens to whom an underwhelming end to the saga
Jan 11 2020,positive,i love it great way to end an amazing saga
Jan 11 2020,positive,i loved it i cant for whats to come
Jan 11 2020,negative,this movie just didnt make sense poor writing quality what a half assed way to end a saga
Jan 11 2020,positive,pretty good  weakish story but pretty decent acting and reasonably good effects  see it if you want
Jan 11 2020,positive,waited for a long time for this one and it was definitely worth it seeing it in 3d was totally amazing not to mention the theater shook every time there was a big action scene i would definitely see this one again
Jan 11 2020,positive,i really like the acting from daisy ridley  adam driver i liked the sets  props i thought the editing was too fast  choppy i thought the story was a mess but i guess thats it for this storyline lets go on some new adventures in this galaxy from a long time ago far far away shall we
Jan 11 2020,positive,good but not great aside from the ending every battle or action scene was very minor needed more large scale battles in my opinion
Jan 11 2020,positive,words cannot describe my feelings for this movie it is epic beginning to end spoilers  palpatine is used if not annoying how he wasnt explained how he was alive other than a prequel quote but he was used very well and drove the story to  one of the best final battle scenes in the saga  rey being a palpatine but at the end calling herself a skywalker shows that names dont define a person and it it the person who makes a difference  1010  see 10000 times
Jan 11 2020,positive,amazing movie  i think this is one of my favorite now
Jan 11 2020,positive,im not a star wars devotee so the movie was good but i got lost on some of its meaning
Jan 11 2020,negative,i didnt think it could get worse but it did
Jan 11 2020,positive,2nd time ive seen it yeah there are things i would change but i dont think it warrants the hate it deserves
Jan 11 2020,positive,best since the originals 
Jan 11 2020,negative,film that does not take any chances at all director who did nothing innovative and only took advantage of things that already existed this is a fan fear
Jan 11 2020,positive,i enjoyed the movie thoroughly it was fast paced but i had no trouble keeping up there were things i would have changed however i understood why things were made it was a great experience always fun to watch a new star wars film
Jan 11 2020,positive,satisfying yet frustrating overall the episode 9 ties too nice a bow on the final trilogy probably of the star wars franchise  theres a lot of nostalgia and good feelings and walking out of the theater with the music playing in the closing credits still brings goosebumps  the set pieces are captivating even if the material isnt fresh and the script is nearly total formula  dont think about it too much and enjoy it  final score  7110
Jan 11 2020,negative,predictable and frankly a bit boring the special effects were awesome but the plot and unfolding story was all over the place it seems the director was trying to pull another film from an already stretched saga
Jan 11 2020,positive,loved it my favorite so far
Jan 11 2020,positive,great way to end the trilogy and skywalker era moviesnice closure to a bunch of stories with surprising conclusions
Jan 11 2020,positive,way better than the previous installment
Jan 11 2020,positive,really feel like it lived up to the star wars legacy made me feel like i got to see one of the original trilogy movies in theater
Jan 11 2020,positive,probably my favorite star wars movie ever
Jan 11 2020,positive,too many plot holes but still very entertaining
Jan 11 2020,positive,i always enjoy following the star war episodes
Jan 11 2020,positive,i was a great ending to the skywalker sega
Jan 11 2020,positive,probably the most disappointing star wars movie since the phantom menace now i actually dont have a lot of issues with this film only 3 issues really stand out to me but they are 3 very major issues the first is the pacing were the prequels or the last jedi too slow for you well this movie moves along so fast it barely gives you any time to breathe for some who just want to go on a fun ride this might be a good thing for me though slowing down and letting the characters just talk to each other is really important this movie barely does that there is always something going on or a plot twist being dropped it went so fast i didnt even have time to comprehend a lot of it this movie feels very rushed it does slow down a little later on but its still a major issue with a good chunk of the film there are also way too many new characters introduced you have a large enough cast as it is just work with what you already have my second issue is palpatine its no spoiler that emperor palpatine returns in this movie his voice can be heard in every trailer and hes on the teaser poster youre supposed to know this going in palpatines return is handled horribly hes supposed to be the main villain even though hes been completely absent from the last two movies its completely anticlimactic none of the characters know who he is or have any real connection with him were supposed to accept that hes somehow still alive even though we saw him die he fell down a pit and exploded its not like bringing back maul or boba fett they literally tell you he came back to life in the opening crawl and then go on to handwave it away with a prequel meme thats it im not kidding its embarrassing how poorlywritten he is they never explain where hes been all this time what hes been up to why hes been doing it how hes been doing it why hes waited so long or how he was resurrected did someone fish his body out of the death star is he some kind of clone like in the old dark empire comics is he a ghost i have no idea and i bet the filmmakers dont either its insulting the third issue i have with this film is the lack of continuity with the other movies the last jedi especially a lot of that movie is either ignored or undone by this movie rose is replaced with a giant slug monster and relegated to a background role they bring in an emperor figure when the last movie made a point to get rid of that and have kylo ren be the main villain and lets just say that rey isnt exactly a nobody could you imagine if richard marquand got rid of lando and made luke not actually vaders son in return of the jedi its so frustrating jj abrams sacrificed a flowing narrative for this trilogy for his own original vision its selfish and its childish again this may be a positive if you hated the last jedi i really like the last jedi so this really bothered me its clear that there was no plan for this trilogy from the beginning and the filmmakers didnt have enough communication with one another its not only tlj that this movie retcons bringing palpatine back really diminishes anakins sacrifice at the end of return of the jedi and kind of rewrites the entire star wars mythos he was the chosen one prophesied to destroy the sith and bring balance to the force he did that by killing palpatine in return of the jedi only he didnt palpatine survived i had the same issue with the old expanded universe i thought the reason they got rid of the eu was so that they could improve on the postjedi storyline not repeat the same mistakes it made only somehow worse whos the chosen one now whats the point of the prophecy what did anakin die for i have no idea this movie also contradicts some of the newer books and comics again i thought the point of getting rid of the eu was to create a more cohesive universe with the films and the nonfilm material if the movies are still going to ignore or contradict the books and comics why did they find it necessary to discontinue the old books and comics from coming out at all they could have two timelines going on at the same time i dont think it would be confusing anyway im getting very nerdy and offtopic from how much im trashing this movie you might think that i hate it i dont i still had fun watching it and there was quite a bit that i enjoyed rey and kylo ren are still great the effects are excellent as always the integration of the carrie fisher footage is pretty seamless the action is thrilling theres good comedy the acting is good and there are many surprises that got me genuinely excited i also liked how it didnt retcon the luke storyline from tlj they just made it more clear for those in the audience who didnt fully understand the point of it in the last movie this movie also explains why hyperspace ramming isnt a common tactic in warfare in the star wars universe after it was shown to be so deadly in the last jedi overall this movie is an absolute mess and a major disappointment but it makes for a fun time out at the movies just dont think too hard about how it connects with the other star wars movies and youll be fine i can see why people like it its just not for me
Jan 11 2020,negative,meh just meh it was alright if it wasnt supposed to be the conclusion of a predetermined 9 episode series perhaps this shouldve been the 1s first film of the final trilogy
Jan 11 2020,positive,great action and a true star wars movie
Jan 11 2020,positive,its star wars it tied everything together nicely
Jan 11 2020,positive,this movie was amazing it answered some questions and left some to be desired the graphics were amazing and the acting was top notch
Jan 11 2020,positive,great story line lots of action
Jan 11 2020,positive,enjoyable movie but more of the same storyline  too pg for my liking
Jan 11 2020,positive,great way to end the saga
Jan 11 2020,positive,there were a lot of things to like in this movie i liked the way they brought back all the old characters from the original trilogy i also like the way it came full circle at the end i especially liked the redemption of ben through reys compassion and healing i just thought that was really uplifting
Jan 11 2020,positive,this movie was excellent  kept me on my toes i teared up   couldnt believe it just like the cast lol im literally going to start all over with movies i dont disagree with how it ended contrary to some of the opinions ive heard i thought it was perfect
Jan 11 2020,positive,really good movie kept my attention through the entire movie
Jan 11 2020,negative,this movie was horrible not only in the grand scheme of the star wars mythos but as an individual narrative this movie tries to ignore aspects of the other two films pulls out random get out of jail free cards because movie continues the trend of making rey unessecarily powerful with an explanation that is not sufficient enough to justify it both rey and kylo are inconsisted characterspoor daisy and adam too cause acting wise they did fantastic just bad writing and certain characters who were built up as supposed to mean something didnt matter the biggest issue i had with the movie was the infornation of it all in that what needed to be explained was never explained and what didnt need to be explained was not only explained but sometimes more than once that and the idea that two separate scwnes in the film allude to another time period just loke in the last jedi where it makes the viewer feel like we missed a complete other movie there is more i wish to go over but it would breach on spoiler territory i still feel it is worth the watch but because it is star wars not because it is good this film is the end of an era and hopefully when the next trilogy is better than this i would also like to highlight that many of this films issues were a direct result of rian johnsons work horrible work on the last jedi but i digress
Jan 11 2020,positive,it was just okay  i liked and i hated  i dont know how to describe all my feelings or to slam it as a bad movie  my childhood feels incomplete says this 41 yr old man who was hoping for an epic conclusion  it is what it is  the good the bad  and the end
Jan 11 2020,positive,loved itfelt like one of the original 3
Jan 11 2020,positive,it was star wars from beginning to end not a perfect movie but its a great star wars movie
Jan 11 2020,positive,i am not a starwars fan but the movie wasnt bad i mean i kind of like starwars but overall i liked it
Jan 11 2020,positive,stars wars speaks for itself
Jan 11 2020,negative,its the worst movie i have seen in the past years what a waste of money and time
Jan 11 2020,positive,wife was a little annoying
Jan 11 2020,negative,like a multilayered jelloo salad each dissonant component of this movie is miserable and disappointing in its own right and yet somehow the whole is worse than the sum of its parts
Jan 11 2020,positive,critics are being a bit harsh on this one it got a lot right pulling some heartstrings and it also went for bigger instead of innovative and got a bit jumbled in trying to fit so much in
Jan 11 2020,positive,finally a featurelength space western action soap opera with representation
Jan 11 2020,positive,i watched all ten prequels just before watching this one which made it more enjoyable but i was thrown off by the introduction of all new sets of random powers that didnt correlate to the earlier movies made me feel like i was watching another avengers flick where the rules of what the heros powers and strengths are change scene to scene but i was still entertained the quality was great as were the characters sand the actors  who played them
Jan 11 2020,positive,spectacular better than we expected  still a little lost in parts of the story but this was a very entertaining movie we loved it and plan to see it again  the imax experience was really great
Jan 11 2020,negative,another spin off movie that seems to be a dream sequence storyboard no need to watch prior 8 movies this will only create confusion   spoiler  anticipated rey was a skywalker by blood not by a last minute decision before the movie ends so the title had a purpose reys bond with portrayed father figure han solo in ep 7 and brother kylo ren in ep 7  8 left me anticipating a finishing tale to explain how the skywalker bloodline finishes the destruction of darth sidious once again and continues the training of the jedi as episodes 18 lead up to
Jan 11 2020,positive,i loved it and cant wait to watch it again
Jan 11 2020,negative,cheesy poor character explanations too many plot holes to name
Jan 11 2020,positive,the conclusion the fans expected thanks jj abrams you have been in charge of this trilogy from the beginning dear disney delete episode viii the last jedi say goodbye to rian johnson and kathleen kennedy please and we forgive you all disney
Jan 11 2020,negative,dont watch it dont consider it canon seriously this is not worth it this trilogy is not worth it just consider it noncanon dont watch dont show this trilogy to future generations this movie legitemately takes a dump on the original saga this whole trilogy does that but especially this one just dont dont dont
Jan 11 2020,neutral,ah another stars wars movie that you have to see jumbled abysmal plot bad dialog questionable acting less than the best cgi thankfully it does move at a quick pace
Jan 11 2020,positive,i liked the way they ended the star wars saga  further i was impressed with the portrayal of leia even though she passed away before this movie was made
Jan 11 2020,positive,my husband and i really liked this star wars movie better than the last one
Jan 11 2020,positive,brings a sense of epicness back to the sequels i liked it but can understand why a casual fan would get lost
Jan 11 2020,neutral,it was better than the last jedi
Jan 11 2020,positive,the best one yet you can watch and enjoy without having watched all of the others
Jan 11 2020,positive,luke skywalker fixed reys insane power explained hyper space ramming fixed kylo ren finally well utilized snoke explained the characters finally had meaningful relationships and interactions pacing mild whiplash
Jan 11 2020,positive,the second time was better than the first 
Jan 11 2020,positive,excellent story lines and secrets revealed amazing cinematographyloved iti sense another movie in the works eventually
Jan 11 2020,neutral,ive seen all the star wars films however was minimally entertained by the last 3yawn  watched this for just 650 and nearly walked out   not a big fan of nonsense fantasy or magic while a huge fan of more science based scifi so have always been more star trek oriented  recent star wars films have increasingly moved into the fantasy direction that are on the level of nonsense super hero stories  also casting seems to be appeasing all the politically correct and global marketing types  dialogue was so predictable and tended to touch all the pc bases   not likely to watch any more of these films
Jan 10 2020,negative,terrible just terrible the writing is completely nonsensical as the main character rey is a mary sue a mary sue is easily defined as the universe bends to the characters will we see this as a a character shown in previous movies is written to be a professional pilot and all a sudden this lonely hermit whos lived their entire life alone is suddenly better than them and b everyone loves the character and she does nothing wrong if she does do something negative its an accident and she was trying to protect them this character was only invented for political reasons and like effing clockwork it is a terrible mess as a longtime star wars fan seeing this dumpster fire of a movie just makes me sad this is mostly disneys fault as apparently they meddled with everything you have ruined my favorite fiction story
Jan 10 2020,positive,a really exciting movie the star wars movie thus far
Jan 10 2020,positive,entertaining and satisfying
Jan 10 2020,positive,too long to wait for action
Jan 10 2020,negative,tiring and repetitive and cheezey
Jan 10 2020,negative,a truly uninspiring finale to what should have been the greatest bigscreen adventure of our generation every part of rise of skywalker feels contrived and mediocre the characters take a back seat to unbelievably awkward plot choices and convoluted worldbuilding thats as thick as a jungle and every bit as unkempt its clear at every turn that disney and abrams worked feverishly to walk back each one of the interesting decisions johnson made in the last jedi making it abundantly clear that abrams is great at regurgitating stories but possesses no real spark of originality the emotional weight of the trilogys most interesting characters gets sidelined by flashy visuals and ill attempts to shock the audience and each moment intended to make a resounding impact simply falls utterly flat rey is suddenly a completely uninteresting heroine with new connections that dodge the greater emotional implications of her arc in the previous two films while simultaneously cheapening her arc in this one were expected to believe that shes been genuinely tempted to the dark side when weve only ever seen her get a little miffed here and there and that sheby herselfhas the strength that the most accomplished jedi masters at the height of the jedi order did not beyond that the one great shining light throughout this whole trilogyadam drivers kylo rengets utterly deflated and turned into a dopey awkward child with no real sacrifice to justify a redemption and significantly less motivation than vader had as he watched his sonone of the last connections to his departed wifeget tortured to death its clear disney wanted to answer fan questions however their obsession to address every single one of them means they dont really answer any of them at all see snoke overall its a very disappointing ramble through the bits of a galaxy far far away that no one ever really cared to see driven at a breakneck pace that seems to hope you wont ask questions if they just move fast and get it over with as soon as possible as a pretty hardcore fan of the star wars franchise very few things have left me as disappointed as this film i also feel like i should say my cold response wasnt the result of me expecting to see my own story ideas or the choices i would have made on the screen i think i was just hoping for a cohesive conclusion to a threefilm saga that respected each installment and allowed the characters to grow in organic ways they could have easily ripped this script off of a reddit post that was upset about the last jedi at the very least they buttoned up the story well enough that none of us should ever have to look at these dismal characters on the bigscreen ever againand for that i can say im grateful rey is the last jedi
Jan 10 2020,positive,better than last jedi but still not as good as force awakens amazing visuals but not the greatest overall storyline 
Jan 10 2020,positive,i had high hopes for this film but i was disappointed it has good action scenes and the visuals are great but it was too hard to watch in the first 20min the dialogue was terrible plus there are no surprise moments just wtf moments i hope this make sense the second time i watch the film best performance is by adam driver
Jan 10 2020,negative,a horrible end to a great film series the star wars saga was complete at the end of return of the jedi great special effects does not make up for a lack of quality story telling adding a 4th act is simply structurally poor writing and i am sure george lucas was well aware of this the latest installment is as hollow a tale as its two predecessors if i could give negative stars i would
Jan 10 2020,negative,it was as bad as the second one it shouldnt worth not even a 010 ticket
Jan 10 2020,positive,loved how they tied everything together
Jan 10 2020,positive,solid  not awesome i will take it hard to speak without spoilers but in quick bullet points  knights of ren disappointing kylo ren  awesome rey  no spoilers but predictable flashbacks  solid fights  need more lightsaber action space battles  awesome story  final finished there is no going back probably for the best if you didnt like two before ep  ix you wont like this one either if you did you will have fun thank you to all the people who made this real through their hard work i appreciate it
Jan 10 2020,negative,the story line all over the place and it was hard to follow thanks
Jan 10 2020,negative,not as bad as some have said but plot holes you can drive a fleet of star destroyers through so my rating  worst to best the last jedi after rise this movie need not exist the force awakens a new hope v2 the phantom menace rise of skywalker attack of the clones return of the jedi revenge of the sith a new hope the empire strikes back  the force has no rules  it can do whatever you need it to
Jan 10 2020,negative,this movie moves so fast and makes so little thematic sense that its hard to imagine it not being in the bottom three star wars films when we look back in a few years jj abrams completely failed to rise to the challenge that rian johnson presented tried to please two different fan camps and broke the story
Jan 10 2020,neutral,works as a movie lots of action and less story but hey dont think abrams had an easy starting point and he didnt mess up completely
Jan 10 2020,negative,for a movie that was so long it seemed to be filled with a lot of fluff there was a lot of pointless action scenes in the first half that seemed to go nowhere that could have been cut out to make way for scenes to transition the plot it seemed to just be a linear ride instead of a story driven by characters while the cg looked amazing i was quite bored until the climax
Jan 10 2020,positive,loved it true star wars fans must give in to the hate
Jan 10 2020,negative,this is not my star warsi dont know what happenedbut apart from the visuals  got that disney money yo and some intresting ideas that never get fully developedthere is not a single thing about tros that makes me appreciate it
Jan 10 2020,positive,perfect cape to complete the series
Jan 10 2020,positive,i absolutely loved this movie yes there were problems mostly because of the disaster that rian left but it was so much fun so fast so full of action and feels that i could look past the flaws at least on the first viewing so far all these stupid comments about fan service just drive me nuts isnt that who these movies are made for the fans want a brand new movie going experience or something that is going to surprise you go see a good rian johnson movie knives out he is a great filmmaker when he is completely doing his own stuff and not taking the reigns of a 30 plus year franchise that has crazy loyal fans but if you want a star wars movie filled with characters and action and plot points that you love and want more of go see this movie jj abrams is a true fan and i only wish he could have done the story as he wanted it played out
Jan 10 2020,negative,allow me to preface this review by stating that i enjoy every star wars film yes including the phantom menace and attack of the clones and this was no exception it was a highly entertaining romp that included many fun callbacks to service longterm fans of the franchise from revisiting the ruins of the death star to seeing the return of luke skywalkers xwing from a new hope that being said the rise of skywalker suffered from indecision and inconsistency within itself and in the context of the star wars canon  jj abrams was not expected to have further involvement in the reprised star wars series following his direction of the force awakens this is painfully obvious in the rise of skywalker which seems determined to disavow the developments of the last jedi  such as the romance between finn and rose the use of force by laymen and raes unspectacular parentage  in favour of a return to traditional form  the rise of skywalker sees the return of emperor palpatine who was believed to have been killed by darth vader in return of the jedi while the return of a historical villain is itself indicative of the film being mired in the past it is made more problematic given that it is revealed in the opening crawl with no explanation of how it occurred nor any comment on its significance  in the course of the film it is revealed that rae is the granddaughter of emperor palpatine this undermines the narrative development of the last jedi which had sought to establish that raes force ability was not genetic thereby heralding the possibility that regular people could harness the power of the force the palpatine lineage also becomes a crux for poor storytelling justifying underdeveloped plot points such as raes proficiency with a lightsaber despite her having no prior experience  additionally the rise of skywalker suffered from the traditional flaws of most disney films being that there was a lack of stakes and that the desire to please the audience outweighed the need for narrative cohesion and originality this was most evident in the multiple resurrections that occurred in the film which robbed the audience of the opportunity to actually feel something  the rise of skywalker was at its strongest when it focused on the relationship between rae and kylo ren and this is perhaps true of each of the new films in the reprised triad this can be attributed to the sense of interiority of the kylo ren character  he has dimensionality which makes him the most interesting person in a film that is populated with many stagnant personalities adam driver carries the narrative tension of the film as it is kylo ren who is truly torn between the light side and dark side this is why it is so satisfying when we see him wield a blue lightsaber when he joins rae in her battle against emperor palpatine that being said i am unsure that his turn to the light was truly earned having been prompted merely by hearing his mother call him ben his true name  in spite of the above even kylo ren is not safe from the broad strokes of fanservice inherent to a disney movie after emperor palpatine has been destroyed rae is dead and kylo ren has survived in many other films this could be considered a bittersweet and impactful ending which acknowledges the importance of sacrifice however disney is insistent that the hero be preserved accordingly kylo ren uses his remaining life force to resurrect rae and dies in her stead bringing the story back within the disney framework i was pushed beyond mere annoyance and into a blind rage when rae and kylo began to kiss as he was dying thereby confirming a romance that had been highly sought after by many star wars fans  the sheer level of onthenose wish fulfillment displayed here speaks to the detrimental effect of social media on our culture at least to the extent that artists pay heed to what is voiced on these platforms great art and therefore great film requires the creator to express their true nature in a singular cohesive vision when the audience is allowed to influence the creative process their competing opinions and ideas result in a highlyfragmented and ultimately incoherent piece of work  overall while the rise of skywalker is an enjoyable cinematic experience i am disappointed by what feels like a missed opportunity to expand on the star wars universe narratively and conceptually abrams desire to return to the status quo is rather comically made physically manifest in the poor reconstruction of kylo rens helmet which had been shattered in the last jedi   this brings to mind hannibal lecters musings on entropy  you may see a cup of tea fall off a table and break into piecesbut you will never see the cup gather itself back togetherthe increase of disorder or entropy is what distinguishes the past from the future  the last jedi dismantled many of the assumptions that existed within the star wars canon and abrams spends the entirety of the rise of skywalker attempting to reconstruct them the law of entropy suggests things cannot be restored to their original state once they are broken the rise of skywalker insists on trying to do this anyway and this is why it is ultimately unsuccessful
Jan 10 2020,positive,it was amazing the special effects were great the emotion from rey was intense and very well done
Jan 10 2020,positive,perfect in every way well done
Jan 10 2020,negative,was hopeful for at least a decent movie but no it was boring and i fell asleep 34 times by the end i was glad it was over too disneyfied lacking soul 
Jan 10 2020,negative,way too happy way too jumbled up why spoil the sideous mystery first thing why not build up to him why have his ships completely unprepared just so that the resistance can come blow them up in the nick of time nothing made sense subpar
Jan 10 2020,positive,loved it this movie was exactly what i needed to see cried like a 10 year old girl like 3 times for real i needed to see this thanks abrams
Jan 10 2020,positive,steps out of the rehashing found in force awakens and last jedi deferential to new hope and subversively mashing empire strikes back presenting old and new faces entertaining while not rising enough to be great there are wonderful scenes like babu frik becoming friends with c3po kylobens conversation with his father and seeing luke finally lift his xwing with the force that really stand out finally seeing a sith planet or a small glimpse of leia training as a jedi are nice too the movie tries to do too much packing in the finale for both the disney sequel trilogy as well as the 9 movie skywalker saga which is its ultimate downfall  the movie has enough fun to be worth a watch and for noncritics it will be less polarizing than its predecessor
Jan 10 2020,negative,sucked lame story line
Jan 10 2020,negative,the movie was extremely bad not did it have a bad story but also it had man bullshit moments and extremely cringy ones it missed so many opportunities i cant even list it and anakin not showing up or the other jedi was extrem stupid having kylo die makes the force be out of balance yet again this movie destroys the original trilogy and anakin arc basically it destroys starwars for me this movie is not canon and especially at the end i had a good laugh
Jan 10 2020,negative,while the visuals and score are amazing the rise of skywalker is filled with plot holes and edited incredibly poorly also rey is a jedi god and palpatine is somehow alive
Jan 10 2020,neutral,should have been two movies too much material without character or plot development
Jan 10 2020,positive,its a fun movie i watch these star wars movie and the flash bangs happen and i forget everything at the end
Jan 10 2020,positive,i liked it its a good enough ending and its a thrilling movie to watch while there are always a few things you can quibble with in a star wars movie i think for the most part they did right by the franchise and im sorry we wont be seeing more of these characters or will we
Jan 10 2020,positive,it was very average and not very creative it seemed like a movie disney puts out on every ending blockbuster movie like endgame and ray complained she didnt know who she is and she banned the truth of who she is at the very end
Jan 10 2020,positive,exactly what i expected i wouldnt change a thing
Jan 10 2020,positive,great movie fitting end of the skywalker series
Jan 10 2020,positive,best of the new films  fixed some of the problems created in the first two movies
Jan 10 2020,negative,so many inconsistencies so many poor story lines  erasing a droids memorywhich seems improbable but suddenly giving it back killing chewie but immediately bringing him back  kylo ren has to be the most feckless bad guy of all time  lando suddenly shows up in the falcon to help never saw that comingsarcasm  horses in space heroine never paid her dues and palpatine coming back with no explanation  one positive they didnt make us suffer thru anymore rose tico storylines  the disney elite have proven they really do know how to kill a franchise  but alas i am sure they didnt because the franchise will always make money  the thing they dont realize is that if they had given it to somebody who understands the culture and has a visionnot an agenda like for instance favreau they would not only have made money they would have broken the box office
Jan 10 2020,positive,i found myself rooting for the bad guys so they could put the protagonists out of there misery
Jan 10 2020,positive,i  like the sound effects
Jan 10 2020,positive,it wad a popcorn movie with a decent story  a few plot holes were never filled and it somewhat felt like a video game  a story filler with a quest then a boss fight then the next level  worth seeing once but no need to see again its not as bad as the utubers are ssying but its not going to win any awards either
Jan 10 2020,positive,it was fantastic  it kept with the feel of the first one in 1977
Jan 10 2020,negative,bland nothing new and too much of an attempt to make the film politically correct
Jan 10 2020,positive,theres nothing like star wars
Jan 10 2020,positive,it drew me in and had me transfixed until its satisfying end
Jan 10 2020,positive,it was good but ending was just not their almost but just missed the mark
Jan 10 2020,positive,very inconsistent to the original story cool to watch
Jan 10 2020,positive,i understand why some didnt like the movie but overall i loved it seeing it in 3d imax is a must
Jan 10 2020,positive,huge star wars fan but this feels too fast and not imaginative as past films it would have more impact if these characters were battling the same force previously  nevertheless it is a fun ride with a great cast one can hope for an extended edition but perhaps this would have been better told over two movies come soon episode x it feels like it just got started again and were back where return of the jedi ended
Jan 10 2020,positive,really enjoyed watching this movie  have watch everyone that came out at the movies and thought this was one of the best
Jan 10 2020,negative,it just doesnt make you pay attention very little interesting action very lfew interesting characters a lot of plot holes
Jan 10 2020,positive,best star wars movie yet
Jan 10 2020,positive,the story wasnt told very well but it was good to see some of the characters again cdw
Jan 10 2020,positive,visually its outstanding plot wise it lacked the least out of the last three movies but had too many where is this going moments  the film suffers from having to carry the preceding episodes of the trilogy one could say that episode 7 and especially episode 8 put up some sort of energy field that prevented this ball from getting over the outfield fence
Jan 10 2020,neutral,not a good movie but a fun one if you open your mind and let all the unanswerable questions go you will enjoy this movie but the second you spend any time thinking about the plot of this movie the dark side will take you over and your anger will lead to hate which will then lead to suffering 
Jan 10 2020,positive,a heroic effort at redeeming the mess created by the previous episode but ultimately cant save the trilogy from itself  in many ways it is unfair to try to rate this movie because it cant exist in a vacuum  it has to be reviewed in light of the previous two installments and to be really objective with all 8 previous canon movies in mind  that being said the movie is enjoyable and jj abrams deserves a large amount of credit for bringing the trilogy to a palatable close  this was no small task given what he was left to work with after rian johnsons deliberate attempt to pee in the proverbial star wars pool  but despite his best efforts the trilogy concludes in a disjointed manner leaving most of the supporting cast with characters that had no development or arc to their story and leaving the audience with little reason to care about them
Jan 10 2020,positive,i was pleasantly surprised by the latest star wars film although the manner of death good guys seem to take is getting ridiculous but i cant comment about that further without spoiling the plot the same with some new abilities jedis seem to have that in hindsight wouldve been pretty useful i think jj made a stellar job at saving what was left and at least getting sw slightly on track
Jan 10 2020,positive,absolutely stunning and action packed
Jan 10 2020,positive,it was truly a turnaround for the better in the trilogy that gave me exactly what i wanted
Jan 10 2020,positive,nice way to end the saga
Jan 10 2020,positive,great conclusion to an amazing epic
Jan 10 2020,negative,movie is nothing but contrived story with more plot holes than interesting characters
Jan 10 2020,neutral,shaky storyline maybe too much action to cover up the lack of a strong storyline  a little disappointed
Jan 10 2020,positive,was a very good movie all the usual twists and turns when all hope is lost type of thing expected from all the star wars movies
Jan 10 2020,neutral,enjoyable enough but there are waaaaaay too many plot points that are crammed in at the last second also half the movie is essentially fetch quests that dont do much to advance the plot probably not worth seeing in the theater
Jan 10 2020,positive,i liked this one and was thoroughly entertained worth the watch
Jan 10 2020,positive,best movie thats the way to end a trilogy trilogy loved it loved everything about it i must go see for any star wars fans
Jan 10 2020,positive,action packed didnt disappoint im going to go see it again
Jan 10 2020,positive,no surprises thought it was a bit formulaic
Jan 10 2020,positive,a fun and rousing way to conclude the star wars saga
Jan 10 2020,neutral,star wars the rise of fan fiction
Jan 10 2020,positive,i love it  a great ending to a timeless story
Jan 10 2020,positive,it is still good verses evil where the good wins out in the end the message  hope is the great motivator for those willing to work for something better  it is the message we need today as much as ever before even the bad person can redeem themselves there is a case where the bad destroys the evil
Jan 10 2020,positive,one of if not the best star wars ever loved it i rarely see movies twice but will be going back to see this one again
Jan 10 2020,positive,better than the last one
Jan 10 2020,negative,better than last jedi but so badly edited and plot holes throughout
Jan 10 2020,positive,i enjoyed the entire movie especially the special affects
Jan 10 2020,negative,garbage total incomprehensible garbage theres nothing about this movie that makes sense lazy incompliant
Jan 10 2020,negative,pretty boring lots of spectacular effects characters were uninteresting as was the plot
Jan 10 2020,negative,it was boring and dull very over rated
Jan 10 2020,negative,just stop the horse is dead as is so stopped dragging the dead freaking horse
Jan 10 2020,negative,what a mess  clever tie in with prequels and original trilogy though
Jan 10 2020,positive,saw it twice and loved it both times this movie is getting a bad rap go see it and make youre own mind up
Jan 10 2020,negative,while better than tlj at trying to be a fun and enjoyable starwars movie instead of a hate filled out of place political lecture it is too late to fix any of the gaping plot holes already setup in fact it introduces even more plot holes the story as a whole is impossible to follow because everything it hinges upon makes absolutely no sense when compared with the final reveals and motivations what i mean is if you think if that is what the bad guy  good guys wanted and rewatch it nothing makes any sense at all even the mechanics of how they go about what they do makes no sense it seems the only thing driving the movie is a desire to string together some cool imagined scenes and everything was clumsily written to try and shoe horn them in finally while i appreciate abrams attempt to fix tlj i get the feeling it is more out of a desire to snub johnson for snubbing him and these points in the movie really pull you out if the director isnt starring in the movie watching a scene shouldnt pull you out of the movie and make you imagine the directors arguing like youtube commenters i couldnt stand johnsons take either but id have preferred it abrams had just left it alone and not reminded us instead of these no you didnt moments that would have been less interrupting and more fun as a directors commentary track
Jan 10 2020,positive,great movie loved the storyline
Jan 10 2020,positive,if you love star wars its a must see
Jan 10 2020,positive,obligatory for those like me whove seen every installment
Jan 10 2020,positive,only saved by special effects story disappointed
Jan 10 2020,positive,a wonderfully beautiful mess of a film that is the perfect case study of disneys handling of the star wars franchise overall it continues many elements introduced in the highly divisive previous installment and even enhances said installment if not making it more endearing as a part of the overall story allinall an entertaining finish to the star wars sequel trilogy and if you go in with zero expectations and turn your brain off you should hopefully have fun
Jan 10 2020,positive,it was amazing action packed  you will not be disappointed
Jan 10 2020,negative,what a disgrace to a beloved franchise just cements how much they dont care about advancing lore and just relying on nostalgia and a messy direction to make money
Jan 10 2020,negative,the garbage in this movie is pretty much the same garbage that has plagued every film in the series going back to return of the jedi complete and utter lack of originality i was cautiously optimistic about it from the first trailer until that cackle from emperor smarmatine seriously they had to bring him back what a pile and it turned out to be predictable every single step of the way
Jan 10 2020,positive,overall good movie that tried to tie up all the lose ends
Jan 10 2020,positive,loved it did a good job of linking it to the original star wars
Jan 10 2020,positive,that was a nice movie the reason of this film to entertain the audience i enjoyed with my family from the beginning to the end this film was much more close to the original series i would by a ticket for a film of any journalist who dislike this movie than i can see will that movie be more coherent and interesting like this
Jan 10 2020,positive,fun ending to the saga
Jan 10 2020,positive,it was action packed and beautifully done  o love all the cameos from the first actors great movie
Jan 10 2020,positive,had a great time loved the way all the characters were brought back one last time
Jan 10 2020,positive,to invest this many years in the star wars series just to see it end in this way  with bizarre truly unbelievable storylines and forgettable new characters  was disappointing they in my opinion went to the well one too many times with the shocking unveiling of the surprise origins of characters star wars has become a story of estranged siblings parents and grandparents who after a series of battles and chases come to find out  too predictably now  that they are linked in some way rarely for the betterment of the story but almost always to the detriment of it the surprise connections eventually fall flat come off lazy and forced no pun intended and do a great job of almost burying completely the original brilliance of the storytelling
Jan 10 2020,positive,beautifully shot could have been two films but worth the ride
Jan 10 2020,positive,i thought the movie was excellent and had people sitting on the edge of their  seats the movie had plenty of action and made you feel like you were actually there i liked the way they went back to previous episodes to bring you upto date with episode 9 i  enjoyed the movie especially with my family and discussing it after the movie was over may the force be with all of us
Jan 10 2020,positive,in my opinion this was one of the best episodes yet  it had so much that was unexpected but also had a few things that could have been left out it was a very good way to end the saga
Jan 10 2020,negative,the beginning i liked when they found the death star it went downhill from there
Jan 10 2020,negative,what a let down feels like a case of film by committee
Jan 10 2020,neutral,felt like weve been there done that my kids really liked it though
Jan 10 2020,positive,my kids and i enjoyed the movie thoroughly for it was entertaining  for them it was actionfilled exciting and funny at times  for me it answered a lot of star wars questions which was satisfying
Jan 10 2020,positive,the movie as a whole was good but it was not on the level with all the other star wars movies to have rey save kylo only for him use everything in him to save her was over dramatiche was supposed to be so powerful yet he died doing it lame and she should have kept her family name as an example to show that there is always good even when blood relatives are bad sith
Jan 10 2020,positive,rey and kylie were amazing
Jan 10 2020,neutral,it is visually stunning acting is earnest and intense however the storyline is too predictable and where it was unpredictable like bringing palpatine back and introducing new secondary characters that dont matter  made me think the writers were desperate and rushing to finish the trilogy  i usually go back for a second and even third viewing but this one nope not wasting my time and hardearned money
Jan 10 2020,positive,not sure what lacked the bad guys cant aim and a weak story line
Jan 10 2020,neutral,very disappointed with this conclusion of the saga
Jan 10 2020,positive,good movie tons of action  cool use of the force
Jan 10 2020,positive,i thought they did a great job while not perfect  what really is
Jan 10 2020,positive,loved all star wars movies and this one didnt disappoint  hope this really isnt the end took my 7 year old grandson and he loved it  want to watch them all with him
Jan 10 2020,positive,loved the story cinematography imagery even some of the snarky bits were great the movie did feel like it tried to make many call backs to the original trilogy some of which felt forced but the great character reveals and the unity projected at the end left me satisfied with the conclusion of a tale that has spanned my whole life  the 3d imax experience was cool but not really worth more than standard admission for this film the quick transitions between shots made it difficult to appreciate the visual effects on the ginormous screen coupled with the blurriness incurred if you moved your head slightly out of center it wasnt worth the extra money for the presentation
Jan 10 2020,positive,this is the best starwars of all time must see
Jan 10 2020,positive,its got a bunch of references from previous star wars movie and the story is amazing even though its similar to return of the jedi
Jan 10 2020,positive,what great movie i would watch it again 
Jan 10 2020,positive,the movie was great and is really what youre looking for to round out the series there was a super awkward kiss at the end that i feel was unnecessary other than that it was pretty good
Jan 10 2020,negative,this movie is terrible
Jan 10 2020,positive,whole movie was great
Jan 10 2020,negative,the worst way to end the most epic saga ever
Jan 10 2020,positive,great movie it was very exciting and it came to an exciting conclusion
Jan 10 2020,negative,what a mess nothing made any sense in this movie
Jan 10 2020,negative,bad writing lack of suspense too many loopholes
Jan 10 2020,positive,this was just awesome
Jan 10 2020,positive,kind of like any star wars movie  pretty good enjoyable if you arent taking it too seriously and havent built up unrealistic expectations
Jan 10 2020,positive,i liked how the story progressed
Jan 10 2020,positive,overall i enjoyed the movie i did cry a couple of times and i was 12 when the very first star wars movie came out in 1977 so i understand some of the complaints that ive heard but i have taken the movie as is and i realize with the death of carrie fisher they unfortunately had to change things we miss our princess i look forward to the new endeavors from disney in the star wars universe
Jan 10 2020,negative,anyone that gave this movie 5 stars is either in denial or lying this was straight garbage that fails on almost every level the plot was nonsensical at times and confusing at others the sequel trilogy failed to make me care about any of the characters except kylo ren this movie more than the others cashed in on nostalgia and references to much better movies as a movie it failed to have a coherent plot there is no beginning middle or end rey is a terrible character that never went through the heroes journey or even had adversity poe seems like a wasted opportunity as he just had quips this movie and doesnt really serve a function same goes for finn the movie relies on coincidences far too much what are the odds you run into lando wandering around coachella or you find exactly what you are looking for by accidentally falling into quick sand the final space battle made no sense ground assaulting a star destroyer with horses you destroy one star destroyer the rest are useless while the rebel fleet is just fine flying around individually palpatines ships are all connected to the same router the rebels or whatever the heck they are called were basically destroyed in the last movie but now they are powerful and for some reason they are rising up against authority at the end because of some reason makes not sense and feels like lazy writing palpatines army makes no sense either who built it why make them all connected why destroy planets when you know that will turn public opinion against you why not enslave the galaxy via the ideas of aldous huxley have you learned nothing of sentient psychology even orwellian control is better than randomly destroying a planet this movie is lazy anger inspiring and worst of allboring i heard it was bad but i had to watch the final star wars movies i loved since i was a child i have seen them all in cinema starting with the rerelease of the original trilogy in the late 90s this is a terrible ending and one that retroactively shits on the earlier ones this made me miss jar jar binks i would give this movie 0 stars as it was such an offense to the audience member but i heard that rt doesnt calculate a 1 star in its averages
Jan 10 2020,negative,it is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing
Jan 10 2020,positive,fit well within star wars franchise good plot lines for each character
Jan 10 2020,positive,great end to the series a lot of great special effects
Jan 10 2020,positive,the special effects were great
Jan 10 2020,negative,reviews were not good but i never could have anticipated how unmitigatingly stupid a film could be  2 hours of lowest grade fan fiction absurd plots military action without military consult thats now a travel if its problems
Jan 10 2020,positive,loved it this was the 3rd time i saw the movie
Jan 10 2020,positive,it was very good just a little over due on effects
Jan 10 2020,positive,so for me best movie of the entire series
Jan 10 2020,positive,not the best or the worstits star wars  
Jan 10 2020,positive,the best star wars movie ever
Jan 10 2020,positive,i was saw it its cool final of saga not bad may be better not sure we cant compare original trilogy prequels and sequels  that 3 absolutely different epochs time of creation and 3 different stories about 1 choice you will be good or bad woman
Jan 10 2020,positive,it was a fun and great way to end the saga it doesnt deserve the backlash it has been getting worth every minute
Jan 10 2020,positive,i like this movie theyre never gonna please everyone but this is a good end to the whole sweeping saga plenty of action plenty of emotion and some fun to round out the whole thing
Jan 10 2020,positive,the movie was great what do y
Jan 10 2020,positive,loved it i hate that it is over
Jan 10 2020,positive,parts were good other parts felt like past plots slightly redone
Jan 10 2020,positive,great ending to a saga
Jan 10 2020,positive,really good ending to the series great story line
Jan 10 2020,positive,it had everything a life long starwars fan could want it ticked all the boxes
Jan 10 2020,positive,what a fabulous movie enjoyed ever minute
Jan 10 2020,positive,answered a lot if lingering questions and wrapped up the series very well
Jan 10 2020,positive,its spectacular visuals spellbinding score and wellchoreographed action make the rise of skywalker stay easy on the senses but abrams arrogant overcompensation for the supposed faults of the previous instalment chew up valuable minutes minutes that could have been spent crafting a story of moderate emotional potency and unpredictability mostly through a little bit of imaginative intelligence please  but there is some pleasure to be had watching driver and ridley give it their all irohs grade c
Jan 10 2020,positive,great conclusion to the disney trilogy
Jan 10 2020,positive,it relied on action nostalgia and cgi spectacle to carry the movie and is stuffed with tons of story which the movie rushes through to make all the story elements seem plausible at closer examination it is very convoluted and flawed
Jan 10 2020,positive,thank you jj abrams this one had it allaction comedy suspense  even pulled at the heartstrings def a must see
Jan 10 2020,negative,quality of movie effects low grade actors who could not act was a negative star rating it was horrible
Jan 10 2020,negative,a big waste of so much time
Jan 10 2020,positive,amazing and all the feels
Jan 10 2020,positive,action packed loved every minute of it
Jan 10 2020,positive,loved every single bit of it yes of course being a star wars fanatic you kinda wish things wouldve ended different but i wouldnt change any bit of it
Jan 10 2020,positive,movie was very interesting bringing back the most powerful sigh of all time  it would of been better if they would of kept luke  so he can face sidious for the final fate of the galaxy
Jan 10 2020,positive,didnt end the way i thought but still as good
Jan 10 2020,negative,the whole movie was an inconsistent mess
Jan 10 2020,positive,absolutely spectacular way to end the saga fan service is whats necessary to finish something of this scale in terms of impact to pop culture
Jan 10 2020,positive,love the way the old characters back from the first movies
Jan 10 2020,negative,considering what they had to follow with the last train wreck of a movie they did a decent job and i enjoyed parts of it but honestly the route they took for the plot was awful and very predictable even though you could tell they were trying to be anything but wouldnt recommend for any true star wars fan the books were better if you want good plots
Jan 10 2020,neutral,the movie just didnt make a whole lot of sense to me i understand that plot points need to be met and characters need to get from a to b but it felt rushed  we lost most the classic cast to make way for the new cast which makes sense though the new characters didnt seem to be respected so ive got to wonder if it was all worth it
Jan 10 2020,negative,what crap it was insulting how can anyone like this movie and claim to be a star wars fan it was a remake a reboot damage control pandering crap movie disney killed star wars
Jan 10 2020,positive,great ending  surprising
Jan 10 2020,positive,i left the movie theatre with a strong of sense of nostalgia so much of this film reminded me of my childhood memories of falling in love with the original star wars saga the filmography was gorgeous and the characters were easy to connect with all in all this was a satisfying adventure in a galaxy far far away
Jan 10 2020,positive,it was good overall way better then episode 8 just a couple of scenes that i still didnt like now that ive seen it a second time after the premiere day the kiss ugh dreadful and the emperor being kinda op or actually alive for that matter
Jan 10 2020,positive,regardless of its flaws it is my favorite of the three new films because i cared it hit where it counts and honored the legacy of the originals its too bad it had to make for the debacle that was the last jedi and try to cram two movies into one but it was overall satisfying and enjoyable and even tugged at my heart all the new characters finally got their due daisy ridley was great and ill never understand the hate she gets shes been good in all three films great final image im actually shocked i went in ready to hate it cheers
Jan 10 2020,positive,may the force live on
Jan 10 2020,positive,loved seeing the old cast loved everything about it
Jan 10 2020,positive,excellent movie i loved it thank you
Jan 10 2020,positive,i loved it the only problem i had is that the movie needed to be way longer
Jan 10 2020,positive,fixes all the problems from the last jedi jj did a great job cleaning up the mess you got to go see it the critics with the bad reviews are clueless as to what a good movie is
Jan 10 2020,neutral,nothing crazy entertaining and glad to see it finally come to a close lots of op moments and wtfs not that great 
Jan 10 2020,positive,it was one of my favorite star wars movie a must see
Jan 10 2020,positive,really good movie 
Jan 10 2020,positive,it was ok not great but not terrible
Jan 10 2020,positive,each star wars trilogy has had a different feel  episodes 79 are far more action oriented and abrams is able to save this trilogy from the dumpster fire it had become under johnson
Jan 10 2020,positive,yes rise of skywalker is a disappointing conclusion to the skywalker saga but it is not a terrible one yes this film is filled with fan service and a bloated plot but is nothing but entertaining  grade b
Jan 10 2020,positive,great movie maybe not perfect but well worth 11 price of admission
Jan 10 2020,positive,i loved this movie 
Jan 10 2020,positive,if you can realise and understand the inner genius within the movie and are a diehard fan you well love the movie and appreciate every bit of it
Jan 10 2020,positive,excellent story telling imagery and character development outstanding movie in every way
Jan 10 2020,negative,not enough action poor graphics and not satisfying with the drama of the film
Jan 10 2020,positive,i enjoyed the movie i thought it was a great finish to one of my favorite series
Jan 10 2020,negative,its trash not a stra wars
Jan 10 2020,positive,confusing as to where they were but at least i knew the good guys from the bad guys  state of the art effects satisfying ending ties all together
Jan 10 2020,positive,this was the perfect ending to such an amazing movie empire i highly recommend this movie to anyone
Jan 10 2020,positive,good story line action packed
Jan 10 2020,negative,thought it was very poor for the last of what was a great series
Jan 10 2020,positive,plot lineit want to all lightsabres and sky battles
Jan 10 2020,positive,best of the last 3 movies  nice save jj
Jan 10 2020,negative,the plot was incoherent and essentially ignored everything that happened in the previous film will probably be remembered as the worst star wars film ever made by critics some of the set pieces are really cool but it is a cinematic failure
Jan 10 2020,positive,absolutely loved it so much was answered and ends tied up an excellent movie that comes full circle at the end i cried thru so many sceneshappy tears  i need to go see it again
Jan 10 2020,positive,i dont know it was fine somewhat boring
Jan 10 2020,negative,a huge splash of special effects with no real story or at least not one that would take 225 hours to tell  rey seems to spend 90 of the movie wandering off or staring into space  the rest was predictable and pretty lame  oh and having one of the big parts being played by a dead woman is awful
Jan 10 2020,positive,i thought this was by far the best star wars movie out of them all
Jan 10 2020,positive,a multiple number of actorsactresses return for the 2019 star wars film that is star wars the rise of skywalker that include adam driver john boyega daisy ridley harrison ford billie lourde kellie marie tran mark hamill billy dee williamsanthony daniels naomi ackiedomhnall gleesonrichard e grant lupita nyongo oscar isaac keri russell joonas suotamoian mcdiarmid cailey fleming carrie fisher and more actorsactresses the character foils of kylo renben solo and rey continuing to evolve to bring out the best in each other is a sight to behold the appearances of luke skywalker and han solo are an interesting surprise that also adds to the essential development of some of the characters the dynamics of rose tico finn and poe dameron are also explored how the main antagonist ties in with two of the characters was an unexpected element that added to the creative unfolding of the show i admit that it was just that i found the ending extremely surprising though my husband helped me understand why i want to be considerate of those who have yet to see the show and are viewing this review lets just say that one of the multiple reasons why i was surprised at the ending was because there are dynamics involved that almost mirror the conceptidea of twin flames however i am very grateful that my husband paid for us to see this film with money from his current job
Jan 10 2020,positive,it really explained a lot  and it was action filled its
Jan 10 2020,neutral,as a mindless action movie it was decent even good  but as a star wars movie it was barely mediocre  i will be avoiding any spoilers  the bad the first half of the movie basically sprints through plot points like its going for gold in the 100meter dash and then spends the last half with weird pacing that left me exhausted    there are a number of plots that either get unsatisfying conclusions or get no conclusion at allhow did palpatine escape the death star explosion why did a certain character make certain decisions towards the endetc  lets not talk about the number of plot holes requiring such a suspension of disbelief that no amount of jedi mindtricks can hand wave away  most characters get little to no real further development in the movie which is a bit of a shame  if youre a fan of the new extended universenot the legacy stuff that came out before disney got star wars then prepare for some confusion and anger as disney stated that their new eu was the new canon but then clearly failed to develop a factchecking department to ensure that all of their stuff matched up  for a company looking to get merchandise purchases this is a merchandising failure as why would i buy eu stuff you say is canon only to overturn it at a whim  there is also this odd issue where the filming quality makes major downturns at random moments like one moment the scene has crystal clear images that are beautiful to see and then the movie switches to another angle where it is extremely fuzzy to the point you might wonder if your sight has gone    the good kylo and reys character development that was actually done pretty well i felt satisfied for the most part   the set pieces gorgeous and really added to the background of the galaxy and were wonderful to see  conclusion  like i said a good action movie but barely mediocre star wars film if the rumors about abrams filming a total of 354 hours worth of movie only to trim it down to the 2 hours and 25 minutes were true id have rather had a part 1  2 at least more effort could have been point into it that way
Jan 10 2020,positive,great movie  ive seen them all
Jan 10 2020,positive,awesome wish the series could go on forever
Jan 10 2020,negative,like episode 7 its derivative and poorly conceived
Jan 10 2020,positive,fantastic movie great way to finish the series
Jan 10 2020,neutral,rise of skywalker was probably the safest ending to the skywalker saga it focussed more on fan service rather than the story itself
Jan 10 2020,negative,more enjoyable than the last jedi but felt cheap and kinda ruined the whole point behind the prophecy of anakindarth vader
Jan 10 2020,positive,did a great job of tying up loose ends   despite the length the time flew by
Jan 10 2020,positive,great movie for any fan of star wars
Jan 10 2020,positive,great movie special affects were wonderful
Jan 10 2020,positive,action filled wonderful movie
Jan 10 2020,positive,fantastic finish to the new trilogy so glad jj abrams came back to the franchise
Jan 10 2020,negative,the rise of skywalker was a bad movie full of plot holes and lack the connection with the previous trilogies it was better than the last jedi for sure but the damage was done since the force awakens the arc of the characters were poorly designed and i basically couldnt care less about them it is not worth to watch this film
Jan 10 2020,positive,this was my 2nd viewing i liked it much better this time tros did tie into episodes 7 8 go see it
Jan 10 2020,positive,the movie is great for any star war fan their is allot of grey area where they could have done more story with characters
Jan 10 2020,positive,jj abrams did a great job of fixing what rian johnson did in last jedi he created a film that was great visually but also had a good story to tell and helped the audience like and appreciate what the characters are going through abrams had a mess to clean up and he did a pretty damn good job of it my faith and love of star wars has come back and i thank jj abrams for that
Jan 10 2020,negative,i felt really let down by the last jedi the rise of skywalker made me wish rian johnson directed it
Jan 10 2020,negative,barely deserves to be called a movie there are only 2 characters in this so called film the rest of the cast are just actors saying their lines not to their fault but the writers nonsense forced rushed plotpoints that dont make any sense the first 30 minutes feel like an attack on your senses and by the end you just want it to be over
Jan 10 2020,positive,amazing movie and a must see
Jan 10 2020,positive,great movie great graphics could of ending better
Jan 10 2020,negative,if anyone can tell me what happened completely id be surprised there was no skywalker rise just bad
Jan 10 2020,positive,this final film in the 9 movie skywalker sagawas entertaining and action packed however for all of its action it was not a great ending to it all
Jan 10 2020,positive,it was definitely a good movie but not the best star wars film ive seen overall it was time well spent to watch
Jan 10 2020,positive,so the skywalker saga has come to an end and once again follows the previous installment the last jedi in being divisive amongst fans and critics the last jedi was overly praised by critics and overly bashed by fans and this time around it is fairly wellreceived by fans and nitpicked to death by critics and while my thoughts on the last jedi were relatively mixed the rise of skywalker though flawed is hands down the better movie  yes there are pacing issues yes certain plot developments feel a bit out of the leftfield but what did any of us really expect due to the failure of the last jedi to effectively move the plot forward the rise of skywalker has the added baggage of being a second and third act of the entire trilogy and for a massive roadblock being thrown in the filmmakers path by rian johnsons overuse of creative freedom i think what jj abrams managed to produce is pretty damn effective and was a really exciting experience  the visuals are once again fantastic but what makes this stand apart from the other films is the horror movie lighting on the sith planet of exogol  the best usage of this atmospheric lighting is during the introduction of our main villain completely shrouded in darkness until you get a flash of lightning which reveals the ghoulish visage of the reanimated corpse of emperor palpatine as he croaks out one of his most iconic phrases just phenomenal the characters have also been allowed to shine much more from when we last left them in the last jedi the best of them is without a doubt c3po who steals the show with one laugh after another luke a character who was kinda unlikeable in tlj was the complete opposite here making me wish he would have survived episode 8  before i wrap it up i must mention the beautiful tribute this film paid to carrie fisher seeing her onscreen one last time was almost tearjerking and giving her top billing though long overdue was a lovely sendoff to an actress who kicked down the doors to our hearts with her wit and sass    overall i loved this movie it isnt as good as the original trilogy or the force awakens and it certainly has its flaws but it has a lot of heart and so i award it 45 stars
Jan 10 2020,positive,what i felt from the rise of skywalker is how they manage to tie up some loose ends from the force awakens and the last jedi greatly the film gave rey and kylo ren an outstanding character development and ended the nine skywalker saga successfully
Jan 10 2020,positive,too much action no down time as a star wars fan i loved what they did with the story
Jan 10 2020,positive,fitting end epic and emotional
Jan 10 2020,negative,this is a train wreck of ideas smashed together the pacing is rushed tons of plot holes and has too many ideas that run in contradiction of previous films in the lucas legacy this film is a dumpster fire of nonsensical quest items chase scenes for the sake of driving the plot forward and not letting characters develop  rogue one was a far superior installment and the entirety of this sequel trilogy should be decanonized  this is a star wars experience that is barely watchable for passive star wars fans and is unbearable for those who enjoy star wars philosophy and lore
Jan 10 2020,positive,how can you be in the movie but not be a force ghost this is outrageous its unfair
Jan 10 2020,positive,redeemed the sequel trilogy
Jan 10 2020,positive,loved the cliffhanger
Jan 10 2020,positive,best star wars ever loved it
Jan 10 2020,negative,well that was lame
Jan 10 2020,positive,lots of excitement and action b
Jan 10 2020,positive,i absolutely loved this movie sure there were some parts that could have been changed to make it better and it felt a little rushed at times but i think it was a satisfying ending for the star wars saga
Jan 10 2020,negative,shit is awful should have put a bullet in the head of this franchise a long time ago
Jan 10 2020,negative,more of the same chapter from chapter
Jan 10 2020,positive,its a classic star wars film its a great way to end the saga
Jan 10 2020,positive,so episode 9 hit all the nostalgic ques but for a life long fan  missed so many opportunities to connect and close  each characters development arch i left the movie with more questions than answers   would i watch it again absolutely the music and visuals were awesome throughout the film and the way the movies are filmed leave you emotionally invested in the characters like i said i just have a ton of questions
Jan 10 2020,negative,the choreography for one of the fight scenes was cool and palpatines display of power was cool  there is no other good qualities about this movie
Jan 10 2020,positive,im not much of a star wars fan but this movie is phenomenal so much action and plot twists you never expect highly recommend this
Jan 10 2020,negative,after the explosive fan reaction to the last jedi and the financial underperformances of previous star wars affairs jj abrams attempts to make a finale that ties up loose ends and brings everyone together he unfortunately fails what started off in 2015 with great promise ends with a rushed expositionstuffed convoluted mess that lazily rehashes return of the jedi but without any logic there are multiple fakeout deaths several mcguffin plot devices and two first acts that feel like they shouldve been in the second film of this missed opportunity of a sequel trilogy the legacy of the originals and the prequels have been tarnished and it all feels so corporate now this should all perhaps be disregarded as fanfiction
Jan 10 2020,positive,original trilogy are still the best but this is one franchise thats work hard for the fans
Jan 10 2020,positive,definitely best seen at a theater very glad we went to see it
Jan 10 2020,negative,a disgrace of a star wars movie
Jan 10 2020,positive,i hated it i loved it ill have to think about it
Jan 10 2020,negative,good movie not fit for the ending of a 40 year series and they should have never made them ending the way they did she is not and will never be a skywalker and if they wanted to make her a sky walker they should have made her a skywalker to begin with and used like and mara jade as her parents
Jan 10 2020,positive,there were some things i wish theyd done differently but it was an entertaining if a bit lacklustre end to the skywalker saga but part of that issue can be placed at the feel of the last jedi which while i didnt hate it i do take exception with some of the decisions made for that movie overall the sequel trilogy would have come together better in my opinion if there had been a solid plan in place before any of them had been filmed rather than letting each director do whatever they wanted as is the trilogy is a bit of a disappointment but hopefully going forward we will get better new stories as a saga endpoint rise of skywalker could certainly have been worse
Jan 10 2020,negative,this movie reminded me why i cant give up on my dream of movie making  palpatine has returned and sends a terror signal across the universe rey finn and poe start a hunt for a wayfinder something that will lead them to the planet where hes hiding meanwhile kylo is on the hunt for rey to either turn her or kill her all to end the saga of the skywalkers  looooong sigh i really dont know where to start with this one i really dont to me star wars was never this this hollywood blockbuster mess sure theres a space journey seen by millions churning out billions of dollars disney bought the property for 4 billion for a reason but in the heart of the explosions and lightsabre fights was something real something organic lukes hope for his father anakins anger and betrayal by the jedi yes not everything was perfect but it still felt honest this though it feels hollow the whole trilogy has i always let it go especially in 7 because i was sure it was leading up to something but here is what its been leading up to and what the hell let me explain myself   the plot is pointless while they should focus on setting up the conflict and establishing what the movie should be about they go out on a plot coupon hunt no theyre not mcguffins for the first half of the movie since they focus on that we have no clue what any of the characters wants why they want it we just have to tag along and hope that we care by the end many maybe did i didnt not even a little bit  this movie also has a huge problem of i want the movie to be like this how do we get to that place so it makes sense doesnt matter dew it heres a few examples it took palpatine 20 years to build the death star and it was so scary that it lead the rebellion to come out of hiding and attack now though every fucking star destroyer has death star tech and is capable to destroy planets do you know why there was only one death star and he didnt build 10 in the same time because its fucking huge and powerful and takes a hell of a lot of time and energy to get something that big and powerful but here a thousand star destroyers are now able to do the same job just raise the stakes it doesnt matter if it makes sense just raise the stakes now the death star is a joke just so get their fucking stakes now the world has lost all sense of reality for me again huge spoilers another example is palpatine being back how you ask i asked that as well you shouldnt expect an answer though i expect one but didnt get one well i got it but it was pretty much hes back they try to give a few sentences here and there but it makes no sense he fell into the reactor of a death star that blew up the force powers as well rey and kylo ren suddenly have the power to give force energy from one person to another healing them but it just makes me wonder why the fuck couldnt obiwan do that he had been training for years under quigon it could have saved his life rey also from out of nowhere sends force lightning because thats how it works now just use a new power whenever you feel like it i thought that was a spesific sith trait why can she do it her last name does not make her to a sith it has never worked that way if so kylo ren should never able to force choke for the same reason consistency luke also returns and he stops a lightsaber right out of thin air what is it that these ghosts cant do now stop physical things send force lightning bolts come on rey and ren also has this weird teleporting ability where they can fight eachother andor give eachother different items they try to explain but once again its really weird they have this ability because shes a palpatine and hes a skywalker so the force has given these two a special power only they can use because it realizes that skywalker has been palpatines arch enemy why would that be a thing if someone can explain this to me please go ahead still it just makes them seem ridiculously strong stronger than yoda could ever dream of being how who cares all these changes slowly but surely takes this epic saga about family war and politics to turn into a ya novel to me thats why through seeing this i felt empty inside emotionless i care about none of these people why should i these big moments that im supposed to care about i just dont i sat there silent only time i got emotional was seeing the old characters being killed off or showing back up i felt upset they deserved something more  theres also a notsosubtle jab at tlj in here c3po gets his memory back and at what does he remember everything from episode 17 but not tlj because it was stored right before rey leaves to meet luke in the end of 7 i dont get why he wrote that could just as easy wrote that it was the start of this movie or the last few months  also wtf is the kid with the broom i thought he was gonna fix everything we better get his spinoff movie broom kid the movie  ok now its time to somewhat explain the rating youre raging over even though ive done that above too how can this be rated below tlj well even though i have a lot of the same problems tlj had one big thing going for it it was dropdead beautiful absolutely stunninglooking this this is hollywood and everything you expect from it yes it has good looking cgi and costume design but still everything still looks so bland and boring  the way they treated pretty much every character as well its just so disappointing again huge spoilers leia dies in the most ridiculously pointless way ever chewbacca gets captured why how because he just randomly wandered away from the group lando just shows up at a random place when the plot needs him but tbh ive never really understood him at least not since 6 hux oh hux its not that i care that much about his character it was just so laughably bad at one point in the movie he said to poe i dont care if you win as long as kylo ren loses i laughed at that point maybe my favorite new character from this series turned into even more of a joke than from the last movie i was literally thinking did a 2 year old write this hes acting like a fucking child they also ropeadopes us twice chewbacca is dead yeah 10 minutes later hes alive kylo ren is dead well we dont see him for a long time and there was nothing from that length that he could grab onto but oh wait hand grabs platform  what did i like about it well theres a very small amount i said the new characters are hollow they are but some of them still serve somewhat of a purpose theres a woman called jannah naomi ackie that joins finn in the fighting that used to also be a stormtrooper and their connection was pretty nice and gave some more insight into what the first order has been doing still though considering the plot couponhunt lasted for so long it gets almost no time also allegiant general pryde richard e grant in the first order was pretty menacing and interesting pretty much what i hoped hux would be theres also a funny view into poes life but again it gets way too little time in general ive really liked the actors theyre great and have amazing chemistry but instead of that making me feel good it just makes me upset they deserved better better planing better writing better management better care so did john williams  im really trying to find a reason to bump it up to 1 star but i dont see a good reason to the few good things i found are so ridiculously tiny in comparison i hate throwing around the 05 star rating unless i fucking know it deserves it like book of shadows blair witch 2 fuck that movie ahh hell you guys can try to change my mind i guess tell me whats good about this movie maybe ill agree im just struggeling to find any true good point these feelings are very fresh and i even know theres tons of bad stuff im leaving out but im stopping this here its already become long enough lets hope it takes less than 141 mins to read this we all know talking about the review cant be longer than the movie or well know its not worth reading
Jan 10 2020,positive,it was 810 it felt really rushed but thats not jj fault its rj fault from the second movie
Jan 10 2020,positive,good movie missing some answers in the movie but overall loved it good ending to the saga
Jan 10 2020,negative,one star and is for the movie have good especial effects and good video quality

Jan 10 2020,positive,i saw the movie with my dad and best friend and we all left feeling happy and satisfied people need to stop being negative bringing peoples mood down and just enjoy the movie
Jan 10 2020,positive,it was good movie just needed a few more light saber battles and force moves
Jan 10 2020,positive,the image and action was great not so much the writing of the movie
Jan 10 2020,positive,good but not excellent
Jan 10 2020,negative,this movie was a rushed mess of a story that does more harm than good to the saga it has plenty of action and good visuals that will please many people however if you truly care about the skywalker saga then i dont think this one is for you retcon this whole sequel trilogy
Jan 10 2020,positive,i may have missed it but who were all those people in the stands in the emperors stadium acting like a greek chorus
Jan 10 2020,positive,star wars the rise sky walker was an action comedy and a heart felt film i thought this movie was amazing and it was a great way to end the saga but the only flaw in this movie was that it was a bit rushed  but other than that i thought it was great and i recommend seeing countless times
Jan 10 2020,negative,boring and predictable empty and tired characters senator palpatine really millions of dollars in budget and the creatives came up with the senator probably the worst of the saga i gave 2 starts because of mark he was impeccable
Jan 10 2020,positive,much much better than episode 78
Jan 10 2020,positive,fantastic close out of the skywalker saga
Jan 10 2020,positive,loved the feel of the show

Jan 10 2020,positive,best movie in decades great story and great way to wrap up the entire series
Jan 10 2020,positive,i loved how they brought back cameos of stars from the past movies
Jan 10 2020,positive,it was definitely better than the last one but still so many flaws and silly plot items to put up with patience needed worst of all was  no anakindarth really since the entire saga is the saga of anakin skywalker and his offspring luke and leia this was the biggest silly plot hole of all now that i think about how upsetting that was to watch three stars could be too generous
Jan 10 2020,negative,all of it left early
Jan 10 2020,positive,great movie  answered lots of questions
Jan 10 2020,positive,good wrap up of a story that took decades to tell
Jan 10 2020,positive,the fight and battle sequences were too long as a result the movie was too long by about 25 minutes  some aspects of the storyline do not make sense i wont give away the plot  this is either the effect of too much disney or not enough lucas  however its star wars episode nine and ill be there for episode 10
Jan 10 2020,positive,it was good i guess i was just expecting a little more
Jan 10 2020,positive,i thought the movie was good but it was very predictable
Jan 10 2020,positive,great fight scenes awesome intro to some new characters all in all a great way to end
Jan 10 2020,positive,all stars were great  sad to see it end    awesome story and effects
Jan 10 2020,positive,great energy reminds you of the original trilogy
Jan 10 2020,positive,i am a giant star wars fan and have been my whole life  although i choose to like all of the new star wars movies i am not blind to some of the problems with the last jedi i thought the two jj abrams films were excellent though and i thought the rise of skywalker was great and gave me all the things i was looking for to wrap up this trilogy without just being completely predictable
Jan 10 2020,positive,went in with low expectations surprised by joy hollywood critics are deluded twas inspiring and moving the critics love movies that are sad to them good triumphing over evil is boring thank you abrams for one of star wars best
Jan 10 2020,positive,its a star wars movie its awesomeness is relative  lol see it
Jan 10 2020,negative,visually stunning but one of the most convoluted screenplays ive seen no  amount of schmaltz can make up for the thoroughly lame plot my daughter summed it up best its like the writer was child with adhd and tripping on cocaine
Jan 10 2020,neutral,disney doesnt know how to take good care of their child because they have too many
Jan 9 2020,positive,this is a good movie to watch to cover for the butchering of the last jedi they make up for many bad decisions made in the previous movie if you hated the last jedi this movie will fix most of your hate for the new trilogy
Jan 9 2020,neutral,since i was a part of my childhood the skywalker storyline is still the best i believe it depends where the magic first attracted you to the franchise is the start of everything as all midlife gen like me george lucas star wars will always be a classic on my book
Jan 9 2020,positive,great way to end the saga
Jan 9 2020,positive,i enjoyed the story and the relationship between rey fin and poe i also like how luke leia hans and lando calrissian were integrated into the film
Jan 9 2020,positive,i liked how it brought the entire star wars story together
Jan 9 2020,positive,not a perfect movie but a very good one it kept me hooked from beginning until the very end
Jan 9 2020,positive,some flaws but thought it was really good and wrapped things up well  there was certainly fan servicebut it was all part of the same story so it worked for me personally
Jan 9 2020,negative,i think is a little bit forced
Jan 9 2020,negative,if you ignore the gaping plot holes and focus on all the special effects like they want you to then the movie does its job as popcorn material j j abrams has successfully taken disneys closing installment in the main star wars cinematic line into a complete nose dive most movies including ones considered to be cinematic masterpieces come with a few plot holes but when you take a series as iconic as star wars with all the backing of a fan base that spans generations and the financial support of a company equally as iconic as disney and still come up short thats pretty bad the writing is so sub par that even the actors struggle to dig their characters out of the graves that were laid before them this movie had a bunch of flash yet no sustenance and relies too heavily on the star wars name as a crutch in a vain attempt to bring itself up to mediocrity
Jan 9 2020,positive,pretty epic ending i love star wars and the last jedi left me unsatisfied but this movie more than made up for it the story was awesome i really enjoyed it i hope they come up with some kind of spin off or something i want more
Jan 9 2020,positive,great movie and finally the story is told
Jan 9 2020,positive,this brought my childhood love to a satisfactory close
Jan 9 2020,positive,dont get caught up in the passionate extreme hate or extreme love of the nerds only a sith deals in absolutes it is really fun and really enjoyable not without flaws especially in pacing and perhaps is not the ending that some wanted still this was definitely great to watch definitely felt like star wars definitely gave me all those star warsy happy feelings and definitely made me want to see it again
Jan 9 2020,positive,liked everything wow
Jan 9 2020,positive,great finale to the rey trilogy like all star wars movies this one has its flaws but overall i loved it and think it treated the saga with reverence
Jan 9 2020,positive,after the miserable train wreck that was tlj went in with little expectation figuring this would be another drab miserable affair expectations were so low that it actually took three weeks to drag myself to see it what a wonderful surprise ended up loving it sure there are some cons the break neck pace of the film with carefree failure to service the many important characterplot developments is the main issue there are plenty of did that just happen moments and a few stretches that seem perhaps too over the top even in the sw universe for example since when can characters freely walk around in space on top of star destroyers some of those escape sequences are kind of ridiculous but hey ill take it since ultimately the film does deliver lots of great nods to fans who grew up with the original trilogy and thankfully he mostly nudged out the miserable rose character too bad shes in it at all   its a shame they didnt have the same director handle all three of the movies for i still cant get over just how bad that last one was what a mess of a snoozy cgi nightmare total disservice to mark hamills character and the luke skywalker legacy trying to forget i ever saw it
Jan 9 2020,positive,lots of action all the way through
Jan 9 2020,negative,as far as im concerned none of the disney films are canon
Jan 9 2020,positive,fantastic movie the 4dx experience combined with star wars was probably the most incredible movie experience ive ever had
Jan 9 2020,positive,good final of the star wars saga
Jan 9 2020,positive,the acting wasnt always believable but the story line was filled with unexpected twists and turns thats what made it captivating and increased the desire to watch all the way to the end
Jan 9 2020,positive,it was a bit too long
Jan 9 2020,positive,it was ok  not bad  good ending to the series
Jan 9 2020,positive,i really enjoyed it
Jan 9 2020,positive,disappointing a lot of fan service they could of done without the whole palpatine story line and plot everything about this movie including carrie fishers scenes felt shoehorned andor forced in overall an entertaining film for us fans
Jan 9 2020,positive,perfect ending to the whole story
Jan 9 2020,positive,love it after episode 5 and 6 this is my all time favorite star wars movie
Jan 9 2020,positive,the powerful scene between palpatine and rey good over evil
Jan 9 2020,positive,best sequel star wars movie by far not too many side stories and excellent plot
Jan 9 2020,positive,i thought it was really good was very entertaining
Jan 9 2020,negative,the worst movie of star wars by far the history has no line horrible
Jan 9 2020,positive,i mean keep in mind its owned by disney so it has that disney magic at the end but other wise a great movie
Jan 9 2020,positive,it was a good movie i liked it none of the star wars franchise will ever be 5 stars for me but it was good
Jan 9 2020,positive,1010 its a movie it gets the job done
Jan 9 2020,positive,it was an amazing way to end an epic 50 year old saga
Jan 9 2020,positive,there was a lot of action but they miss a lot of opportunities to develop some characters
Jan 9 2020,neutral,was it an improvement on the the last jedi yes of course it was but then again that wouldnt have been difficult as this was directed by jj abrams it was very much in sync with the first of the sequal trilogy the force awakens i will begin with the positives as i feel there arent many and that leaves time for the real meat of this review the emperor was portrayed in a way that he truelly should have been all along menacing scary and evil thats a thumbs up from me the idea the millennium falcon can hyperskip also a simple but genius idea there thats the postives done now for the rest of the film the plot was well there wasnt much of one it was again like the force awakens a carbon copy of a new hope however this is a rehash of return of the jedi  especially the end fight when all the galaxy comes to the aid of the resistance its like they picked up the return of the jedi script scribbled out the title and wrote the rise of skywalker the idea the emporer could be defeated just by deflecting his own lighting is ridiculous otherwise he would have died in revenge of the sith mace windu vs palpatine fight but to top it off rey and ben had to kiss didnt they i would wager disney insisted that this had to be included but the moment that genuinely had me angry and i mean actually angry is how they killed off leia so apparently she sacrifices herself by communicating to her son ben long distance via the force and the shear power that it took overwhelmed her and she dropped dead really really abrams pathetic complete betrayal of the character overall this film will not stand the test of time and i hope disney get their act together produce good quality star wars films like rogue one
Jan 9 2020,positive,it is a great tribute to all of the past actors
Jan 9 2020,negative,bad but not bad enough
Jan 9 2020,positive,there were a few confusing parts but overall a very good movie the only thing that took away from the experience was the person sitting next to me he was very aggravating
Jan 9 2020,positive,i enjoyed members of previous movies especially the originals
Jan 9 2020,negative,its  just disgusting this shit should be removed from the star wars history
Jan 9 2020,positive,i liked the end being in the location that it all began good tie in to all characters past and present
Jan 9 2020,negative,the plot holes were massive the story was contrived and the characters were bland its a bad sign when the best parts of a movie are the callbacks to a previous movie
Jan 9 2020,positive,it had its things but i liked it overall it wrapped up the trilogy well enough as a huge star wars fan im not one to complain and just enjoy the fact that i am getting new star wars movies
Jan 9 2020,positive,very nice and touching tribute to our princess rey and ben  well thought out a little slow and korning in the first few minutes but quickly gets moving into the next mission
Jan 9 2020,negative,this was a dumpster fire and a betrayal to the fans
Jan 9 2020,positive,its not a bad movie but some of the story felt like filler including the part with keri russell after a while the film was getting repetitive it did end on a nice note however
Jan 9 2020,positive,perfect way to end the saga loved it
Jan 9 2020,positive,the special effects were well done the movie kept this viewer glued to the screen every second of the very fast moving adventure
Jan 9 2020,positive,one of the best star wars movies we have seen full of action  new characters  and adventure
Jan 9 2020,positive,i loved much better than its predecessor
Jan 9 2020,negative,awful writing tons of pointless lucky breaks 0 thought put into this movie other than pissing like a male cat claiming his territory i left disgusted
Jan 9 2020,positive,great cinematography lots of action great plot with a surprise ending
Jan 9 2020,negative,this film ends the saga that failed expectations even with none set in place going in all i can say is dishonorable deaths to characters leia fades away plot holes such as force healing and lightning issue rey uses it and it destroys a ship palpatine uses it and it only shuts down computers on a ship palpatines fleets do not know how to go up the space cancer that blocks people from entering can be flown around why does palpatine have a map to his planet rey is still a mary sue kylo as a character is still inconsistent apperently force ghosts can now do anything with the force including move objects the whole dagger being a map is absolutely silly and nonsensical fragments of the death star shouldnt even exist what about erosion to the ruins of the death star from water which would ruin the point of the dagger map and if the characters werent lucky to be standing at the right spot they wouldnt have even seen how the map works so many things in this movie done with a feeling for plot convenience and the list goes on severely disappointing and as someone who grew up with the prequels this is a new low you not only ruined the star wars story but as well as an entire brand toys collectibles has turned into utter garbage you find in the clearance section well done
Jan 9 2020,positive,one of the best movies ever it had the high tech special effects but still held true to the star wars nostalgic feel not a dull moment in the entire movie definitely a movie to see on the big screen versus waiting for it to come out on dvd or netflix
Jan 9 2020,positive,it was a good ending it the trilogy but fell short of the expected level of excellence 
Jan 9 2020,neutral,too many plot twists that were immediately resolved
Jan 9 2020,positive,just okay not close to the actual story but lots of action worth seeing if thats all you care about
Jan 9 2020,negative,hard to believe this was the best a billion dollar studio could come up with tragic that there was no overarching plot that could have been thread through these movies takes no risks offers no creativity and few characters we should care anything about
Jan 9 2020,negative,very predictable little bits from all the previous movies all in 1 
Jan 9 2020,positive,i throughly enjoyed the movie
Jan 9 2020,positive,excellentespecially in 3d
Jan 9 2020,positive,overall a good movie i mean its star wars so cant really go wrong wont say really what i liked or disliked was just a good overall movie
Jan 9 2020,negative,its a fittingly trite and hackneyed end to the jj abrams sw duology  the best thing one can say is that its not as aggressively insultingly terrible as the last jedi  thats faint praise because this movie is very bad in its own way  the plot is nonsensical  its also rushed cringeinducing and boring  i dont mean boring as in nothing happens to the contrary it feels like too much happens  i mean boring as in its impossible to care about the characters because over three films none of them have been properly developed while pacing is frenetic the narrative is formulaic and predictable  completists who want to finish the saga might be better off waiting for this to come out on streaming but i dont think its even worth anyones time to watch for free  if there was ever any doubt its now clear that the saga ended in 1983
Jan 9 2020,positive,storyline wasnt very good but the special effects were good
Jan 9 2020,positive,a very engaging exciting end to the saga
Jan 9 2020,positive,i thought it was great have seen it twice already i really dont understand all the criticisms but i would think if youre a true fan like my husband and i are then youd enjoy this they did a great job wrapping up all 9 episodes
Jan 9 2020,positive,i liked how the old actors were brought in and how they were able to incorporate princess leah impressive special effects were great  however i think my husband enjoyed movie better than me i found time to take a nap
Jan 9 2020,positive,the movie moved fast but it was worth it  my only gripe was the scene at the end which was an homage to george lucas so i was good with it
Jan 9 2020,positive,excellent my husband and i totally enjoyed this start wars movie
Jan 9 2020,positive,this movie was damn fun with a great cast
Jan 9 2020,positive,just saw it a 3rd time in 3d 4dx love it
Jan 9 2020,positive,this movie pulls off epic moments like no ones business i got chills three or four times watching if i had one complaint it would be that the character development seems a tiny bit bland but who cares to me the insanely welldone action is what matters
Jan 9 2020,positive,a long time ago in a galaxy far far away a very similar story to this one was told and it was told much better this is still a must see for any star wars fan but not up to snuff like many of the others its still head and shoulders above any of the prequels but something is still missing here the end of the movie left me hoping someone at some point will pick up the reins and tell a great story from this galaxy there are so many to tell
Jan 9 2020,negative,its face paced plot made zero sense and was all luckforce bs this movie retconned the entire new trilogy and forced so much it isnt even worth watching anymore
Jan 9 2020,positive,great action and threads from the past movies
Jan 9 2020,positive,too much of the same old same old
Jan 9 2020,positive,exciting   special effect wonderful and story excellentdefinitely advise seeing this movie
Jan 9 2020,negative,really bad movie cattered to trolls if your someone trying to relive your childhood than youll like this movie because jj has no creativity and copied return of the jedi this movie made me hate star wars i guess on the plus side you can skip the original trilogy now since vader is meaningless and the new movies are the same with better graphics
Jan 9 2020,positive,the movie tried to solve the problems the last jedi had and it did it in a respectful way and it worked but beacuse of so much damage it was hard to make it a good film
Jan 9 2020,positive,entertaining and fast moving
Jan 9 2020,positive,loved the whole movie
Jan 9 2020,positive,movie is a special effects conclusion to one aspect of star wars
Jan 9 2020,positive,the story has begun to be repetitive with few new plot lines
Jan 9 2020,positive,completely predictable
Jan 9 2020,positive,having followed star wars since the very first i was not disappointed
Jan 9 2020,positive,good movie wasnt my favorite thoughgood movie though
Jan 9 2020,negative,all over the place broke jedi canon rise of the emperor not skywalker all skywalker died
Jan 9 2020,negative,complete hot garbage felt so scotch taped together from start to finish you are barraged with scene after scene of half baked and on the fly ideas and were supposed to just accept it because its star wars it spat  in the face of vaders redemption it invented yet more force powers that only now have come to light rays force healing power was just about the stupidest thing ever the whole reason anikin fell to the dark side was to learn that power and yet ray just does it no explanation the whole sith planet with thousands of ships for the final order just lol i was left feeling that star wars was destroyed there was no point to anything the amount of times i found myself shaking my head in the theater or shooting my brother in law a looking in the theater were numberlessthe characters deserved better we deserved better you had it all disney and you blew it just blew it all to hell
Jan 9 2020,positive,i enjoyed the movie connecting the dots from the early days to the last days of the story  small screen shots of old original characters was awesome  the story telling with general lela was overdone because knowing that she carrie fisher had passed sometime ago did not feel right or real to me  the special affects were wonderful and allowed george lucas to finish with all the bang that he originally wanted  it is star wars what is not to love  i think all the main characters were there except for yoda and obe wan  nice finish
Jan 9 2020,positive,the end of a family saga lots of stuff packed in couldve gone longer we demolished a large tub of popcorn and had fun
Jan 9 2020,positive,great story and good action throughout the movie
Jan 9 2020,positive,i love the full circle story ends where it begani love the redemption of kilo renand the victory of reyi hate that the story is ending
Jan 9 2020,positive,outstanding score and special effects  good storyline but drags a bit at times
Jan 9 2020,positive,enjoyed the whole film   great action
Jan 9 2020,positive,fun to watch if you arent a star wars diehard like me but i can definitely understand why you may hate it if you are
Jan 9 2020,positive,i like everything about the movie
Jan 9 2020,negative,really damaging for the franchise
Jan 9 2020,positive,not the best but pretty good not the most satisfying but it kinda works
Jan 9 2020,positive,it ties all together
Jan 9 2020,negative,its just an apology for tlj that we need to buy a ticket for
Jan 9 2020,positive,best of the star wars series
Jan 9 2020,positive,i just love the star wars movies  the movie flowed well the storyline was great and it kept me glue to the screen hate to see it end
Jan 9 2020,positive,i thought it was a good tie in to the others and finally a winning outcome
Jan 9 2020,negative,an absolute steaming pile of shit a plot that is totally inconsistent and contrived it retcons the previous trilogies to the point that the whole franchise falls apart the best thing to do would be to forget this trilogy and consider as canon only either the original trilogy or the originalprequel trilogy
Jan 9 2020,positive,i loved the return to the feel of iv v and vi  loved the way the series  was wrapped up
Jan 9 2020,positive,well done cleared  up some loose ends
Jan 9 2020,positive,i dont even know what to say about this movie it is just okay
Jan 9 2020,negative,worst cinematic experience since our 2nd grace produced movie the emperor as the main villain is just lazy writing rey being his granddaugter does not make any sense and basically every scene in the move will leave you wondering what the hell the writers were smoking when they came up with this youre better off wathing flies copulate than letting this heap of junk infect your mind
Jan 9 2020,positive,too many stories to wrap up in this final movie but overall very entertaining
Jan 9 2020,positive,soooo good definitely my favorite of the new trilogy well paced and the dialogue wasnt nearly as bad as last jedi
Jan 9 2020,positive,my one dislike of this movie was that it is very fastpaced jj abrams had a lot to do in this movie after the debacle of the last jedi this often leads to some weakly developed and sometimes dropped plot lines  despite this the movie ran that line as good as it could have and it was a wonderful wrapup to the 42 year history of the skywalker saga i hope to see some characters and stories spun off from this and hope that jj abrams gets to steer those stories in some capacity i dont think his original vision was given enough of a chance with this trilogy  i really believe that had jjs original draft of this trilogy been followed more closely after the force awakens and in the last jedi this movie would have had a chance to slow down the pace and dig deeper into some of the characters back stories lets hope there is an extended directors cut released at some point
Jan 9 2020,positive,great movie a satisfying end to an epic saga tying everything together perfectly  i began watching this series in my late 20s and im 75 now this is well worth the wait i hate that its over
Jan 9 2020,positive,fantastic culmination of all the trilogies especially for the star wars fanatics
Jan 9 2020,positive,lots of action with caricature building never a dull moment throughout
Jan 9 2020,positive,it was entertaining and definitely way better than the last jedi but still was not very star wars  it felt like a trilogy itself all in one movie
Jan 9 2020,negative,a decent standalone popcorn movie poor entry in a star wars saga makes me wish this trilogy was removed honestly
Jan 9 2020,positive,although not perfect all things considered this entry into the star wars franchise is the best we couldve hoped for never underestimate the power of the force
Jan 9 2020,positive,cinematically creative and beautiful
Jan 9 2020,positive,set peices action story are all entertaining
Jan 9 2020,positive,had a lot of fun great end to the saga
Jan 9 2020,positive,predictable and somewhat unoriginal saw the original star wars series and it was almost the same story line with a few tweaks
Jan 9 2020,positive,my husband loved it but i went with him not seeing the rest of the star wars shows and was lost  my bad not into star wars
Jan 9 2020,negative,just didnt care for a second thought i was watching a snl parody for the first 45 minutes
Jan 9 2020,positive,loved everything about it  tons of action tons of nods back to the other 8 episodes  really good job tying everything together  there are a few details that were left hanging or unresolved but dont get hung up on them and miss out on the total experience of star wars
Jan 9 2020,positive,an entertaining film to be sure  hit some really good notes  this sagas trio has such great chemistry  some moments seemed rushed but to be expected as they try to wrap up 8 movies in 2 hrs
Jan 9 2020,neutral,meh too much of carrie fisher and trying to tie it all in
Jan 9 2020,positive,i have liked all the star wars movies always needed to see them in the theater
Jan 9 2020,negative,if you dont know what deus ex machina is watch this movie i couldve cared less what happened to any of the new characters throughout the film but by the third turd squeezed out by disney you just know exactly whats going to happen force powers win because destiny jj abrams needs to stop making movies and read joseph campbell who greatly inspired the original films in order to make a believable plot this movie was utter crap
Jan 9 2020,positive,it was a pretty good movie a few funny parts and some very tear jerking scenes as well seeing things come full circle and even seeing a sign for future spin off movies is pretty exciting
Jan 9 2020,negative,same old stuff bad acting lots of fighting and hokey sob stuff
Jan 9 2020,negative,pandering nonsense of which the soul purpose was to undo the last movie highly disrespectful and kiss the asses of those who screamed and cried at last jedi  congrats jjyou succeeded in doing that  making a movie that is highly unwatchable  i have this ranked as my lowest star wars movie which says a lot considering i have almost nothing nice to say about a couple of prequels  solo
Jan 9 2020,negative,its boring and way to long
Jan 9 2020,negative,not good at all i fell asleep
Jan 9 2020,positive,too many plots deviated too much from originals
Jan 9 2020,positive,movie with good images but no context very short poorly explained 
Jan 9 2020,positive,great movie 2nd best movie only to return of the jedi
Jan 9 2020,positive,mostly fast moving great special effects
Jan 9 2020,negative,star wars story 15  eye candy 45 would i watch it again  watching paint dry would be more interesting
Jan 9 2020,positive,i think it was good way to end a series concerning one legacy of a force involved family there can be future adventures but we need to see new heroes take up the mantle i see that in this movie
Jan 9 2020,positive,the dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural
Jan 9 2020,positive,great and worth the wait
Jan 9 2020,positive,its good but still not what star wars is about the original 3 were light silly and funny but also serious and dark the grind and struggle was real definitely have the grind and struggle in this one just a little too serious tho
Jan 9 2020,positive,best star wars yet but they had to make it the longest one yet as well with that they kept the story moving and there was no time for boring scenes the movie kept you engaged and guessing
Jan 9 2020,positive,still s lot of unanswered questions at the end but enjoyed the action and character development in this
Jan 9 2020,negative,predictable shallow and too long but entertains with good battle scenes
Jan 9 2020,positive,not sure why star nerds extreme star wars fans didnt like this movie  after all the franchise is aimed at minors cute robots not adults compare star trek movies  not the tv series  this is a closure movie to a series and does need to wrap up its multiple story lines  thus the frentic pace and length  i thought the disclosure of who rey really is was nicely done and kylo rens fate was fine but could have gone in another direction  i did enjoy the tech that allowed carrie fisher to have some decent screen time  allinall an entertaining evening
Jan 9 2020,positive,a solid ending for the current story line while leaving possibilities for a new beginning its a big universe out there
Jan 9 2020,negative,absolutely disgusting mass of unrelated scenes only connection of rey and ben somehow watchable please leave star wars alone please
Jan 9 2020,positive,loved this movie lots of action and great storya fitting way to end the skywalker trilogy
Jan 9 2020,positive,great story fast paced
Jan 9 2020,positive,the rise of reboot episode 47 young nobody raised on a dreary desert planet learns about the force and becomes the heroine  episode 58 empire1st order chase down the the rebelsresistance on a icesalt planet  the heroine trains with a hermit on a faraway planet  episode 69 vaderkylo redeems himself to help defeat palpatine lando flies the falcon
Jan 9 2020,positive,some tears some laughs and some omg moments  if this is the end of the legacy i would say it was a good way to end itor open a new door  if you are a fanperson definitely a must see
Jan 9 2020,positive,while not the absolute best it was still decent and enjoyable there were the action parts and the funny parts and the emotional parts i expected worth seeing
Jan 9 2020,positive,great movie  hard to see the series end
Jan 9 2020,positive,loved the graphics  great storyline
Jan 9 2020,negative,bad ending it follows the same story pattern as the first trilogy might as well be watching return of the jedi
Jan 9 2020,positive,great plot full of twists and turns  excellent want to see it again
Jan 9 2020,positive,the movie was exceptional  the character relations were amazing the casts chemistry was off the chart  the only thing i didnt like in brief instances were when the special effects were still so far out there that they seemed fake  ive seen disney so much better its thor cgi special effects  but i still have to say it will be one i watch again and again  and just as last jedi was my favorite when i was much younger this will be my favorite going forward
Jan 9 2020,positive,good and entertaining
Jan 9 2020,negative,just the worst thats all i can really say
Jan 9 2020,negative,this would be my 1st review on this site so here it goes this movies audience rating is complete bs and those responsible whoever you are should be ashamed of yourselves
Jan 9 2020,positive,like old home week with various cameos and scenes from all previous movies throughout the series a must see for any star wars fan young or old
Jan 9 2020,positive,the best of the current trilogy but why did they have to bring back palpatine
Jan 9 2020,positive,i thought the storyline actually made sense and was well done visuals were amazing and played homage to the originals my only issue which seems to be a problem for a lot of people was the fact that it seemed   rushed and so many things were left unexplained this wouldnt bother me so much but this is was supposed to be the kind of ending where all loose ends were  tied up
Jan 9 2020,negative,the only positive aspect of this filmthe music but what else would you expect from john williams however the amazing score cant distract from the mess that jj abrams has created with this series of random action sequences that they are brave enough to call a movie everything good that the last two films set up even though it wasnt that much is rendered completely ridiculous and useless with this the proof that star wars has become nothing but a money machine deprived of all basic rules of storytelling pacing and dialogue 15
Jan 9 2020,positive,most of the movie keep with the theme liked it didnt love it  one character was gotten rid of too quickly
Jan 9 2020,negative,i wish disney would sale star wars and marvel so they can stop putting politics in my entertainment and wish i could be hired for my creativity because clearly im more intelligent a villain makes a movie the heros should win but the villain should be scary and i can play chess these mess of stories by disney need my help if they want to stop upsetting the fans these movies are for fan entertainment not appeasements i would work with the originator and tell his vision with my villain putting you on edge of seat
Jan 9 2020,negative,looks good visually but the storyline was rushed and all over the place
Jan 9 2020,negative,the sequel trilogy progressively got worse as it went along if this was truly part of the skywalker saga then maybe have an actual skywalker be the main character no ben solo isnt the main character rey palpatine is the skywalker sagas main focus has always been anakin skywalker darth vader luke skywalker in the sequels that is all pissed on and we end up with this mess there are some fun parts throughout the trilogy but if it was truly part of the skywalker saga it would have honoured the name and the characters that carried the name
Jan 9 2020,positive,this was a perfect novel rendition i truly enjoyed this movie disney i hope you keep this franchise going in all its glory
Jan 9 2020,positive,we think the movie was really awesome we love it
Jan 9 2020,positive,plenty of action and new likable characters
Jan 9 2020,positive,it was action packed and i loved watching
Jan 9 2020,positive,watched it twice and would recommend you can see all the great star wars of it all once the stakes arent so high and you can relax about whether everything gets wrapped up as upj would wish some excellent parts  some a bit dodgy but a herculean task to end the saga and it was never going to succeed quite as well as endgame succeed it did though
Jan 9 2020,positive,i honestly dont get all the critics rise of skywalker is the the best movie of this new trilogy and ill say one of the best star wars ever there are severals defects no doubt but the same defects of every star wars but this one has good acting good cinematography a lot of action and its overall very enjoyable i cannot tell the same about other episodes of the old trilogies
Jan 9 2020,negative,the final nail in the coffin however it is unfair to blame jj as rian was the cause for such a rushed and frantic ending like the last jedi the script is full of holes with universe breaking albeit not as severe scenes this movie tries to apologize for the abysmal last jedi undoing everything in said movie however this movie undermines and undoes al 6 movies of the original trilogy and the prequels which is why many fans consider this series of movies as non canon speaking of the disney era of films are so terrible that they desperately try to gain the fans they lost baiting characters like revan and the old republic as if begging for fans to return saying please come back and watch our movies and well make your favorite things canon again george lucas for all the flaws people point out had a story to tell he had plans he knew and understood what to add or keep out a good example is to keep revan and bane out of the clone wars series as it conflicted with the universe rules he created disney has no such restraints if the rumors are true and the old republic is the focus of the next series of movies this is a good example of disneys desperation they understand that any new ideas they have will be met with box office flops and so they must resort to fan favorite characters and settings in order to salvage whatever remains the only redeeming factor is palpatines show of power in one scene that is it and even then it is impossible to fully love or enjoy due to how it breaks everything the past 6 movies built up to
Jan 9 2020,negative,the acting was alright especially adam driver the problem with this movie is the writing which seems sloppy and lazy and if we take the events of the last jedi the plot also seems incoherent some of the plot points set up in the other movies in the trilogy just fail and im especially disappointed in the knights of ren as weve been waiting for them since tfa the movies pacing also feels off as the movie never gets to breathe and theres always something going on that can be a good thing but in this case it really isnt to be fair i think that people new to star wars or people that just want to be entertained will be happy but as a star wars i have to say im disappointed
Jan 9 2020,positive,it is a good star wars movie  better than the sequels in my opinion  i have watched all star wars films played 90 of the games dating back to 04 and i have read a few of the really good comic series  this movie cannot top the original trilogy but i feel it is an improvement from the last 2 films
Jan 9 2020,negative,this movie was a mishmash of a bunch of stuff it felt like a script written in the comment section of youtube too much pandering to the fans and not enough vision for the story   also way too much fan service  i disliked this movie as a movie and star wars fan
Jan 9 2020,positive,i loved it i know there will be haters who cant replicate their experience as a 10 year old in 1977 good movie my only gripewhy was there a hobbit in a star wars movie
Jan 9 2020,positive,i can tell jj abrams really tried to fix star wars but rian johnson and disney screwed it up so bad either way im happy that i got to see a whole new trilogy to star wars but dont go in expecting a masterpiece especially to rise of skywalker just enjoy it for what it is
Jan 9 2020,positive,good stuff follows star wars story
Jan 9 2020,negative,just awful a big kick in the mouth to the skywalkers
Jan 9 2020,neutral,spoiler free review   better than the last jedi but worse than the force awakens  this sequel trilogy is the worst of the trilogies  original  prequel  sequel    my expectations were very low for tros following up to the last jedi but tros still struggled to meet my alreadylow expectations  disclaimer   i love star wars  im going to sound highly critical below but thats only because i love star wars and want it to stay true to itself so that new fans can have the same quality storytelling that we had when we first experienced the saga  i do not dislike everything about the new disney films in fact there is something i can enjoy in all of the films even the ones that i liked the least  disneys mandalorian and rogue one were pretty great in my opinion  i loved the force awakens when it came out and had a lovehate relationship with the last jedi but those two movies have not aged very well in my opinion  the more i digest them the more problems i have with the story that those two tell  once again this is a spoilerfree review  i talk about some of the traits of the rise of skywalker tros without going into further detail about the actual events in the film  without further ado here we go        tros gets a passing grade from me 50 but theres plenty to be disappointed about the film was far too predictable the writing was lazy and used the most obvious copouts it doesnt answer some questions from the previous two films it poorly handled some of our beloved classic characters it didnt feel like it wrapped up the skywalker saga and lastly  it was all over the place        the film was far too predictable it was nearly all fanservice that was forcibly shoehorned in and some of the most obvious fan theories or copouts to questions that we had from the earlier disney sw movies came true  the kind of fanservice that jj abrams used in tros makes the film predictable because the director is going out of his way with the story just to stuff in some more recycled material or jokes attempting to add nostalgia from the george lucas trilogies that weve already seen  not only is this kind of storytelling predictable but it also causes the plot to dart all over the place the way jj handled it anyways  next some scenes in tros were executed quite poorly ie certain characters deaths and some parts could have easily been left out entirely think of that useless casino subplot with rose finn and the codebreaker dude from the last jedi that did nothing to contribute to the main plot and ultimately is just a waste of precious screen time im talking about scenes like that      the poor flipfloppy setup of the first two films of this trilogy are partially to blame for tros being such a mess  having to follow up to the story of the force awakens and the last jedi i think jj did a decent job of salvaging this mess of a trilogy  my expectations were very low for tros following up to the last jedi but tros still struggled to meet my alreadylow expectations  this film mostly felt like jj was stomping out fires that rian ruin johnson had set which i agree needed to be done but the result was a rather sloppy crammed incoherent plot the setup from the first two sequel films are mostly to blame for tros not reaching its full potential  tros didnt quite hit me the way that tfa first did  heck tros even had its moments where i was rolling my eyes thinking this might really be worse than tlj but it also had some better moments  there were at least enough enjoyable or interesting things to keep me seated so i wouldnt walk out of the theatre while this film was still playing   conclusion    due to the story of the last jedi doing nothing to move the story forward from tfa  snoke died thats about it  lukes death didnt matter because he was absent from the battle and can appear as a ghost at any time anyways thats about all that happened in tlj   jj abrams tried to make up for it by trying to cram two films worth of content into one film  the result was a messy unevenly paced plot that creates new plot holes in an attempt to patch up the ones from the previous films  we are left with an unsatisfying ending to a very very unnecessary addon story that deconstructs the already satisfying ending of return of the jedi  the big fight at the end wasnt even much of a fight and after it every fans worst nightmare came true  it really was underwhelming and cringey to say the least  by the way when i say messy think of the movie aquaman and its interesting plot  im talking that messy  there were still some questions from the force awakens that are left unanswered by tros  ie how did maz get anakinslukes lightsaber  a story for another time well its another time now maz isnt it   final remarks     if youre going to addon some extra story to an already satisfying saga ending that is return of the jedi  please please plan out the three movies before hand and make sure the characters are somewhat interesting rather than having flat onedimensional characters some with no weaknesses and playing passthebaton between directorswriters for each of the three movies  remember this is a film trilogy not an elementary school relay race  im talking to you disney 
Jan 9 2020,positive,dont worry no spoilers here  overall i really loved this final installment in the 3rd star wars trilogy  very creative and enjoyable to watch  my big complain is that it felt choppy  almost like they were rushing to release it before it was fully finished
Jan 9 2020,positive,my wife loved it as a long time star wars fan i liked it could have been better but it was decently good
Jan 9 2020,negative,wow what a piece of garbage it seemed like some crappy fanfic written by a 12yearold girl
Jan 9 2020,negative,in one movie they tried to close too much plots so sometimes was missed connections between them
Jan 9 2020,negative,a lot of action maybe too much because you get lost trying to piece what is going on and with whom its a zero in my book
Jan 9 2020,positive,im perhaps in the minority but i absolutely loved it the ending was perfect
Jan 9 2020,positive,much of the same storylines and action
Jan 9 2020,negative,hot mess of bad editing crappy macguffins contradictory ideas and contrived setpieces
Jan 9 2020,negative,lazy messy erratic nonsensical what a way to end the star wars saga
Jan 9 2020,negative,dumb boring lazy just revive characters bcuz why not the action scenes are really bad the entire movie feels just like a bad excuse to launch a mediocre movie with the name star wards on it bcuz of money  to be honest this movie makes the prequels looks amazing and good movies
Jan 9 2020,positive,disclaimer i really liked the last jedi and consider myself a casual star wars fan ive played all the games but im not particularly crazy about the series i dont own any of the toys or the specialmegagodlike editions of the movies i dont know the backstory of a guy who was in one scene in the second movie heres your warning spoilers incoming  right off the bat the film tries so hard to undo the story changes from the last jedi that its painfully transparent if it was an important reveal in the last jedi then it was undone here while its trying to do that its also trying to have its own story what the film gives us feels bloated and rushed due to trying to juggle so many things at once the quick pace introduces to many moments where you ask why didnt they just for one example star destroyers are in formation parallel to the ground and need to launch its so stormy that it messes with sensors to the point that they need a navigation beacon why didnt they just turn the vessels upwards 90 degrees and step on the gas they and by extension we can literally see the ground during the inevitable shiptoship combat  is the first order the remnants of the empire or is it a separate entity why is someone with the emotional maturity of a 2yearold in charge of the first order who built the fleet of star destroyers on exegol the forbidden sith planet were said ships conjured by the emperor who i might add survived being thrown down a giant shift while exploding how did chunks of the death star crash into a planet when the return of the jedi very clearly showed it disintegrate in a massive explosion is korriban from the old republic series still the sith homeworld why do characters get brought into the story and then have about 3 minutes of screen time if star destroyers could all have planetvaporizing weapons then why was the death star even necessary i cant believe the emperor living mostly alone on a planet that a 13yearold goth would think is cool developed the weapons on his own  the movie could have been really interesting if disney hadnt chickened out instead we get a trilogy that just rehashes the original trilogy theres an empire run by a sith against someone from a famous bloodline that has to use jedi to stop them i truly believe there isnt anything new that can really be done with star wars because as the fan outcry over the last jedi showed anything even slightly different is met with hostility  is there anything particularly wrong with this movie not at all in fact its fine the story is fine the acting is fine the special effects are fine i dont know if whelming is an actual word to use but it describes this movie exactly
Jan 9 2020,positive,it was slow couple interesting details but it wasnt that bad
Jan 9 2020,positive,i loved the movie jj saved star wars while rian johnson ruined star wars
Jan 9 2020,positive,it was ok better than the return of the jedi it had some surprising twists still think the 1st 3 released are the best
Jan 9 2020,positive,overall good but long
Jan 9 2020,positive,major endgame vibes but disappointingly pales in comparison to its disney counterpart tros wouldve been a masterpiece if there werent so many plot inconsistencies throughout the trilogy
Jan 9 2020,negative,so many plot holes destroys the original saga technically excellent
Jan 9 2020,positive,great movie sad to see it come to an end
Jan 9 2020,positive,a good wrap up to this trilogy
Jan 9 2020,positive,im excited to see the continuation from rise of skywalker returns in 2021 in rise of skywalker it is about leias dynasty the rise of palpatine from the dead and rey finn and poe along with others battle against palpatines dynasty interesting twist to this film but change to reys name as the grand daughter to palpatine to skywalker
Jan 9 2020,positive,satisfying ending to a rich layered story
Jan 9 2020,negative,too many characters too long too safe
Jan 9 2020,positive,i love how it was tied together in the end
Jan 9 2020,positive,great movie loved the action and plot
Jan 9 2020,positive,this was my second viewing i enjoyed it even more than the first time jj did a great jobthere was fan service but not too much its a great conclusion to the story
Jan 9 2020,positive,as a lifelong fan i was pleased with the ending i wish the story had gone a different way but i am sure most people have their own vision the 3d was very immersive and really enhanced the experience for me personally overall a pretty stunning visual achievement
Jan 9 2020,positive,an almost impossible feat to wrap this franchise up nicely so it feels chaotic but i cant see how it could have been done better lots of fun i was skeptical but pleasantly surprised 
Jan 9 2020,positive,a lil cheesy but i love the cheese ya feel me
Jan 9 2020,positive,great movie as always from the star was saga
Jan 9 2020,positive,best of the last series of star wars movies plenty of action and closure to the story
Jan 9 2020,neutral,as a star wars fan it was enjoyable but it was a forced end to an uninteresting trilogy and spent more time trying to right the wrongs from the last jedi than it did entertaining
Jan 9 2020,positive,was fun and exciting
Jan 9 2020,positive,it was a great movie i dont think it deserves the negativity its receiving highly recommend it jesus loves yall stay safe and god bless
Jan 9 2020,positive,loved every minute of it cried 3 times lol it was amazing
Jan 9 2020,negative,this movie was a mishmash of scenes with too many random characters a complete disregard for the trilogy characters who were thrown aside made subservant to poe fin and rey none of these new characters had any character development except that rey is superwoman  just because  the most interesting comparatively was kylo rens arch    anyone who intimately knows star wars can see through the cinematography that jj and disney completely ripped off dialogue and scenes from the original trilogy   if you want to see a teen movie to get your fix and leave forgetting what you saw  like movies versions of hunger games twilight or even maze runner this movie is for you but with more beautiful cinematography and special fx  if you are a star wars fan there is nothing orginal about this movie even the score was very similar to the original trilogy  disney has successfully spit on this epic piece of my childhood
Jan 9 2020,negative,not great very long
Jan 9 2020,positive,awesome movie will see it again
Jan 9 2020,positive,i enjoyed the character development but it felt like there was a little too much breathing room the balance of action was a little lacking to me i enjoyed what action there was i really enjoyed the humor as well it just seemed slightly softer overall than i anticipated
Jan 9 2020,positive,enjoyed seeing the original cast with a great ending
Jan 9 2020,negative,overrated and overhyped just a stupid cashgrabbing movie for fanboys
Jan 9 2020,positive,action packed loved it
Jan 9 2020,positive,not quite as good as the originals but better than all the other disney star wars movies
Jan 9 2020,positive,liked the fact that the movie had a conclusion to the 3part saga the action sequences were vintage star wars there were a couple of interesting surprises to the storyline   i think they could have have a more nuanced approach to presenting the sithvsjedi conflict instead of the simplistic sith are bad and jedi are good
Jan 9 2020,negative,the movie is very pretty but the plot was lacking quite a bit the first 30 minutes are really disjointed the plot basically scrapped 75 of buildup from the last jedi and there isnt a lot of payoff for me   it relies too much on fanservice and nostalgia for me
Jan 9 2020,negative,i did write a big ass review but i click out of it so just let me say that this film was just made to make money go watch the vader fan film from star wars theory thats what a original idea and love for the franchise looks like
Jan 9 2020,positive,its star wars of course great storyline for the decadent fan 
Jan 9 2020,negative,really corny and boring  i was cringing throughout the entire thing from how dumb it was  bad acting stupid story another disgrace to a once promising franchise  thanks disney  only cool part was palpatine
Jan 9 2020,positive,somewhat disjointed and lacking in a believable ending
Jan 9 2020,positive,predictable and a little cheesy but it was good
Jan 9 2020,negative,bland unoriginal formulaic and cliche waste of a star wars movie
Jan 9 2020,positive,special effects are great
Jan 9 2020,positive,good end to the saga it had some rushed spots and some goofy writing but i liked it overall

Jan 9 2020,negative,the story was not well written and the characters were not the greatest i cant say ill watch it again

Jan 9 2020,neutral,the movie was ok i didnt like how the whole story was developed it doesnt make sense for what george lucas started
Jan 9 2020,positive,it was good  just left too many questions unanswered  but as a fan im ok
Jan 9 2020,positive,i think was the best star wars since the return of the jedi jj abrahams did a beautiful job of tying in all of the previous movies including characters and all of the fighters and previous sets they brought back the magic that was lost in many of the more current installment great job
Jan 9 2020,positive,the continuation of the story in this trilogy was masterful the insertion of harrison ford mark hamill and carrie fisher was eloquently touching everything was neatly tied up with a lot of room for future speculation and possible forward marching onward toward the 50 year mark of this magnificent series
Jan 9 2020,neutral,meh its hopefully over now
Jan 9 2020,negative,disorganized and lacking soul or structure how can you even get a chance to marvel at a new planet or even begin to care for these characters on any level whatsoever when the movie pulls you off into another tangent every 10 minutes a lackluster final corporate product that falls flat
Jan 9 2020,positive,a very nice wrapup to the star wars saga  seeing it in imax 3d was great
Jan 9 2020,positive,very satisfying and great action
Jan 9 2020,positive,perfect ending to a fantastic saga its been one of the grandest adventures of my life thank you mr lucas

Jan 9 2020,positive,loved it  next please
Jan 9 2020,positive,it is a great movie that ruined because the struggle to please everyone   but i kinda like the ending it all ends well should be excellent actually
Jan 9 2020,negative,i made an account just to express how awful this movie is  thats how awful it is
Jan 9 2020,negative,awful the story made no sense the characters made no sense so many plot holes its literally as if someone was making it up as they went along in true jj style no real questions were answered only more wtf moments created another beloved scifi movie franchise ruined by abrams
Jan 9 2020,positive,tied up alot of loose ends
Jan 9 2020,positive,fast paced and action pack great effects nice to see some of the original characters the went on a little to long
Jan 9 2020,positive,action engaged the audience and kept me wanting more as always
Jan 9 2020,positive,a serious movie not a victory lap still the return of the emperor is a crappy plot
Jan 9 2020,positive,movie was ok it was pretty predictable
Jan 9 2020,positive,action packed an very well story driven a great movie after what we got with episode 8
Jan 9 2020,positive,i truly do not understand the critic hate for this movie the only way you could find real problems in this movie is if you went into it looking for them and hoping to find them best finally i could have hoped for given the way the previous two went
Jan 9 2020,positive,nice end to the original three star wars movies and the two sequels  wow so epic and heartwarming 
Jan 9 2020,positive,i thought it was a fitting end to the saga a lot of fun and actually quite an emotional rollercoaster
Jan 9 2020,positive,a great end to the series
Jan 9 2020,positive,theres too much that was unnecessary and the many attempts at satisfying moments fell flat otherwise an partly enjoyable movie
Jan 9 2020,positive,liked how it tied up alot of loose ends felt sad every time i saw carrie fisher
Jan 9 2020,positive,i enjoyed the wrap up of the trilogy the conclusion of leias story and deeply appreciated how they managed to implement carrie fishers amazing talents and role into the movie after her passing and i really loved the little easter eggs and that occurred throughout which likely only meant anything to longtime fans but also didnt detract from the enjoyment for new viewers
Jan 9 2020,neutral,its the best  the worst film from the disney star wars trilogy why its the best it has better pacing and action than the prior two it also in some ways redeems luke skywalker though not as satisfying as some would prefer  why its the worst it retcons everything prior to it from anakins chosen one arc to his own sacrifice as vader force users are so powerful they can sense someone from planets away yet no one not luke not leia nor all powerful rey sense palpatine is still alive the film is entertaining  it has likable characters however to a star wars fan from the beginning its a let down a film that will take your childhood heroes wad them up like a candy wrapper and toss them in the garbage if your first introduction to star wars was the force awakens you will probably enjoy this film far more than i did
Jan 9 2020,positive,i wish kyler ren didnt die  i like that he turned good
Jan 9 2020,positive,it wasnt a good movie but it wasnt bad either its definitely the kind of movie star wars fans have seen already in the first two movies of the trilogy but its not really anything mentionable in terms of a finale its kind meh
Jan 9 2020,negative,this movie seemed more focused on spectacle and fan service than bringing the star wars saga to a satisfying conclusion still its fun and visually appealing right up to the end when the frenetic incoherence reaches a point where enjoying the film becomes impossible
Jan 9 2020,positive,the movie was great
Jan 9 2020,negative,sad to seee the neglect they had with the franchise 
Jan 9 2020,negative,it was hard to get through 90 of the movie the jokes fell flat and there wasnt much intense action that being said the final battle was pretty dope but the ending was probably one of the worst endings i have seen in a long time
Jan 9 2020,positive,it was an amazing experience but the lack of practical effects was concerning i get its a space film with aliens and lightning and so on but the cgi gets shoved down ur thought just a tiny bit too much
Jan 9 2020,positive,so much action and very much enjoyed the story line 
Jan 9 2020,positive,honestly i think this is the best of the new trilogy blends fun and serious moments very well could have ended 10 minutes earlier it is nice to have a break from star wars
Jan 9 2020,positive,i loved the action and the storyline  the graphics were awesome  some of the one liners were predictable still enjoyable
Jan 9 2020,positive,not as good as the first three movies
Jan 9 2020,positive,i thought it was entertaining  it gives closure to the original star war movies
Jan 9 2020,negative,the manic pace and terrible decisions ruined this movie it had some great effects and character moments but ultimately it couldnt be saved from its writers
Jan 9 2020,positive,it was the best since the original 3 came out
Jan 9 2020,positive,star wars was meant to be fun in the movies which my husbands and i had this last installment was highly satisfying
Jan 9 2020,positive,honestly loved it it was the space opera i was waiting for
Jan 9 2020,positive,great storyline love the movie
Jan 9 2020,positive,loved it dont listen to the bad reviews see it and make up your own mind
Jan 9 2020,positive,i didnt expect a certain character to die and not as climactic for the supposed ending of such a saga hence the 12 star deduction  overall a fantastic movie great acting and music was terrific  i would watch it in theaters again i enjoyed it so much
Jan 9 2020,positive,its a good popcorn movie
Jan 9 2020,positive,fantastic film must see enjoyed it all
Jan 9 2020,positive,thank you mr abrams and mr lucas
Jan 9 2020,negative,an awful movie with a tpuching ending ruins the continuity of the franchise and ignores themes not only from the lucas material but also from both the abbrams material and the johnson material i am very surprised that disney approved this films release it seems like they really just dont cate anymore the worst part was the sheer amount of missed opportunities here it felt like there was no real venerence for the source material
Jan 9 2020,positive,im a big fan fitting ending to a great saga
Jan 9 2020,positive,amazing way to cap off the trilogy and end the saga
Jan 9 2020,negative,disjointed and all over the place  glad i had a fandango vip reward bonus to see it for free
Jan 9 2020,positive,i expected so much more
Jan 9 2020,positive,loved  carrie fisher mark hamil billy dee williams harrison ford the effects of obi wan kenobis voice chewbacca yoda  all of the veteran characters not sure about the name rise of skywalker
Jan 9 2020,positive,loved this movie bring the tissues
Jan 9 2020,positive,did not disappoint loved every minute
Jan 9 2020,positive,a good save after the train wreck of the last jedi still not up there with the force awakens or rogue one but still least it feels like star wars 45
Jan 9 2020,positive,they did a much better job with this movie compared to last jedi
Jan 9 2020,positive,great movie and action the color was amazing the plot was believable and surprising i loved this movie and hope there are more coming  the end gives me hope for ore to come i would see this again and again  and again
Jan 9 2020,negative,it was pretty bad but there were some awesome cinematography and cool scenes
Jan 9 2020,positive,great way to end the skywalker saga  watched it a few times and thanks to fandango for making it easy to purchase each ticket
Jan 9 2020,positive,35 starsbetter than meh but certainly not awesome  it was a satisfying ending to a decadeslong saga  it tried hard maybe too hard to pay homage to parts 4 5 and 6  many of us werent very happy with the other numbers anyway
Jan 9 2020,negative,this could have been its own triligy it tried to fix what the last movie did sorry disney you goofied it up
Jan 9 2020,positive,great movie no complaints
Jan 9 2020,positive,amazing first star wars my girlfriend liked
Jan 9 2020,negative,i was let down by the lazy script full of holes and contrived plot devices expected more from the franchise finale
Jan 9 2020,positive,really enjoy it great end to the trilogy
Jan 9 2020,positive,2nd viewing after seeing it in chicago just before christmas just finished reviewing the force awakens and the last jedi to see if it would add anything didnt see the end credits in chicago but did today the music was fantastic one last time   other than the music end credits my opinion didnt change significantly got a lot more detail this time around but i have to say that finn and poe dameron are not particularly memorable characters in this epic spaceopera spanning 19772019 and the fact that rey with very little jedi training could do all she did with the force again just my minor opinion  oh well   generally enjoyable throughout the nine films my three favorites are definitely iv a new hope v the empire strikes back and vi return of the jedi one of my favorite characters in the saga was actually count dooku darth tyranus and wished they could have explored his character a bit more the end of an era may the force be with you
Jan 9 2020,positive,well done  a lot of action humor and  drama  story line paid great tribute to the main characters throughout the entire franchise
Jan 9 2020,positive,tied up all the loose ends  used the original music  jj abrams was the primary writer  the perfect finale
Jan 9 2020,positive,star wars was definitely entertaining but a little predictable
Jan 9 2020,positive,they did a good job of wrapping it all up got all the previous characters in  the story line was pretty much the same but still very well done
Jan 9 2020,positive,loved return of many characters and the way they helped bring closure to this epic story
Jan 9 2020,positive,look what they did to my boy how they massacred my boy
Jan 9 2020,positive,very enjoyable movie  at times predictable and yet not predictable
Jan 9 2020,positive,my husband enjoyed it more than me  it was a satisfying conclusion to the series
Jan 9 2020,positive,i think the whole series over all these years has been done fabulously what a ride over 30 years of my life it is epic
Jan 9 2020,positive,my kids really enjoyed this movie we saw it in a dolby cinema theater amazing
Jan 9 2020,positive,it was just what i wanted it to be
Jan 9 2020,positive,i loved it some of it was rushed but overall it was a great movie 
Jan 9 2020,positive,it was at its best when the three main characters were together but too many plot conveniences made what could have been a great movie good
Jan 9 2020,positive,i think youll enjoy this if youre a die hard star wars fan it was a fitting end to the skywalker story with great cameos and a fulfilling end  also it was a nice send off to carrie fishers character overall a very satisfying experience
Jan 9 2020,positive,great movie i know there was a lot of dissent with doehard fans but i took the movie at face value and really really enjoyed it
Jan 9 2020,positive,it answered so many questions every star wars fan will love to see it multiple times to get the full picture again and again
Jan 9 2020,positive,big star wars fan was not disappointed
Jan 9 2020,negative,while the cinematography was excellent the plot completely tears down the whole narrative built up over the past 8 movies from illogical to impractical to down right ridiculous rent this movie if you are a fan of the series just to say you copleted this series poor effort and horribly ruins a beloved franchise
Jan 9 2020,negative,boring have outgrown the unending sabre battles dialogue immature and childish i fell asleep
Jan 9 2020,positive,enjoyed very much good special effects
Jan 9 2020,positive,spoiler alert didnt like killing off ben after he saved her not sure why she couldnt save him back
Jan 9 2020,positive,finally main cast gets to spend most of the movie together great fan service as well as fitting ends for the characters
Jan 9 2020,negative,this film is a checklist the producers think the fans want to see that ultimately feels just like a checklist
Jan 9 2020,positive,exceptional visual effects combined with topnotch acting made for a movie worth watching more than once and the inclusion of archival footage of carrie fisher interacting with presentday cast was nothing short of awe inspiring
Jan 9 2020,negative,this movie was an overstuffed convoluted nonsensical mess i think that jj abrams tried his best to undo the damage done by the last jedi but that is a task too great for any director
Jan 8 2020,positive,star wars was a good movie i enjoyed that rey is a palpatine princess but didnt like that palpatine himself was still alive i guess they had to make the connection
Jan 8 2020,positive,amazing roller coaster of emotions
Jan 8 2020,positive,another awesome movie loved the action as well as the humor
Jan 8 2020,positive,it was ok pretty predictable from the opening credits
Jan 8 2020,positive,pacing was all over and it was too long
Jan 8 2020,positive,i was the end of the saga i think there was a big hint of rotj i did enjoyed it all the same  it was nice to return to a galaxy far far away one more time  lets hope if there is to be a new trilogy it delivers like a new hope did all those years ago 
Jan 8 2020,positive,amazing fixes everything that went wrong with the last one blends the old with the new so well cant wait to see it again and again and again
Jan 8 2020,positive,surprisingly better than i expected not as disappointing as the last jedi
Jan 8 2020,positive,the ending was not good
Jan 8 2020,positive,i obviously love the story of star wars and all of the movies but this one just felt a little rushed and they were trying to put a bow on it too quickly maybe they couldve done a part one and part two to give them more time to develop the story
Jan 8 2020,positive,fantastic this proves critics have zero clue about movie quality after this and the last jedi reviews im so glad abrams came back we got what we should have gotten for the last movie he should have directed all 3 or at least wrote all three im very pleased with how they ended the saga now disney can go exploit characters for their agenda and destroy all the character arcs they want at least they cant destroy the skywalkers
Jan 8 2020,negative,wow  i thought the last star wars movie was garbage  i was told by several people this one was really good  wrong  one of the worst movies ive seen in years  complete garbage from start to finish
Jan 8 2020,positive,a great rendering of the end of an epic story
Jan 8 2020,positive,ren stepping up and helping ray
Jan 8 2020,positive,an amazing ending to the franchise could it be better absolutely but its not bad at all and has very exiting moments and i would say that just enough fanservice
Jan 8 2020,positive,i guess i must just be too easy to please but im a huge star wars fan and enjoyed every minute of the rise of skywalker started out of the gate strong and did not disappoint for me for those of you that just enjoy star wars and arent overly critical of movies this is a must see
Jan 8 2020,negative,it was just sad to see what they turned the star wars franchise into
Jan 8 2020,negative,very commercial and predictable not a good movie
Jan 8 2020,positive,rise was clearly an attempt at a make up with star wars fans  for me it did one important thing that the previous two films didnt it gave our main characters time around each other  the relationships between finn and poe and finn and rey never really clicked for me in those two first films  they spent just a few minutes with each other and suddenly they were best buds  contrast that with the original trilogy where those main three or four characters were constantly around each other and overcoming problems together  sure luke would jet off to dagoba or be stuck on the death star at parts but the others were always around each other  to me that allowed us to fall in love with the characters and be invested in them  cant say the same for finn and poe in tfa and tlj  however this movie we got to see a little more interaction as well as a little more backstory on poe  which was great  they also did a better job of representing the luke han and leia characters in this movie  the previous movies didnt do their characters justice at all    in the end it was a much more enjoyable star wars film than the first two of this trilogy but it will always be weighed down by those two films  kyloben and rey were a great story and had great chemistry together but i feel like the rest of the cast sort of got tossed aside
Jan 8 2020,negative,so this is the conclusion of the skywalker saga  with that in mind this movie is a complete and total disappointment  if you are only wanting a conclusion to this sequel trilogy then you may be partially satisfied  the problem with this trilogy and this movie is the obvious creative differences between directors and writers  the fact that the original script for 9 didnt include emperor palpatine should tell everyone the problems going into this rather quickly  with the ot cast being nothing more but campy dialogue that is restricted to repeating lines from their previous trilogy and essentially having less than a side role is another problem  this is the skywalker saga concluding trilogy and the skywalkers were barely a focus in it  i could go over all the problems with this movie but i dont want to get too nit picky  essentially it was a cliche plot that you will already know what happens before you even walk in the theater    the movie felt like jj went onto social media wrote down all things the fans were pissed off about with 7 and 8 and put a check next to each item as the movie progressed   rey origin check new villain check snoke explained check where is lando check who are the knights of ren not check but here they are doing there best to look awesome standing on cliff tops  i wont even get into the sith way finders or the sith army or the worshippers orlike i said it is very hard to find anything to like about this movie  i will say the trailer made me almost drop a tear during the c3po scene  when that scene came on in the movie i realized two things every single person in the room when he says i wanted to look at my friends one last time that to either completely disrespected and ignored him the whole movie up to that point and two this was his very first movie where 3po actually had any interaction with any of those characters  i mean chewbacca was not even there  sorry this movie just sucked
Jan 8 2020,positive,not a huge star wars fan however it was a perfect ending to the saga my husband loved it
Jan 8 2020,positive,star wars the rise of skywalker was a great movie lots of action and returns of previous characters that fill the story id recommend it for all who watch the star wars saga
Jan 8 2020,positive,almost as good as the original movies
Jan 8 2020,negative,horrible lore knowledge by the writers very poor attempt to bring back a villain somehow the only threats in the universe are planet killing machines and palpatine for 9 movies obvious mary sue protagonist feels like a huge superproduction made by people who dont like what they are doing music they ended the trilogy without the most iconic songs duel of the fates immolation anakins dark deeds etc the choreography was appalling and childlike unworthy of the franchise a tiring movie with no plot nor anything that might help you swallow such nonsense
Jan 8 2020,positive,fun exciting and cool to see the old familiar faces back in action
Jan 8 2020,positive,overall great fan service loved the movie but it was predictable to some extent
Jan 8 2020,positive,to me this is a 65 out of 100 a solid starwars movie that sucks you into the story there is things you want and dont get but overall i liked it how the franchise handled cary fischers death was very thoughtful not explaining how palpatine lived left plot holes but incorporating him into reys life was an interesting twist i didnt see worth seeing
Jan 8 2020,positive,a charming conclusion to a long and successful franchise
Jan 8 2020,positive,definitely a whole lot of fan service but thats it
Jan 8 2020,negative,disney  the cow has been milked drymove on and never come back 
Jan 8 2020,positive,really enjoyed all the lightsaber fights
Jan 8 2020,negative,after jj abrams set up multiple mystery boxes in the force awakens to be answered in the next two films rian johnson subverted everyones expectations by painting disney and the unfortunate directorscriptwriters for episode ix in a corner   rise of skywalker attempts to correct the absolutely insane last jedi by shoving every piece of story and visuals in your face like someone shoving a firehose in your mouth dont actually think about this logically says the movie just look at all the things on screen the movie is all over the place sometimes literally as it fights so hard to undo the sins of last jedi and come up with some kind of story that makes sense and finishes a saga that really should have ended in 1983 i dont blame jj abrams for this at all he had nowhere to go and no options as rian johnson took every plot thread away in episode viii where can anyone even a better director than abrams produce a new threat character development and arcs and finish a trilogy in one movie the answer is to shove so many visuals throwaway lines of dialogue and have so many things happen offscreen so your movie isnt 3 hours long and still doesnt answer the million questions that i have after watching this as many have said this movie should have been two movies at least but that was impossible to do as this was the end of the saga  the only other frustrating thing that truly eats at me is the treatment of john boyega in this film let alone the franchise without spoilers it is easy to see that there is something very special about his character of finn and the movie alludes to it multiple multiple times even where there is a scene where he is just about to reveal this very interesting thing but then the camera cuts away because god forbid we have an intriguing plot point or a scene with depth there is so much ground to cover to fix the trilogy to the point that too much is shoved in not enough is explained and the movie is begging you to just pay attention to the big budget visuals and not think critically about the plot or what is actually going on overall rise of skywalker is definitely better than the tragedy of darth johnsons last jedi but it is forced to correct so many mistakes of the last movie while being its own film that there is nothing but a 2 12 hour video game cut scene mashup to finish this oncerevered saga its over and i hope it just stays dead this time unlike palpatine i guess one last thing rotten tomatoes i dont believe that the real audience score is 86 rt you sold out shame
Jan 8 2020,positive,i had a pretty good time with this movie i felt it was far superior to the last jedi without giving too much away i felt that it did a nice job tying up the entire story
Jan 8 2020,negative,it was just ok all these years of fighting and she was still cried the entire movie
Jan 8 2020,positive,it was much better than the last movie that came out a fitting end
Jan 8 2020,positive,hubby and son gave it a 7 out of 10 i fell asleep 20 mins into it
Jan 8 2020,positive,while it had a lot of fan service it was still packed with action and amazing visual effects
Jan 8 2020,negative,totally fails as a sequel and totally fails as a stand alone movie awful way to finish an epic movie franchise
Jan 8 2020,positive,an uneven mess of a film spoilers   you start bringing dead characters back your taken away the threat and then you have a lead character rey who doesnt resonate with the audience there no interest then you have the side characters that have nothing much to do  i have never been that bothered about a stars wars trilogy since the prequels  at least the mandorlain has shown us the way and there is a new hope 
Jan 8 2020,positive,it was not predictable
Jan 8 2020,positive,same old story some parts were a little hokey enough of star wars
Jan 8 2020,positive,going to see it again tomorrow
Jan 8 2020,negative,i thought it was only ok   they make lea look like an elf  i would have waited until it came out on dvd
Jan 8 2020,neutral,palpatine story line is filled with plot holes
Jan 8 2020,negative,total clusterfuck so many side stories feels like watching a video game its a mess a huge fucking mess its better then the terrible last jedi but that dosent say much it still terrible
Jan 8 2020,positive,great movie and i am not even a start war fan but i really enjoyed it
Jan 8 2020,positive,maybe the best episode of the franchise
Jan 8 2020,positive,if you love star wars and i mean you actually enjoy watching the movies and not just fighting over ownership of it then you should enjoy this movie its far from perfect its often a mess in fact its also not an abomination or a betrayal its a love letter to how star wars made you feel when you first discovered it its fun at times funny and its meant to excite you its ridiculous but it looks and sounds great and its an adrenaline rush from start to finish  feel free to criticize what it gets wrong and thats plenty but it still gets more right simply sit back and enjoy it for what it is
Jan 8 2020,positive,yeah its convoluted feels rushed sometimes a little bit too much on the nostalgia side all of that but i cant help myself i enjoyed watching the movie its star wars and its very star wars that alone makes me like it for what it is besides that the movie is very well crafted and despite all the stuff that is going on i think the writing is good enough to still make it work its not the best star wars movie ever and not some transcendental experience or something but it is a fun movie and a fun star wars movie alsoadam driver just nails it scene after scene if you are a fan of kylo ren and adam drivers acting you will love this
Jan 8 2020,positive,nonstop action  lots of tie ins with previous movies so some stuff might get lost or mean little if you havent seen the originals
Jan 8 2020,positive,it was ok nothing special
Jan 8 2020,positive,ive watched the star wars movies from the beginning i had to see the last one been theredone that was the way i felt when i left the theater im glad i went on 5 movie night it was worth that
Jan 8 2020,positive,great end to the skywalker saga
Jan 8 2020,negative,the force made return of the jedi exciting in the rise of skywalk the force made the story absurd
Jan 8 2020,negative,this movie was such a mess and pretty much spent its entire time trying to recon the last jedi
Jan 8 2020,positive,the best possible conclusion to the primary skywalker storyline that chronologically begins with episode i the phantom menance and through the original trilogy  the parallel between the skywalker name and the legacy of darkness come to a head in this film  although not perfect it managed to conclude the sequel trilogy despite story progression issues from the last jedi  with a better suited middle act film this movie would have not suffered from the exposition issues it had to endure in order to close out this trilogy as quickly as it had to
Jan 8 2020,positive,it was a little choppy but overall good
Jan 8 2020,positive,awesome and great movie as always 
Jan 8 2020,positive,a grand finale to the skywalker saga
Jan 8 2020,negative,the characters didnt even know what jetpacks are and act like its something new and incredible like it has never been in star wars before all i can say is oof
Jan 8 2020,positive,incredible movie full of surprises passion and everything youd expect from starwars awesome
Jan 8 2020,positive,really liked it im not a huge star wars fan i dont really care for the star wars movies too much but i really enjoyed this one with star wars i always feel like its difficult for me to follow the storyline because i paid more attention to the graphicsi liked  storyline it was really easy to follow i would say it may be in the top two of my favorite star wars movies i recommend itprobably not for your average geeky star wars nerd but good for your average movie goer
Jan 8 2020,positive,really great action with a story that brings it all together
Jan 8 2020,positive,it was all well written and well put together
Jan 8 2020,positive,good action likable characters drama plot twists some relationships arent fully fleshed out obscuring motives behind the characters
Jan 8 2020,positive,good story but somewhat frenetic pacing   jj directs well but the writing sometimes falls flat  or delivers corney lines that make you roll your eyes  overall though its a fun time and a good end to the tale
Jan 8 2020,positive,the story is fun and exciting to see in some parts but is far away from a good star wars movie they have take zero risks in the film the fans want to see this to happen but it feels like the past of the saga doesnt really matter in this conclussion
Jan 8 2020,positive,this is an excellent movie it made me cry multiple times and i would watch it another 20 times if i could you should definitely watch this
Jan 8 2020,positive,downright polarizing and stupid but had it good moments save by the visuals a little
Jan 8 2020,positive,what a great ending to an amazing saga
Jan 8 2020,positive,i loved this movie even though ive seen few of the other star wars movies since the first few  dinner and a movie with girlfriends in our 60s  so nostalgic with original characters  cameo with carrie fisher was so good that i looked up afterwards how they did it  and does rey become a skywalker or go to the darkside  love interests were a plus  good family movie  im buying this movie on dvd when it comes out for my granddaughter  i would watch it again
Jan 8 2020,positive,this movie is a breath of air compared to its predecessor its a shame that disney couldnt andor wouldnt have jj abrams pilot the directors chair for all three movies of the final trilogy sure there were some boring parts and whatnot but jj had the unfortunate task of cleaning up rian johnsons mess that is the last jedi
Jan 8 2020,positive,didnt like the ending
Jan 8 2020,positive,it was suprisingly enjojable ride best of the newest trilogy it was overthetop but redeems previous films
Jan 8 2020,positive,i really liked this movie
Jan 8 2020,positive,it tied up a few loose ends overall not as terrible as i heard
Jan 8 2020,positive,i really enjoyed the movie  i went in with reasonably tempered expectations having heard a bunch of conflicting opinions  i enjoyed tfa and tlj as well for reference  the biggest problem with the movie was that it felt rushed  like jj abrams needed to do a bunch of setup to get to the place where he wanted to be to start the third movie from so he rushed through establishing a bunch of important stuff at a breakneck pace  like he tried to cram 2 movies worth of stuff into one    the other big problem i felt was that theres this demonstrable escalation of powers from previous movies to this one  these forceusers are more superhuman than ever before  there are some unresolved threads from previous movies as well as this one  the plot sure had some leaps of logic and some just go with it required  but all that stuff was in service of the heart of the story and in that i felt like it did a great job  the heart was in the right place  the characters were handled well  i enjoyed kylos internal struggle and journey  c3po was actually a fun character  luke had some redemption  they handled leia well  at the end of the day while i can poke holes in it all day i enjoyed myself all the way through  it gave me the feelings i expect and hope to feel when watching a star wars movie  so im happy with it
Jan 8 2020,negative,seemed like they had a check list of items they had to cover and crammed them all in at the last minute but im sure disney will get some toy sales out of it too much too late awkward contrived scenes with a dead actress
Jan 8 2020,negative,this movie is not true star wars ludicrius plot with many plot holes that have implication for past films was just fan service pretty much without a deep plot star wars would expect to have
Jan 8 2020,positive,wraps up the third trilogy with lots of nods to previous trilogies easter eggs and cameos
Jan 8 2020,positive,so sad its the end still unsure how rey is granddaughter of the evil sith leader
Jan 8 2020,positive,best with what was given although i would have loved to see 7 and 8 build up to this movie from the get go opportunity missed i suggest wright out a trilogy before you shoot the movies but what do i know
Jan 8 2020,positive,my son and his absolutely loved this movie
Jan 8 2020,negative,bad as the rest of the last trilogy to tell the truth this one is the worst of all
Jan 8 2020,positive,loved it one of my favorites in the series a couple things i didnt quite understand but overall i think it was awesome
Jan 8 2020,negative,honestly while watching the movie i was asking myself if they got a wrong version which messed up the order of the scenes but i had to admit that this is it this is what modern top budget writing looks like this happens then this happens then this happens oh this looks spectalular decisions questions reason depth nope dont think just enjoy blinky pointless images thats what this trilogy teaches us by the way exstormtroopers are excellent spacefighterpilots by default and then ride into battle on horses in space why disney thats why to be fair i fell asleep midway in so i might have missed some steps im sure they would have explained nothing production cgi and acting is ok the editing and story is an insult to intelligence rendering the former completely pointless
Jan 8 2020,negative,full of plot holes a full disrispect to the lore and to the original movies characters legacy the first 23 parts of the movie i couldnt even believe the amount of plot holes i found wile watching and the dumb logic they force in to keep the trama going the 33 part was the less disastrous but still i hope this movies never came out so someone else could done it at least with some logic
Jan 8 2020,positive,for this 70 year old whos followed the story from the beginning this was a very satisfying conclusion to lucas hero story written broadly across the galaxy   with the help of those who went before them the compelling new characters bring this grand story to a rewarding conclusion
Jan 8 2020,positive,it was a nice movie my nine year old son loved it
Jan 8 2020,positive,wonderful conclusion to the star wars saga the force will live on
Jan 8 2020,positive,more true to the storyline
Jan 8 2020,negative,it was terribly fine for the finale of a 30 year series of films it only succeeds in insulting the last jedi which was unequivocally the worst star wars movie of all time this film is lukewarm in a really depressing way because the series had incredible potential going in after the force awakens this movie just reminds you of what could have been disney would do well to learn from this mistake and just erase this like they did star wars legends from canon its not worse than the last jedi or attack of the clones but it is nowhere near return of the jedi or empire strikes back it is convoluted hard to grasp and gives the audience no emotional attachment and takes away consequences of characters actions it was just fine and that is not a good thing for a star wars movie that caps off a trilogy
Jan 8 2020,positive,jj abrams gave exactly what fans wanted to see pure gold im going to see it again 
Jan 8 2020,positive,the weakest of the new trilogy but not bad
Jan 8 2020,positive,seemed like a rushed finale it needs a complete rewrite for it to become that blockbuster this should have been
Jan 8 2020,positive,love it what a great ending to the saga
Jan 8 2020,neutral,jj was given shit and lemons after the last jedi he took what he was given and made shittylemonade it is not a great moviebut it is a lot better than part2  it is shitty lemonade
Jan 8 2020,positive,they tried way to hard didnt have the spark of the original movies
Jan 8 2020,positive,i like how the movie tied the series together bringing back pieces from the original movies it was heart felt and kept me in the story
Jan 8 2020,positive,as a star wars fan its enjoyable and it was a good movie to end the saga if you are not into star wars its not that great as far as movies go
Jan 8 2020,positive,the time has come to say goodbye well sort of after 42 years and nine films the skywalker saga has reached its end disney of course plans on releasing more trilogies and tv series so star wars is far from dead  i have been a star wars fan since i was five years old thats about 25 years for me and have continued to fall in love with it with every movie and series i see in fact to this day attack of the clones is still my all time favorite movie with each movies release my anticipation of my theater viewing is more exciting then any other film i ever want to see at the theater but here we are just two years after the last jedi divided fans which to this day i still dont understand i never saw what people see so wrong with episode eight yes the film made some bold moves and choices but so what rian johnson was ballsy and took some risks and i think most of them payed off no i wasnt happy that we didnt get many answers and some of the explanations were kind of shuffled off but all in all in still had some great moments and will go down as another great installment in this incredible saga now returns jj abrams to finish the trilogy that he started with the force awakens i was so glad when it was announced he would be returning because i only thought it was right for abrams to finish the story that he started in episode seven we finally get answers to our long standing questions as to who snoke actually is who reys parents and lineage is and who has been pulling the strings all along the film hits the ground running from the very beginning we are treated to the return of emperor palpantine i love the lighting at set design of exogel the planet where the sith have been hiding along with the now zombie like emperor it sent chills down my spine when the fleet of hundreds of star destroyers rose from the ice one classic line from revenge of the sith essentially explains how the emperor is back it was a nice callback but can agree that i would have like a little more explanation to his return with a rumored extended cut on the way we are hearing we may just get those answers anyway after our great opening we get a nice falcon chase and get to see rey training on the new planet for the resistance base i was very impressed to how carrie fisher was integrated into the film leias scenes although brief still work in telling the story abrams and his team did a great job writing and filming scenes around the stock footage from the last two films  as the film goes along we are treated to many funny moments most from c3po and plenty of fan service and callbacks some people i know have had issue with the fan service but why whats wrong with calling back to the classics that made the series what it is all of the scenes with rey and kyle are so well done their chemistry is undeniable daisy ridley and adam driver ooze so much appeal that even their intense eye stare downs have tension thats something that pays off in the final act reylo fans got their wish thats all i will say there are many moments in the film that probably could have taken a few more risks including the fake out of chewbaccas death i really thought this might stick and thought it was very ballsy to do but it is undone chewbacca survives i would have liked it more for the film to maybe have took that risk as the film plugs along i started piecing together to who rey was especially after force lightning comes out of her hands there were rumors online for quite sometime who she might be and they happened to be spot on i do like how after this whole saga the skywalker and palpantine storyline becomes one it made a lot of sense that rey is who she is there are so many moments where i got goosebumps throughout the film i dont want to spoil them here but with a classic character return and an ending that sent chills down my spine this movie gave me all the feels  more great lightsaber and space battles along with some great performances from ridley and driver the saga comes to a thrilling and nostalgic conclusion that gives us plenty of callbacks and nostalgia that will put a smile on your face it sure put one i mine thank you star wars for giving me a great 25 years and i look forward to the next 25 more with new films and series  grade b
Jan 8 2020,positive,it fixes all the problems from the last jedi and remains true to the spirit of the original trilogy
Jan 8 2020,negative,spectacular visuals and action scenes do not overcome a mediocre story and poorer story telling  the story sometimes jumps from one scene to another and you dont know whats going on or why  i grew up on the original sw series but every scene with one of the actors from the original series was lame  the scenes with luke were especially awful
Jan 8 2020,neutral,it had a low bar to climb over and it barely did solid acting from the leads wasted
Jan 8 2020,positive,overall i found the movie enjoyable  i didnt leave disappointed but i was hoping for something a bit more original  the scene progressions felt somewhat rushed but comes up short of becoming jagged or hoppy see batman vs superman for an example  its a fitting conclusion to a lessthaninspiring sequel trilogy
Jan 8 2020,positive,the final installment of the skywalker saga is wellworth the watch so long as expectations are managed unfortunately the rise of skywalker suffers from being attached to a weak link in the last jedi  a movie i recently rewatched and enjoyed much more than on my first viewing but still hurts the overall plot of the final installments to the ennead an example would be even hinting at palpatines ascendance earlier in the series than merely standing alone in the final episode the longrun time doesnt flow as smoothly as expected and was choppy throughout some quality dialogue and funny and others were cringeworthy  i know difficult with carrie fisher passing away so not taking off for that finn and rose who apparently is still alive and well are not still a thing and finn gets potentially his third love interest in three movies finns arc was always my least favorite and hurt the most from the last jedi i know im going to sound like a hypocrite here because i had asked for more lightsaber battles in the earlier movies but did we get too much lightsabering here i thought reys arc was the most complete and entertaining even if the writers botched her final line which i understand would require changing the title i hated what they did with chewie  either killoff a beloved character or let him escape but dont do both its offensive to the audience and although a tear came to my eye when the full resistance fleet appeared i couldnt help but wonder where were these motherfuckers during the past two movies all that being said the rise of skywalker was an enjoyable experience  its a space adventure after all  and definitely worth seeing in theaters i think it fits nicely enough as the center pillar between the force awakens 90 and the last jedi 78
Jan 8 2020,negative,dumpster fire of a movie on so many levels did not think itd get any worse after seeing luke drink alien boobie milk in the last crappy movie ill never watch rent or buy these new trilogy sw movies even to show my new baby if i had never seen the original trilogy or the prequels id still think these new movies were garbage
Jan 8 2020,positive,this one was as good as the first one  usually dont get better than the first but the rise is skywalker comes very close loved it
Jan 8 2020,positive,very very good loved the endgame feel to it ie the nod to everything thats happened for the fans whove been there from the beginning thought jja did an excellent job trying to pick up the broken pieces rj left behind the beginning was lightningquick because of it but that was fine was hoping for a mandalorian tiein given the timeline of the show and movies releases but not a huge disappointment the best of the third trilogy imo slightly behind esb rotj and anh and maybe solo  yes i loved it
Jan 8 2020,positive,amazing wrap up to the skywalker storyline i want to watch it again top 3 star wars movie hands down 
Jan 8 2020,positive,have seen now for the 2nd time  better seating  much better to take everything in
Jan 8 2020,positive,it was better than episode viii  still left some loose ends  episode x by 2023
Jan 8 2020,positive,it  was a great closure for the skywalker legacy
Jan 8 2020,positive,it was awesome rae is an amazing action
Jan 8 2020,negative,what i dont like the holl movie is crap from the first moment till the last is really the most bad made movie ever the have make a joke from the franchise
Jan 8 2020,positive,i loved it it was easy to understand for nonfans as well
Jan 8 2020,positive,it is a good movie  i went in with high hopes and left without them  i had hoped for something like iv or vi episodes and this wasnt close
Jan 8 2020,positive,ultimately i was entertained and enjoyed the ending to this saga but it was definitely my least favourite of the three it was very linear there were no offshoot storylines going on like there normally are in star wars movies and i found the scenes pretty jumpy like it was too fast paced and moved from scenetoscene too quickly i also found it pretty far removed from the other movies in the saga like the other two could have almost not even been made for this one to exist i also found the script to be very surfacelevel there were a few too many oneliners for me and i found people spoke too fast in this movie somehow   that being said it was still an enjoyable and satisfying ending i love all the main characters and was extremely happy to be watching them on the big screen again so it could have been better but i still enjoyed it
Jan 8 2020,positive,not a huge star wars fan but i did like this movie  i love how they brought back the original cast into the story and that i didnt have to know all about star wars to follow
Jan 8 2020,positive,everything you need and want in a star wars movie
Jan 8 2020,negative,the movie is allover the place  nothing makes sence anymore so thank you for this disney
Jan 8 2020,negative,im a lifelong sw fan and i could not find much to like about this movie all the characters arcs were regressed any personal growth they had made so far had been erased the movie was rushed and the premise weak the actors did the best with what they were given i would have gladly waited another 2 years for a more satisfying conclusion to the saga
Jan 8 2020,positive,bringing back old characters and the whole storyline was great
Jan 8 2020,positive,excellent end to the series
Jan 8 2020,positive,to put a bow on an epic begun 42 years ago is a difficult thing the films last act beginning with the lastditch assault of the resistance has some heavy lifting to do and yet the script provides nice curtain calls and reasonable closure for characters from 4 through 9 that many of us have known all our lives it invites us to think about all thats been accomplished by a film series begun all the way back in the precgi world
Jan 8 2020,neutral,i will only say that all involved with this film had zero appreciation for the original films a pity because the first two original films achieved quite a lot
Jan 8 2020,positive,i laughed i cried and i felt like 40 year old story was given a satisfiying ending the way the characters relationships grew and developed was beautiful the visuals were amazing the writing cant hold a candle to the original trilogy but they make up with it through amazing casting
Jan 8 2020,positive,im sad this was the last star wars but it was all worth it in the end this movie answered a lot of questions i had and cleared up things for me loved this movie
Jan 8 2020,positive,enjoyed the movie it is a lot fun but i understand people complaints dont let the negative comments stop you from watching a fun movie
Jan 8 2020,positive,i thought this was the best star wars out the the newer sw series alot of light saber battles and very intense emotional moments it definitely ties everything together well loved it a must see for sure
Jan 8 2020,positive,great movie  deff a closure to the franchise
Jan 8 2020,negative,they attempted to correct the mistakes made in the previous two films of this trilogy but it still felt like the same story told over again nothing new and certainly nothing inspirational
Jan 8 2020,positive,critics are clueless  perfect ending
Jan 8 2020,negative,a decent movie with a few nitpicks including anakins lightsaber activation button being wrong maybe a result of it being rebuilt between movies and remnants of the second death star even existing watch the explosion scene in rotj and try to tell me that it was anything more than space dust after that   while this was not nearly as blasphemous as the last jedi the inclusion of palpatine is this movies fatal flaw i understand that jj abrams was put into a seeiously tough spot both in story continuity and in satisfying the fans while still making a profitable movie it seems like one of the best moves he could have chosen   that being said the palpatine plot completely undercuts the sacrifice of darth vader and the climax of lukes journey in becoming a jedi worse yet palpatines survival is left to the viewers imagination as there is no explanation given a common trend in this movie   looking past this major disrespect to georges works what is done in this movie is done either well or fast enough that one does not have much time to ask why in the moment   this movie is a spectacle but reveals its flaws upon closer examination
Jan 8 2020,negative,retitle movie to star wars zoo
Jan 8 2020,neutral,the movie is fun so it works as a good entertainment  however the poor decisions of the script spoil the experience as a whole the producers should have continued the controversy but brave decisions from the previous film  in turn the plot twist is horrible
Jan 8 2020,positive,plenty of twists to plot you have to see it to believe it
Jan 8 2020,positive,the beginning of the movie seemed rushed but i liked where they took the story
Jan 8 2020,positive,great way to end the saga
Jan 8 2020,positive,loved the action visualsand it had a really good story and im not even a star wars fanatic
Jan 8 2020,positive,a good movie yesbut as a final moviei expected more
Jan 8 2020,negative,marginally better than last jedi great special effects and action sequences hobbled by a contrived disjointed sophomoric plot seriously this might have been written by two arguing eightyearolds so tedious that by the end i really didnt care who lived or died
Jan 8 2020,positive,great action scenes with a lot of loose ends tied up some of it is confusing and you must know the story line of the other 8 movies
Jan 8 2020,positive,it had many jaw dropping visuals with amazing shots and landscapes but after that it was mostly bland thats not saying all parts were bad but were just bland it also doesnt explain a lot that it really should have i wish it would have been longer so it could have explained itself and maybe would have had time to redeem itself
Jan 8 2020,positive,almost perfect ending to a fairytale saga
Jan 8 2020,positive,fun movie and a worthy conclusion to the story
Jan 8 2020,positive,it was good and worth seeing it for a second time the story did seem to be rushed and left some opening for series expansion
Jan 8 2020,positive,i still remember seeing a new hope in the theater way back in 1977 as a 4 year old it completely captivated me and introduced me to wondrous worlds and amazing characters over the years i have proceeded to see every star wars release in the theaters  while i enjoyed some more than others i always loved the experience of being taken back to these worlds and getting reaquainted with the characters perhaps the best compliment i can give this film is it brought all these wonderful memories back to me and allowed me to spend a few hours catching up with some of my oldest friends for that i am grateful
Jan 8 2020,positive,a fitting conclusion to the star wars saga rise of the skywalker is definitely worth watching although the story is not one of the best the amazing battle scenes and the constantly mentioned connections to the previous star wars movies are enough to keep the viewers interested this movie also provides all the answers to the baffling mysteries of the last two movies so thats great too there were moments when i was disappointed with the newly begun movies but i think ill miss rey and her adventures
Jan 8 2020,positive,i dont know why people are complaining about this film  movie was great
Jan 8 2020,positive,im just a star wars geek in general so  there really wasnt anything i disliked about the movie but lots of things i did like
Jan 8 2020,positive,great final chapter to an epic story a genuine and meaning  interplay with the older and younger generation of rebel freedom fighters poetic ending where the actors playing luke skywalker princess leia hans solo and lando calrissian all make final appearances it makes me want to revisit the entire series
Jan 8 2020,negative,wouldnt see it again thats for sure not even if it was free
Jan 8 2020,positive,it was ok not the best but ok the actors dont have the same energy the old characters have
Jan 8 2020,positive,excellent sfx and cinematography huge show for eyes
Jan 8 2020,negative,the rise of skywalker while ending the saga well delivers a mediocre film that seems like a worse combination of return of the jedi and avengers endgame despite its flaws however it it is still entertaining bad film but at least enjoyable
Jan 8 2020,positive,much better than what critics have you believe i was in tears in the last scene similar to one when luke sees the two suns one cannot but transport back to the first star wars brilliant closure amazing cinematography and solid acting much watch
Jan 8 2020,neutral,watching this was like getting spit in the face by a hot super model your ok with it only bc she so hot 
Jan 8 2020,neutral,for once i agree with the critics the story is weak and the jedis abilities are really inconsistent
Jan 8 2020,negative,the movie dragged on and on with many unnecessary scenes and new characters
Jan 8 2020,positive,great movie lots of fun
Jan 8 2020,positive,high energy and very entertaining
Jan 8 2020,positive,perfect ending to the saga im not a line up to watch star wars kinda person but if i wouldve been for this movie they pulled out all the stops for this one
Jan 8 2020,positive,very good movie the movie didnt flow easy for me loved the ending 
Jan 8 2020,negative,the second worst movie of the saga
Jan 8 2020,neutral,as a huge star wars fan i was looking forward to this movie in a big way  there was so much potential for a great film but it wasnt it wasnt even mediocre  in fact it was one of the most frustrating films i have ever seen because its recent predecessors were all incredible the force awakens was possibly one of my most unforgettable cinema experiences  a new story interesting characters that linked with the old   rise of skywalker however is a messy journey where too much is unexplained and convenient accidents lead to unconvincing finds  a needle in a haystack just happens to appear when it is most wanted fin has something to tell but we never find out what it was  the whole way through the film we are wondering but we never find out  yet we are left with a cheesy unsatisfying lazy conclusion after endless unrealistic cgi flight battles and explosions   what happened to the slick genuineness of the sets from force awakens this is why it feels lazy and rushed  i only gave it 25 because i am such a fan of the product but really it is worth less sadly  even the actors originally so fresh and passionate were unconvincing and looked as though they did not believe that the force could hold itself together any longer
Jan 8 2020,negative,contrived and nonsensical plot bland characters and mind numbing emotional scenes riding on the coattails of the original trilogy all plastic wrapped with out of touch fanservice that is shoved down the viewers throats
Jan 8 2020,positive,the final chapter of star wars was a very good watch the graphics were excellent the storyline was excellent there was exactly the right amount of action none of the 30 minute fight scene movie fillers  the heroes were believable and well acted    definitely see this one
Jan 8 2020,positive,lots of action and a good story
Jan 8 2020,positive,epic full of action from start to finish
Jan 8 2020,negative,better than 8 but still horrible
Jan 8 2020,positive,amazing end to this trilogy of movies
Jan 8 2020,negative,even before it is a bad star wars movie its just a bad movie worthy conclusion of an unworthy trilogy that in three films has limited itself to copying even in an objectively ugly way what is beautiful in the original saga the direction is bad the editing is even worse inconclusive and not received character thickness adam driver is the only positive note cgi in some moments definitely not up to par there are some beautiful settings
Jan 8 2020,positive,great special effects
Jan 8 2020,negative,this episode could have been amazing  kylo ren skywalker on the dark side willing to return to light  rey x palpatine in the light but tempted by the dark side  they are in love  but instead of focusing the whole story on this the scenario tells a story destroying any kind of poetry and mystery and filled with inconsistencies  if you have expectations on star wars you should not go if you are just looking for a big show with special effects you will have fun  may the force rest in peace 
Jan 8 2020,positive,i loved it its rare for star wars to throw you a curve ball and keep you guessing i cried twice  ive never cried at star wars except for when han died but awesome all the way
Jan 8 2020,positive,the storyline is confusing and unnecessary at times some points were so obvious it was like they asked a 9 year old where they should go with the direction of the film the film score is great as always though and the star wars aesthetic is enough to get at least a couple stars id recommend seeing it if you saw the recent films
Jan 8 2020,positive,it was a great story to the saga lots of action and it even made me laugh some
Jan 8 2020,negative,im just glad this trilogy is over
Jan 8 2020,negative,awful trash at least we have the original trilogy
Jan 8 2020,positive,rise of skywalker rounds off the series thrusting nostalgia at you and desperate to remind you of fonder times its not the perfect sendoff but its still blockbuster fun doesnt quite reach for the stars enough
Jan 8 2020,neutral,as a star wars fan i have a few problems with it all together as a movie man its a movie i enjoyed but not one to sit down and watch over and over again some scenes were very cringy and some scenes felt way to forced
Jan 8 2020,positive,the writers tried their best to correct things from tlj in the first half of the movie and for the most part they did a good job some parts are not explained well and can seem a bit rushed the second half is great and overall it was entertaining and im glad they ended it this way
Jan 8 2020,positive,it was an amazing movie everything is explained in the movie and people should really give this movie a chance
Jan 8 2020,negative,unacceptable biggest cinematic fuck up five minutes was all disney needed to truly bury this franchise and it was the last few scenes of this film
Jan 8 2020,positive,devastated its all over
Jan 8 2020,positive,mediocre desperately tried to appease fans with yet another illogical script with way too much packed in
Jan 8 2020,positive,long movie but lots of action it ties up the series well i think
Jan 8 2020,negative,a runaway train wreck in a blinding strobe flash 7 hours and 10 minutes ends in a blinding brilliant disaster the worst crime of this movie is the tepid and utterly forgettable soundtrack by the incomparable john williams 2 hours of recycled themes that only remind you of better moments of more compelling storylines characters before the dark times before the empire
Jan 8 2020,positive,very dense with story but a very satisfying conclusion felt like star wars again after the bizarre revisionism of the last jedi id rank it up there with return of the jedi tied for third place after a new hope and the empire strikes back some breathtaking set pieces and rey and kylos development were truly satisfying in this one
Jan 8 2020,negative,they close door on me
Jan 8 2020,negative,the fall of skywalker is a horrendous end to a legacy
Jan 8 2020,negative,after setting the stage with a charismatic young cast and a thoroughly exciting and entertaining actionadventure film with the force awakens jj abrams fumbles the conclusion to the trilogy with a jumbled sloppy mess of a movie in the rise of skywalker  lacking any real heart or substance this one is primarily for the fans who only care to see people wacking each other repeatedly with laser swords
Jan 8 2020,negative,lots of unanswered questions that left the franchise off worse than it started quality action throughout the film but very frustrating to see so many things done wrong
Jan 8 2020,positive,i absolutely loved seeing the last of the star wars movies in 4dx there are a lot of flashes of lightning flying around and water scenes so this experience definitely made you feel like you were right there with the characters  my cousin also loved it and if it is offered again i would like to take my dad who is also a huge star wars fan
Jan 8 2020,negative,some entertaining scenes but the story is all over the place second half of the movie is pure fan service
Jan 8 2020,negative,deserves the tomato bring a bunch
Jan 8 2020,negative,unfortunately this movie is a complete miss only fan service makes its score for fans so high
Jan 8 2020,positive,dragged out a lil too much and a bit too much drama but otherwise had some really good parts to it a must see for the end of the trilogy
Jan 8 2020,positive,absolutely loved this movie
Jan 8 2020,positive,great ending to the saga
Jan 8 2020,positive,i absolutely loved it cant get any better especially the ending im ready for another one
Jan 8 2020,positive,fitting ending to the series it ended each of the characters stories in a respectful way it have been a fun journey all these years and this was a great tribute to the saga
Jan 8 2020,positive,if you like star wars youll like this movie next to yoda rae is the best character in the whole canon and her relationship with kylo ren is interesting
Jan 8 2020,negative,crap ending to a crap trilogy  i cant believe i now view the prequels as good movies  bring back george lucas
Jan 8 2020,negative,poor character development has plagued this entire series and this movie was no exception nearly every major crisis was solved by deus ex machina the only interesting conflict was resolved tidily by killing off the character that left no lasting conflict through an impossible resurrection i could see the ultimate crisis and denouement coming from about 13 of the way in the most exciting portion of the movie was the score
Jan 8 2020,negative,star wars the rise of skywalker was an absolute mess this was supposed to be the star wars movie that wrapped everything up with a nice big bow it was supposed to be the film that answered all if not most of the unanswered questions that we had since the force awakens and especially the last jedi but on the absolute contrary it left us with even more questions questions that cant easily be answered furthermore the film was just piled with this and that and this and that that it was very difficult to actually feel any sort of emotion when it came down to the emotional sequences and if it did the film was extremely good at giving us merely 2 and half seconds to feel it and then boom it would hit us with something else that would require the audience to feel an entirely different emotion and at some points i just wanted to tell the movie to wait because of how fast it was going past every scene however the action sequences were good but there couldve been a lot more by this i mean a lot more lightsaber duels they really missed it on that part and it is unfortunate the rise of skywalker is the movie that is supposed to wrap up the skywalker saga and that it did with an atrocious wrapping job and a halfassed bow on the top
Jan 8 2020,positive,its star wars awesome
Jan 8 2020,negative,with a lack of vision and guidance the finale of the star wars sequel trilogy ends on a whimpering thud wasting all the great performances and character potential on a confusing and convoluted story that is all over the place yet went absolutely nowhere
Jan 8 2020,positive,kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time sad ending  but thats just my opinion
Jan 8 2020,negative,so much going on so little substance the story adds nothing to the star wars universe than cashing in on nostalgia and fan service even the widelyhated the last jedi broke more ground was more worth watching tros is just a bog standard blockbuster
Jan 8 2020,negative,i have been a huge fan of star wars all of my life and i am completely disappointed with what disney has done to it i watched ros and almost cried with anger at the end the plot sucked the characters suck the writers should be beheaded for their blasphemy
Jan 8 2020,positive,incredible everything as usual why was i crying my eyes out at star wars i loved it
Jan 8 2020,positive,i enjoyed the film and the complete overlook of the series
Jan 8 2020,negative,the whole movie was written and ran like a poorly concocted dd campaign i love star wars but that film was a travesty
Jan 8 2020,positive,what i love about the movie ren skywacker
Jan 8 2020,positive,go with modest expectations and accept a crazy number of plot conveniences and then youll enjoy this movie quite a lot thanks jj abrams and team this was so much better than i ever expected it could be
Jan 8 2020,positive,i loved this movie the finale was great because it worked on both a conceptual level and also used the characters kylo and rey quite well  the biggest problem for me is the use of emperor palpatine which wasnt handled properly in episode  7 and 8 and thus came out of the blue in 9 overall though i thought it was a great move
Jan 8 2020,positive,its a bittersweet moment for me to finally see this storyline come to a end growing up watching the original trilogy all in all happy with the outcome and def give it 5 stars
Jan 8 2020,negative,as a lifelong star wars fan its heartbreaking to see a group of creative people that have such a poor grasp of the source material felt like imposter star wars
Jan 8 2020,positive,classic jj abrams actionpack moviebut the heart and soul of star wars seemed to have lost its way in this final episode i wanted to feel the struggle between the good and dark sides of the force as in the first 3 original episodesbut it just wasnt there even the light saber duels seemed too choreographed and soulless
Jan 8 2020,positive,movie was great i enjoyed it from start to finish the pacing was good it had a lot of action i couldnt find anything bad with this movie i might watch it a second time
Jan 8 2020,positive,i felt they ended the series well but left enough to make more in different directions
Jan 8 2020,positive,my favorite scene was actually chewbacca grieving  very touching
Jan 8 2020,positive,it was an excellent movie
Jan 8 2020,negative,not impressive boring at times a fitting end to a trilogy doomed to fail from the start 
Jan 8 2020,positive,the last jedi was a spit in the face to all of us star wars fans the rise of skywalker cleans our face from that spit and gives us a kiss on the cheek by retconning some of the major insults done by the last jedi   while its a satisfactory field to watch it sadly had to spend a bit of its running time trying to fix the errors of the previous movie the movie is action packed it will fly by you if you blink it certainly could have used some slow scenes perhaps it should have been split into 2 parts  the movie feels like star wars the ending could have been handled a little better and while it doesnt add anything particularly new it sure doesnt feel as recycled as the force awakens  overall a good movie by far the best of the sequel trilogy but sadly a shadow of what the grandeur of original and prequel trilogies
Jan 8 2020,positive,i liked multiple individual sections but it didnt seem to work as well as a whole movie or trilogy
Jan 8 2020,negative,complete cluster a middle finger to tlj plot holes as big as the death star maguffins galore some cool visuals and new force moves made it bearable zero stakes a bummer of a way to end the saga
Jan 8 2020,positive,it was a great movie
Jan 8 2020,neutral,i watched this twice because i had to see it in both dolby and imax with the new laser projection the latter was better visually with the exception of those moments where 3d appears to be a total afterthought rogue one remains the only film since return of the jedi to offer an enjoyable story so very glad that my drive to see anything else star wars has concluded with this trilogy
Jan 8 2020,positive,a lot to hate about it but it was a very star warsy star wars movie i liked it
Jan 8 2020,positive,loved everything about it
Jan 8 2020,positive,42 years later and after seeing the original star wars in 1977 15 times i might add  i consider this to be a satisfying finish to complete the star wars saga  dont believe the dissatisfied reviews  another job well done by jj abrams  we absolutely loved it
Jan 8 2020,positive,i think it was a great movie given what jj has to work with
Jan 8 2020,positive,it was a great movie that incorporated characters from the previous star wars movies very well
Jan 8 2020,positive,i love the storyline and the effects were as great as always i thought it was a perfect ending to the series and highly recommend seeing it
Jan 8 2020,positive,new character development was very well done  the movie did not require watching any of the others to understand what was going on  still have a lot of questions but that is what makes it an epic story
Jan 8 2020,positive,i enjoyed it but with an asterisk  rian johnsons star wars the last jedi 2017 is a mess at both a structural and thematic level it spends 40 minutes on a sidequest that has nothing to do with the rest of the film holdo laura dern withholding her plan from poe oscar isaac makes no sense luke mark hamill throws away his lightsaber to hell with that scene hux domhnall gleeson becomes comic relief there are resurrected flying space jedi and so we have rise of skywalker which is a course correction if not a flatout apology and although i certainly enjoyed it as a spectacle its a deeply flawed film that feels like it was created by a computer algorithm designed to tick as many boxes as possible  the opening crawl reveals that emperor palpatine ian mcdiarmid has returned and has been manipulating events from behindthescenes for years as the film begins kylo ren adam driver is making his way to palpatines base seeing palpatine as a threat to his leadership of the first order ren is planning to kill him however rather than doing so he watches in awe as palpatine reveals a massive armada of hundreds of fearsomely powerful xystonclass star destroyers and so the resistance set out to confront and defeat him  directed by force awakens director jj abrams with a script by abrams and chris terrio the biggest problem with rise is that at no point does it feel like the culmination of a ninefilm arc not only is there a disconnect between the three films in this trilogy but theres a disconnect between this trilogy and the previous two with the trilogy never really feeling like a valid continuation of the story at best it feels like a spinoff with thematic connections and recurring characters occasionally shoehorned in to try to establish narrative continuity  of course a big question is whether or not disney had a specific narrative plan going into this thing with many arguing that the lack of coherence between the three films proves they did not especially important here is the return of palpatine which has been accused of being completely arbitrary i can certainly sympathise with those sentiments and i agree that his return negates vaders sacrifice at the end of return of the jed 1983 however there were hints in force awakens that there was a hidden big bad and that that big bad was palpatine although to explain any more would constitute spoilers for rise  there are also smaller issues with the film for example it treats death less than reverentially with multiple characters dying only to return in some form or another which cheapens and undermines the sense of risk the quartet of main characters also remain as insipid as ever  rey is still a reluctant jedi trying finn john boyega is still a token good guy who used to be bad poe is still han sololite ren is still a moody emo the biggest problem is that the film is built around the resistance trying to get to palpatines base to do so they need a wayfinder but to get that they need this other thing but to find that they need to go here but to do that they need a doohickey but to get that they have toyou get the picture  for all that however i enjoyed rise for the most part abrams and cinematographer dan mindel shoot the scenes in palpatines lair like its a horror movie  deep chiaroscuro shadows ominous caverns disappearing in the background unnaturally powerful lightening flashing from above equally important here is david accords sound design which features a constant chatter of unearthly and disembodied voices like a thousand ghosts whispering at once   the scenes showing rey and ren speaking via force dyad are also excellent as we see the background of one characters location appearing behind the other character with the backgrounds shifting from one to the other as the scenes play out a lightsaber fight makes particularly good use of this with events in one location having an unexpected effect on events in the other  so all things considered i enjoyed the rise of skywalker and found it a vast improvement over last jedi however having said that it never touches greatness with everything feeling workshopped and focusgrouped to within an inch of its life it looks great and its both exciting and entertaining but its also safe and predictable and sure you might say that fans rejected last jedi because it took too many risks and now they reject rise because it doesnt take enough and theres probably some truth to that but the fact is that it just never feels like a closing chapter i enjoyed it whilst i was watching it and its a decent enough star wars movie with some terrific individual scenes but as the final entry of a 42yearold franchise the most popular franchise in any medium in human history it is perhaps inevitably a little disappointing
Jan 8 2020,positive,i loved the movie especially watching it in 3d i loved the way it closed out the star wars story and i am hoping to see rey finn and poe continue
Jan 8 2020,positive,rey develops her newly discovered abilities with the guidance of luke skywalker who is unsettled by the strength of her powers meanwhile the resistance prepares for battle with the first order  i will admit i am wired with a with the sense of melancholy sensibilities i lost track of how many times i wiped a tear while watching rian johnsons film but im sure i also laughed hard just as many times if not more it is in general mindblowing it is emotional and it is filled with surprises the last jedi really manages to keep the star wars spirit while being innovative on many fronts nothing can prepare you for the emotional ride it takes you on its a truly epic journey  star wars episode viii had some amazing set pieces wonderful cinematography and special effects the 3d presentation added to the film the fabulous film score from the greatest film composers of all time john williams as splendid  the acting from mark hamill and carrie fisher are sublime tapping into my sense of nostalgia for star wars saga daisy ridley as rey tremendous johnson eloquently deepens his characters in the story long long ago in the galaxy far far away adam driver is welcome strength returning as the dark side forces kylo ren the other narrative threads are often perfunctory in the subplot with resistance fighters finn played by solid john boyega poe dameron played by intrepid oscar isaac and rose played by stellar newcomer kelly marie tran and how doest like benicio del toro  fantastic   the last jedi is clever welltailored and genuine heroes and villains and those who are somewhere in between rian johnson created a beautiful tale a filmed it with stylistic brilliance and terrific pacing from the excellent cinematography snappy dialogues and first rate music the last jedi makes you feel overwhelmed and fills you with odd admiration for the story that is being conveyed 910  director rian johnson genres action adventure scifi fantasy rating pg13 runtime 152 min  starring adam driver andy serkis anthony daniels benicio del toro billie lourd carrie fisher daisy ridley domhnall gleeson gwendoline christie john boyega joseph gordonlevitt laura dern lupita nyongo mark hamill oscar isaac tom hardy
Jan 8 2020,positive,was thrilled with the action sequences great cast not great storytelling not too thrilled how it ended either some stuff felt forced in order for jj abrams to coursecorrect still good enough to watch it in the theater though
Jan 8 2020,negative,bringing back the emperor destroyed the original trilogy and adds nothing to the disney trilogy  the new force powers cheapen everything about the prior trilogys and show how laziness has replaced good story tellingly lucas films  i tried to like the new trilogy from day one but have been disappointed at every turn  i wish i could wash it out of my consciousness and forget what ive seen   alas star wars has become a thing of childhood and as an adult you mast put away childish thing  on a side note why the emperor why didnt snooke reveal to ren that he foresaw his betrayal and substituted a clone and further reveal himself as darth plaugus instead of ruining the original trilogy  i wouldnt hire writer so inept again if i wanted to make a good movie  just a thought
Jan 8 2020,positive,it wasnt good it wasnt bad no real plot it is what i guess   there was enough of the original characters to keep you interested   it was too long there were a couple times i thought it was ending but it kept going   i went to see it  after the hype and with low expectations and i found it entertaining enough   im glad to see this trilogy and characters come to an end
Jan 8 2020,positive,the non stop action was fantastic great movie all around never a lull
Jan 8 2020,positive,it was good to see poe rey and finn back together again but they spent a little to much time bantering and not enough strengthening their friendship dialogue was pretty good and i liked the various arcs going on however those arcs felt too rushed because the movie had too much crammed in   material that should have been in episode 8 this leaves the feeling of oh this movie has so much more potential   this sequel trilogy should have been better planned and layed out however on the grand scale of ten movies  1  being best   id say this is number 4 or 5
Jan 8 2020,positive,last jedi sucked this is an improvement
Jan 8 2020,negative,meaningless ending of a nonsense trilogy the only goal to destroy heroes of the past and destroy a story of the most popular movie series of all time all episodes ivvi are pointless now same turd as terminator dark fate
Jan 8 2020,positive,loved it  rey is amazing as the hero
Jan 8 2020,negative,disney has now officially killed star wars rip
Jan 8 2020,positive,everything was great
Jan 8 2020,positive,if you didnt like the last jedi you might like this movie  it tries to explain why rey is a super forceuser why luke was acting like a grumpy hermit on the island and why the holdo maneuver doesnt defy the physics of a galaxy far far away  it brings rey chewie finn and poe together instead of keeping them apart like they did for the first two movies  poe and finn have good chemistry together in a bromance type of way  reylo fans will like parts of the movie and absolutely hate other parts  if you are a rose fanwell there isnt much for you in this movie  the film is super fast paced and half the time i wasnt sure where they were and what was going on but it wasnt boring  lando looks great and they did a good job putting the late carrie fisher into the movie  i can understand why some fans see this movie over and over  it was like two movies worth of scenes shoved into one movie  it is a lot to take in overall it is my favorite of the sequel trilogy
Jan 8 2020,positive,amazing  worth seeing in the theatre
Jan 8 2020,positive,repeats itself yes not making drastic changes to the universe yes but what can i say i enjoyed it and thats enough i wasnt expecting to see a life changing movie overall good movie if you dont have high expectations
Jan 8 2020,neutral,meh spent the first half of the movie fixing the mistakes from tlj and as a result felt rushed
Jan 8 2020,positive,was pretty dedicated to the star wars  ideals but there was a couple of things that disappointed mewhich unfortunately i cant say without posting mega spoilers so im going cryptic on thissomeone shouldnt have died and even if though they didat least have the decency of honoring them at the end
Jan 8 2020,neutral,typically disney movie  the franchise was destroyed the moment disney bought it  oh to be 12 years old and view star wars fresh again but its 2020 not 1977
Jan 8 2020,positive,special effects were incredible  storyline was good but slightly predictable at points along the way  overall worth seeing
Jan 8 2020,negative,aside from looking the part this is devoid of everything that makes star wars great
Jan 8 2020,positive,i liked how they brought it full circle
Jan 8 2020,positive,another star wars movie entertaining but not great for the last one of the saga
Jan 8 2020,positive,it stayed to the whole saga
Jan 8 2020,positive,loved it for the most part
Jan 8 2020,positive,loved this movie  as last one it completed the circle of stories and was great to see the characters from the past appear in this last movie all the good stuff was there the strengths of the characters their loves determination humor and music
Jan 8 2020,positive,i grew up with this sagaan amazing end to an incredible journey
Jan 8 2020,positive,huge star wars fan lived up to the expectations
Jan 8 2020,positive,excellent very entertaining and the special affects were fantastic
Jan 8 2020,positive,i thought they did a really good job of wrapping up the saga  there are some parts that were not my favorite for the saga  i really like how they finish the movie
Jan 8 2020,positive,loved it jj wrote this just for me
Jan 8 2020,positive,did not enjoy how it was wrapped up why not just call it return of the jedi 2
Jan 8 2020,negative,rough ending and sporadically pulled together but at least its over
Jan 8 2020,positive,great way to end the saga
Jan 8 2020,positive,extremely exciting perfect end to the trilogy and the saga as a whole especially for newer fans
Jan 8 2020,positive,nice twists would have liked ben to survive though
Jan 8 2020,negative,more of the same and not in a good way n no imagination nothing different its as if they wanted to just play it safe such a shame considering the talent level of the cast
Jan 8 2020,positive,very good end to the franchise dont believe the bad reviews some just love to hate
Jan 8 2020,positive,very well done film  it should stand up well among the other star wars movies in the series overall the story didnt end all story lines for all major characters  some were openended    it was nice to see all the major characters worked into the final story of the series  luke leia han solo  landau  would have been good to see yoda obiwan and vader   it was weird for rey to end up on lukes home world  and claim his familiy name   i love the movie
Jan 8 2020,positive,just a few problems but best of the last three
Jan 8 2020,negative,worst from the new trilogy didnt care about what was happening or why it happened just stick with the originals
Jan 8 2020,positive,so much to wrap up  im going to have to see it again  it was star wars  how could you not see it 
Jan 8 2020,positive,awesome from the starthad to use the bathroom halfway thru but held it cause i wasnt going anywhere jj abrams is a geniusgeorge lucas thank you for star wars
Jan 8 2020,positive,familiar faces come back some classic faces also   a few faces are lost    all in all nicely dramatic cohesive story stellar special effects and what most fans wantedclosure at the end
Jan 8 2020,negative,even with the extremely low bar that tlj set ros still somehow managed to limbo right underneath it contrived aimless and plot holes galore a fitting end to a forgettable poorly constructed trilogy
Jan 8 2020,positive,not the best of the 9 movies but not the worst either
Jan 8 2020,positive,the rise of skywalker was a phenomenal end to what is arguably the greatest scifi saga in existence at this time while the story does jump around and moves quite quickly it sets itself up very well to wrap up the saga the acting is quality regrettably it is evident that the late carrie fisher has been created through technology and it is a fitting tribute to general organa han solo and luke and the skywalker story while i do not think we will see another skywalker on this level i do feel that their story has been told to completion a mustsee for sure
Jan 8 2020,positive,there wont be any more
Jan 8 2020,positive,great end to the saga
Jan 8 2020,positive,it was very emotional at times
Jan 8 2020,positive,the end of a great saga
Jan 8 2020,negative,its a watchable nonsensical trainwreck of a movie that tries to undo the damage of last jedi but in doing so crams giant plot twists in a span of minutes some of the scenes and settings look cool but its marred by a needlessly bloated plot that has the cast zipping across the galaxy chasing mcguffins adam drivers acting is topnotch but its not enough to forcerevive this meandering mess
Jan 8 2020,positive,this was a wonderful way to end the series of films questions were answered we were able to reunite with old friends and revisit familiar lands there were tears and laughter moments of despair and delight an abundance of the force the honor of sacrifice and bonds of love rey was phenomenal
Jan 8 2020,negative,terrible worst star wars movie ever placating to nostalgia jumping from scene to scene without a tangible story or related foreshadowing and extremely predictable ending meant for the simplest of the masses
Jan 8 2020,positive,its my favorite out of the last three star wars films good ending to the trilogy
Jan 8 2020,positive,enjoyed it  it was more like the first ones
Jan 8 2020,positive,the ending with a twist  the movie was great
Jan 8 2020,negative,a completely baffling cobbled together highlight reel of a firstdraft script after being brutally hacked to death in the editing room and fed through a series of corporate boardroom filters utterly devoid of genuine creative inspiration or coherent thematic throughline let alone of basic narrative construction or pacing
Jan 8 2020,positive,good effects and good story too
Jan 8 2020,positive,tied up the 9 story arc nicely fantastic action
Jan 8 2020,negative,this just really really sucked
Jan 8 2020,positive,ridleys performance is so good it tacks on a star on its own shes a force to be reckoned with pun and i had the feels several times through it yes it could have been better in a bunch of ways but i was satisfied
Jan 8 2020,negative,there were plot holes big enough to make me think it was a black hole then again after 10 movies you would think they would know how to write a script but no they still dont
Jan 8 2020,positive,this movie was done very good hope there will be another one
Jan 8 2020,positive,jj abrams did much better in this film than rian johnson did in the last jedi the rise of skywalker really felt like you were watching a true star wars movie
Jan 8 2020,positive,this was a  first rate movie  anybody who didnt like it is being picky
Jan 8 2020,positive,good conclusion to many questions  brought up a few more questions
Jan 8 2020,positive,so awesome was on the edge of my seat the whole time saw it in 3d imax quite a special experience
Jan 8 2020,positive,this was the culmination of one of the best stories ever told well made and well played by all  wonderful final to a series that has changed my life for over 40 years
Jan 8 2020,neutral,decent movie overall the pacing just felt off almost like they cut important parts out of the movie lol
Jan 8 2020,positive,i wasnt disappointed
Jan 8 2020,positive,could of went on long into more detail
Jan 8 2020,positive,what a beautiful mess the film was beautifully made and the effects are fantastic whats not so great is the film felt like it was in ten different places at one time the actors were great and it was nice to see some of the old faces come back for cameos there was a lot of emotion in the acting and daisey ridley was superb  the worst part of the movie was the editing i felt like i was on a barrel ride and i couldnt get off i expected more from jj abrams but i will say the ending was perfect grab your popcorn but dont expect the empire strikes back which is still the best of them all
Jan 8 2020,positive,awesome fast paced story with the perfect ending
Jan 8 2020,positive,yes it was fast paced and there was lots of fan service but i loved it i think it was very well done and a great close out of the trilogy and the skywalker saga as a whole
Jan 8 2020,positive,it was a little painful to see the old characters die out in the last couple of movies but the new characters hold promise  there was lots of action and the usual great special effects  long live palpatine or is that skywalker
Jan 8 2020,positive,everything weve been waiting to see ticked all the boxes for a classic star wars adventure and then some loved it
Jan 8 2020,positive,being a younger generation 24 star wars fan i really enjoyed this movie not my favorite but pretty dang close it ended very well i thought
Jan 8 2020,positive,fixes everything the last movie did wrong
Jan 8 2020,negative,plot best described as stupid
Jan 8 2020,positive,a vast engaging conclusion to not just the sequel trilogy but the skywalker saga itself tros blends the perfect amount of  riproaring adventure character building and even nostalgia to weave a compellingly brisk film with action emotion and intrigue cant wait to see it again
Jan 8 2020,positive,better than empire tlj sucks jj saved the saga rip poggers roflcopter
Jan 8 2020,positive,great conclusion to a great frnchise
Jan 8 2020,positive,maybe its because i was expecting not to like it based on reviews but i actually enjoyed it dont over analyze it and just be entertained
Jan 8 2020,positive,it was okay  a lot of dead people rising again  many battles won with insurmountable odds     im glad to have it finished at last
Jan 8 2020,positive,what a beautifully done movie it tied everything up in a beautiful package i wanted to stay and watch it again a wonderful ending to a series of movies i have watched all my life
Jan 8 2020,positive,i enjoyed the movie im a die hard for the original series so i try not to compare too much the story was good and the cg wasnt too overwhelming but be prepared for a lot of flashing lights and fast camera action  my eyes were burning after the first 15 minutes  im always impressed with the creativity of all the different worlds and characters  all in all worth seeing whether youre a fan or not
Jan 8 2020,positive,considering the last two sucked great way of tying everything together and closing out the saga
Jan 8 2020,positive,everything you could want and then some
Jan 8 2020,positive,the movie was good and stayed true to the franchise but i felt it was somewhat of a confusing plot to follow the movie jumped around and was a little draggy in spots but all in all it kept the audiences interest and attention throughout the movie
Jan 8 2020,positive,people gave this movie bad reviews because they didnt understand all is it i think
Jan 8 2020,positive,such a great movie
Jan 8 2020,positive,not what i expected but a really good movie nonetheless  whole family loved it
Jan 8 2020,positive,fitting end of the saga
Jan 8 2020,positive,awesome movie  loved it
Jan 8 2020,positive,loved the movie but the end made it seem like theyre going to continue with reys story
Jan 8 2020,negative,to much like the first set of series i kept drifting off asleep movie couldnt hold my attention nothing new same old stuff was expecting something new boring
Jan 8 2020,positive,loved it but i am still a sw fan since 1976 good story good acting i likes that they cleared up the big mystery but left us hanging on one or two others
Jan 8 2020,positive,love star wars what can i say it is legendary movie already for many years was really enjoying to see another episode with my son recommend
Jan 8 2020,positive,this was one of the best and the action was nonstop from the beginning
Jan 8 2020,negative,wish the real version was out not frankenstein version we saw  disney completely destroyed the saga  somehow they managed to make something worse than the prequels
Jan 8 2020,positive,quite honestly its become my favorite star wars movie bumping rogue one into my number two spot
Jan 7 2020,positive,this movie was awesome cant wait for more from star wars
Jan 7 2020,positive,it was awesome these critics liked the last jedi and didnt like this one man critics these days are out of touch im going to see it twice in imax
Jan 7 2020,negative,what just happened is rey god yet
Jan 7 2020,positive,great movie shout out to adam driver semper fi brother
Jan 7 2020,positive,loved it hope to see a ben spinoff of some sort down the line as his scenes were by far the most compelling throughout the trilogy
Jan 7 2020,positive,loved everything about this movie
Jan 7 2020,neutral,the main problem with this film was trying to squeeze too much into one movie  it lessened any drama or thrills when the characters were pulled from one scene to the next with barely any pauses or interaction also all the changes made to how force powers worked from previous stories was pretty hard to swallow
Jan 7 2020,positive,this movie was better than the other two so far it was fun to watch should kilo have kissed rayi personally dont think so but hey its cool seeing new uses for the force yea it was really plot armor but force heal and animal friendship are rad jedi powers the fact that they brought back the emperor  off screen and killed him by making him shock himself again was something but still i had a fun time
Jan 7 2020,positive,as a long time fan of star wars this film is a mixed bag as a film on its own its still less approachable than the films prior as it spends a great deal of time trying to explain or rectify plot points from past films
Jan 7 2020,positive,it was a fitting conclusion i hated the prequels they made me grow up and move on from star wars these last 3 films were much better but still lacking the charm and magic of the original trilogy that being said i really enjoyed the cameos seeing the x wing rise from the sea and a lando piloting the falcon againi had some serious childhood flashback moments that made me happy cry was it perfect hell no  but out of the last 3 episodes it is my favorite
Jan 7 2020,positive,i thought it was a fun movie that the entire family would enjoy  a lot of action and great special affects  kept moving with some exciting moments  several very touching scenes  go see it
Jan 7 2020,negative,so boring its the same storyline they just changed the characters and names

Jan 7 2020,positive,it was ok but not like i thought
Jan 7 2020,positive,a very watchable mess of a movie not bad but not amazing either so many plot holes and unexplainable issues had some cool moments and looked nice on the plus side
Jan 7 2020,negative,the best of the worst saga ever  all the movie feels rushed terribly the actos are just chatting among them the obvious linear choices and they end up looking clueless and stupid there is no development of any of the characters total waist of talent of some actors and not even with all the easter eggs and the endless plot holes they tried to cover the story is empty and without flavor fights are terrible like little kids swinging sticks and no logic on any of the story better than the previous one but still very bad
Jan 7 2020,positive,good  movie expected more
Jan 7 2020,positive,the movie was fabulous seats were very comfortable  no one talked in fact i have seen the movie twice now
Jan 7 2020,positive,everything was awesome
Jan 7 2020,positive,checklist of things to finish ticked
Jan 7 2020,positive,fabulous to the end
Jan 7 2020,positive,this final segment of a 40 year saga was a good character driven movie  it finalized the story of the sith and the jedi  rather than the cgi and fx being the focus the story and the characters were the focus  i thought it was as good as the first three
Jan 7 2020,positive,we loved it it kept our attention the entire time and it was action packed
Jan 7 2020,positive,very entertaining  excellent film production  lets blow up some more battle cruisers  great effects  most storylines concluded well  however could it be i felt they left plenty of room for another sequel  oh yeah les i forget daisy jazz isobel ridley is sooooo hot

Jan 7 2020,positive,great closing to the skywalker rey trilogy few over zealous characters but overall great storyline
Jan 7 2020,positive,slow in the first half better in last half cant compare to the magic of the first 2 trilogies
Jan 7 2020,negative,the plot was very rushed and didnt make any sense there was a lack of emotion in the plot which was substituted for special effects
Jan 7 2020,positive,have seen this twice now in the theater and enjoyed it both times its fun exciting good humor c3po strikes again with several great lines lots of tieins and references to previous films and other star wars universe people and places etc does its best to fix the frustrations from episode 8 solid film all around
Jan 7 2020,negative,it has a hundred plot holes and a very messy script i thought that the last jedi was going to be the worst star wars movie of all times but this one is even worse it is nonsense after nonsense the disney trilogy murdered star wars
Jan 7 2020,negative,to be fair this film was doomed once the last jedi was made and it never had a chance but still it did not have to ruin anakins sacrifice and have the galactic civil war be for nothing c3po was great i guess
Jan 7 2020,neutral,dont start a trilogy without a plan
Jan 7 2020,positive,it was time to end the saga and it was put together well a little slow at times but overall a must see if you are a fan  a 1watch film for me but happy i watched it
Jan 7 2020,positive,its better than you think no thanks to the critics rt score
Jan 7 2020,positive,i sat down in the cinema feeling nostalgic prior to the start  thinking about me pleading with my father to go see star wars new hope in 1977 at the liverpool odeon london road i leaned over to my 9 year old feeling excited that we were both  going to be in for a movie of all movies sadly it was just okay  i mean kinda good but not great i fact very predictable and a lack of imagination from the writersdirectorproducers  in 77 i got scared and excited and first 5 minutes but unfortunately its started quite poor and the fighting scene with kylo in the woods fighting  against strange hessian sack covered beings that had the worst or lack of choreography the emperor should of been used a lot more and possibly not revealed  until about midway through the movie maybe looking into the sith societyfigures along the way kylo turn to the light much much too easy and early  han solo thirty second chat  wow a bit like when kylo  killed his dad oh oh err did i mention this movie should of been renamed the rise of deja vu servere lack of imagination  please dont make any more from a dissapointed lifelong fan
Jan 7 2020,positive,older movies were more exciting  but this one was great to see the actors from the first ones
Jan 7 2020,neutral,they seriously ruined this series  started great totally flopped on the second now this which fell flat  thanks for ruining star wars disney
Jan 7 2020,negative,a rushed and disjointed mess that spends the first 3rd doing its best to pretend tlj never happened and frustrate as few people in between  afraid to upset either side of this fandom they strike an unsatisfying and disappointing middle
Jan 7 2020,positive,standard star wars formula wrapped up the 9 film series perhaps too quickly but nicely
Jan 7 2020,positive,what the fuck is wrong with people this was a fun thrill ride and a great star wars filmthoroughly enjoyable
Jan 7 2020,positive,go with the audience score at times it moved a big fast but i really like the characters and the overall tone of the movie a fitting ending
Jan 7 2020,positive,loved it this was by far the best of the series you have to have seen all of them to understand also watch carefully because it can get confusing but overall it was so suspenseful
Jan 7 2020,negative,too complicated story line  characters with no personalities action pretty good but sound levels all over the board
Jan 7 2020,negative,star wars the fetch of the quest oof 
Jan 7 2020,negative,loved the new trilogy but the final film disappointed me felt like a forcefed fan service buffet that i didnt want
Jan 7 2020,positive,best star wars movie a little cringe was seen
Jan 7 2020,positive,wasnt a satisfying conclusion had good visuals though
Jan 7 2020,positive,i personally liked the way that they wrapped up this
Jan 7 2020,positive,worth watching the final movie in the skywalker saga action and laughs and an overall star wars adventure awaits
Jan 7 2020,positive,i loved this movie it was a great ending to the star wars story i took my son to the movies to watch the first one and l just enjoyed the last one with my 17 year old grandson they did a good job with the story and the acting was superb
Jan 7 2020,neutral,to many story lines not enough answers
Jan 7 2020,positive,im not into star wars honestly only went to watch it with my husband but this movie was really cool a lot of fun to watch
Jan 7 2020,positive,every detail will see it again
Jan 7 2020,negative,the movie is just not good forget trying to rate it as a star wars film but as a movie in general it is just bad it suffers mainly from some horribly frantic pacing in the first half to 23 through which leads to some very rushed and poor line delivery the lines come across as being read right off que cards rather than memorized and rehearsed the cuts from sequence to sequence make little sense and typically confuse the action and again we are plagued by underdeveloped characters that are supposed to add depth keri russell but really add nothing because they are in the movie for so short a time that they fail to be anchored properly to the rest of the story
Jan 7 2020,positive,i just recently watched the entire star wars series for the first time and this movie was soooo good so intense and full of emotion
Jan 7 2020,positive,my family and i loved it
Jan 7 2020,positive,overall this tied up the 9film saga well there were some missed opportunities some predictable scenarios and some cheesy lines but i was pleasantly surprised definitely worth catching before it leaves theaters
Jan 7 2020,positive,the story felt like it was lacking something
Jan 7 2020,positive,this was the best of the disney star wars  much more like the lucas style
Jan 7 2020,positive,all you haters are crazy jj nailed it
Jan 7 2020,neutral,honestly they could have done way better seemed rushed and left a lot of plot holes heard through the grapevine that jj abrams cut is way better than the final cut that disney wanted a lot of the things we ended up seeing in theaters sad if true honestly
Jan 7 2020,positive,too much fuss about the story  this is what movies were made to beenjoyable
Jan 7 2020,positive,action packed love star wars
Jan 7 2020,positive,im not a big star wars fan but i loved the movie
Jan 7 2020,positive,may not agree with everything they did to end the saga but this was a good movie especially at the end effects were good score was good acting was good and the movie spawned a lot of conversation with the family afterward as we all had differing opinions a movie you can debate in my mind is a good movie as the experience goes well beyond the rolling of the final credits
Jan 7 2020,negative,horrible way to shove it down my throat also no soul lifeless soulless
Jan 7 2020,positive,loved loved loved the movie great story if youre a star wars fan u wont be disappointed
Jan 7 2020,positive,was never going to please everyone i really liked it best of the new trilogy
Jan 7 2020,negative,too long too loud and repetitive  very strange and unsettling to see carrie
Jan 7 2020,negative,great performances but the plot was a complete mess
Jan 7 2020,positive,simply amazing i felt that each of the last star wars movies has been exceedingly better than the last very fun and entertaining such a great movie
Jan 7 2020,negative,a travesty of a movie thank god this saga is over
Jan 7 2020,positive,it was a movie that was fun to watch but nothing that special and defiantly isnt as good as it could have been
Jan 7 2020,positive,perhaps a bit too tied up with a bow at the end but definitely a wonderful journey and a fit ending to the series  the actors were superb in their roles a movie with heart and humor as well as excellent dramatic action must see
Jan 7 2020,positive,could ofshould of been better for what it was
Jan 7 2020,positive,much better than that first two in the series  it felt more fresh and original versus the other two which were just regurgitation of the earlier movies
Jan 7 2020,negative,such a disappointing ending to a series that helped redefine science fiction cinema this was purely a cash grab by disney and in trying to please everyone they pleased no one even though the last jedi was divisive at least it took chances with the story and an exciting opportunity for others to wield force powers instead of continuing that story they dropped almost everything from the last jedi as if it didnt exist this felt like a saturday morning cartoon that was trying too hard to please everyone and was just toying with our emotionsnostalgia and not explaining anything it just assumed the audience is stupid and wont question the script and goes along with whatever happens 
Jan 7 2020,negative,this movie is for simpletons thats it enough said if you can live with 2 plot holes per minute enjoy this movie but like episode 8 and 9 it has nothing to do with star wars like rian johnson jj abrams doesnt understand star wars space the force light sabres  its plain ridiculous how those 2 directors managed to drive a good franchise into the mud and beyond
Jan 7 2020,positive,was a bit disappointed i think 7 was the best of the last 3 8 sucked 9 tried to fix things but still felt liked it was just all crammed together
Jan 7 2020,positive,it was so filled with great actions from all of the actors  it really kept me alert
Jan 7 2020,positive,enjoyed it not perfect but it at least undid some of the crap they pulled in the previous ones the old characters that were brought back were enjoyable so were kylo and rey fin and po are just there but dont really add to the movie much  the movie was to fast paced would have been better if it was longer for me it receives a 5 just for undoing crap and not giving rose a bigger role
Jan 7 2020,positive,it was really good i thought that it was really superb i mean there were a couple plot holes which were not well explained but it was an extremely well done and emotionally riveting  it was just really good there were plot twist betrayals and amazing character development there were like 23 missed opportunities in my opinion but it was really great so yeah i would definitely recommend that yall see it
Jan 7 2020,positive,it was one of the best star wars films of alltime totally recommend going to see it best ending possible for the star wars saga
Jan 7 2020,positive,good action nice to see old characters liked it
Jan 7 2020,positive,dislike that it wasnt jj abrahms original cut
Jan 7 2020,positive,it was okmy wife and i saw the first one as friends the 2nd one as a married couple and this one we took our 14 month old little girl to seeshe was really behaved and wasnt scared of it
Jan 7 2020,negative,full of plot holes and nonsense completely destroyed george lucas saga
Jan 7 2020,positive,the rise of skywalker is satisfying conclusion to the skywalker saga even though some of it is rushed it is fun to see that kylo ren is a jedi again and to see that rey is a palpatien its a fun ride from start to end is an amazing movie and the hate that this movie gets unfair yes rian johnson messed up star wars but the episode fixed the series and to me is top 5 if i rank the star wars films
Jan 7 2020,positive,i enjoyed the rise of skywalker however i feel it was rushed too much crammed into two hours too many unanswered questions
Jan 7 2020,positive,i feel they did a great job of wrapping up the saga and answering some lingering questions the visuals were amazing and there are some treats for those of us who started watching the saga when it first came out in the 70s mt girlfriend really enjoyed it and she isnt into start wars whatsoever
Jan 7 2020,negative,to fast paced convenient plots lack in character development to the point you dont get invested in any of the characters i dont by raes struggles and see her grow into a jedi because every thing comes to easily i dont by any of the relationships between any of the characters its  a microwave relationship instant best friend instant love interest i couldnt by into it i had no suspension of disbelief i havent since they rebooted it its just gotten worse i dont like being negative unfortunately im not able to pretend this was worth my money or my time
Jan 7 2020,positive,it has a return if the jedi feeling to it  very good
Jan 7 2020,positive,whatever its fine didnt feel like the end of a 40 year saga though  guess disney is gonna milk this one forever
Jan 7 2020,negative,total waste of film stock  glad this series is over  sad that it tarnished the good work that came before it
Jan 7 2020,positive,it is amazing i recommend that people go see it multiple times in the theaters
Jan 7 2020,positive,i really really enjoyed it dont really care what other people think best one so far  not flawless but still very good i recommend watching it
Jan 7 2020,positive,i ranked it up there 2 just behind return of the jedi but the 3d was the best movie i have ever seen in it but it was great movie it was so much better the  last the last jedi
Jan 7 2020,neutral,too fastpaced to fully enjoy it does have a couple of good moments but in general the story feels nonsensical i miss the times when writing a good story took risks and not a ton of focus group studies
Jan 7 2020,negative,terrible suspect disney just wanted to get it out of the door
Jan 7 2020,positive,its a 6  7  10 imho basically its the return of the jedi redux with better acting and effects but a questionable storyline its worth seeing because its the end of the saga but it still falls short of the empire strikes back and rogue one
Jan 7 2020,positive,loved it some surprises here for sure sad this series has come to an end
Jan 7 2020,positive,it was a wonderful movie one of their best i think
Jan 7 2020,negative,the visuals and soundtrack were amazing but thats about it the rest of the movie was contrived and imbecilic but hey disney made their  so why should they care about the quality of their product as long as the masses keep gobbling up sugar coated turds they will be more than happy to keep taking massive dumps on the franchise for them
Jan 7 2020,positive,saw it twice thats how good it was
Jan 7 2020,positive,i liked the movie a lot
Jan 7 2020,positive,action was great fun
Jan 7 2020,positive,this was an action packed epic adventure with a good plot  good movie for all ages  would like to see it again
Jan 7 2020,positive,i loved it dont listen to the naysayers the events in the movie could come as a surprise but i really think it was the only way in the end im completely satisfied just sad its over
Jan 7 2020,negative,hard to stomach the story good acting and great special effects
Jan 7 2020,positive,it was wonderful having jj at the helm again felt like star wars had returned chewie were home
Jan 7 2020,negative,this was the director going down the list of the viewers unanswered questions while simultaneously filming a chase scene i found myself unable to care about the answers or anything else it didnt seem like the director cared either very disappointing
Jan 7 2020,negative,no plot weak acting an attempt at an emotional connection with past characters in a wellremembered classic a feeble attempt to waste 500 million dollars
Jan 7 2020,positive,great addition to the star wars series  pays homage to the past while focusing on the new characters and how they react and effect the overall story  movie works as part of the overall star wars story  it has everything you want lightsabers droids lasers force powers space ships and good vs evil  try not to analyze it too much  just enjoy it for what it is a great adventure  i know i did
Jan 7 2020,positive,another good star wars movie in the books
Jan 7 2020,positive,on a clinical level tros is not great the plot is convoluted the characters have little development and at times it seems to revel in spectacle for spectacles sake  on the other hand this is a movie where people have superpowers giant lasers and yet still fight with laser swords it is inherently ridiculous and i grade it using that curve i recommend this movie it moves quickly delivers sumptuous visuals too much if you are photosensitive and ties up enough loose ends that it is a fitting ending to a story that simply got too complex for its own good in summary buy a ticket and expect to be entertained but not much more
Jan 7 2020,negative,really terrible way to end the trilogy
Jan 7 2020,positive,maybe too fastpaced at the beginning but ultimately i got into the story  i thought it got better and better and yes i did love he ending
Jan 7 2020,negative,too much fan service with a lot of plot holes cinematography was excellent
Jan 7 2020,positive,lots of action and adventure  story unfolds right before your eyes and its plot wasa easy to follow  great use of old characters as well as new ones
Jan 7 2020,positive,good action and wonderful special effects as always what you expect from george lucas they left it open for the possibility of a sequelwhich isnt supposed to happen
Jan 7 2020,neutral,great special effects but formulaic and predictable story line just more of the same plot with different characters fun escape but thats all
Jan 7 2020,negative,tros simultaneously deepened the inevitable heart of the story and gutted it it gave the characters and audience long awaited payoff to immediately rip it away leaving both the film and viewer feeling hollow it turned a happy ever after into a tragedy a cautionary tale the pacing was terrible they lacked continuity with all previous films characters had retconned story arcs rey lost all of her agency and the script writer has literally said we havent seen the twins on tatooine before  as if hes never seen  return of the jedi  which explains a lot about the movie
Jan 7 2020,neutral,poorly paced and it seems reddit had more of a hand in writing the movie than chris terrio
Jan 7 2020,positive,great story  upbeat for once
Jan 7 2020,positive,it was more character than cgi effects driven it nicely closed the arc of the series it left me satisfied
Jan 7 2020,positive,a great movie theater experience ive enjoyed every star wars movie experience and this ones no exception it had thrills suspense moments of terror excitement and allaround fun loved it and have seen it several times with many more to come
Jan 7 2020,positive,it is one of the best in my thought
Jan 7 2020,negative,had its moments but was ultimately hamstringed by rian johnsons abysmal episode 8 heres hoping that the 190 minute jj cut is real and can redeem the finale of the skywalker saga
Jan 7 2020,negative,sux a bd remix of return of the jedi 
Jan 7 2020,positive,i didnt want it to end especially knowing this was the last in the series it was heart pounding and unbelievable jedi tricks as well as syth powers
Jan 7 2020,neutral,this movie need more time looks like 2 movies in 1 trying to fix the things in tljat least they try
Jan 7 2020,negative,a desperate scream to be accepted the film tries to meet all expectations without breaking any and in the end delivers a cowardly visionless and even meaningless movie
Jan 7 2020,negative,i mean it looked good for the most part it was such a mess of a plot that never slowed down to let you or the actors cath your breath im being generous with 15 stars that was so terrible but i blame rian johnson for this mess
Jan 7 2020,positive,i saw the first star wars movie when i was 12 and have been in love with all the characters ever since i am now 56 and this final chapter in the skywalker saga did not disappoint this life long fan saw it in 3d imax and i was blown away by the action and storyline this is definitely a see it on the big screen type of movie and is not to be missed
Jan 7 2020,negative,calling it garbage is unkind  to garbage those that tell me they like any of the movies in this last trilogy they can tell me they want to marry their sister or thier hero was hitler and they wouldnt have as bad a degrade in respect from me i will not give any money that can go to disney or star wars any more they have had my last dollar
Jan 7 2020,positive,such an amazing ending to the saga
Jan 7 2020,neutral,one wonders if the premise for this film was written by some halfwitted nerfherders with adhd after my incredulity of this silly premise wore off i found myself hoping there would be some twist in the story to make it not only believable but enjoyable but alas that was not written in these stars abrams filled it with so many shoot outs and action scenes to distract from its sagging storyline that i couldnt tell if i was watching a movie or a video game the pace was way too fast to be enjoyable hyperdrive is fun occasionally but not constantly the scenes that were meant to evoke emotion and serious contemplation were rushed and unconvincing   this film was like that meal you had been looking forward to but had to scarf down when an emergency crouches in on you you realize that you wont be able to enjoy it and will probably have heartburn afterward but there are more important things to attend to   i walked out of the theater thinking give me back the 2 and a half hours i just spent and i could have come up with a better story than this one
Jan 7 2020,positive,review star wars episode ixthe rise of skywalker  directed by jj abrams the concluding chapter of the skywalker saga is one not to be missed the film follows rey and finn as they along with chewbacca c3po r2d2 poe dameron and bb8 try to stop the first order from destroying what is left of the resistance rey must now use what she has learned from leia luke and han solo to help them along the way meanwhile they must battle their enemies including kyle ren all while the threat of an old enemy looms the story wraps everything up perfectly the acting performances especially those of daisy ridley john boyega oscar isaac adam driver anthony daniels billy dee williams mark hamill carrie fisher and ian mcdiarmid are perfect the score by john williams his final score for the franchise is one of the best of the year and of his career the visuals beautiful and breathtaking the action scenes are some of the best of the series and once again the year and abramss direction is flawless the idea that a fortytwo year story has now come to a close is mindboggling and this film does it better than i ever would have thought in all this is a perfect film that is sure to satisfy all those who have stuck with the franchise from the beginning as well as myself rating 1010
Jan 7 2020,negative,pretty much as expected for star wars i went with my teenage son who enjoyed it more than i but its a standard mishmash of ridiculous chases gaping plot holes time and logicdefying escapades grand melodrama and a ragtag bunch of rebels taking down an overwhelming force created by evil geniuses who happen to be incredibly stupid and slow to act meh its really starting to bother me how they humanize stormtroopers without helmets finn for instance and his new friends on yaks yet mercilessly slaughter thousands along the way that along the way with once again showing entire planets being destroyed without barely a notice and zero emotional impact i saw the original episode iv in first run and have seen them all out of a sense of completism but i pretty much regret having gone
Jan 7 2020,positive,i thought it was a fitting end to the saga great movie
Jan 7 2020,positive,loved it  critics are stupid
Jan 7 2020,positive,the best of the final three great human interaction and dialogue plus saber duels and aerial battles riveting and a stupendous conclusion to the star wars saga
Jan 7 2020,positive,weak story line and highly disappointed for what is supposedly the last star wars to be produced
Jan 7 2020,positive,it was very similar to how i felt of endgame but i liked it more it was a good end to the skywalker and made the characters less godlike jedis spend years working with there lightsabers and we see all that in this movie that comes true it is true to the lore and the previous movies a mustsee for all starwars fans
Jan 7 2020,positive,everything about it was great especially how they brought all the old characters back in some form or fashion
Jan 7 2020,positive,after what 42 years  the nine part series is over thank goodness no jarjar in this one a good movie i doubt anyone would be disappointed other than the fact that the series is over i think i need to see it again to catch all the details
Jan 7 2020,positive,honestly i thought it was a good end to the skywalker saga but also it doesnt feel like the end of reys story
Jan 7 2020,negative,i have no words for this although i do give props to the visuals and action sequence the plot is literally all over
Jan 7 2020,positive,good but not great kinda leaves a empty feeling inside you because it is the final star wars movie but without the prestige of ending a 11 movie journey the finale should have a special closing credts sequence giving credit to all the movies before it this or just ends absolutely nothing to stick around for that was very disappointing 
Jan 7 2020,positive,first off there is so many questions so many what the f moments that we will never get an answer to now that the skywalker saga is over anakin was my favorite character besides darth maul and it just seemed anakin was not really anybody special he wss supposed to be the chosen one anakin was supposed to bring balance to the force and honestly it seems as if his life didnt really matter much in the end  this movie tries to fix reys parents realize the prophecy explain palpatines voice from trailer explain the new enemy finalize rey and kylos story give new characters flesh out older characters undo the controversy from the past 2 movies well alot can be summed up by either not answering your questions or speed through stuff without explaining the plot  they added a new thing called hyper force jumping just jumping through hyper space over and over like 8 different places in 2 minutes and that was supposed to be the main journey and setup to this new found enemy this movie desperately needs another hour added to this just to explain the huh moments  these scenes goes by so quickly but other parts go on slow action scenes are over in minutes while talking scenes takes 10 or 15 minutes  the space battle if you can call it that is going on in the background you cant see whats going on i want to see the star wars space battle in star wars rose isnt even in the movie barely finn was setup to have something special with rose in previous movie but finn says like 2 lines to her amd seems to lust over rey  someone quoted this movie as a deeply horny movie for two and a half hours with almost every lead character having sexual tension with each other  there are so many questions how did palpatine come back no real answer whos rey parents hmm interesting but wtf how no explanation i dont understand what they are doing why wasnt hayden in the movie i wanted anakin in this film rise of skywalker anakin skywalker luke skywalker who was in this film named skywalker kylo ren no hes ben solo rey well last jedi said her parents were nobody so not there what the hell  there are so many plot holes i can name 10 at least but cant cause spoilers i just want a satisfactory ending to skywalker not make anakin feel like he was pointless not to raise questions about what i was watching good things good things funny smart ass remarks there were a few good jokes and come backs made by finn c3p0 and others that were laugh out loud funny the visuals are amazing which is to be expected by disney and star wars franchise the action when there was action was pretty cool leia was done well with dignity and respect however by trying to fix stuff from the last jedi there were more questions raised we didnt get answers to  this movie did feel like a star wars movie did this movie reach levels of revenge of the sith no but out of the new trilogy this movie is the best and it was very entertaining this movie is good but plot holes are what is holding this down i hated kylo ren in the last 2 movies but in this one hes one of my favorite characters now i wish this movie went a different direction this movie has actual lightsaber battles not as good as anakin vs obiwan but pretty dang great nonetheless this movie has emotional scenes and the scenes that worked worked great  rating this movie rating this movie is hard to do i only watched this movie once and i am going to watch a second time when i get paid and maybe my opinion changes or maybe it wont if you liked last jedi you may not like this as they try fixing errors from that movie if you like anakin then youre going to be kinda pissed if you just want to see star wars action youre gonna like this movie at least a bit if you dont care about the plot then youre good youll love it this movie is not a bad movie if you see the people giving this movie a 1 or a 2 out of 10 they are lying this movie although may piss you off it is not bad it doesnt make much sense but it isnt bad i can see you giving this movie a 510 if you are just completely turned off by the plot holes i am torn on my rating i want to give this an 8 as i see the previous movie as a 7 however the plot holes are just so bad  can we get an extended cut are they gonna release an hour longer version on bluray it worked for batman v superman we need it here it doesnt matter if its just a few scenes of fixing the plot holes i hope you enjoyed the review and remember to game like a god
Jan 7 2020,positive,i loved it was sad but the action was great and it kept me on the edge of my seat down to the unexpected end
Jan 7 2020,negative,completely laughable movie with terrible acting they should put a nail in the coffin of the series and collett good good
Jan 7 2020,positive,it tied up the loose ends but was a bit choppy and the battle screens were on repeatthere wasnt any mystery
Jan 7 2020,positive,desperate attempt to fix tlj horrible mistake despite being too fast expecially in the first part and having few plot holes too little luke skywalker screentime and not showing the faces of the characters rey hear which for the international audience is terrribly confusing guess why it feels like real star wars saga at least unlike episode viii
Jan 7 2020,positive,exciting and adventurous
Jan 7 2020,positive,this movie was a perfect ending to the saga of star wars jj abrams was the best choice to make this final episode i recommend it and give it a 1010
Jan 7 2020,negative,just terrible tried to recreate some iconic moments from the original films that just fell flat predictable boring storyline and very poor acting
Jan 7 2020,positive,it seems that this movie is very similar to the very first star wars movie only the characters have been changed but the story line and meaning of the film are very similar to the first movie i like that the sound wasnt so loud that it blasted you out of the theater my grandsons liked the movie a lot
Jan 7 2020,negative,cheesy and predictable
Jan 7 2020,positive,cheesy rehash of all the previous plots and storytelling elements from the old films fanservice without any creativity i was still definitely entertained and i love star wars but this film was by far the worst of the trilogy
Jan 7 2020,positive,loved all the old characters
Jan 7 2020,positive,its was what i expected in my opinion they are all the same and pretty predictable some cheesy acting good action scenes i was happy they did not introduce any weird characters and i think it wrapped up nicely  certainly nothing special
Jan 7 2020,negative,the entire movie was a video game fetch quest to get the thing to lead them to the other thing to lead them to the place to the final boss battle multiple planets visited in the span of 16 hours is laughable the time table made no sense  palpatine announced he was still alive via a podcast broadcast to the galaxy in the opening text crawl  you want to know how he came back dont ask its not important apparently  if you want to get any explanation of key plot points you will need to read comics the visual dictionary and other source material to attempt to make sense  the knights of ren were laughable and were only there to sell merchandise there were no consequences to anything in the movie multiple deaths instantly reversed it was a mess
Jan 7 2020,positive,i loved it i avoided any trailers i wanted my own enjoyment of the movie to be uninfluenced i loved the progress and transition yes there were tears but like life it was needed unexpected twists but so much more can be done to expand and explore in st world i love jjabrahms directorship
Jan 7 2020,positive,i thought it was great a few things felt rushed or unanswered but overall a great movie
Jan 7 2020,positive,it was good like episode 7 the story line was good but the trailer of the movie gave that away i dont understand how people riding on horses can trot down the wing of a large space craft  its space  you cant breathe in space
Jan 7 2020,positive,pretty entertaining movie  feel good ending which i love
Jan 7 2020,positive,i enjoyed throughly and got more out of it the second time
Jan 7 2020,positive,i really liked jjs final ending of the saga had emotions fanbased understanding and actions pace flow very good best in the latest trilogy
Jan 7 2020,neutral,would you like to see a 90s video game in a movie format do you want to ignore everything that happened in the last jedi and act like this is all going according to plan if so this movie is for you otherwise if you have any sense you will just be sad at what could have been this trilogy is a big miss for disney they could have told a story that people remembered for decades all it did for me was make the prequel trilogy seem ok
Jan 7 2020,positive,nice capper to the skywalker saga a chance to say goodbye to old friends and hello to some new friends hopefully well see more of the new ones in the future
Jan 7 2020,positive,awesome worth seeing ive now seen it twice
Jan 7 2020,positive,this was a good end to an epic series this was 40 years in the making so many characters an expanding universe and a fan base full of opinions lol this was a fun popcorn movie that took me back to a galaxy far far away one last time c3p0 said it best we got one last look at our friends dont let the hate of fans and critics flow through you watch and enjoy the rise of skywalker
Jan 7 2020,positive,great ending to an even greater series
Jan 7 2020,positive,entertaining from start to finish
Jan 7 2020,positive,great movie  great ending to the skywalker saga
Jan 7 2020,positive,as a lifetime fan i felt like they respected the old stories and closed a saga with dignity
Jan 7 2020,negative,the cgi may be the only reason to watch the movie the make up and costumes were substandard especially noticeable flaws in the dancing alien festival scene where the masks bounced up and down looking disjointed the plot and story were a complete mess more concern in getting nostalgia references than telling a reasonable tale most of the actors looked bored or uninspired and just going through the motion and lines
Jan 7 2020,positive,it was great action all the way through
Jan 7 2020,positive,it was a bit of a mess jumped around too much without much plot to drive it home
Jan 7 2020,positive,i liked it insofar as it was ana croon movie based on the star wars universe but the longer i had to think about the plot afterward the more i found it problematic and disappointing in direction let me say i dont think it was a bad movie it just wasnt what i wanted from this series
Jan 7 2020,positive,great action and story line the only star wars movie that made me cry loved it
Jan 7 2020,positive,loved how they started with a bang and i enjoyed the mix of old and new characters great movie
Jan 7 2020,positive,action is great movie felt too compact they should have made it two separate movies  seeing in 4dx was well worth it for the experience
Jan 7 2020,positive,great ending of an erapulling everyone together made it relevant to everyone who has seen any or all of the prior movies
Jan 7 2020,positive,very satisfying conclusion to the series
Jan 7 2020,positive,much better than last jedi dont listen to haters it was pretty solid not going to blow your mind but a decent addition to star wars
Jan 7 2020,negative,corny corny corny everything for everybody and nothing for everybody my friend was lucky half way through he dozed the more think about it the worse it gets
Jan 7 2020,positive,its good but not the best
Jan 7 2020,positive,good movie left with a few scenes unanswered but overall a really good movie
Jan 7 2020,positive,one of the best movies ive ever seen critics should be fired for doing this movie wrong
Jan 7 2020,positive,filled in missing family backgrounds wondered why harrison ford was not listed in the credits
Jan 7 2020,negative,if you want fanservice and 0 argument this movie its for you
Jan 7 2020,negative,felt like i was watching a video game going from one fetchquest to another just curious as to why the rt score is superglued at 86 i havent seen it change even one percentage point updown in ages
Jan 7 2020,positive,a few things were illogical withing canon or a bit cringy but all in all it was a very entertaining flick would recommend watching if you enjoyed the other two movies of the third trilogy
Jan 7 2020,positive,a lot of loose ends tied up
Jan 7 2020,negative,it has some good action scenes but the plot the bad use of some characters the humor and the tension part or basically everything else are lame
Jan 7 2020,positive,very good movie the last in a long line of movies
Jan 7 2020,negative,bad acting with a terrible script totally rushed for the holidays so much not explained in the final chapter
Jan 7 2020,positive,i took my 12yo son to see it at the imax theater  we wanted a good movie to see it on that huge screen disney didnt disappoint i was surprised that they even brought back the ewoks great job jj abrams
Jan 7 2020,positive,excellent finish to the series hit all the right notes tied up loose ends but had a compelling storyline of its own
Jan 7 2020,negative,it was like watching someone you used to admire have a spastic seizure and die it was a mess it almost makes me yearn for the simplistic stupidity of the prequels but i have to say the mandolorian is doing star wars better
Jan 7 2020,positive,i liked that it came full circle and left it to where it can be continued
Jan 7 2020,negative,disappointing the original casts and plots were vastly superior
Jan 7 2020,negative,super exciting for someone who dont care about story if you like explosions and the films you watch to hold your hand and tell you how to feel this is for you this movie was terrible
Jan 7 2020,positive,thought it wrapped up the series well and it ended happy
Jan 7 2020,positive,didnt like the ending iij wanted ben to
Jan 7 2020,negative,largely underwhelming  lots of punch with little substance
Jan 7 2020,positive,heavy on the actionfight scenes it answers the big questions and ties up the lose ends the purists will continue to hate it but those of us who enjoy the story for what it is not some greater meaning will be perfectly happy with it
Jan 7 2020,positive,seemed a little rushed but the people playing the characters did a good job getting it done
Jan 7 2020,positive,honestly this movie was an amazing movie
Jan 7 2020,positive,somewhat slow in the beginning
Jan 7 2020,positive,the star wars franchise has run its course  this movie was definitely better than the last but it just didnt measure up to some of the earlier episodes  still worth watching as it wraps up the series but dont expect to be blown away
Jan 7 2020,positive,loved the 3d and if you have watched all of the star wars movies then its awesome  great job     i only wish that we got the recliner seats as these seats were so close and a bit uncomfortable  it was really loud too  but i should have paid closer attention to the details on getting my tickets  movie was so good though
Jan 7 2020,negative,no cool lightsaber fights and palpatine survives everything bulshit story
Jan 7 2020,positive,darth sidious looked insane
Jan 7 2020,positive,such a fulfilling end to the saga
Jan 7 2020,positive,i loved the movie and the way it brought all the favorite characters back 1 last time thanks for leaving ja ja binks out
Jan 7 2020,positive,great entertainment
Jan 7 2020,positive,cheesy and predictable even more than other star wars movies
Jan 7 2020,positive,loved all the characters the personalities really came out in this one there were so many side stories i would have liked more i wish the jedi would return
Jan 7 2020,positive,it was a perfect star wars movie
Jan 7 2020,positive,great movie loved kylo ren and ray so much
Jan 7 2020,positive,what a fantastic conclusion to this trilogy really loved where the characters were the jedi are back
Jan 7 2020,positive,there is no movie franchise like star wars  a lot of fun and great to see all the old characters in the movie  then of course they throw in new lovable droid  if you like star wars you will love this movie
Jan 7 2020,positive,well written and brought all elements together in the end
Jan 7 2020,positive,lots of nostalgia moments calling back to the last movies still leaves more questions than answers but overall enjoyable to watch
Jan 7 2020,positive,very good  liked how everything came together
Jan 7 2020,positive,coming into the rise of skywalker id had very low expectations so i ended up really liking the film and finding it solid overall there lies a great lesson for everyone  always hold your expectations on the lower end of the spectrum as otherwise the moviegoing experience can turn out to be very disappointing as a fan of its predecessor the fact that they decided to retcon all of its great ideas really bothered me but still i found its major twist solid and all of the lightsaber battles in this movie are excellent too the films supporting characters are a total waste of time but palpatine is excellent and all of raykylo scenes are scenestealers how electrifying they are its a hugely entertaining film with some actually very strong humor and adventure elements but it shrank the universe so badly with some very unfortunate cheesy and stupid decisions to appeal to the dumbest sw fans out there
Jan 7 2020,negative,a gilded turd    very well crafted beautiful shots and effects    all created in the service of a storyscript that was painfully dumb cliched and predictable this is the worst movie ive seen in a theater since spider man 3
Jan 7 2020,positive,release the original cut
Jan 7 2020,neutral,average movie however for a starwars movie is not good
Jan 7 2020,positive,not clear what fins message to rey was also needed some better character development with fin and poe
Jan 7 2020,positive,tied everything up in a knot made you laugh and cry action packed from start to finish
Jan 7 2020,positive,the movie will entertain teen fanboys who have a crush on rey but if you are an adult i would recommend you that you should watch cats instead
Jan 7 2020,positive,too dark in places but it was ok
Jan 7 2020,positive,8910 very very good infititely better than the last jedi still not perfect though
Jan 7 2020,positive,good just some of the scenes felt cut short for some reason
Jan 7 2020,positive,this was a movie for the ages
Jan 7 2020,positive,just riveting from the opening scene till the close of the entire saga
Jan 7 2020,positive,jj did a great job of getting the franchise back on track after the last jedi debacle while also crafting a satisfying ending to the skywalker saga i only wish jj had written episode 8 or was allowed to make episode 9 a two parter so some story lines could breathe a little more still an excellent movie
Jan 7 2020,positive,story character development ending  all lived up to expectations
Jan 7 2020,positive,very good a couple of plot choices i didnt like
Jan 7 2020,positive,great job wrapping up the story i feel jj abrams did his best to salvage rian johnsons mess
Jan 7 2020,positive,great fight and battle scenes
Jan 7 2020,positive,it tied it all up and had a great ending 
Jan 7 2020,positive,a lot of critics have slammed this movie for its inconsistencies and granted that it may not be what most fans would expect but it did a pretty great job in concluding a saga that our parents grew up with and our kids would grow up knowing jj abrams did a wonderful job the cast and crew deserve all the praise
Jan 7 2020,positive,some scenes were enjoyable but overall the movie was too hard to follow and introduced characters that were hard to care about
Jan 7 2020,negative,really bad a waste of time destroyed everything that was built in the previous films surely there was no planning on the part of disney
Jan 7 2020,positive,way better than that train wreck of a movie the last jedi
Jan 7 2020,positive,so much action that you will get dizzy  you may need to see previous star war films to keep track of all the characters  special effects are tremendous and often move too fast  nice to see some of the old characters from 197790s
Jan 7 2020,positive,my opinion is that it was a little messy a little rough around the edges and a little rushed at the beginning but overall i liked it  i think it is the best of the new 3 movies but doesnt hold a candle to the original trilogy the movie i think correctly aligns with how the force works how it ought to work  the nostalgia ride is worth it  the emotional roller coaster is worth it  it flies in the face of whatever rian johnson was trying to do with the trilogy and i think thats a good thing  i think you might want to give it a chance  it does not leave me with a sour taste in my mouth like the last jedi did not even close  its about as decent as revenge of the sith i think
Jan 7 2020,negative,i enjoyed all of the previous sw movies including the last jedi which i had mixed thoughts on but this movienah
Jan 7 2020,positive,they did their best to reverse that absolute garbage of the second movie this one was basically two movies in one whilst dismissing the steaming pile of shit that was the second movie
Jan 7 2020,positive,excellent movie full of action and story line  go see you will be glad you did
Jan 7 2020,positive,it was good action just didnt have any original thought
Jan 7 2020,neutral,i cannot say i did not find any enjoyment in the movie but it was so aggressively paced and did not take the time to dwell on anything it tried to introduce way way too many things at the end trilogy and consequently it feels oversaturated it feels like course correction after episode 8 going as far as to take jabs at the movie and it suffers from it
Jan 7 2020,positive,i loved that the movie included so many of our favorite actorscharacters from the original series of movies
Jan 7 2020,positive,with engaging characters and dialogue exceptional action sequences and plenty of fun to be had the rise of skywalker serves as an emotional and effective end to the star wars saga even if it is consistently hindered by poor pacing and an overabundance of exposition
Jan 7 2020,positive,i really like the fight scenes and the kylorey scenes were done really well kylo ren definitely had the best story arc in this trilogy and adam driver acted the hell out of this role it has its holes and problems but i enjoyed it and think its the best film in the newer trilogy
Jan 7 2020,negative,it was an incomprehensible succession of fast clips
Jan 7 2020,positive,after 42 years of expectation it was a very satisfying conclusion
Jan 7 2020,positive,was an overall letdown very dissapointed in kylo ren
Jan 7 2020,positive,a lot of questions still need to be answered and we needed hayden christensen but the ending was good
Jan 7 2020,negative,what there is to say if you liked this trilogy since the beginning youll be fine however if you were disappointed by the previous two movies this episode is just more the same long live the mightyvirtuousunshakeabledonothingwrongever rey
Jan 7 2020,positive,though i enjoyed little pieces here and there rise of skywalker as a whole was exhausting to watch the plot if one even existed to begin with felt rushed and uncomfortable at times very uncharacterist for star wars well not including the last jedi or attack of the clones the acting i have to admit was fairly decent it was apparent that the actors and actresses were giving it their all i just wish the screen writers had gotten that memo
Jan 7 2020,positive,i loved it epic visuals from start to finish i love how the story finished i just loved everything about it i might be biased because i love the series but it was super awesome to me must watch
Jan 7 2020,negative,jj abrams massacred star trek and now he was allowed to massacre star wars good job disney p
Jan 7 2020,positive,there was a lot happening and it was full on but i enjoyed it overall finishing off a saga like this was never going to be an easy feat my biggest fear was that it would be more about online fan theories and appeasing the online obsessive fans i do like that there was a balance between nostalgia and new still processing a number of elements but overall yes i do really like
Jan 7 2020,positive,i really enjoyed the movie it was a really good conclusion id recommend it to any star wars fan
Jan 7 2020,negative,imagine that episode 5 had no surprise and just in 6 the opening letters inform us that vader is lukes father a narrative disaster right well thats episode 9
Jan 7 2020,negative,it was ok not that great kinda boring to be honest only some parts were good
Jan 7 2020,positive,i liked this one a lot i think people are unfair with their criticisms of this its a fun adventure film and if you watch it without baggage its hard not to like it
Jan 7 2020,negative,honestly i got more questions now than i did after tlj
Jan 7 2020,negative,slightly better than the last one the power scaling in this trilogy especially this one and the last one were crazy and made no sense
Jan 7 2020,positive,nice movie  fun and touching
Jan 7 2020,positive,wonderful even though we were 10 minutes late lol  it was freezing in the lobby though
Jan 7 2020,positive,fanservice with some emotional highlights but that is ok
Jan 7 2020,positive,it was just a good movie i dont want to be a spoiler alert er if thats a word lol
Jan 7 2020,negative,it was watchable only because nothing else to do fight scene between rey and kilo was very good but characters were boring story line was rehash of the previous movies pretty much luke and anakins story before was a irelevant to defeating palpatine basically the movie was rey had it all under control but fin was worried running around yelling rey rey every 15 mins
Jan 7 2020,positive,i dont know if so many critics have ever been so wrong about a movie maybe with david lynchs fire walk with me when it came out this one will fare well against the test of time easily the best of the new trilogy quite possibly in the top 3 of all time full of heart fun real star wars magic shocking surprises my jaw dropped to the floor on at least 2 occasions so glad i was able to stay away from any leaks or spoilers just the right amount of humor thats classic star wars and fresh at the same time amazing action and plenty of emotional wallops i dont know if ive ever cried so much in a movie theater such a fitting and beautiful end to the skywalker saga
Jan 7 2020,positive,the show answered questions
Jan 7 2020,positive,left with lots of unanswered  questions felt i should start with that but anyway the movie is alright finally some questions weve had since the force awakens are answered and i must say there was great twist with reys parents one that i personally didnt see coming unfortunately as much as it answered those questions it raised new ones and left them unanswered i guess for us to conclude for ourselves youve already watched the first two you might as well watch this one but dont go in with your hopes too high it give it a 510  just watch it cause you know its star wars 
Jan 7 2020,positive,better than ros but not great
Jan 7 2020,positive,a pretty good conclusion to the sequel trilogy and the entire nine episode saga  jj abrams did the best he could with what he was given and he has improved as a filmmaker
Jan 7 2020,negative,this movie was ridiculous not a good star wars movie
Jan 7 2020,positive,amazing best one yet
Jan 7 2020,negative,so boring my friend was falling asleep
Jan 7 2020,negative,beautiful to watch but frustrating to experience as a fan of the original movies so many liberties were taken with the original canon that i left the theater feeling used as if discovering the love of my life is only after my money as if the filmmakers were simply checking off boxes sarcastic banter check bromance check i had no concern for the characters most of the time not that the actors were at fault most performances were fine but the story and script they had to work with were selfconscious banal and paperthin full of cliches i know you cant recreate the awe and wonder of the first films any more than you can relive your first kiss but at least give me a little passion some inspiration this movie had very little of that its just another pretty face that happens to be blessed with a onceglorious family name
Jan 7 2020,positive,crazy end to an amazing saga
Jan 7 2020,positive,excellent show excellent seating i really enjoyed it
Jan 7 2020,positive,its was a masterpiece
Jan 7 2020,positive,abrahams killed it def owning this
Jan 7 2020,positive,the new star wars movie was honestly the best one out of all of them like literally tied in all three sequels and brought in fans from three generations together all the mysteries were explained there were no questions left at the end and the cgi although slightly overwhelming wasnt as bad as other disney movies like marvel and it was tied in with actual practical effects just the whole movie was brilliant and it had the best elements from all three sequels and explained so much backstory and didnt leave any plot holes except one and was just all around pretty awesome movie they did a good job ending star wars and brought out the geekiness in me which lots of new action sci fi movies lack when they make newer continuations which are targeted at a younger audience
Jan 7 2020,positive,a great way to end the skywalker saga
Jan 7 2020,positive,everything all these years and it turns out just to be another love story  but great
Jan 7 2020,positive,i liked the story and imagery will b back to see a 2nd and hopefully 3rd time as well perfect wrap up to the sky walker saga
Jan 7 2020,positive,this is a movie for the fans not the critics to really enjoy this you have to love star wars for what it is  a great adventure story with unusual characters and heart is it perfect nope but its ties up the narratives threads nicely and keeps the spirit of the original film intact and if you have the opportunity go see it at a 4dx theater the motion seats and intheater effects enhance the 3d in really cool ways that make you an active viewer in the adventure
Jan 7 2020,negative,great special effect terrible story line  extremely disappointed
Jan 7 2020,negative,anakin you have to work really hard and train constantly to become a master                                                                                    rey yeah i started here
Jan 7 2020,positive,although the jj cut was not released i found this to be the best out of the last trilogy jj totally redeemed the final saga
Jan 7 2020,positive,loved it a beautiful and fitting end to the saga especially considering the narrative challenge of losing carrie ive seen it three times and i will be back for more i think the sequel trilogy is great  fun unexpected and soulful im a huge star wars fan that means i love star wars even when it is flawed similar to how i love imperfect family members disney please keep making star wars movies and fans lets be supportive
Jan 7 2020,positive,the latest film brings conclusion to a ninepart movie series i am not quite sure how to describe the film we did enjoy it and thought it to be a satisfying end to the series to get there however meant sitting through some rather corny dialog odd music and a lot of visits with characters from previous episodes the film seemed more interested in paying homage to the series than creating anything new and exciting the story also felt rushed to me i did like how it brought resolution to the question that started it regarding the power of good versus evil i thought adam driver as kylo ren and daisy ridley as ray were both very strong in their roles thumbs up for a film whose final quarter is much better than the rest of the film and while not a perfect film is still entertaining it is not one of the better episodes but for me it was a decent way to end it all
Jan 7 2020,positive,i loved it jj abrams basically had to save it for the fans after the last jedi and you can see he really tried it could never be a perfect movie but it felt like a return to the stars wars i love
Jan 7 2020,positive,honestly the movie was just ok a solid c same ole storyline absolutely no creativity very little to see new here folks i would not see again on video nor would i purchase
Jan 7 2020,positive,a nonstop nostalgic trip down memory lane combined with some great new characters babu frik anyone  only thing i didnt care for was the kiss toward the end  seemed out of characterout of place  other than that really enjoyed it
Jan 7 2020,positive,its star wars and george lucas and john williams for crise sakes
Jan 7 2020,positive,very good story line
Jan 7 2020,positive,we thought that daisy ridleys performance was outstanding she acted her tail off liked the special effects the appearance of original characters and the little droid that looked like a dog love that rey adopted the skywalker surname she wears it well  also enjoyed keri russells character very hot need more of her

Jan 7 2020,positive,i enjoyed the movie it tied everything together for me for all you complainers have a coke and a smile and enjoy
Jan 7 2020,positive,action sequences and visual effects were great plot and character development were a bit weak though
Jan 7 2020,negative,the movie was cgi at the forefront with poor acting built around the cgi  the acting was laughable at times the storyline cheesy for sure and predictable  there was no attention to detail aside from ensuring the scenes were pc and millennialfriendly  i vowed that this would be my last star wars that i will watch  hopefully no more will be produced
Jan 7 2020,positive,they stretched out some scenes that caused the story to drag
Jan 7 2020,positive,i really enjoyed the movie i was wary about it at first because of all the negatives things i was told prior after watching it i can see what other people were talking about but i didnt think that it took away from the movie i felt like it was a great wrap up to the trilogy
Jan 7 2020,positive,you know you have to see it no matter how good or bad it is if you love star wars  its not a total disappointment but fails to delight as much as jjs first outing with the franchise  in the end it will close the story satisfyingly on only a couple characters and ultimately leave you wanting more answers and more star wars so i guess thats probably what disney wants  not all the characters get a satisfying end however
Jan 7 2020,positive,excellent movie it ties everything up very nicely
Jan 7 2020,positive,i love the way it drew everything together from all the generations together   i enjoyed most of the actors desperation in the last battle which is at the end of each trilogy
Jan 7 2020,positive,a blast from the past very entertaining
Jan 7 2020,positive,the end left me with questions but it did bring in the old movies nicely and paid homage to hallmark characters and fan favorites
Jan 7 2020,positive,loved it with all the 4d packages
Jan 7 2020,positive,my boys went and they loved it they are huge star wars fans anyway so theyre happy to watch the only thing i heard them discussing at length was the real skywalker didnt show up idk what that means but they had fun anyway
Jan 7 2020,positive,a couple of slow spots but a really good movie
Jan 7 2020,positive,loved it it was a great finish to an epic saga sad to see it end
Jan 7 2020,positive,it was amazing if you hated what rian johnson did to starwars and loved the original trilogy this is a movie for you jj fixed starwars with this one only reason it isnt a full 5 stars is because it started off choppy but who could blame jj he had to fix the mess that rian johnson created the ending was perfect and it was an action packed very thrilling adventure from start to finish
Jan 7 2020,positive,this movie was incredible perfectly wrapped up the most amazing series
Jan 7 2020,positive,i mean what can i say that hasnt been said its star warsif you like star wars movies you will like this one would have liked a little more closure with kai lo ren in the end but thats just me being nit picky
Jan 7 2020,positive,enjoyed the wrap up after 40 years of excellent story telling enjoyed the special effects as well
Jan 7 2020,positive,fun and exciting a nice conclusion to the saga  if you dont think too much about it afterwards
Jan 7 2020,positive,very slow start  saw people leave after around 30 minutes into the movie
Jan 7 2020,positive,the best nonoriginal trilogy star wars movie
Jan 7 2020,positive,it was a true emotional roller coaster of a movie over all i loved it so much subject it should have been 2 movies but cleaning up after the last one they did a great job
Jan 7 2020,positive,i liked the blend of action and emotion plenty of old and new characters some scenes completely blew me away i was taken to the edge of my seat and moments later i was holding back tears
Jan 7 2020,positive,beautifully done  filled with all the action and surprises youd expect from a star wars story  also filled with a lot of emotion and wit  a must see  i cant wait to see it again

Jan 7 2020,positive,dragged in places  liked having luke leah han landau etc make final appearanceseffects were spectacular   ice closure
Jan 7 2020,positive,excellent  everything comes full circle  a lot of blanks to fill in bit a true fan wont get lost  coils have made two movies with everything thy happened  but a satisfying movie
Jan 7 2020,negative,scattered storyline and bringing back old characters is no substitute for a good plot
Jan 7 2020,positive,it stayed well within the star wars story lines and left it open for more
Jan 7 2020,positive,great ending to the storyline
Jan 7 2020,negative,god awful pacing and completely bereft of interesting themes spends way too much of its time retconning the previous film leaving this trilogy feeling like a jumble of ideas all trying to strangle one another the final scene is embarrassing i laughed
Jan 7 2020,negative,i fell asleep during it wasnt enjoyable to me
Jan 7 2020,positive,a theatrical space war action comedy and a dab of romance it had me cringing crying laughing and having a good time watching the end of the saga  were there a few coincidences sure and a few things that probably would not have worked out like thatbut its a movie and things have to work out and flow it has a lot in it to notice if you dont remember all the other movies you might want to watch them and then go see it  definitely worth see on the big screen we enjoyed it
Jan 7 2020,negative,very disappointed  bad story line and bad acting
Jan 7 2020,neutral,i did not like the ending and the fact that they brought back palpateen
Jan 7 2020,positive,it was really a full circle perfect
Jan 7 2020,negative,consistent with the trash that they have been calling star wars since rogue one
Jan 7 2020,positive,never bored me  action packed greatness
Jan 7 2020,positive,good movie not the best but pretty good some lame scenes
Jan 7 2020,negative,a four hour movie with a two hour run time  it felt like a video game get the thing toget the thingto get the thing  anakin the chosen one only provided a voice and never spoke to his grandson  and the palpatines win  all skywalkers are dead at the end because of sheve  damn disney
Jan 7 2020,negative,just an absolute train wreck of a movie
Jan 7 2020,positive,i think i was kinda lucky i had heard so many bad reviews that i lowered my expectations and i ended up liking it my biggest beef is that jj abrams should have just accepted the events of the last jedi and just made the best movie he could this isnt the best movie he could have done because he was so busy trying to undo the last jedi
Jan 7 2020,positive,good conclusion to the series
Jan 7 2020,positive,i think it was a good finish the series it was redeem itself from the last one
Jan 7 2020,positive,i really like the way they tied it all together
Jan 7 2020,negative,such a disappointment after waiting a lifetime to see the third trilogy play out its all too clear that under disney control this last trilogy had no preplanned story arc each of the three movies took its own path with no unified threemovie vision no pay off in the end and blasphemy in undercutting the importance of the original trilogy undermining darth vaders act of killing the emperor with lukes guidance i never wanted a fanservice movie either just something that did justice to the original ninemovie plan i think this trilogy was worse than the prequel trilogy the acting was far better in the last triology but at least the prequel trilogy stuck to the original story line as bad as the prequel scripts were they still gave us anakin skywalkers story arc cloners darth maul and general grievous rey and kylo ren were fun but it was hard to really care about them in the end
Jan 7 2020,positive,awesome end to incredible story great job jj
Jan 7 2020,positive,it was one of the best star wars movies weve seen wow
Jan 7 2020,positive,for a fan of 42 years this was awesome and fitting ending to the series
Jan 7 2020,positive,good female lead storyline cameo by kylos father added star power to the usual storyline special effects were great except for the jedi training flashback
Jan 7 2020,positive,i really loved the storyline of it all but i really think they could of done the ending better it is what it is
Jan 7 2020,positive,excellent end to the saga much better than the last jedi
Jan 7 2020,positive,nowhere near as bad as critics are saying  any movie thats over 25 hours but doesnt feel like it is a win for me  and as we learned from got finale its really hard to please everyone when concluding a multidecade epic  pretty damn good imo
Jan 7 2020,positive,story sagas as deep and extensive as star wars can only please so many fans with a run time of two and a half hours but this has easily earned a spot as one of the best star wars installments of the franchise and with all things considered this climactic ending brought justice to a galaxy long awaited
Jan 7 2020,positive,looked forward to seeing this segment it had fantastic cig plot action  we were never bored
Jan 7 2020,positive,good movie with a twist i wasnt expecting no spoiler alert here going to see again
Jan 7 2020,negative,they ruined the legacy of anakin
Jan 7 2020,positive,excellent just excellent  what an awesome end to the trilogy of trilogies the 42 year wait was well worth this absolutely beautiful ending no disappointment at all
Jan 7 2020,positive,spectacular many of the critics that get paid are wrong dont miss this its like return of the jedi on steroids if this is the last one its a great culmination to the series but leaves the door open of course you never know but it felt very satisfying and made me feel like a kid again  i watched it in 3d and in a dbox seat first time ever in a dbox seat for me and i highly recommend it it made it into my favorite amusement park ride ever enjoy
Jan 7 2020,positive,amazing on the edge action
Jan 7 2020,positive,highs and lows i laughed i cried i was even scared at times good end to the trilogy
Jan 7 2020,positive,second viewing still loved it 
Jan 7 2020,positive,judge for yourself definitely a must see some may say its just ok but i enjoyed it and wasnt disappointed and my wife not a fan also enjoyed the movie dont expect it to be the best movie ever but definitely worth the night out
Jan 7 2020,positive,i have to say i loved this movie i thought it was a great end to the skywalker saga i think abrams did a beautiful job with the film
Jan 7 2020,positive,reviewed 122119  perhaps the greatest star wars mystery of all is why disney would approach the most cherished movie saga in history in such a haphazard manner for 2015s the force awakens they gave jj abrams complete creative control hes a talented director but he made it clear he would only contribute to one installment can you imagine being responsible for a multibillion dollar franchise and deciding meh let jj do one and well figure out the rest from there   but amazingly enough that was exactly their plan did it work fans will debate it till the end of this galaxy but to critics and fans of quality writing it did not one succinct and original story from the mind of one talented writerdirector would have avoided this whole mess instead were left with a trilogy pastiche sort of speak too many ideas too many characters and simply not enough time to cram it all in but try they did  abrams got the whole affair off to an unimaginative start by inexplicably choosing to rehash major plot points from the original trilogy from the ridiculous appearance of yet another death star but this one is bigger to an almost identical antagonist but this one is bigger to the repeated dialogue from earlier films the whole thing reeked of a shameless nostalgia grab   to top it off abrams decided to introduce a new lead cast of characters as opposed to focusing on the original set fans were dying to revisit in doing so he robbed fans of a deep dive into the franchises most beloved characters and a chance to see them ride off into a double sunset one final time i mean isnt it called the skywalker saga for a reason  call me crazy to think the guy the whole series is named after might actually be the focus  couldnt the new cast of characters have been introduced in a subsequent trilogy   to his credit though once he made his fateful decision he created some interesting characters rey is a hero for a new generation while kylo ren introduced a freshly nuanced spin on the dark side but unfortunately given the off the cuff writing process they were never fully developed as the installments progressed  the result is the loss of what could have been a deep emotional return to the original characters or what could have been the next great trilogy  as a result it traded what could have been two great trilogies for one overstuffed version    for 2017s the last jedi the creative keys were turned over to a new writerdirector rian johnson as talented as he is see looper breaking bad knives out it is inconceivable that he was permitted to take the story wherever he wanted but he was and boy did he no spoilers but suffice it to say he made choices that completely derailed abrams imagined plot line thankfully he did so to exciting effect injecting some desperately needed surprises and originality but with his efforts also a one off it left two mens visions to be stuffed into one final chapter  that brings us to the rise of skywalker where jj abrams decided to return after all  but get this it was originally scheduled to be written and directed by a third director colin treverrow  its stunning that a company with disneys pedigree could ever be so careless  three writerdirectors with three different stylesvisions is a recipe for disaster  and some feel that was the result  i am not one of them  although its frustrating that the trilogy isnt what it could have been credit must be given  despite their opposing visions the abramsjohnson team managed to create three highly entertaining movies  highly flawed too and thats the rub    that preamble complete the rise of skywalker is the hodgepodge youd expect  there is so much to work with after 42 years of story development but much time is wasted trying to tie up all the newly created loose ends  and some questions are simply never answered  like what happened to the little boy that used the force to move his broom at the end of the last jedi  his existence had to be addressed since he represents either a completely new understanding of the force as an ability that anyone can possess a democratization of the force if you will  or he somehow has a bloodline to explain his ability  either way its a game changer  it was a bold move by rian johnson and its a major blunder to not revisit him in some fashion  that said the remaining big questions are indeed answered to varying effect  reys parentage is revealed but leaves a whole new line of unanswered questions  kylo ren makes his final choice to heartening effect  but for every emotional moment that hits home theres another that falls flat due to the aforementioned lack of development  the end result is representative of the entire process  a story for the ages led by talented forces battling disneys hubris  do they prevail  well its a fun ride but youre left wishing it all felt a bit more triumphant
Jan 7 2020,negative,what a mess why did they bother making this slop
Jan 7 2020,positive,rushed plot loop holes visually stunning though
Jan 7 2020,positive,i loved everything i was taken away to the worlds of star wars
Jan 7 2020,positive,i was afraid to go see the film that was marking the end of an era that began when i was 12 would it disappoint me terribly like the last jedi did after regaining my  star wars excitement watching the force awakens  i managed my trepidation bit the bullet and went i could tell pretty early from the tone and cinematography that i would ay least like it i did was it perfect no but then what is it was good enough good enough that i laughed cried jumped in my skin clutched my seat and felt all the nostalgia of 40 years of star wars if i could commission the makers to tinker with it another 6 months to achieve that epic perfection few films attain sure i would but was i satisfied at the end i was a lil confused about some things but satisfied all the same a 3star farewell to a legend of the industry
Jan 7 2020,positive,this is a movie made for a 2019 audience tons of action tons of characters almost too much going on its hard to pick a time to run for a refill finals chapters are always tough because there is so much to tie up this did a pretty adequate job of addressing as much as one movie could while still bringing some fresh plot points we all came out of the theater quoting different parts and reminding each other of new characters and aspects to the new worlds if you are looking for something that doesnt exist like a time machine you wont find it go back to the 80s brah however if you want a film consistent with the quality jj abrams brought to lost then this is your flick starwarsforever
Jan 7 2020,positive,fantastic everything
Jan 7 2020,positive,i liked it it played out differently than i thought it would
Jan 7 2020,negative,lets get this out of the way yes i loved the original star wars movies who didnt i want to love these too i was onboard after the first part of reys story from jj abrams but this one was absolute garbage they crammed so much crap into a meaningless story it was ridiculous they completely forgot the reason people loved the originalsthey developed the characters into ones we loved and the story was unique but not over the top it was cast perfectly this one was so crammed with so many holes and unfortunately bad characters it just sucked nevermind that you have a stormtrooper that escaped from the empire lets just make him a meaningless background story it had potentialright before they turned the lights out and those famous words scrolled on the screen
Jan 7 2020,positive,wish it couldve been longer and have a bit more action but other than that it was pretty good
Jan 7 2020,positive,great plot and action
Jan 7 2020,positive,very good movie and a good ending to star wars even though i love them
Jan 7 2020,neutral,messy conclusion this feels like a remake of return of the jedi safe filmmaking with zero gambles the first hour is tough really tough to sit through were suppose to swallow a villain has been alive this whole time without any explanation things do ramp up towards the end but abrams and disney have really nailed the coffin shut here uninspired and meaningless film and its a shame the storyline is tedious and a stepping stone for the so called fanboy groups that called the last jedi a mess this is a real mess its a shame rian johnson didnt write and direct this trilogy this film has forced story beats nothing flows its all for fan service essentially box office glorification lucas never did this wheres the risks disappointing conclusion after the great work done in the last jedi what happened to the spark to ignite the rebels what happened to the child at the end of the last film too many holes and characters left to the side finn is here for no real reason i wasnt a giant fan of the remake of last hope by  abrams but at least it had some originality with set pieces disneys influence was obviously too much here 20122019
Jan 7 2020,positive,i like the fast paced action and that it didnt detract too much from the story which was well done and how i wish the last few star wars movies would have flowed  a few characters were not key players as in past films but they developed others better  worth the trip to the movie theatre to see it
Jan 7 2020,positive,not great not terrible
Jan 7 2020,positive,i have at my age been lucky enough to see every single star wars movie made since the very first to keep this extremely simple it follows the same exact pattern and formula of success but unfortunately does absolutely nothing new at all its receiving negative reviews for that fact alone im one of the few people who actually thinks the character of rey is very disappointing and even more so not only her character but most of the movie is just lacking there are very few moments that seem real at all and most are without emotion through the whole film the thing that is missing in norma sli and instantly recognizable about this installment oh is that it takes itself way way way too seriously and is not lighthearted fun i have heard jj abrams filmed more than four and a half hours total and ill wait for the release so that because i would say the quality is laying on the floor this is not to say isnt entertaining it isnt cool to go see the new star wars movie oh but it just really doesnt do anything different there are much better movies coming out soon thankfully
Jan 7 2020,positive,my kids and i loved this movie we are huge fans of star wars and it was a great ending to this trilogy im gonna miss seeing rey and finn and poe they are truly a great team and loved watching them on these last 3 movies
Jan 7 2020,positive,star wars awesomeness
Jan 7 2020,positive,i liked that the storyline was answered i enjoyed that so many of the characters were included
Jan 7 2020,positive,poor character development same fights with lasers and ships 42 years later r2d2 still looks like a vacuum cleaner c3po is no closer to being a true android chew bacca still only speakshis language and wardrobe is the same keyvword all the same i liked the music
Jan 7 2020,positive,my sister and i loved this film it was well put together and the cast and storytelling and visuals were astounding its definitely a must watch on the big screen
Jan 7 2020,positive,i found it convenient in a lot of places but overall i found it enjoyable
Jan 7 2020,positive,loved it star wars storytelling at its best
Jan 7 2020,positive,it was okay it could be better though
Jan 7 2020,positive,not a bad movie it has a lot of emotion and provides a good ending for this trilogy however  fails to capture the original story essence and seems to force some aspects of the plot
Jan 7 2020,negative,movie bogged down until about the last 20 minutes too many writers changing the overall story arc through three films
Jan 7 2020,negative,i was hesitant to go to see this one after the previous entry in the trilogy although jj abrams did a fair job introducing the characters in the first installment im not sure where you should place the blame for how this movie turned out unfortunately it was not even close to saving the series or the franchise the tatters of the saga were revived and stretched beyond breaking point as far as storytelling goes inconsistent with its own internal logic treads all over original movies arc and the sentiment of the force  overall a terrible movie but if i had to pick a couple of positive points its better than last jedi and the effects were great  not exactly a high bar
Jan 7 2020,neutral,bad star wars movie good on its own if you arent a big sw fan  i liked the big dramatics and the fact that it made me sob buckets but the ending was shoddy and the title of the movie makes little to no sense when you think about the plot
Jan 7 2020,positive,nice finale to the series
Jan 7 2020,positive,good moments but too many plot holes for me to really enjoy it a viewer should not have to have a star wars movie explained to them by the internet this means youve done a bad job with your movie
Jan 7 2020,positive,sucker for happy endings
Jan 7 2020,positive,true to the original trilogy with plenty of nods to lucas i hate that this story is ending  but love love  love this film
Jan 7 2020,positive,it was much better than i expected since rotten tomatoes gave it such a bad rating  i liked everything about it
Jan 7 2020,positive,awesome conclusion
Jan 7 2020,positive,the rise of skywalker is basically jj abrams trying to salvage star wars from the disastrous last jedi though some of the it plot is forced upon you i think jj did a pretty good job all things considered
Jan 7 2020,negative,we could talk all day about all the bad parts of this movie from poor pacing to lack of developing its own plot points but heres what makes this movie genuinely unforgivable  1 rey palpatine and rey skywalker both rey was done so dirty in this movie from kylos they sold you to protect you line to the final shot of rey alone on a desert that means nothing to her claiming a surname of ghosts with less belonging and family then she started the movie with a blatant middle finger to the only thing rey has ever wanted and the whole trajectory of reys character arc   2 rose tico was cut out of the story rose tico had barely any lines during this movie rescinded to a character role equaling snap wexleys kaydel connixs and wedge antiless this was done in spite of the fact that rose tico was set up as a main front and center character in the last movie and this was done probably to appease the incredibly racist backlash against rose tico which drove kelly marie tran off social media  3 poe damerons preestablished backstory was erased to make the latino character a drug dealer the rise of skywalker includes a plot point of poe dameron seeking out babu frik an old friend from poes newly invented background as a spice runner the comics for poe dameron made by lucasfilm and disney leave absolutely no room for poe to be a dug dealer and he was with the resistence from the getgo just another instance of blatant racism in this movie  4 finn deserved better finn doesnt do much in this movie he screams rey a lot he hints at being force sensitive but this whacko movie apparently cant find the time to actually address this except to take the power of finns choice to leave the first order and pin it on the force told me to do it and to sense rey dying  5 this movie also blatantly retcons the last jedi in a sloppy and honestly petty way but honestly thats really not important in the light of what this movie did to its characters  so why even give it two stars because there were two good things i liked in this movie   firstly kylo ren was good kylo rens arc was definitely not superbly written but it was a lot better done than literally every other character so beggars cant be choosers i guess the ok writing combined with adam driver literally carrying kylo ren on his back makes kylo ren the shining diamond in the rough of this movie though kylo ren retconning his own words from the last jedi and telling rey her parents sold her to protect her fills me with more righteous rage than kylo ren has ever felt in his life also the first scene in this movie was badass  2 the trio dynamic was really fun and enjoyable yessss give me a rey and poe that lowkey just do not like each other and do not get along but love finn so damn much so they put up with each other while simultaneously being snotty  i love it despite all the heart break this movie put me through rest assured i would watch another trilogy of finn rose rey and poe going on whacky fetch quests but only if rose is in them goddamnit
Jan 7 2020,positive,was an awsome tie up tie up to the trilogy
Jan 7 2020,negative,the only parts i enjoyed were the references to the original movies
Jan 7 2020,negative,at least we still have the mandalorian it is nothing more than weaponize nostalgia mixed in with fanservice catering to the ultimate mary sue addicts
Jan 7 2020,positive,its a very very beautiful movie
Jan 7 2020,positive,a satisfying ending to an epic story that has meant so much to this generation
Jan 7 2020,positive,i really enjoyed my second viewing  it was action packed and didnt feel like 2 12 hours  i thought it was really well done
Jan 7 2020,positive,it hit every note for me i loved it will see again and again
Jan 7 2020,positive,it was great to see everyone from the franchise the movie answered all the questions i had
Jan 7 2020,positive,not as good as prior movies story was too broken up
Jan 7 2020,positive,action packed and very entertaining loved it
Jan 7 2020,positive,storyline rushed throughout
Jan 7 2020,negative,exhausting except for one or two technically beautiful scenes i came out of the movie with a blinding headache
Jan 7 2020,positive,it was done very good and the end was well writing i think all the bad reviews are not really seeing what it took to make this movie as good as it was i always say if you could do better lets see love bobby lee 007 ps watch how many go and see it again and buy it when it comes to blu ray
Jan 7 2020,positive,it was nostalgic all over again cast take a final bow and may god rest princess leah chewie and 3cpo
Jan 7 2020,positive,i enjoyed how the movie contained throwbacks to the original trilogy i enjoyed that it wrapped up a ton of unanswered questions  it was just a fun movie to see
Jan 7 2020,positive,very entertaining any many questions were answered
Jan 7 2020,positive,it dotted the is and crossed the ts
Jan 7 2020,positive,closed the series as i liked
Jan 7 2020,positive,a satisfying conclusion to the skywalker saga
Jan 7 2020,positive,it was ok   the story is a parallel to return of the jedi unfortunately   same story with different characters
Jan 7 2020,positive,spoiler review after learning that the rise of skywalker was a splat on rotten tomatoes i was devastated and had extremely low expectations walking into the theatre but by the end of the movie i was skeptical of the critics interpretation this movie was awesome while i would have appreciated less cgi the character development was excellent per the disney standard the movies writers wove the new trilogy into the original trilogy intricately and fascinatingly leias back story  however brief  enhanced her character and made us fall in love with her all over again i also loved that the rey and ben learned to use their force connection intentionally which allowed for one of the best transitions of the entire series when rey holds leias lightsaber behind her back and it appears in bens hand so he can take down the knights of ren i didnt know it before the rise of skywalker but the concept of the sith home planet exegol was missing from the series and truly demonstrated a balance in the force weve seen jedi temples the jedi counsel on coruscant and a sacred jedi library tree thing on the island where luke lived in exile why not a sith equivalent i was not so impressed by the expansive fleet of stardestroyers  all with planetkilling capabilities no less while impressive it was also a bit farfetched i appreciated the drama but it strayed from the monstrous yet refined vibe of the original empire the struggle between palpatine and his grandaughter wow made me confident in the film again a battle of wills between the spirits of all of the sith and all of the jedi is the perfect climactic point for the final installation in this trilogy of trilogies the poetic final scene when rey buries luke and leias lightsabers on tatooine is an unforgettable moment of nostalgia and it seems fitting that rey has a bright yellow lightsaber a new kyber crystal for a new age of the jedi
Jan 7 2020,positive,wasnt my favorite star wars mediterranean bowl was not edible
Jan 7 2020,positive,its star wars stop thinking and enjoy
Jan 7 2020,negative,hated it everything was so messy and bad explanations to everything

Jan 7 2020,positive,amazing score and i enjoyed the story and appreciated the tie up of everything my only real complaint is how they handled the force ghosts not quite in keeping with the way i thought the thing worked  but definitely worth watching
Jan 7 2020,positive,sad that this was the last star wars movie and that i didnt get to see it with my dad
Jan 7 2020,positive,i am not big onto star wars but this one was really good
Jan 7 2020,positive,wish fin could have hooked up with ren
Jan 7 2020,positive,too busy hard to focus i actually fell asleep
Jan 7 2020,negative,a horrible conclusion to the disney star wars trilogy it spends so much time retconing things from the last jedi that they dont cohesively tie together at all its filled with plot holes pointless emotionless character deaths characters who serve no purpose other then selling merchandise and terrible humor it spends so much time looking back on the older films that it does a horrible job of standing on its own what should be an epic conclusion to a three movie narrative feels like an improvised disaster
Jan 7 2020,positive,wrapped up the story line nicely
Jan 7 2020,positive,rise of skywalker did a good job wrapping up the skywalker saga awesome action scenes and a very cool twist
Jan 7 2020,positive,ok ending no emotion and zero plot  all cgi it was time to end it

Jan 7 2020,positive,a little too longtypical star wars movie meh
Jan 7 2020,positive,great actiongreat castinggreat visuals ties into the history of the story
Jan 7 2020,positive,i truly enjoyed star wars ix a great conclusion of 42 years of skywalker  jj abram did a great job
Jan 7 2020,positive,loved it ignore the haters jj did a great job second time seeing it  just as good
Jan 7 2020,negative,it seemed like they packed way too much contentplot into this movie in an effort to make up for or undo the events of the last jedi  some of the concepts were actually really cool but a lot seemed shoehorned in when it didnt need to be and i found myself questioning a lot of things that didnt make much sense  i could see how it was probably difficult for some people to keep up with what was happening the older gentleman a few seats down was actually snoring at one point  if you feel like you have to see it simply because its the last of the series i would wait until its streaming
Jan 7 2020,negative,visually very good but a limp plot line with farfetched crapola going on and complete ignorance of space and physics  recycled drama and everybody sacrificing their lives for each other  including some old jedi holograms to instill wisdom  been there done that  give us something new
Jan 7 2020,positive,it was good not great but good enough
Jan 7 2020,positive,i really loved this movie and would go see it many more times however i did not like when ben solo died he was the best character in the sequels and deserved a better ending 
Jan 7 2020,positive,beyond what i expected based on previous reviews
Jan 7 2020,positive,the to fast movement of the ships flying upset my vertigo otherwise the movie was well done and exciting
Jan 7 2020,positive,basically same story line minus the great actors from the old movies would have liked to seen a tribute to all the old characters who made this series so great
Jan 7 2020,positive,finally fixed the garbage worst jedi movie  it had great plot twists and completed the story respectfully
Jan 7 2020,positive,unlike many reviews out there  i think this movie was absolutely excellent  i was locked in from beginning to end  everything you want in a movie and more  i feel the way they ended the story was great
Jan 7 2020,positive,so ive had a long time to think about this movie i saw it on the 20th and left the theatre happy however a lot of my expectations were subverted so i left confused as well i didnt know if i loved this movie so i spent two weeks thinking about it then i went to see it again with my family i enjoyed it even more the second time i noticed deeper meanings that the film was trying to convey even more easter eggs a lot of fan service isnt always a bad thing especially if its star wars and i had more fun knowing where the film was going and accepting the things that happened the reason i dont give this a full five stars is because it should have been longer the first half of this movie crams a lot of things into it really fast and reminds me of how transformers 5 was cut very quick where a scene didnt feel like it ended properly there are rumours on how disney is the reason behind most of the mistakes and elements left out of the film and that it was supposed to be 3 hours long all in all it is a good movie whether youre a fan of the force awakens and even the last jedi a lot of people are overlooking elements of this film that make it truly wonderful
Jan 7 2020,positive,love it from the beginning to the end  great job 
Jan 7 2020,positive,a bit maudlin in its dialogue and character conflicts but a really fun action movie to be sure
Jan 7 2020,positive,i didnt hate it it felt a bit clumsy at the start a bit forced in the middle and twisty at the end the sound and visual fx were phenomenal i will be watching again when it comes out on bluray and see if a second viewing helps making the story stick together any better
Jan 7 2020,negative,a disappointing letdown to one of the biggest movie franchises of all time throughout the movie it was clear that they didnt care about the last movie and practically retconned everything that happened
Jan 7 2020,positive,i enjoyed the movie but i felt that the previous movie the last jedi  was better  i feel like they could have developed the characters a bit more however that would have made the movie longer and it already quite long
Jan 6 2020,positive,the last movie in the star wars skywalker canon is both a present and disappointment to both fans and new moviegoers jj abrams took the same idea of the force awakens and tries to incorporate a sensible plot after rian johnsons last star wars movie the last jedi after it was announced that jj abrams was replacing the original director for episode x we can see this was strictly a movie grab decision by disney all i can say is just enjoy the ending star war fans deserves better from disney
Jan 6 2020,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed the movie ride that the star wars crew gave us i want to go see this movie again
Jan 6 2020,positive,an action filled end to the sw saga
Jan 6 2020,positive,a fantastical ending to the star wars saga  with all the spin off potentials i hope that they continue to produce more star wars movies in the future
Jan 6 2020,positive,had a great experience fun ride
Jan 6 2020,positive,perfect ending to the 3 trilogy set of movies
Jan 6 2020,positive,fantastic will see it many more times
Jan 6 2020,positive,thoroughly enjoyable
Jan 6 2020,positive,it was a great finale to the most recent trilogy easily the best of the three movies
Jan 6 2020,positive,it was action packed and fun to watch and full of a few surprises
Jan 6 2020,positive,it was a little predictable and it was hard to connect to it i just felt like oh this is great and then i would be like nope its the same movie as last time
Jan 6 2020,positive,so much action its hard to keep pace with it all
Jan 6 2020,positive,loved this movie best of the series
Jan 6 2020,positive,likes how they transitioned from old characters to the new characters
Jan 6 2020,negative,a confounding 25 hour blunder through exhaustingly predictable tropes which are not bad by nature that left a lifetime sw fan ready to leave the theater the only reason i didnt was because this movie felt like witnessing a train derailment take place over 150 minutes it was dreadful and inexorable a bad thing to happen to the world but i had to finish watching just to know how it ended
Jan 6 2020,negative,huge disappointment  i have always loved star wars movies and shows including solo and last jedi  but this movie sucked all of the joy out of the newer characters during the first 90 minutes of the movie  unlike all of the other character driven movies of the past this was a mostly plot driven story that felt very rushed until the final parts of the story  i hope this poorly written movie doesnt discourage disney from making movies with these newer characters in the near future because the definitely deserve a better final chapter to their stories
Jan 6 2020,positive,good continuation of storyline good ending space battles werent up to my expectations though still a must see
Jan 6 2020,positive,loved it as a fan it it felt good it helps knowing background from star wars universe such as swtor or wikis lots of little easter eggs to pick up the golden sabre brilliant force chose her a sentinel crystal for those confused by the reylo relationship youre only seeing a snapshot of the constant connections to the force these two keep getting in the unshown story their diad is a very rare thing in star wars lore and it makes sense that these two had strong emotions going the softer side of rey wanted ben not kylo she was attracted to him and could see his wounded heart she wanted to help him even though the dark side had control over him yeah its dramatic but so is the whole saga   also the whole thing of jedi not having relationships is out the window in this era old ways are dead literally one trained jedi left the story becomes more about the will of the force diad than about organisations lightning trying to burn the books i thought it was great that it went more this way im surprised finn has been kicking up a stink about that aspect but i do think there should be a side story movie to him since they showed he was a force sensitive adult i think the chances of this will be lowered now  i never got the feeling finn and rey would be an item id have to watch 7 again  finn is a great actor and more should come of that
Jan 6 2020,positive,great movie but it seemed rushed crammed so much in that some story lines were not fleshed out completely
Jan 6 2020,negative,it was boring and did not wrap any of the last 40 years up it really was a bomb
Jan 6 2020,negative,carbon copy of episode vi feels bad knowing they ruined the story of vader by bringing palpatine back also both sides went from no ships to about 100000 in a 2 minute span
Jan 6 2020,positive,excellent i loved it dont listen to the a negative comments go see it
Jan 6 2020,positive,we enjoyed it  didnt over analyze or criticize
Jan 6 2020,negative,a complete cinematic failure this movie is plain trash very hard to follow and in my opinion one of disneys greatest failures if not its greatest star wars movies 1 to 6 have nothing to do with this nightmare a big thumbs down
Jan 6 2020,positive,fixed all the errors from last jedi which was awful
Jan 6 2020,positive,as far as star wars movies go it was ok  certainly better than the disaster that was the last jedi  but there was too much crammed in and some of the plot made little sense far too little was explained as to palpatines returnresurrection for example
Jan 6 2020,negative,this movie was ass and it makes no sense in the continuity of the trilogy i want my money back disney
Jan 6 2020,positive,finally a good star wars movie but we need more vader
Jan 6 2020,negative,pretty good photography i can give that to it but the number of plotholes way too important the awful script and the ending that just destroies everything that happened between episode 1 to 6 and make them irrelevant this movie is just a treason to star wars and good cinema
Jan 6 2020,positive,still after seeing the movie three times the retcon of the last jedi is unforgivable the emperor is unnecessary as jj tries to satisfy the haters
Jan 6 2020,positive,it was a great way to end the saga  the action met expectations previous star wars movies
Jan 6 2020,positive,a little slow i think in the beginning but super good plot twists and ending
Jan 6 2020,positive,perfect a good ending for skywalker
Jan 6 2020,positive,i liked the special effects as well as the acting and story line
Jan 6 2020,positive,i loved it i cant wait for the next one
Jan 6 2020,positive,while i love star wars i felt this flick was specifically aimed at males between the ages of 11  15  can not explain this family other then it was shared by my date to the movie
Jan 6 2020,neutral,a disappointment yet still fun to watch very impressive visuals and enjoyable fan service but a story that like the force awakens leaned heavily on the original trilogy as a crutch to satisfy fans im sure as time goes by ill learn to live with it but for now it leaves a bad feeling in my stomach
Jan 6 2020,positive,the film is flawed and has issues with the flow of the film without a doubt it was a last minute finale throw together to hopefully satisfy the hardcore star wars fans i was entertained and found tons of enjoyment from the movie though i can completely understand why someone would be dissapointed
Jan 6 2020,positive,i would love to see an uncut version to see how it all fits together but i enjoyed how they tied up all the loose ends  the story was a little rushed but over all i loved it i loved all the cameos of people and critters through the years watching carrie fishers last film moments was a little surreal but i liked how that even turned out caught a few more things the second time around of watching it that i missed the first time glad i watched on the big screen before it came to video
Jan 6 2020,negative,over stuffed plot this should have been all three of the movies  then i have to wish they would respect the old star wars and stop misrepresenting fisher  you cant od on the force  leaving her in the bed for half the movie  in true jj fashion there are a lot of setups with no pay off i need to tell you storm troopers rebel horses one a star ship  its pretty and rey trains in the last movie but really would like my time and money back on this one
Jan 6 2020,positive,loved it  story line was good  lots of action and special effects
Jan 6 2020,negative,it may be worse than hudson hawk
Jan 6 2020,positive,loved it  it was long but i never was bored  it was well edited and told an interesting story  well worth going to on the big screen
Jan 6 2020,positive,great movie  i dont know what those haters are saying but they can hate all they want  go out there and appreciate the movie landed all the marks i left the theater with a big smile on my face
Jan 6 2020,positive,nice little bow out on top of the skywalker saga
Jan 6 2020,negative,not much could be done after the mess that was the last jedi this was a complete train wreck
Jan 6 2020,positive,not sure what the critics were hoping for  our whole family was cheering in their seats by the end
Jan 6 2020,positive,a good ending and final one at that to one of the longest running movie sagas in motion picture history well done the circle is now complete ben kinobee
Jan 6 2020,negative,you ruined my childhood played outside of cannon disgraced the entire cast of the original films undermined darth vadors character arch didnt even spell check the script it goes on and on and on disney who are you hiring i could have made a better trilogy by myself i wish i had applied not that you would have taken it seriously i spit on disney and reject everything they put out you will never make it up to me even the video games are trash mcguffin quest contrived bs movie that isnt even star wars
Jan 6 2020,negative,face it like every other star wars diehard fan youve been used to disappointment you knew this film will most likely be another disappointment after being let down from tlj yet like every other diehard fan you still went out to theater to see this film  i know because i am one of those diehard fanboys and im glad im now done with the now finale of the emotional rollercoaster we know was the star wars saga  star wars episode ix  the rise of skywalker tries to maintain the magic of the original while salvaging what was left from the previous episode there are many nods to the previous episodes and some attempts at genuine humor in this film expect a ton of nostalgia fanservice yet all the goodwill disney tries to impose on this film isnt enough to save it  there are massive plotholes that i wont disclose  ill let the youtubers do that there are characters that dont resonate with the audience loose ends dont get wrapped up where there are scenes that could have a significant consequence disney continues to play it safe and continue to please fans wanting nostalgia  if you are a star wars fan this movie wont make much sense if you are new to star wars this film wont make much sense as a standalone movie this film cannot hold up by itself  15 better than tlj but not enough to save this sinking ship forgettable at best and a disservice to fans at its worst
Jan 6 2020,positive,there was a plot to follow i didnt like the love scene between rey and ben
Jan 6 2020,positive,haters gonna hate it was great
Jan 6 2020,positive,it was great story line and had good action scenes
Jan 6 2020,positive,i thought it was a good end to an amazing story
Jan 6 2020,negative,i think i can write something much better
Jan 6 2020,neutral,my initial reaction to this movie was something like exhaustion i walked out of the theater breathless as if stepping off a roller coaster the rushed pace and little of actual substance is what makes this movie frustrating for me since the plot can basically be summed up as a bloated cast of characters trying find this mcguffin to find that mcguffin so they can find the place where things will finally happen it really could have slowed down stopped introducing new characters when the established characters already had little to do and spent time exploring the interesting elements particularly the sith planet  it was clear watching this there was never a plan for this trilogy the original star wars trilogy can be forgiven for not having a plan since the first film was a sleeper hit almost everyone involved expected to go straight to latenight tv and be forgotten forever there was no excuse this time disney decided to make three movies before they knew what they would be about it is a shame so much talent and resources were squandered on this mess they wrote themselves into a corner with the last jedi and the rise of skywalker cleaned up the damage in the only way it could but not entirely we never learn how lukes light saber ended up with maz kanata in the force awakens although i had already given up on learning this when luke tossed it away like a piece of garbage in the last jedi elements are set up at such as jannahs possible relation to lando calrissian and something important finn needs to tell rey but ultimately dont pay off supposedly this movie was being edited up to two days before the release and it shows i did like how this movie patched up the problems from the last jedi and avoided any woke social commentary damage control at the same time though this movie undid the significance of the original trilogy since this trilogy was basically a remake of the original in effect the original trilogy including darth vaders sacrifice didnt amount to anything in that sense the sequel trilogy ruined the original and we never even got a scene with luke han and leia together again unforgivable missed opportunity  this movie also ruins the emotional elements within it without getting into spoilers everything of emotional impact gets undone a few minutes later it is reminiscent of the droid factory sequence in attack of the clonesonce you realize nothing is really at stake you just feel bored and frustrated another criticism in the same vein is the force literally has no rules or limitations in these films it took all of lukes concentration to pull his light saber a few feet from the snow with the force in the empire strikes back here rey can stop a spaceship midflight with little effort using the force emperor palpatine seemed to shock luke for a few dozen seconds in return of the jedi without him suffering any lasting physical damage rey causes a spaceship to blow up with a brief spurt of force lightning in empire when luke was caught in the snowstorm he nearly froze to death and had to spend the night in a snow camels body cavity i have a feeling if rey were in a similar situation in one of these movies she would just conjure up a thermal force bubble the lack of limitations doesnt make much sense and constantly lowers the stakes making these movies boring  ultimately all i need to say about the movie is this every time ive described it to someone who hasnt seen it giving away spoilers and recounting the stillborn awkward millennial humor it always elicited laughter at how ridiculous it sounds in the telling return of the jedi had me in tears at the end the rise of skywalker had me scoffing that is certainly not the reaction you should have to star wars
Jan 6 2020,neutral,rotten tomatoes lies cheats on the score definitely paid by the corporate mouse and giving it an audience score of 86 hmmm  so in short the rise of skywalker is a horribly written illogical mess with some really cool scenes sound design fight scenes thanks to those it was somewhat enjoyable but also really cringy at points you dont write a trilogy on the go they could have written it before making the force awakens they had no idea what they want to do with this trilogy which is sad because whole tfa was very convenient and safe at least it gave the rest room to do something with it we got some decent characters new places new story arc but well the last jedi destroyed it and the the rise of skywalker couldnt save it actually it made it even worse  im heartbroken over this trilogy its a mess
Jan 6 2020,positive,loved it every generation is confronted with the struggle between light and darkness my generation had the original trilogy my kids will have this one they both tell the story in their own way i think this trilogy was a success
Jan 6 2020,positive,i really like the characters they have developed  i felt the movie answered a lot of questions
Jan 6 2020,positive,it reminded me of early 4 5 6 star wars
Jan 6 2020,positive,i loved this movie it made episode 7 and episode 8 make complete sense tied the story together nicely lots of action quips and suspense well written story great acting great effects i was very happy with what jj abrams did with this this trilogy is awesome
Jan 6 2020,neutral,5 out of 10  very formulaic  glad it is finally over  not worth a second viewing
Jan 6 2020,positive,loved seeing original characters  very entertaining
Jan 6 2020,positive,it was long ultimately worth it
Jan 6 2020,positive,an astounding  breathtaking and epinefrinefilled closure for the saga george lucas started back in 1977 coherent visually amazing and with a compelling story loved it as i loved the previous 8 episodes
Jan 6 2020,positive,excellent action scenes liked that rey a woman saved the galaxy and i enjoyed seeing characters who had died in past movies
Jan 6 2020,positive,the force is strong with this one great movie from beginning to end i saw on imax screen which was awesome
Jan 6 2020,positive,finally got to watch it and the biggest lesson learned for me it doesnt matter how deep blood runs in you you dont have to become your parents you always have a choice to become someone way better than why you were born into resist the wrongs your parents and their parents made and createbirth whats right for you and your own future
Jan 6 2020,positive,awesomeness great add on to star wars legacy
Jan 6 2020,positive,i liked it after considering the entire trilogy i think it was hurt by the change of directorswriters at the midpoint but apart from that the story was solid and the acting especially on the part of the driverridley was great it was long but could have been longer lots of content to cover
Jan 6 2020,positive,is good love this movie
Jan 6 2020,positive,like cotton candyenjoyable empty of nutrients over quickly doesnt really make sense lower your expectations and try to enjoy
Jan 6 2020,positive,there is a level of convenience of circumstance throughout the film but overall they resolve almost all the plot points from this trilogy while still shouting out the classic star wars films i enjoyed it more than i expected to my two nieces however were bored out of their mind
Jan 6 2020,negative,gofundme for adam driver and daisy ridley for carrying the entire franchise on their backs and for the cast for doing their best with a wonkass script its only a 2 because it was a wild ride if you only go to turn off your brain and the benrey relationship
Jan 6 2020,negative,no story lacks character development total fail imo
Jan 6 2020,positive,for true fans of the skywalker series it was an emotional roller coaster in a good way
Jan 6 2020,positive,fitting end to a great series
Jan 6 2020,positive,its a good movie the unfortunate thing is that there is no consistency with all 9 episodes this final episode was a disappointment its like they didnt make any effort to create a new villain
Jan 6 2020,positive,i always enjoy the special effects and yes the story of good vs evil its an evolving new story line i hope as actor actresses from the original series from the 70sage out or have passed
Jan 6 2020,negative,a disappointing end to an unnecessary trilogy sad to see this happen to such a beloved franchise
Jan 6 2020,negative,story line was okay not great acting and too many unnecessary additions to plot and characters to make it worth watching seems comedy aspect doesnt  quite work either this movie is worth watching when streaming  free on live tv not worth paying theater prices for lack luster film
Jan 6 2020,positive,its the best star wars film since episode v the empire strikes back jja got handed a steaming pile by rian johnson he also had to cope with a missing lead actress  carrie fisher he navigated some difficult story elements and still managed to make a compelling entertaining film with plenty of drama action and excellent dialog which is a huge departure from any of the terrible lucas dialog in episodes iiii it was a fitting end to the skywalker sagaand i thought he ended it perfectly absolutely perfectly
Jan 6 2020,negative,its pacing is a mess lots of it makes no sence and has no direction no good action
Jan 6 2020,positive,great way to wrap up the skywalker storyline or did they
Jan 6 2020,negative,this movie was slightly better than the last jedi but thats not really saying anything the rise of skywalker lightspeed skips its way along making this movie seem very rushed  it fails very badly in answering the many questions  plot absurities that come up this movie would have been far better if it slowed the pacing   spent time to develop the story
Jan 6 2020,negative,this movie was all over the place it felt like disney chopped this film up and stitched it back together multiple times with out of place shots some scenes maybe lasted 23 seconds and jumped to a different shot the story was painfully bad along with the pacing of this film fans hoped that after the disaster that was the last jedi we would finally get many burning questions answered but instead we left even more confused and upset ive seen the original films countless times but i dont think i will ever rewatch this trilogy
Jan 6 2020,positive,overall it was well acted and entertaining the pacing was very quick which can be confusing but also helps gloss over some big plot holes
Jan 6 2020,negative,the end of star wars saga was a real shame
Jan 6 2020,positive,i have seen it twice both in imax 3d and normal theatre i got a great movie from star wars universe this for me means great visuals cool and weird creatures all around new worlds likeable characters corny dialogues fun life wisdom and scenes which are super epic i got it all so i cant give less than five especially for the epic emotional duel scene on the death star where you soon realize kylo and rey dont fight each other but they are beating their own rage and pity till exhaustion till something bad must happen so they realize how stupid they both are this scene is one of my favourite from all star wars duels
Jan 6 2020,positive,i was just expecting a lot more  plot was not very exciting
Jan 6 2020,positive,i just enjoyed the movie for what is was and did not get critical it was entertaining
Jan 6 2020,negative,weve seen this movie fine times now this is a mess of a movie then again how could it not be  what kennedy has done to star wars is unforgivable how is she still employed
Jan 6 2020,positive,i thought it was a great star wars movie would put it at the top of the list
Jan 6 2020,negative,plot holes so large you could fly a super star destroyer through them but when you start a trilogy with no plan and then hire someone to subvert your expectations as well as any idea of where you were going with the story this is what happens sad pandering to fans in hopes that they not only ignore the aimlessness of the overall trilogy but the nonsense slapped together in this movie as well if youre a star wars fan save your money and go stream the mandelorian
Jan 6 2020,positive,if you liked episodes iv through vi best and dont have strict expectations this is an awesome completion
Jan 6 2020,positive,perfect way to end the saga
Jan 6 2020,positive,not a fan of this one
Jan 6 2020,positive,was slightly predictable but its the last one so to be expected
Jan 6 2020,positive,good movie even if you dont know the history still enjoyable
Jan 6 2020,negative,uninspired garbage boring ridiculous even if you dont like star wars movie sucked 
Jan 6 2020,positive,the best of the rey trilogy
Jan 6 2020,positive,full circle  it all came together  epic  worth the 2  12 hours buy extra popcorn
Jan 6 2020,positive,plot points were kind of dumb plot threads left unresolved
Jan 6 2020,positive,outstanding  full of adventure and excitement  its exactly what a star wars movie should be
Jan 6 2020,positive,was a great movie liked 3d effect
Jan 6 2020,positive,fantastic  a fitting and satisfying ending to a 9film 30year saga
Jan 6 2020,positive,didnt like it my first viewing more enjoyable after watching it a second time
Jan 6 2020,positive,coming from the fan base that treats the eulegends as the holy grail of what should have happened in star wars i think this is an awesome movie and everyone should watch it with an open movie i went in with a smile and left with one
Jan 6 2020,positive,i thought the movie was great  i really liked all the stars ie harrison ford billy dee williams mark hamel and carrie that were brought back even though they had small parts  i was really amazed with carrie fishers part
Jan 6 2020,positive,time to put it to rest running out
Jan 6 2020,positive,it was everything i had hoped it would be
Jan 6 2020,negative,i tried really hard to stay awake for this new star wars movie but i just gave in during the second half the story is rudimentary and the dialogue is just boring and stupid it is so obvious that a committee wrote and rewrote the script for the maximum safety thats how dc movies got ruined and disney just went to a new low with the star wars franchise no amount of special effect can keep me up for two hours if i cannot cheer for anyone in the movie definitely not recommended george lucas where are you
Jan 6 2020,positive,stayed true to its title great movie
Jan 6 2020,positive,wow my wife and i loved the story characters special effects and the cinematography im so glad that disney picked up the franchise and will continue to expand and improve with technology i think its sad that some purists are giving this film a bad rating simply because it wasnt part of the book series its a movie for petes sake  go forth and be entertained
Jan 6 2020,positive,it was awesome it did bring back the feel of original star wara seen as a teenager it was a treat to share and pass the legacy on to my teen we watched all the preceding films before seeing this one my daughter and i loved it it left you wanting more alas it is over the force is strong with this one
Jan 6 2020,positive,loved the movie wrapped everything up very well
Jan 6 2020,positive,where to start what a movie said to see it end
Jan 6 2020,positive,i enjoyed the film but the pacing was incredibly fast as jj tried to force in any and every way to undermine the previous film for no reason other than appeasing fans with that aside the film was incredibly emotional and will get your heart pumping
Jan 6 2020,positive,tons of action some parts of the story seemed rushed and a little confusing but it was fun its star wars after all
Jan 6 2020,positive,i waited 40 years for this
Jan 6 2020,positive,great job on the final episode  my son loved it as well
Jan 6 2020,positive,definitely the best of the sequel trilogy  obviously hard and high bar to make it the best with the original trilogy but its worth the price of a ticket  while the crawl was a bit odd and the opening was a bit choppy in the cuts the story and the characters were well developed and likeable but still human  and thats what makes a good movie
Jan 6 2020,positive,i thought the movie was really fun the action scenes were quite actiony the acting is pretty spot on and the fan service will really hit fans  that said i cant disagree with a lot of the criticisms that the movie is getting theyre all pretty on point but if youre just going to be entertained and arent expecting shakespeare you wont be disappointed
Jan 6 2020,positive,this is a great movie i have seen it 4 times in the theater and cant wait for 4k and 3d bluray home release its really the best movie we could have gotten considering how the sequels were handled palpatine is by far the best part of this movie
Jan 6 2020,positive,review rise of skywalker  i am a sci fi fan first and foremost star trek fan 2nd star wars fan 3rd has anyone seen this old old 2 movies called uhhh let me think empire strikes back return of the jedi  rise of skywalker which should be named reruns of skywalker and pals  if you have seen those you will have already seen this rise of skywalker  same theme  i am your father  yes  i am related to you and you dont know it different people different characters  same story sodont get your lightsabers out yet people i loved the movie i loved the cameos   but it was alot alot of cameos     come on disney get original  4 out of 5 stars
Jan 6 2020,positive,the movie is good while it has many many flaws and i can see why critics hate it as a long time star wars fan who knows about star wars legends it was amazing i recomend it to anyone
Jan 6 2020,positive,brought closure to the series and took care of 8 problems
Jan 6 2020,negative,it was all that i expected and worse
Jan 6 2020,negative,poor character development weak dialog the pacing was rushed movie felt like it was scripted to be a video game with just enough plot to get you to the next stage
Jan 6 2020,negative,in the biggest sign yet that hollywood has lost all its creative genius the franchise chooses for its finale to bring back the villain that it killed off six episodes ago  now theyve killed the whole franchise
Jan 6 2020,positive,loved that a lot of the characters from previous star wars movies were in this one hopefully there will be more and this will not be the last one
Jan 6 2020,negative,shot for shot remake of return of the jedi and filled with scenes dedicated to fixing the massive errors and plot holes made by rian johnson in the last movie carrie fisher is in a number of scenes and none of them feel right in fact it takes away from the movie  they should have just killed her character in the first scene
Jan 6 2020,positive,rose should have had a bigger role and some of the extreme close up shots were really grainy but otherwise good way to end an epic series
Jan 6 2020,positive,it is way too fastpaced in its first two thirds reutilizes many elements from previous films comes up with new uninspired subplots and supporting characters and is marked by plot twists that are anything but breathtaking the film is only saved from utter failure thanks to its everpresent nostalgia evereffective soundtrack everengaging characters with adam drivers kylo ren stealing the show and an explosive final act making it at least enjoyable and better than the poorlyconceived episodes i and ii for these reasons star wars episode ix the rise of skywalker is a weak closure for the most influential trilogy of trilogies of all time
Jan 6 2020,positive,entertaining  not that much of a fan to get bogged down in details  star wars officially over for me
Jan 6 2020,negative,the story was all over the place  thinking back to the original back in the seventies this story just didnt seem to have a good flow
Jan 6 2020,positive,movie was awesome it brought back past movies to tie them all together highly recommend
Jan 6 2020,positive,the best star wars since the first
Jan 6 2020,positive,the plot was excellent the characters made sense and didnt feel forced unlike episode 8
Jan 6 2020,positive,i was actually overwellemed by the action in the movie perhaps people should not ask to many det in what is basically an action movie
Jan 6 2020,negative,pretty stupid to be honest no self consistency with the rest of the universe contrived and base definitely better than the one before it but just feels like a trashy cash grab
Jan 6 2020,positive,great action film movie started a bit slower than i expected however it turned up the action and interest very quickly and the many glimpses and cameos from the past were very pleasing probably especially for those that saw the early films as young adultsthe action grew to the final battle and in the last scenes i could see other movie goers wiping their eyes along with me if you were a star wars fan or just like moviesthis is a must see
Jan 6 2020,positive,not realistic compared to traditional star wars
Jan 6 2020,negative,rise of skywalker lacked direction and appeared mindless in most of its direction once again very interesting characters are given bad development and writing that makes them overall unlikable uses nostalgia to manipulate the audience into a feeling of warmth towards it villain doesnt feel well earned or built up after 2 movies and feels like a shoe in settings scenery alien beings and creatures all extremely beautiful and well done action was also well done but appears at some points lazily choreographed very last scene on tatoine was well done to wrap up the skywalker storyline most of this movies problems stem from bad planning on previous movies parts and no direction within them either overall the only solution is to hand the franchise off to kevin feige
Jan 6 2020,positive,end of skywalker saga awesome good prevail against evil great message of hope and redemption your destiny is not dictated from family u r from palpatineevil but your choice to become a part of a better family skywalkergood who love u
Jan 6 2020,positive,the nostalgia and creativity remains with me as i recall in 1977 when i saw the first movie  a new hope at 17 years old good movie the finality will never come
Jan 6 2020,positive,this movie is incredible a lot of fans and critics say that this isnt a good film at all theyre right its not a good film its an amazing star wars movie the beginning may be choppy and rushed but after a while it makes sense honestly after the last jedi star wars fans needed this they may not all realize it now but hopefully they will eventually open up their hearts and minds to see that this is the ending were looking for ps ben solo palpatine and rey were undeniably incredible in the movie saw it twice cant wait to see it again may the force be with you
Jan 6 2020,negative,the last jedi done the damage and there was no way to prevent the disaster that came with the rise of skywalker even if the visuals was pretty good the weak story and contradictions between newest installment of skywalker saga and its predecessors was to disturbing to enjoy this movie
Jan 6 2020,negative,ancient sith dagger finds the way from death star 40 yr old wreckage thats just foolish lightsaber choreography sub par rey  kylo get together makes no lick of sense jj abrams needs to knock it off with the flashs hes trying to compensate for his lack of storytelling not great incredibly rushed with the writing  pacing is like sonic the hedgehog on koolaid
Jan 6 2020,positive,awesome conclusion to a saga full of hope
Jan 6 2020,negative,the storyline wasnt much of anything new  these characters have little to like about them  the humor seems out of place
Jan 6 2020,positive,i love they paid homage to the original trilogy with mirrored scene shots between rey and ben kylo ren
Jan 6 2020,negative,fast paced but lazy story telling too much crammed into one movie means youre constantly having to suspend belief at the how easily the whole story wraps up a real shame as the previous installment had some rich story telling and interesting leads for the continuation this is just popcorn fodder garbage
Jan 6 2020,negative,convoluted plot with major plot holes this movie nearly ruins everything established in the star wars universe actors not take to their full potential only adam driver was the redeeming quality and with the bar this movie set it doesnt seem that hard to do
Jan 6 2020,positive,exceptional acting great action fast paced better than average storyline  answered a lot of questions
Jan 6 2020,negative,pretty disappointed overall many plot holes were presented and character arcs were given forced endings
Jan 6 2020,positive,many may say it was somehow unfulfilling but i waited 42 years to see how this story would end im satisfied and it brought it all to an acceptable conclusion in my view time and lives have passed people things change and even our fantasies have to evolve with them thank you for the dreams george steve and jj
Jan 6 2020,positive,wonderfully outstanding worldclass  wow
Jan 6 2020,positive,the scenes with leia seemed forced for obvious reasons and adam driver never really cut it as a bad guy for me  otherwise it was a well done and satisfying finale  and please let it be the last one
Jan 6 2020,positive,loved it  dont let the critics scare you off this is a fun star wars movie and completes the skywalker saga wonderfully
Jan 6 2020,positive,it was too predictable for me the fact that rey was a palpatine and not just a force sensitive child was poorly written however i didnt exactly hate the film i did love the chemistry between the characters and the fact the saga is over is sad im hoping for separate arcs for rey and even for fin since fin too has the force
Jan 6 2020,negative,to long and confusing
Jan 6 2020,positive,loved the whole story
Jan 6 2020,positive,everything and the kitchen sinkhorses on a star destroyerum
Jan 6 2020,positive,beautiful star wats closing 
Jan 6 2020,negative,awful just awful contradics with tlj story and ending force healing and fakes deaths everywhere
Jan 6 2020,negative,3rd worst sw movie it does nothing new and fails to really explain any questions established by the prior two films completely shoehorns in palpatine just so it can tie the 9 films together but doesnt justify bringing the emperor back it plays out like a national treasure movie for the first half jumping from macguffin to macguffin really dumb but beautifully shot well enough acted better than the prequels anyway and john williams continues to do great work everything i would expect from a script written by the combined efforts responsible for batman v superman and star trek into darkness
Jan 6 2020,positive,this movie did something very different from the many other movies ive seen it brought a year to my eyes and when i saw the giant fleet appear out of hyperspace a smile appeared on my lips just as fast i loved the movie and i dont care what anyone else says this was a masterpiece and a great ending to a franchise of many ups and downs and this movie makes the last jedi look like attack of the clones so with that i feel it earns its title as the end to a great saga
Jan 6 2020,positive,it was better than expected didnt seem rushed like the previous two in this series
Jan 6 2020,positive,i grew up with the original trilogy was disappointed with the second trilogy and have enjoyed the third trilogy this is the best star wars movie ever it has the best plot best character development and best acting of any of the nine mainseries movies
Jan 6 2020,positive,my favorite movie it closes the star wars saga in a fantastic way i love it alllll
Jan 6 2020,positive,so many plot twists and it had a lot of action
Jan 6 2020,positive,i just didnt get the ending it doesnt fit at all but everything else was fine if we just ignore canon stuft
Jan 6 2020,positive,go see it for yourself we viewed it yesterday and it was a nice crowd pleasantly surprised just how good the movie was in fact we are not star wars buffs however this is a first class movie it was very good in all aspects
Jan 6 2020,negative,together with the last jedi the worst star wars movie ever produced i was swearing at the screen throughout the whole movie in cinema
Jan 6 2020,positive,better than star wars 8 but not better than any other star wars  star wars 8 was tied for worst star wars along side sw 1  phantom menace so star wars 9 is only slightly better   the good a fight scenes are good a lot less agenda   the bad movie is rushed and crammed with too much halfbaked story line the ugly continues butchery of force powers adding things that just dont make sense  includes all kinds of jumps in story that really are bad    summary while the names and characters still exist sw 9 like sw 8 pretends that the other 7 movies didnt exist why they butcher a story world and replace it with nothing good or consistent is beyond me  if sw 9 was the first in the series there never would have been a series
Jan 6 2020,positive,tons of special effects way out there for star wars it was suspenseful the whole movie great for star wars fans
Jan 6 2020,positive,this was far better than the critics thought the story held together but i had to wonder why the old timers looked so old as technology got so sophisticated surely they had figured how to slow down or reverse the aging process just saying
Jan 6 2020,positive,this is for the 4dx version the movie itself was 4 stars
Jan 6 2020,negative,just the absolute worst complete waste of time
Jan 6 2020,positive,i loved it all thank you for a truly wonderful film
Jan 6 2020,negative,absolutely terrible movie good still shots not going to lie they nailed those camera shots but the story is so bad and really doesnt make any sense and nothing has any consequence or risk for the good guys 
Jan 6 2020,negative,just awful  it didnt feel like star wars at all to me
Jan 6 2020,positive,i went in to watch this movie with hopes of getting a satisfying ending to the classic 40 year long saga and i got what i was looking for but as a movie alone there are several flaws and nit picks that brought down this movie for me even though it was a divisive movie i believe that disney should have kept then story lines from the last jedi so we could have a more satisfying conclusion to the trilogy this is a good ending to the saga but a flawed movie in whole
Jan 6 2020,positive,overall i thought the movie was great they did an amazing job on this film the ewoks even made a cameo the final scene between rey and kylo renben was not my fav but besides that it was great
Jan 6 2020,negative,get the thing so we can get the thing then big space battle what a wasted opportunity for the trilogy
Jan 6 2020,neutral,too much lifting this movie was trying to do way too much known characters were flat new characters werent developed logic was terribly flawed
Jan 6 2020,positive,jumped around way to much
Jan 6 2020,positive,we love the movie wish it did not have to end  have enjoyed star wars
Jan 6 2020,positive,good movie lots of action
Jan 6 2020,negative,a sloppy mess of an ending to a mediocre new trilogy that also does poorly wrapping up skywalker saga skip it
Jan 6 2020,positive,i liked the movie for the sake of star wars in general but it only passing quality was that it was eye candy the script for the movie and just how the characters were played couldve been more intriguing and actually gave them lines in example finn the force sensitive exstormtrooper most of his lines only consist of rey
Jan 6 2020,positive,viewing was awesome sound was too loud
Jan 6 2020,negative,if this were not a star wars movie it wouldve been pretty good not great by any means but pretty good ill list my top thoughts of it they played the luke skywalker theme way too many times its a great piece but overusing it takes away a bit from the spectacular moment near the end  the movie should have been longer i understand it is hard to keep an audience seated for three hours even endgame got boring in parts this movie however needed the extra time to tie up some loopholes such as how lando got so many supporters maybe more time spent on how palpatine actually got so many followers and materials for 10k evil ships  theres one thing i really liked about this movie and that is how they treated the death of carrie fisher through princess leia chewbaccas yells of sadness really brought the tears   overall movie eh star wars movie aweful
Jan 6 2020,positive,dont listen to the hype this is a great movie
Jan 6 2020,neutral,just nothing special was okay
Jan 6 2020,positive,great ending to a great saga
Jan 6 2020,positive,while i enjoyed myself watching the rise of skywalker it is not a great movie most of the complaints i have heard have been about how ridiculous fastpaced and messy this movie is but the more i consider these issues none of them would have been an issue had rian johnson progressed j j abramss story instead johnson tried to make what a star wars movie was in his opinion instead of what the fans wanted the last jedi did not progress anything in fact the story is back at square one by the end rey has barely learned anything luke barely did anything except show that johnson does not understand his character the casino planet was a waste of time holdo could have saved so much time and panic had she just told everyone they were going to seek refuge on the nearest base and snoke the supposed new big villain is killed without any story to his character   j j abrams had almost nothing to work with just the death of luke and rey  kylo rens force connection who else would be the villain other than palpatine who else could train rey but leia the only things i found truly dumb were the dagger that perfectly aligned with the death star remains and rey  kylos ridiculous use of the force ie grabbing a ship from the sky and magically making a lightsaber disappear into the others hands  this was a 4 hour movie crammed into 2 i hope that disney will allow for a directors cut so we can see a more clear but still fairly flawed movie
Jan 6 2020,negative,i was very disappointed  how do you have a light saber duel when youre light years apart too touchy feelly  i know  a disney thing  plus  the dead were popping up all the time the worst movie of the series  they could have done better
Jan 6 2020,positive,i throughly enjoyed it  it is definitely better than the last jedi this film was well done and answered questions that the star wars fan base had on rey
Jan 6 2020,neutral,all right movie to eat some popcorn a terrible conclusion of what was thought to be the skywalker saga this became the palpatine saga what a waste
Jan 6 2020,negative,special effects were really good and cinematography was good acting was good but script and plot were disjointed there was too much god mode force break abilities and the fan service felt faked and forced as part of a sw trilogy it was awful as a stand alone scifi movie with glowing sticks it was ok
Jan 6 2020,positive,two movies jammed into one trying to fix all the plot holes and omissions left by the trash fire that was the last jedi fast paced and full of action still a good popcorn movie with lots of fan service and yes that is a good thing you make movies for people that want to see them at times you see some great interaction between the main cast and it is evident what the trilogy could have been had disney and rian johnson no horrendously screwed up the second film however some of the new force powers shown are terribly op force healing seems natural and realistic to me and similar to other force powers but resurrection from the dead force lightning that destroys entire fleets transportation of material objects across the galaxy through a mind connection stupid
Jan 6 2020,negative,so many issues horses riding on a destroyer story continuity that sees rey become a superpowerful jedi with very few lessons that we were exposed to seeing poor ol kylo and a super super short expose to palpatine i mean  i kept away from spoilers for this movie and as soon as the start scrolling story lines appear they spoil what would have been a shocker for me only to leave me thinking meh dont mention all the ships at the end that appear it turned out to be laughable
Jan 6 2020,positive,its a cool movie with spectacular special effects but it suffers from some script flaws such as the unusual discovery of the jedis healing powers and its plot twist is absurd how did emperor palpatine have a child
Jan 6 2020,positive,a fun overstuffed movie some great star wars moments it walks back a lot of the choices made in tlj which is why i docked it a star i loved tlj realize many didnt
Jan 6 2020,positive,final star wars did not disappoint
Jan 6 2020,positive,great movie  a fitting ending
Jan 6 2020,positive,we loved it my boys 12  14 and i found it to be entertaining start to finish the closing scene in the jungle was a little corny but overall there movie was tons of fun
Jan 6 2020,positive,absolutely loved this movie
Jan 6 2020,neutral,upsetting conclusion to the skywalker saga its ashame that there was no cohesive plan for all 3 movies i felt even though tfa was a rehash or anh it was still a good jumping off point that all went to heck when most of the villans  luke were killed off in tlj this movie seems to not no what to do after tlj but rehash palpatine  bounce all over heck at light speed you can tell that tons of footage was cut  spliced together ending in a hodge podge of tropes  poor fan service im just saddened after tfa  rogue one were such a great start for disney star wars
Jan 6 2020,positive,it was a little long however doesnt seem like couldnt have fit all the different layers of the story in shorter time anyhow good acting lots of action some sentimental stuff might pull a few tears good movie definitely worth matinee price of 650
Jan 6 2020,positive,an acceptable if predictable conclusion to the storied franchise
Jan 6 2020,positive,ive been a fan since i was little loved everyone
Jan 6 2020,positive,best star wars so far
Jan 6 2020,positive,like star wars as one of the people who waited in long lines to see the first movie 7 times in 3 weeks its a must see
Jan 6 2020,positive,awesome  action packed the entire movie
Jan 6 2020,positive,hard to follow too many computer graphic fight scenes strung together
Jan 6 2020,positive,the movie was great great effects and great acting
Jan 6 2020,positive,great action scenes and story line
Jan 6 2020,positive,loved how it brought things together
Jan 6 2020,neutral,as we walked out after the show my wife said well that was just a hot mess but we still had to see it
Jan 6 2020,positive,good references to the first trilogy and it gs a fair ending not underwhelming cast did great
Jan 6 2020,negative,as a long time dedicated star wars fan i had hoped for a strong ending to the series  sadly this movie seemed more focused on backtracking on the last jedi than on developing a strong narrative ending  frantic pacing did not hide the plot holes
Jan 6 2020,negative,feels very unimaginative and boring doesnt conclude the trilogy well at all really disappointed as i was really looking forward to it
Jan 6 2020,negative,watched the first hour then got bored and left in the middle of a fight scene in rough seas i take it as a given that this is the end of the series it sure felt like it dead and buried
Jan 6 2020,positive,jj abrams fixed everything ryan johnson broke great sequel to episode vii just as if episode 8 never existed
Jan 6 2020,positive,could this movie have been more more catered to the professed fans more perfect in every way sure but i am old enough to remember when the empire strikes back was in theaters i went to see it with my family and loved the experience if i had instead seen the rise of skywalker i would have been blown away even more we tend to forget the shortcomings of the previous films which we have based all our fandom in the first place were we to judge new hope as harshly would it stand up to our scrutiny i doubt it we have been swept up in the collective tide of cultural mythology which exists now for star wars we all need to relax and appreciate just how amazing our storytelling has become since 1977 the rise of skywalker was a great film flawed yes but not enough to keep me from losing myself in the magic
Jan 6 2020,positive,if you are a fan of star wars you cant miss this my sons felt it was the best movie of the series
Jan 6 2020,positive,brought everything together
Jan 6 2020,positive,disney followed along with the original format  action were scenes were fun without going on too long  it was silly fun
Jan 6 2020,positive,thought it was well done and very entertaining  a few weak spots but over all excellent
Jan 6 2020,positive,absolutely a great watch
Jan 6 2020,negative,wow this is the worst movie ive seen this year  the dialogue  between actors is horrible  couldnt they find a better script writer for the final piece   everyone is overacting but i think alot of it is because of the dialogue they are stuck with  seems like the producers were just looking to get this out and make a buck
Jan 6 2020,positive,the whole movie  it closed many open ends and it was overall and awesome story
Jan 6 2020,positive,great ending to a great series
Jan 6 2020,positive,thoroughly enjoyable ending to the films if you go looking to be entertained you will be
Jan 6 2020,negative,better than tlj but bad movie
Jan 6 2020,positive,really enjoyed the movie husband found it slow at times
Jan 6 2020,positive,a few unanswered questions   but fun to watch
Jan 6 2020,positive,great movie i love it
Jan 6 2020,positive,fast paced action and motivated story line leaves lots of questions unanswered but the wrap up feels complete and purposeful
Jan 6 2020,positive,best in the final trilogy the themes of the saga were cohesive to the mythology and it really exceeded my expectations ive seen it 3 times already and will probably return to see it again
Jan 6 2020,positive,very entertaining   did not seem like a two and a half hour long movie really enjoyed it 
Jan 6 2020,positive,for once the story is well told
Jan 6 2020,positive,right on target with the story line and the end of the skywalker saga we look forward to a the new jedi series it was also amazing to see carrie fisher involved in this closure and memorializing  her persona
Jan 6 2020,positive,it was an alright finish to the series
Jan 6 2020,positive,loved it awesome way to close the series
Jan 6 2020,negative,not a single new idea just bigger louder and somehow cornier versions of every plot point joke and reference from the earlier films an exercise in corporate cowardice
Jan 6 2020,positive,we are star wars fans so it was awesome
Jan 6 2020,positive,another action packed adventure
Jan 6 2020,positive,entertaining but a bit cheesy this time
Jan 6 2020,positive,i love all of the star wars i have all of them at home and ill be adding this one to my collection
Jan 6 2020,negative,its was very bad for me as a true star wars fan things doesnt make any sense the story the characters and the plots doesnt go together at all
Jan 6 2020,positive,my kids loved it  im a bit star wars out  i found it a bit cheesy but great for the kids
Jan 6 2020,positive,it was good kind of disappointed that it received such negative reviews it was a solid movie and i almost didnt see it due to the mixed reviews
Jan 6 2020,positive,the ending was ok movie was once again nothing legendary
Jan 6 2020,positive,emotional roller coaster  cinderella story  some quirky plot points but anything that makes me feel that way has got to be doing something right
Jan 6 2020,positive,loved the action and the old characters who appeared
Jan 6 2020,positive,one of the best star wars movies
Jan 6 2020,positive,we loved it great way to tie up the trilogy
Jan 6 2020,negative,i am so disappointed in what jj and disney did to star wars  this is easily the worst of of the 10 movies
Jan 6 2020,neutral,cheesy i only gave it 25 rating because the saga is finally over
Jan 6 2020,negative,the worst ending for a kinda decent trilogy
Jan 6 2020,positive,fantastic transition adding carrie fisher into the movie
Jan 6 2020,negative,dont waste your time or money just rewatch the originals instead
Jan 6 2020,neutral,after my first time watching the rise of skywalker i had prequellevel hatred for the film it was such a massive disappointment now that ive seen it a second time i found some minor enjoyment so if theres less vitriol in this review its merely because i gave it a second shot and was able to anticipate all the awful things so they wouldnt be as annoying i think the first thing that jumped to my mind when watching this film is that it felt like someone at the studio spent way too much time on twitterreddit pages that were full of last jedi haters between the way they almost completely wrote rose out of the film to the way they changed reys history it was such an overcorrection that you could almost watch this movie right after the force awakens and pretend the last jedi never existed while im underwhelmed by the last jedi and have some major problems with its story structure this certainly wasnt what i wanted them to do in followup the biggest problem with the rise of skywalker is its script this is a horriblywritten film and even when the dialogue works what is happening on screen makes almost zero sense but not all the blame can be placed at the feet of these writers although whoever decided to hire the guy who wrote batman v superman and justice league to work with jj abrams on this movie should be fired the problems with this film didnt start here they actually started more than 10 years ago a decade ago as disney began plans to create a new sequel trilogy they did not have the foresight to hire one writing team to plan out the entire trilogy instead they decided to make one movie and then hand the reins off to someone new for each subsequent film for all their faults the prequels at least have a consistent story arc but this trilogy is a mess of mixed messages and disjointed theming its infuriating how poorly these 3 movies hold together as a single narrative i appreciate some of the action sequences in this film and i think adam driver elevates every scene hes in because hes a truly great actor there are also some excellent moments with c3po that reminded me of the original trilogy while i dont like the everexpanding power of the force that seems to be nearly limitless now i did like the way they used it a few times with rey and kylos continued forcetime conversations thats about where the good stuff ends ive heard several people talk about how much this film felt rushed but i couldnt help feeling that it was rushing to nowhere the movie is like a scavenger hunt where they seek out one macguffin after the next and then they arrive at the climax through a completely different way so everything before that was pointless the rise of skywalker has some enjoyable elements but its definitely the worst film of the sequels and has convinced me that the original trilogy is probably all the star wars i need
Jan 6 2020,negative,they tried to wrap it all up and just failed to do it with the same humor and any originality  the plot doesnt hold up especially where they bring back the emperor  there are a couple of scenes where you might think youre watching a harry potter movie  they need to seriously edit this movie then run it again
Jan 6 2020,positive,classical star wars at its best
Jan 6 2020,positive,took my eight year old grandson and he was mesmerized as was i great story line and effects liked the people portrayed and the good over evil not enough of that would see it again
Jan 6 2020,positive,i thought it was an excellent movie well put together answering all the unknown questions and tying everything together
Jan 6 2020,negative,this movie was such a waste of potential the last jedi set up an excellent optimistic ending that could have rallied laymen and laywomen to the resistance instead of continuing on that plot thread rise of skywalker spends more time trying to undo the last jedi than build its own plot   half the movie is spent trying to track down an object that turns out to not be necessary anyway   huge character development moments are thrown out then abandoned as quickly as the next scene  characters make choices that are contrary to their own desires or motivations up to that point   there are so many problems with this movie i couldnt list them all i literally lost count
Jan 6 2020,positive,this movie exceeded my expectations i am a die hard star wars fan and i had watched my favorite youtubers talk about the movie for the past year or so and i went in expecting it to suck but it was really good there are a few plot issues in the movie probably from all the editing that george lucas had to do to save it but it is very entertaining overall
Jan 6 2020,positive,was the best of 7  9 i would give it a 75 out of a possible 10
Jan 6 2020,positive,great movie  loved it
Jan 6 2020,positive,the fight scenes were incredible but the movie lacked a strong story i mean rose the main character of last jedi was just thrown in there for the shortest amount of time
Jan 6 2020,positive,the usual spectacular graphics and action packed thrills you expect  the story line with its twists and surprisesgreat   cameos of the original was a bonus
Jan 6 2020,positive,although it is the end of my childhood i can appreciate the journey this movie hand the ones previous have brought me to this movie laves a few open story lines to be considered rey is now rey skywalker where will her story continue on the galaxy far far away the return of lando flying with chewie the entire sith legion destroyed what does the new galaxy have to protect itself from now
Jan 6 2020,neutral,not as bad as the last one but thank gawd its over for now 
Jan 6 2020,positive,we took our daughter to this movie and she absolutely loved it it had some wow moments to what the heck moments  to awesome moments great movie
Jan 6 2020,positive,liked that many  major cast members from the original star wars reprised their roles in this one good story special effects and humor
Jan 6 2020,positive,i absolutely loved this movie 5 stars all the way great way to end the greatest story in science fiction history
Jan 6 2020,positive,true star wars fashion it did not disappoint
Jan 6 2020,positive,not much of a story line
Jan 6 2020,positive,it was awesome after you see it dont share with others who havent sad to see the star wars saga end i saw the first star wars in 1977 and the last in 2020 enjoy the movie
Jan 6 2020,positive,better than the last jedi some huge surprises in it
Jan 6 2020,negative,this film was a waste of two hours i will never get back it created more questions then it answered which normally is a great thing but with this movie that isnt the case it almost felt like watching a childs play everybody hold hands and sing kumbaya type of deal without stating any spoilers this franchise has made the prequels absolutely irrelevant the only thing ros has over the other two titles is that you arent being force fed sjw content near as much
Jan 6 2020,positive,let me start off by saying i am not a star wars fan boy  i enjoy the movies but the comparisons to the originals and not viewing the newest trilogy on its own merit is not how i go into these movies  i felt the first movie in this trilogy force awakens was good while the last jedi had some serious pacing issues  now that we have a basis of opinion to build off of here is my review  this movie is what i want out of a 2 12 hour movie  its a strong mix of action then story action then story  i never felt the lulls that came with the second movie the last jedi  the story was entertaining but surface level  this movie wrapped up storylines rather than expand on anything new  overall its a star wars movie  you know what you are getting yourself into  though they are not all created equal this one is definitely worth seeing
Jan 6 2020,negative,the movie seems like a collage of ideas with unrelated scenes weakly connected by a wholly unbelievable plot    on the positive side the special effects were stunning i had no issues with the acting daisy ridley rey finally got a character arc all those things were positive  but the story was so silly that i felt completely disconnected from the film  these characters deserved better
Jan 6 2020,positive,liked the story but expected more advanced technical effects
Jan 6 2020,positive,this movie saved the trilogy
Jan 6 2020,positive,it could be much better but it could be much worse kylo is the best character of this generation and had a pretty decent end ben solo forever other saber calors warmed my heart missed more sw rebels lead references
Jan 6 2020,positive,enjoyed every minute of it
Jan 6 2020,positive,this movie was perfect almost as good as episode 1
Jan 6 2020,positive,way better than vii and viii it totally redeemed the entire 9 movie saga  i loved it great storytelling techniques
Jan 6 2020,positive,i loved how the movie tied in to the first trilogy and the story came full circle it was action packed throughout with emotions jumping back and forth between hope and disappointment truly a great way to finish off the third trilogy
Jan 6 2020,positive,the movie flowed well loved the story line great action i was sad when it was over
Jan 6 2020,positive,it was nice a good ending to the saga
Jan 6 2020,positive,i am a star trek fan did not think i would enjoy this movie even though the plot maybe different from star trek i enjoyed this movie full of action and the story line kept you wanting the next scene
Jan 6 2020,positive,not thrilled with the way it handled the resolution  too much disney influence
Jan 6 2020,positive,that it had a twist at the end
Jan 6 2020,positive,great ending to the skywalker saga look bed the specialefffects as always and as did a wonderful job inserting footage of carrie fisher to tie up the story with leia cant wait to see the next adventures of rey finn and poe
Jan 6 2020,positive,the movie took us back to the original 3 sws which we liked we have not seen one for years so this was a nice trip down memories past
Jan 6 2020,positive,they did a great job of wrapping up the skywalker saga with this movie  great story amazing cinematography and seamless special effects  i cant wait to see it again
Jan 6 2020,positive,they saved the best for last of the latest three
Jan 6 2020,positive,amazing best star wars ever made in my opinion
Jan 6 2020,positive,wonderful ending to a series that spanned decades
Jan 6 2020,positive,while lacking in character growth for some of the main cast minus rey and kylo episode 9 was a fun and action packed conclusion to the saga wasnt a fan of the text crawl and its never explained why palpatine is back that being said ian mcdiarmid is fun as always on screen a lot of fan service but only a couple of moments i wasnt a fan of spoilers chewy getting his medal was egregious but i digress the films comedic beats land more than they did in the last jedi and some of the action was better executed in this film even though the last jedi was better shot than this film at times the film feels like its in a rush to get to the conclusion as there is barely any time to breath in the film c3po was actually used well in this film and he had some of the better comedic moments overall i feel this film and trilogy as a whole could have been handled better and would have been if disney planned out the story in its entirety but despite that they have delivered some solid star wars films and concluded the saga with a solid action adventure 7510 not as good as tlj but more entertaining then tfa
Jan 6 2020,positive,too long  not enough left on the cutting floor  way too much magic for a scifi movie
Jan 6 2020,positive,action packed it kept moving not too many slow times  felt like they condensed two movies into one it was a bit too fast
Jan 6 2020,positive,it is my favourite star wars movie so far
Jan 6 2020,negative,just simply terrible very schizophrenic
Jan 6 2020,positive,jj abrams brings a fun and exciting energy to this movie since im a fan of the last jedi  i was not too big of a fan of this movie mostly beacuse jj just kind of forgot about episode 8 and retconed alot from it altough the movie brings a somewhat satisfying ending to the skywalker saga
Jan 6 2020,neutral,too crazy   little suspension of disbelief   you transport yourself mentally  to battle but not know where the battle is occurring   it was kinda of lame and didnt hold my attention    i wanted to leave early but my wife would not let me this was last hope for a great star wars movie ill not pay for another
Jan 6 2020,positive,great action great storyline great special effects awesome ending to a great series
Jan 6 2020,positive,great action with plot twist sad to happy moments kept you wondering whats next
Jan 6 2020,positive,although too rampant and with buts it seems like a dignified and elegant conclusion to the saga and fans know it
Jan 6 2020,positive,we love all the star wars movies keeps you on your edge
Jan 6 2020,positive,loved everything i actually had tears in my eyes several times ive watched star wars from the beginning and this was a perfect way to end the series
Jan 6 2020,positive,too loud too violent
Jan 6 2020,positive,fun and fastpaced a great conclusion
Jan 6 2020,positive,this was a fitting way to end the skywalker saga i think they did well to answer questions and button things up
Jan 6 2020,negative,hated it  contrived predictable boring poor acting too long  if like that 25 hours of my life back please
Jan 6 2020,negative,this only has star wars name on it hope disney goes bankrupt over this 
Jan 6 2020,positive,great way to end the saga even though in the books ben and rey were actually han and leias twins  great to see lando one last time  only downer finn never got to tell rey he loved her
Jan 6 2020,positive,awesome film for true star wars fans
Jan 6 2020,positive,great way to end the series everything came together
Jan 6 2020,positive,all the components of the best star wars lovable droids kitcky dialogue good vs evil action packed impressive stunts great acting
Jan 6 2020,positive,thought it was a fair end to a great series took you back
Jan 6 2020,negative,this is the end of a failed endeavour to continue the legacy of the jedi saga unfortunately this attempt is still far far away from what the public wants but its ok as it brought more merchandise to sell so disney must be happy i am not
Jan 6 2020,negative,had quite a bit of potential however too much political agenda too much reliance on mcguffins and not on proper story telling or character development stop introducing new people and give us decent character arcs
Jan 6 2020,positive,everything is perfect
Jan 6 2020,positive,forget critics very fun and entertaining
Jan 6 2020,positive,was epic in many ways especially the final battle was saddened my all the deaths but i knew eventually those characters were going to die somehow overall very good conclusion to the skywalker saga
Jan 6 2020,positive,like the movie from star to end
Jan 6 2020,positive,although this movie was convoluted and at times confusing the special effects were again top notch jj abrams really should have considered that the younger fans of star wars like the series period no thinking about subplots or why this and why that kiss it
Jan 6 2020,positive,its quite sad to think that a series that began just before i was born has finally closed its doors for the final time  at least i hope its the final time as i wouldnt want such a legendary franchise to start losing any creditability you feel with a movie like this that critics are just waiting for something or anything to go wrong but i felt it ended the saga positively and emotionally with several references and cameos from iconic characters from the past it was a fitting ending and tribute to what has to be the most infamous film series of all time 
Jan 6 2020,negative,what a lousy movie finally this trilogy is over with
Jan 6 2020,positive,i thought that the movie was great
Jan 6 2020,positive,i enjoyed the movie as a whole and they do a lot of good to repair the mistake episode 8 was this being said its star wars there will be cheesy and ridiculous moments 45 i would recommend and would watch again
Jan 6 2020,negative,not a stat wars fan so i looked at it like any other movie i have seen all of them and other then then first one  they are all the same good wins evil wins good wins predictable story line
Jan 6 2020,positive,a fun ride and fitting end to the trilogy rise of skywalker had to do 2 films worth of work to carry on from the last jedi creating a fast paced and exciting adventure full of classic star wars fandom i left with hope for the franchise something i was not expecting
Jan 6 2020,positive,predictable and a few jump the shark end moments pulled it off well
Jan 6 2020,neutral,it was really interesting but overall is just pew pew laser flying everywhere with a poor story telling
Jan 6 2020,positive,fantastic movie action packed and so much fun
Jan 6 2020,positive,watch it on tv not even 3d makes it better
Jan 6 2020,positive,great ending to the skywalker saga
Jan 6 2020,positive,a satisfying end to a very messy trilogy 3 films that are individually good to watch but together are just incoherent the fact there was no plan for all 3 from the outset is very blatant    the rise of skywalker does its best to mend issues from the last jedi and answer some of the questions in force awakens and is certainly a fun yet messy ride adam driver and daisy ridley are magnetic kylo ren is far and above the best character from this trilogy and again is the best thing about this film finn could have been so much more with such an interesting story but he was completely misused in the trilogy and poe as likeable as he is was ruined in the last jedi   the trilogy as a whole could have been so much more but i believe we still got 3 good individual films in the end
Jan 6 2020,positive,great ending to a trilogy
Jan 6 2020,positive,it was good but the first one  was best of them all
Jan 6 2020,positive,the plot was good despite the negative reviews by the critics
Jan 6 2020,positive,an end to a saga a trilogy and a beautiful part of my childhood i couldnt ask for a better conclusion it was extremely satisfying to watch they ended with the same sunset from the beginning cant get better than that if you ask me sure the film wasnt perfect but im ok with that what was perfect to me outweighs what isnt the score is astonishing as ever with tweaks here and there that are subtle but beautiful the special effects were truly prodigious the acting was very schmaltzy in a good way i enjoy a good nostalgia trip every now and then i felt so many emotions watching this and i was intrigued almost every second its more or less the subtle things that the film doesnt shove in your face that are truly moving im excited to see what else the great minds at disney studios and lucasfilm have in store for us in the future because this is the happiest ive been in a theatre in a long time
Jan 6 2020,positive,good movie a bit too much special effects and explosions which got in the way of the plot lines  seemed like some plot lines like the snake had been cut to get it down to what was a long movie spoiled by theater not showing in 3d imax as ticketed
Jan 6 2020,positive,perfect no probably number 5 star wars film after original trilogy and rogue one if you dont count the mandalorian after the mess of the last jedi no way it could be perfect jj abrams should have just had the entire trilogy  some magic in this movie evocative of new hope or empire but not perfect
Jan 6 2020,positive,being a star wars fan for the last fortytwo 42 years i was highly impressed by this movie it was exciting and entertaining nothing at all like the bad reviews i read online it was amazing
Jan 6 2020,positive,it was starwars always good
Jan 6 2020,positive,it was fine and not as bad as you might believe as long as you dont think about it too much and enjoy the movie and atmosphere once you do start thinking about it though most is this movie is just a load of bullshit although i understand how it came to this  as a standalone movie yeah it was nice as a star wars trilogy ender should have been much better
Jan 6 2020,positive,was lacking in some areas but over all i think they did an ok job must see the jj cut though because there so much more they could have and probably did do but disney did what they do best and out then san franciscos slippers and cleared their throat for their share holders but the actors did well and i think jj tried but unfortunately disney is the english word for sith empire check the movie outdo it
Jan 6 2020,positive,epic and emotionally absorbing with lots of chemistry and a characterdriven story this is a great ending for a series that spans three generations of viewers
Jan 6 2020,positive,it was an enjoyable movie and a fitting ending to the series
Jan 6 2020,positive,great movie screw the critics jj salvaged the shitshow that was left after tlj starts off a bit too rushed at the beginning but once it picks up steam it is really enjoyable
Jan 6 2020,negative,a mess who tries to compensate so hard for all that episode viii lacked at least it is packed with action that maintains you distracted the main characters remain with no appeal though kylo ren had a somewhat satisfactory end of his arch a fitting end to a trilogy who was never planned as a coherent story but a nostalgiaappealing moneymaking
Jan 6 2020,positive,loved it just saw it for the second time gripping from the opening scene
Jan 6 2020,positive,it was good the ending could have been better though
Jan 6 2020,positive,great movie if your a star wars fan i loved it
Jan 6 2020,positive,the best film i have ever seen  5 star so good
Jan 6 2020,positive,awesome conclusion to the series
Jan 6 2020,negative,an exercise of nostalgia in a desperate attempt to save the plot disaster of tlj
Jan 6 2020,positive,i love it the story all of it was perfect
Jan 6 2020,positive,loved it i have seen all of them and this one in real 3d was like being in the movie or like a long ride i enjoyed it very much and plan to go again with my kids
Jan 6 2020,positive,id like to know how george lucas envisioned the saga ending jj abrams is great and the movie was great but it didnt feel like it really went along the star wars line
Jan 6 2020,positive,i found this movie to be just okay and entertaining but i dislike the fact that disney wanted to kill off all of the original star wars main characters we grew up with it was a nice surprise to see harrison ford return and billy dee williams come back into action i was satisfied with the ending with the cast celebrating in the land of the ewoks i hope it is not the end for our new star wars cast of daisy ridley john boyega oscar isaac and i hope we see them again in a new trilogy adventure in the 2030s or sooner
Jan 6 2020,positive,people who hate this movie are nuts
Jan 6 2020,positive,it was entertaining enough and felt more like star wars than the rest of the sequel trilogy the only redeeming factor for tros was that it was worlds better than the steaming pile of sht rian johnson gave us in the form of tlj
Jan 6 2020,negative,so the movie was overall pretty bland and pointless and random too tbh like this whole bringing in palpatine out of nowhere i didnt feel much of an attachment to most of the characters so most of it was pretty boring the rey and ben parts were amazing and there was so much wasted potential their chemistry was hit only soul in this movie the worst movie of the st in my opinion
Jan 6 2020,positive,it was anything but a hopeful and satisfying end
Jan 6 2020,positive,its a disney movie not star wars
Jan 6 2020,positive,how can you not watch this movie
Jan 6 2020,positive,loved it we had a blast from beginning to end my 9 yr old inner child was happy with droids creatures ships battles and lightsabers especially loved the darkness of this one we had a great time
Jan 6 2020,positive,excellent special effects as always i just wish the story had circled around back to the prophecy like expected but no mater what you have heard about the movie or the controversy  surrounding it it is still worth seeing in the theater at least once may the force be with us all
Jan 6 2020,negative,a simple example of why writing is more important than visual effects the writing makes this movie a boring mess of crippling plot conveniences the only reason there is to watch this movie is for the emperor rey is a constant annoyance a complete mary sue with little training of any kind with a light saber and the force yet she knows how to do both quickly not only that but she trains with a light saber not a blaster or a ship yet she can shoot and pilot anything that she sees this film and its trilogy is a complete disgrace to all of the star wars movies before it nit including the two disney prequels
Jan 6 2020,positive,great action great actors
Jan 6 2020,positive,like the story and action scenes
Jan 6 2020,positive,awesome i loved it all cried laughed and cried some more i was 10 in 77 and went to see the first matinee and stayed till they closed one show after the next been a fan ever since i am sad that the skywalker story is over  but they is always hope may the force be with you always
Jan 6 2020,positive,while the movie did seem squished with plot points it was satisfying to see the story coming to the conclusion abrams chose to show hopefully theres a directors full length cut out there that shows the full story development someday
Jan 6 2020,positive,excellent all end in the end thanks disney
Jan 6 2020,positive,got to a point it put me to sleep
Jan 6 2020,positive,great story and visuals true to the saga
Jan 6 2020,positive,great end to a saga wonderful characters and surprising
Jan 6 2020,positive,such a great movie i am glad that j j adams directed it
Jan 6 2020,negative,not a typical star war movie
Jan 6 2020,positive,some parts were a little slow
Jan 6 2020,positive,great picture but it cod be vedder
Jan 6 2020,positive,i love imax movies and i love star wars movies on imax so much fun
Jan 6 2020,positive,it is strange in some parts but watch it a second time and youll love it
Jan 6 2020,positive,it definitely was a lot better than i thought it was gonna be had a few unexpected parts but was still a tad cliche
Jan 6 2020,positive,the movie bring a felling that you can fell with the oldest movies its for star wars lovers
Jan 6 2020,positive,it was really enjoyable a lot better than ep 8
Jan 6 2020,positive,as a huge starwars fan i think this was a great and emotional ending to the saga good job jj
Jan 6 2020,positive,i dont know why the critics were saying that people shouldnt watch it i thought it was overall a great movie and potentially the best in the trilogy
Jan 6 2020,positive,this movie was an absolute blast  it ends the trilogy perfectly  i highly disagree with the critics  i give this movie a 100 for audience score
Jan 6 2020,positive,beginning was a bit mashed together as the story progressed the groove of the movie was amazing to get into the ability to see the final bow on the star wars universe be tied together by jj abrams perfectly gave me chills it is worth a watch but one thing i will say before going into this film is that you will need to brush up on how much you know about the star wars universe from the expanded universe to all 9 of the films the more you know the easier it will be to understand
Jan 6 2020,positive,it was great loved the end
Jan 6 2020,negative,so much potential but a rushed mess and a sad conclusion to a legendary franchise
Jan 6 2020,positive,i loved all of it u should go see it
Jan 6 2020,positive,i thought it was great
Jan 6 2020,positive,perfect i couldnt have asked for more 
Jan 6 2020,positive,good movie would recommend if you like star wars
Jan 6 2020,negative,sucked what a mess why couldnt they just leave the original three alone  angers me as a child of the eighties
Jan 6 2020,positive,liked the movie generally and there were extremely good moments i feel like there should have been more to the ending and feel like ben did not get his justice but i loved the development of ray
Jan 6 2020,positive,awesome actionpacked wrap up that brings the audience full circle in a moving closure of the saga told over the past 40 years i was a teenager when the first star wars came out and this was a fitting ending that took me back to those early days when we first met our beloved characters
Jan 6 2020,positive,satisfying conclusion to this most recent trilogy not a dull moment
Jan 6 2020,positive,i dont know how i feel about this movie first it feels like it should have been split into two movies the plot is way too convoluted and strait up ignores most of the last jedis decisions the last jedi had some bad parts but i dont think the way to correct them was to undo a majority of them this sequel trilogy as a whole was all over the place as far as im concerned return of the jedi wrapped up the skywalker story well enough
Jan 6 2020,positive,for the last star wars it was really good
Jan 6 2020,negative,what is there to even like
Jan 6 2020,positive,ranks up there with iv new hope
Jan 6 2020,positive,entertaining and wraps the storylines
Jan 6 2020,positive,i loved it action emotion  and a huge space battle awesome
Jan 6 2020,positive,good action and story ty
Jan 6 2020,positive,great ending to the story only a few small things left to the imagination  plot holes but all in all it was really good
Jan 6 2020,positive,i like the action and adventure aspect of the movie its entertaining but thats all it is i dislike the story i felt almost no emotional weight in scenes where there should be some
Jan 6 2020,negative,i have been a lifelong fan of star wars  disney completely ruined the skywalker saga
Jan 6 2020,positive,episode 9 brings closure to 3 final set of 3 the way disney as changed the story line my son and i enjoyed it
Jan 6 2020,positive,loved it  not perfect but pretty darn good
Jan 6 2020,positive,i enjoyed it wasnt the best of the 11 main movies but i thought it was good wrapped up the main story left some questions open but those could be answered in a disney plus show
Jan 6 2020,positive,great effects  some surprises too many fights worth seeing
Jan 6 2020,negative,i was so disappointed in this movie a movie i had high hopes for next to cats a movie that i had low expectations with i will take cats any day than rewatch this movie like i said cats was way better and needs more appreciation one thing for sure people are going to tell me where were you when star wars came out i would say i was enjoying cats and i highly recommend it dont listen to other peoples opinion thats why you have your own go see it you might like it you never know
Jan 6 2020,negative,jj abrams proves once again that he has no imagination of his own
Jan 6 2020,negative,bad movie  miss the old star wars movies
Jan 6 2020,positive,it was very predictable made it kind of boring
Jan 6 2020,positive,fantastic completion to a 43 year story
Jan 6 2020,positive,loved it jj abrams really did justice to the story arc and the film had lots of great surprises
Jan 6 2020,positive,on a comparative scale from episode 1 to episode 8 i give episode 9 a middle rating the story was week repetitive  discombobulated but the cgi stuff especially with the resurrection of carrie fisher was fantastic if you are a star wars fan it doesnt matter how good or bad it is it is a must see
Jan 6 2020,positive,the reviews for this movie should all a nostalgic and action all in one 
Jan 6 2020,positive,perfect way to end series
Jan 6 2020,negative,too many new concepts with the force
Jan 6 2020,positive,i think that is not the best movie of star wars but is a good end to the saga 
Jan 6 2020,positive,loved it great ending to a legacy
Jan 6 2020,negative,i for one thought that this movie would be awesome when i went to see it about thirty minutes in you could not only tell the difference but they have butchered this saga this movie rise of skywalker is left with so many questions and honestly the feel is nothing like the rest honestly ive given every other movie a five star this movie being a huge fan of dc comic marvel start wars star trek and many more disney is clearly destroying not just what george lucas built and stan lee but they have destroyed each of these sagas the brilliant art work their predecessors worked so hard to create it this movie was a huge let down honestly it sadness me that soon every super hero saga etc will be not even worth watching due to the fact disney will completely and already has destroyed the ending movie of star wars they should keep to what they are good at and let those who still are here today finish their art regardless of weather they own it or not its bad enough they want to monopolize and make billions off just owning the rights but they have to destroy the legacy and story line
Jan 6 2020,positive,i thought it was great nice way to wrap up the series and always takes me back to childhood i was happy with it
Jan 6 2020,positive,liked bringing old characters back for a quick look  no complaints at all
Jan 6 2020,positive,it was better than expected  i tested up 4 times and full on cried once i know im not the only one jj did fantastic and i honestly wouldnt chance anything about it except maybe the horses which played out a bit cheesy but i still enjoyed it my husband my 7 year old daughter who went to the movies as rey and myself loved every second of it
Jan 6 2020,positive,loved the movie the theater was disgustingly dirty from the concessions to the bathrooms
Jan 6 2020,negative,that it was incosistan not just with the trilogy but the it self it destroys all the universe that george lucas created it does not connect with nothing
Jan 6 2020,positive,this movie is fine on its own but placing in a trilogy thats supposed to wrap up an entire saga felt out of place and kind of a mess it was well acted and well shot but the writing wasnt there still would recommend seeing if youre a star wars fan like myself
Jan 6 2020,negative,one of the ten worst movies ever every time i woke up i saw the same scene again space ships shooting so phoney there were even horses galloping on space ships really lets bury this franchise forever
Jan 6 2020,positive,great continuance of a 32 year old franchise
Jan 6 2020,negative,horrible movie tried to bring back everything from before cast just sucks the overt effort to make women the stars is just pathetic  the original trilogy with harrison ford and carie fisher were some of the greatest movies of all times these just try way too hard to be overtly politically correct 300 destroyers yet finn just knows which one to go for so so dumb  we were all rooting for the good guys to die too thanks disney for ruining star wars
Jan 6 2020,positive,this was the beat star wars movie to date this was amazing and to discover who rey is the grand daughter of was shocking the sith are done forever
Jan 6 2020,positive,didnt like how loud the movie was but the movie itself was excellent
Jan 6 2020,positive,i loved the story and the action 
Jan 6 2020,positive,contains spoilers  im sorry to all the folks unhappy but i for one am stoked about the return of palpatine he is my favorite character i love how erratic he has always been the story line of ben solo is so rich and the cheesey references to classic star wars films were delightful and in my opinion very much in the star wars spirit star wars since day one has been a cheese fest this is by far my favorite of the disney star wars films and i walked into it thinking this one would be garbage
Jan 6 2020,positive,amazing end to a trilogy
Jan 6 2020,positive,fun exciting and as always entertaining
Jan 6 2020,positive,watch it before it leaves the theater
Jan 6 2020,negative,to many loose ends being tied up and no real flow to the move also very predictable
Jan 6 2020,positive,great ending to such an amazing storyline
Jan 6 2020,positive,overall this was a decent finish to the star wars movies  a fair amount was predictable and thus a little anticlimactic at the end  it was great to have the original cast show up and provide wisdom to this generation
Jan 6 2020,positive,the storyline was great
Jan 6 2020,negative,terrible star wars movie while the music was absolutely gorgeous there were a couple sad moments and a couple funny moments most of the movie was just a mess a nonsensical plot new stuff added for the hell of it and old characters brought back because the new ones suck it was more fun to make fun of than it was to actually watch hopefully they scrap jj abrams with someone who can write a coherent plot
Jan 6 2020,positive,this movie was an emotional rollercoaster
Jan 6 2020,positive,wow   loved every second of it the reviews did not do it justice number one its a movie lighten up already  number two the cgi was incredible number three who saw kilo ren turning coming  i sure didnt wow   loved this movie
Jan 6 2020,positive,its was not great but not horrible there was some easy prediction of what was happening next but still enjoyable to a point and an end to an era of storyline
Jan 6 2020,positive,i have been in all star wars movies for 50 years this one is a classic
Jan 6 2020,positive,loved this  all the feels
Jan 6 2020,positive,it was an asboultly amazing movie i would definitely go see this again
Jan 6 2020,positive,great conclusion to the skywalker saga trilogytrilogy
Jan 6 2020,positive,there were some great scenes and moments but the film overall was just okay
Jan 6 2020,positive,felt like it paid homage to george lucas  i love the droids and the characters were funny and more of them
Jan 6 2020,positive,im not sure what movie the critics watched this was the best of the new trilogy by far i felt like star wars 8 worked harder than a sith at destroying the star wars universe lucky for us abrams and his genius team brought order to the galaxy thanks for making a show worthy of 40 years of devotion
Jan 6 2020,positive,forget the critics this is the fun campy adventure we have all come to love from this franchise
Jan 6 2020,negative,the male leads are have no charisma the movie was too long the movie was too loud
Jan 6 2020,positive,one of the best star wars movies
Jan 6 2020,positive,i am not a big star wars fan i loved the last two stars wars movies though
Jan 6 2020,positive,loved the movie sad to think the story is over
Jan 6 2020,positive,movie was not as good as i expected it to be ending was not good
Jan 6 2020,positive,good way to end the series
Jan 6 2020,positive,turned a bit dark towards the end
Jan 6 2020,positive,such a great movie makes you think about it for days
Jan 6 2020,negative,the movie jumped all around there was actually no development of the plot in s logical chronological format whoever directed this movie should really go back to school because my guess is they probably flunked out in the first semester  the actors are never given a chance to develop his characters simply because of the lack of quality script and dialogue feel like stupid mundane in action spend your money and go see it
Jan 6 2020,positive,i liked that it felt more like star wars again i did not like the last 2
Jan 6 2020,positive,for sure fun great graphics but storyline confusing at times not the best release but definitely worth it
Jan 6 2020,positive,its a decent movie all though it felt really crowded and alot happens because the movie needs it to happen not always because it makes sence
Jan 6 2020,positive,finally over nice resolution to the whole epic
Jan 6 2020,negative,horrible story plot and character development  one of the worst movies ever made   shocked disney would release such a tragedy
Jan 6 2020,positive,i really enjoyed the movie this way a great way to end the skywalker saga a big movie with lots to love
Jan 6 2020,positive,the acting storyline pacing editing humanitarian connections drew me into the movie  i felt a part of it excellent
Jan 6 2020,positive,it ended very well i loved it
Jan 6 2020,negative,there was so little humor in this movie the george lucas era had a way of telling a heroic big story with humor 
Jan 6 2020,positive,i loved it really a great ending to something ive been watching since i was a kid
Jan 6 2020,positive,thank you jj abrams for saving star wars my family and i loved this movie so much you made star wars great again it was an epic and fantastic story and worth every penny
Jan 6 2020,positive,i hated that it had to end
Jan 6 2020,positive,exactly what i wanted to see as a followup to a force awakens and a rebuke of last jedi i think luke admitting he was wrong was a wink to fans that last jedi was a mistake and rise was a return to form loved it
Jan 6 2020,positive,like it a lot the message was really good
Jan 6 2020,negative,no script continuity full of fanservice and a grand finale that looks like an marvels endgame meme
Jan 6 2020,positive,the first half is fast paced and i mean 23 minute scenes  the start feels like its already 30 minutes in and playing catchup carrie fishers scenes were always going to be lifted from last jedi outtakes due to her death but theyre really obvious if you get what im saying i did like the movie it was fun but it felt like they shouldve made it a 2parter and it wouldve been good if theyd given more time to foreshadowing a certain og characters storyline allinall  id rate it 335 out of 5 if i were rating the trilogies given that theyre all done now id give the original trilogy 45 out of 5 the prequels 235 out of 5 and the sequel trilogy 3 out of 5
Jan 6 2020,neutral,the final installment of the most unnecessary sequel trilogy has finally come yet it doesnt deliver the one satisfying star wars story that we used to have 40 something years ago i can see mr abrams trying to mend the broken the last jedi left for us thank you very much sir but the rise of skywalker seem to prove that fixing the franchise with only just one movie is proven to be more destructive than constructive following the will of the fanbase is the secret recipe of success only when it was done from the beginning now instead what we got is one big of a convoluted mess with little to no good result of the character development aspect that has been built up since force awakens some parts just dont make any fucking sense too much going on that no time for us to realize what the fuck is going on too many inconsistencies and all other stupid things happening that i personally can summarize in few words it doesnt feel like star wars at all no matter how many tie fighters xwing star destroyers and planetdecimating superweapons you put in front of the camera no matter how many times you see the millenium falcon flees the bad guys in one sitting it is not star wars when you are forced to see a 23 movies cramped into one twoandahalfsomethinghour movie its something else and its not good let alone remarkable
Jan 6 2020,positive,luved every minute of itteared toward the end
Jan 6 2020,negative,no plot line with the same old tired formula and new made up powers
Jan 6 2020,positive,best job that disney could do to finish the amazing story of star wars
Jan 6 2020,positive,had a decent at best beginning and middle but ended better than i thought it would
Jan 6 2020,positive,i saw the 1st star wars movie yes i am that old  as always attended another star wars with wife and teenage sons  love the new and respectful reference to old memories  must see
Jan 6 2020,positive,spoiler alert this movie felt like season 8 of game of thrones all that setup in the previous seasons that leads up to a halfassed attempt to wrap up the story although tros is not as bad as got season 8 it feels sloppy and lazy as if to wrap up the story of rey and kylo ren the movie has a lot of tell but no show in the movie when palpatine has rey pinned down with the force lightning and all of jedi speak to rey as if to encourage her this would have been a great time to utilize the fan service that this movie likes to throw out at random times and show all of the jedi helping rey to repel the lighting similar to dragonball z when gokus ghost helps gohan with a kamehameha the movie is entertaining though my biggest gripe with the movie though is that how is this movie going to be called rise of the skywalker when the the original skywalker anakin darth vader skywalker does not even show up in the film such a missed opportunity i understand that rey never met him and why luke and leias ghost show up at the end but for a movie that has so much fan service you would think they would do it here this also brings me to my next point disney hates the prequels 13 and it shows in this movie through the fan service
Jan 6 2020,negative,what in the world was all of that about
Jan 6 2020,positive,great film lots of fun jjabrams has his work cut out cleaning up the mess that was episode 8 my wife who isnt a massive sw loved it i am a massive sw fan i loved it the critics were wrong the movie goers are right
Jan 6 2020,positive,it was a nice way to conclude the saga i enjoyed and felt the force 
Jan 6 2020,positive,tons of action its in the mold of the originals awesome
Jan 6 2020,positive,i grew up on star wars and liked this one too to me not as good as the originals but still great
Jan 6 2020,positive,absolutely loved it the visuals were incredible and the acting was flawless
Jan 6 2020,negative,so in the end the villains bloodline wins the classic heroes are all dead so much for they lived happily ever after huh disney
Jan 6 2020,negative,cinema is dead and we killed it
Jan 6 2020,positive,good finish to the story loved reys journey
Jan 6 2020,positive,great storyline with lots of action
Jan 6 2020,positive,read a lot of negative reviews before going to see the movie with three of my kids we all very much enjoyed it ive grown up with star wars and have liked this new trilogy quite a lot
Jan 6 2020,negative,cant believe its been 42 years additionally i cant believe this is how it ends  ummm probably wont ever watch this or any of the other  6 new star wars movies the original three and rogue one im all good with those 4 end of story
Jan 6 2020,positive,im not really into any of the star wars movies but this one i really really liked
Jan 6 2020,positive,better the third time
Jan 6 2020,positive,the fact that critics are panning this because it caters to the fan base is absolutely ridiculous why on earth would you want to make a movie that the fans which have kept the franchise alive all these years wouldnt like i appreciate the fan service and wish that jj would have just done the whole trilogy
Jan 6 2020,positive,the flashing lights its really hard for people like me to have epilepsy to go to the movies because of flashing lights its a chance we have to take if we want to see the movie but this was me and my husband second wedding anniversary and he is a star wars mega fan so i got us tickets for our anniversary otherwise the movie was very good
Jan 6 2020,positive,rise of skywalker is an enjoyable movie and a decent end to the sequel trilogy but its held back by a lack of creativity and cohesiveness with the overall narrative of the trilogy there are a myriad of plotholes when you look at it as a sequel to the last jedi and it feels like disney wanted to distance themselves as far as possible from the direction that rian johnson was trying to take the franchise due to the backlash that episode viii received in that regard its as if episode ix tries to correct the issues that fans had with tlj but by doing so it makes the narrative of the movie feel a bit sloppy like it was all thrown together at the last minute with an incredible amount of fan service added however its still an enjoyable film the adventure does feel fun the characters have great chemistry with one another and ian mcdiarmids performance as emperor palpatine is fantastic im sure this movie will remain extremely divisive with the fanbase as time goes by but despite its issues i did enjoy it
Jan 6 2020,neutral,lovely production terrific action scenes but a cookiecutter script that echoed rotj its a mustsee if youre a fan of the series but i would have preferred something darker its not without its charm i saw it in 3d and it looked and sounded awesome but lacked any decent story line to the saga
Jan 6 2020,positive,it was a good ending to a saga i began watching as a child almost a love letter from past generations to present and future generations
Jan 6 2020,negative,it was tired trite and plodding followed the worst sins of the series you could tell abrams was crippled by the studio
Jan 6 2020,positive,moved quickly but still was great to watch especially in 3d
Jan 6 2020,positive,i consider myself a fan of star wars having seen the premier of the series back in the 70s   abrams tied up the series neatly bringing all the storylines to their conclusions and it all felt just right to me  i thought ridley did a really fine performance as a more mature rey and gave the final journey of the story a greater depth of emotion  the   comradarie of rey finn and poe fit right in with the original cast  the technical job of fiting in carrie fisher with old footage was astounding you would never know it was pieced together  as for the professional reviews i read before seeing it i have a hard time believing they actually saw the movie or cared for the series they were so off  this is a really satisfying series finale for me and for all the people i know who saw the movie  all of them said what i didi cant wait to see it again
Jan 6 2020,positive,its a tall order to make the final episode of skywalker saga after what happened in the last jedi i dont like the last jedi because its so contradicting with other star wars movies and basically destroys everything in star wars people may complain about the rise of skywalker doing too much fan service but hey wouldnt it already be a fan service when they started to make the sequels all in all the rise of skywalker is a good ending to the skywalker saga to fans
Jan 6 2020,neutral,those characters are so unrelatable   finn is pointless just runs around yelling raerae
Jan 6 2020,positive,the story was great
Jan 6 2020,positive,loved  the whole movie  started watching star wars in 1977 with my son  and ended it with my granddaughter in 2020 fabulous journey
Jan 6 2020,positive,would i have done a few things differently maybe but they would be so minimal they wouldnt change much this was a fantastic star wars movie felt like star wars with a new intensity finding that balance between doing something new making it feel like the same star wars galaxy and serving the entirety of the story is a difficult thing to do i think jj abrams nailed it with what he had to work off of personally i think last jedi was an atrocious portrayal of luke skywalker barely moved the story forward wasted good intriguing characters etc etc it wasnt all bad but it was pretty bad abrams was able to make something very very good out of that mess i dont mean to rag on last jedi that much but i kind of have to because of how much better rise of skywalker was in comparison   some people criticized rise of skywalker because it was too much jammed into one movie and catered to fans too much with too much leveraging of nostalgia i could feel it being a bit rushed a couple times but i actually enjoyed the pacing overall and the slightly rushed moments were not bad at all catering to fans is a good thing in my eyes especially when youre talking star wars add some twists and turns and youve got the recipe for a great entertaining film and nostalgia its star wars the last of 9 films at least for now why would you not want a good amount of nostalgia i thought it was good balance honestly and it all fits into the story  anyway thats my take if youre a star wars fan go see it
Jan 6 2020,positive,i thought it was super loved every minute of it
Jan 6 2020,negative,that was the most convoluted annoying mess of a movie  glad its over now 
Jan 6 2020,negative,while some people heavily criticize the first two in the series for various reasons i actually  enjoyed the first two movies as they built up a little something maybe not go see it in the theater something but it had some potential to have a remarkable ending however this was not the case with star wars ix there was a lot of junk just thrown together to create some form of nostalgic feeling for fanatics the problem is none of it made any sense literally i sat there trying to understand why certain characters were built up in previous movies only to be made miniscule why abilities never before seen were now amazingly available the phrase  somehow magically serves as an explanation for some ridiculousness very poor writing i felt cheated like the director or producer or whoever is in charge just wanted to have a grand finale but forgot pay a team to design the fireworks layout and timing so they went to the fireworks store and just threw a little of everything together
Jan 6 2020,positive,impressivejust as enjoyable as all the other star war movies awesome for the 9th version
Jan 6 2020,positive,excellent made continuation of the star war story i enjoyed it and would see it again
Jan 6 2020,positive,love it  would  see it  again
Jan 6 2020,positive,i enjoyed it not perfection but it was good
Jan 6 2020,positive,loved the humor action mash up amongst the characters made the movie very entertaining
Jan 6 2020,positive,the movie was great  you have to know the story line from the other movie it connects
Jan 6 2020,positive,i loved all of the nods to the past movies and how it brought it all together
Jan 6 2020,positive,anyone age 45 or older who doesnt like this film is not a genuine star wars fan who attended new hope in 1977
Jan 6 2020,negative,half the things in the movie didnt make sense  the story was poorly executed and it was all action with no substance
Jan 6 2020,positive,great movie  nice way to finish the series
Jan 6 2020,positive,i mean its star wars
Jan 6 2020,positive,it was totally a star wars film  better than the last one  i think that j j abrams saved the franchise and recovered from the previous debacle the best way possible  i only wish there was more skywalker to see  not sure what the future holds
Jan 6 2020,positive,loved it  i cried at the end i cannot believe the saga that started when i was 9 is now complete  well paced movie with lots of turns enjoyed it completely and will see again
Jan 6 2020,negative,if you love star wars then then this is the worst star war movie ever made of the 9 lots of pointless trick and events that add nothing to the story its a clumsy retcon of the previous movies it was pretty looking movie but the plot and storyline was a hot mess
Jan 6 2020,positive,the rise of skywalker was an entertaining film that lacked depth it created compelling characters out of ben solo kylo ren and rey but it failed to create a compelling antagonist  the film relied heavily on nostalgia and gimmicks however it comes as the ninth movie of an extremely popular series so this was expected
Jan 6 2020,positive,speechless thats it
Jan 6 2020,positive,wonderful ending to a great series
Jan 6 2020,positive,i good conclusion to the store
Jan 6 2020,positive,it had a great ending
Jan 6 2020,positive,great ending to a great saga very entertaining
Jan 6 2020,positive,fantastic  best one yet perhaps
Jan 6 2020,positive,movie feel a little compressed  they had to undo some of the crap that ryan johnson did in ep8 if it had more time in the film it would have been better
Jan 6 2020,positive,much better flow of story and characters over the last two films
Jan 6 2020,positive,amazing movie i am just upset that this one was ended 
Jan 6 2020,positive,overall the movie was great there were some parts i didnt like and the cinematography wasnt the best in some scenes
Jan 6 2020,positive,i think all in all it was the best star wars yet
Jan 6 2020,positive,i loved it and rey is awesome 
Jan 6 2020,positive,a solid ending to the trilogy i will miss these characters
Jan 6 2020,positive,jj did the best job he could have done  it was enjoyable and had gave a proper good bye to the skywalker saga
Jan 6 2020,positive,it has been an incredible journey from the beginning in 1977 to the end in 2019 thank you
Jan 6 2020,positive,i enjoyed it it did fill in one big hole in the story for me some things i would have done different but is the best of the disney versions
Jan 6 2020,positive,i felt it drew the current arc to a satisfying conclusion loose ends were tied up and there were a lot of these and we saw what we all came to see lightsaber battles light speed travel xwings none of the action was disappointing on the downside i felt a lot of characters were introduced without leading anywhere and a cynical part of me kept wondering whether this was a commercial decision
Jan 6 2020,positive,i thought the movie flowed well and answered a lot of questions that were outstanding  the ending was great  the story ended where it all began  a whole new franchise could be started from where the movie ended if they wanted to go that way
Jan 6 2020,positive,a hard thing to do to put the franchise to rest there are some amazing scenes and no real stinker moments
Jan 6 2020,positive,i liked it all very clever at how leia dies the connection of rey and kylo ren is perfect
Jan 6 2020,positive,i loved it so fun and fresh
Jan 6 2020,positive,if you knew that darth maul was alive before watching solo you will be shocked how good this movie is
Jan 6 2020,positive,omg ive only become a star wars fan recently the last 2 weeks i watched all 9 movies in that time and i absolutely loved it i highly recommend it
Jan 6 2020,positive,great ride  awesome climax satisfying finish
Jan 6 2020,positive,i enjoyed the story and tying up some of the story lines
Jan 6 2020,positive,great ending to a great saga
Jan 6 2020,positive,spoiler free  so thats it the story of the skywalker saga draws to an end   would the sequel trilogy ever live up to the magic of george lucas imagination certainly not i had these expectations going into the force awakens and each film in this trilogy proves why he never should have sold it and never should have listened to cry baby fans if it was my story i sure would not and will not when i release my own   that being said the rise of skywalker is a fastpaced recklessly moving film that demands a fans attention to detail to appreciate it all is it perfect anybody expecting perfect has their expectations too high but i had the opportunity to watch all 8 currently released movies before going into the rise of skywalker and i can appreciate jj abrams and companys efforts   the prequel trilogy deserves more credit for its ability to not only provide a dark and moving origin story for anakin but for its ability to link to the original trilogy it is stunning to hear luke and obi wan talk about the clone wars many years before those films were even made it is this detailed writing that the sequel trilogy lacks due to the changing of hands between films but where the rise of skywalker succeeds is where the prequel trilogy succeeds as well connectivity relevance to the rest of the story as a writer closing off the saga that another person created with so many hands involved would be a tremendous task   perhaps that is the attractive part of the rise of skywalker it knows its not perfect it has a very human and emotional element to it filled with nostalgia and questions being answered i felt the space battles were underwhelming but the lightsaber battles and the battle between the jedi and sith has never been more exhilarating for all that the rise of skywalker has to juggle it accomplishes its task with all the spirit of the previous 8 films rolled into one ridley and driver steal the show in the final installment as they have the entire sequel trilogy but the flashback segments and tribute to leia were incredible as well   i know the reviews have been negative but i do believe people need to let go and just enjoy the art for what it is flaws can be found in the entire saga of movies and the rise of skywalker is certainly flawed but it is also a human emotional and thrilling roller coaster that will leave you wondering if we will ever see the skywalkers again
Jan 6 2020,positive,the whole movie is very action packed the first half is a little too fast paced and is the weaker half in my opinion but the last hour is straight star wars and is great the music hits as usual for a star wars film if you like star wars action and star wars in general i think youll probably like it
Jan 6 2020,positive,i have watched all the star wars movies this was good but not great
Jan 6 2020,positive,c3po at his best great standalone movie
Jan 6 2020,negative,over the top storyline movie was basically one light saber fight after another with multiple scenes where characters are killed only to reappear enjoyed episodes 4 through 7 rest of films are waste of time
Jan 6 2020,positive,plenty of fan service but a really fun movie enjoy the ride
Jan 6 2020,positive,the movie has very emotional moments and the ending brings the series back around to the beginning i wasnt pleased with the last two movies so i was pleasantly surprised
Jan 6 2020,positive,loved please dont be the last one
Jan 6 2020,positive,kylo really hot that sassy shoulder shrug king 1010
Jan 6 2020,positive,considering that star wars the rise of skywalker is the third or fourth time the franchise has used the same plot the movie could have been worse in the movies favor the closing out of this simplistic story of good jedi v evil sith seeing some old familiar faces even those that are literally dead an overall enjoyable experience carried mainly by the two stars daisy ridley and adam driver and best of all the awesome ending battle with the emperor ian mcdiarmid is fantastic against the film as already stated  a retread seizure inducing special effects ludicrous battle scenes where the good guys beat the bad guys in the same ratio as their outnumbered like 1 to 100 and most damning requires a completer suspension of belief regarding all matters of science and mechanics even for the future if youre a star wars fan definitely a must see
Jan 6 2020,positive,wow this is a movie well done
Jan 6 2020,positive,action packed with lots of surprises
Jan 6 2020,negative,not worth watching luke saving his father is insulted and thrown away wouldnt waste my time
Jan 6 2020,negative,1 star to counteract disneys attempts of buying a better score   the movie was more like a 25 but still not very good  let me preface this with an experience in the cinema spoilers at the end of the movie we see rey die kylo offers his life force to her and it ends in a romantic scene where kylo dies after kissing rey arguably this was supposed to be the most dramatic moment of the movie  the entire cinema laughed like actualy laughed out loud and that wasnt the only time they did  because honestly the film is laughable  rey is a total mary sue the film is riddled with deus ex machina  it breaks previously established lore and generally makes no damn sense   the one good part of the movie was the production quality  vfx sfx etc was as good as ever a truly spectacular show  but if youre wondering whether you should be watching this film or whether youd rather watch the showreel of industrial light  magic i would wholeheartedly recommend to watch the showreel  cheers and out
Jan 6 2020,positive,very good film help tie the old star wars films together highly recommend
Jan 6 2020,negative,i new it was going to be bad but i think that i mightve ruined a great childhood memory by waisting my time with this horrible movie
Jan 6 2020,positive,great movie plenty of action
Jan 6 2020,positive,a bit hard to follow in the middle music was perfect action was great great surprise appearances bit ending was just ok
Jan 6 2020,positive,amazing as always starwarsfans
Jan 6 2020,negative,hated the last jedi for its treatment of luke this one redeemed that slightly and was actually good up until the 12 way point the multiple twists at the end with the emperor made the story feel forced no pun intended the nonsensical stuff in the final battle horses running on a flying star destroyer just made the movie nondramatic  lazy writing to close the plotlines and sometimes shameless nods to previous movies trying to play to the long term fans but in the end felt insulting its like someone said we have to show jawas and ewoks somehow
Jan 6 2020,neutral,the music and special effects are terrific if you have seen all the prior sw flicks you can put up with the mind numbing stupidity of the plot and enjoy the resurrection of your favorite characters  much better final chapter than godfather iii but thats not saying much since gdf iii may have been the worst final chapter ever screened
Jan 6 2020,positive,great visuals sound and story yes im a life long star wars fan
Jan 6 2020,positive,this film does a great job of redeeming a struggling trilogy and undoing the disaster of the last jedi fun with plenty of action scenes moving moments and easter eggs daisy ridley made rey likeable and tough dont let cynicism put you off this is well worth a watch
Jan 6 2020,positive,action packed and great ending to the saga
Jan 6 2020,positive,i enjoyed all of the movie and the new characters i missed a few points in the dialog that didnt make sense to memaybe see it again soon
Jan 6 2020,positive,a few major plot holes okayish lightsaber duels and repetitively corny dialogues
Jan 6 2020,positive,loved the action could have a little more plot to it tried to cover 8  movies to conclude in one
Jan 6 2020,negative,this is fricked this is messed up
Jan 6 2020,positive,one of the best out of all of them
Jan 6 2020,positive,it was a classy ending to a classic franchise
Jan 6 2020,positive,loved the death star scene haunting
Jan 6 2020,positive,loved it true to the star wars genre actionpacked suspenseful and perfect for new and old fans
Jan 6 2020,positive,excellent movie great acting and story the start wars sequel and the legend of skywalker continues in fine fashion
Jan 6 2020,negative,just when you thought there was nowhere to go but up after the last jedi this film cant decide what it wants or what to focus on  except for grasping at shocking callbacks that further undo the previous two trilogies of work it looks pretty so if it can keep you distracted i guess youll enjoy it
Jan 6 2020,positive,liked the action and the special effects the story was choppy and i would have liked to see all the jeti ghosts at the end
Jan 6 2020,positive,great ending cute humor
Jan 6 2020,positive,love star wars movies
Jan 6 2020,positive,non stop action and mystery
Jan 6 2020,negative,visually the movie was great the score was decent and the acting was decent but that doesnt draw away from the poor plot much of it didnt make sense poor planning and rushing to reshoot caused this movie to be a fail most true fans of star wars will agree this was a bust casual moviegoers would think this is a good movie take it as you will i only watched this movie because of discounted tickets i wouldnt pay full price to watch this garbage
Jan 6 2020,positive,lotta legit criticisms but the thing still ended up a fun roller coaster ride to be fair this series shouldve stopped long ago like after the original so i cant get too worked up about the hinky bits in ros the humor was better than i thought the story was almost laughably the same as at least three previous episodes but the spectacle of it was effective the action was nonstop and the ending was kinda nice big laugh out of c3po reintroducing himself after amnesia to babu my oldest friend
Jan 6 2020,positive,i loved it  kept the action going the whole time
Jan 6 2020,positive,my boyfriend and i are major star wars fans we loved the movie from beginning to end

Jan 6 2020,positive,ive been a fan of star wars since i was eight and ive been fortunate enough to enjoy the skywalker saga theatrically the rise of skywalker was full of surprises and kept me smiling from ear to ear
Jan 6 2020,positive,ok if youre a purest im sure there are elements those of us just going for entertainment value might not catch  our family old  young loved it  great story great action cgi could be a bit tighter around princess leia but otherwise some nice surprises and wed like to see it again
Jan 6 2020,positive,dont listen to the critics this movie was awesome a new hope came out when i was a kid and now my son has seen all the movies an led thought this one was epic
Jan 6 2020,positive,this was great just wonderful an amazing recovery from the conflicting second act from the character relationships the flow the comedy all of it was a great end to this series

Jan 6 2020,positive,best movie ive seen in a long time
Jan 6 2020,positive,very respectful end to the skywalker storyline plays it a little too safe but in the end a very good movie
Jan 6 2020,positive,im old enough to have seen all 9 movies in the theater it was a hard series to wrap up but they did a decent job better than any of the prequels for sure
Jan 6 2020,positive,i appreciate how the story ended we all know that the stories have the same plot as 4 but it is enjoyable and worth seeing multiple times cant wait for more sagas
Jan 6 2020,positive,great movie specially for the star wars followers

Jan 6 2020,negative,meh  this whole new trilogy has been unoriginal and full of missed opportunities none of the characters were well developed dont make any more movies until you have an interesting plot please
Jan 6 2020,positive,the movie was awesome from beginning to end a awesome addition to series
Jan 6 2020,positive,it was okay it definitely felt rushed and incomplete last jedi had a good message that they kind of abandoned in this one you can see they gave up with all the drama behind the camera and just decided to go for the fan service instead
Jan 6 2020,positive,the movie had the unenviable task of wrapping up an iconic series that spanned generations while it wont win best picture oscar it was a worthy final chapter and the average non diehard fan should be content with how it wraps up 
Jan 6 2020,positive,spoiler disliked that kiss
Jan 6 2020,positive,very satisfying i saw the first star wars back in the 70s and like that one the story ends with the good guys winning the bad guys losing thats how its supost to be
Jan 6 2020,positive,entertaining fast paced movie while it does have some fan service it is a fitting end to the star wars saga

Jan 6 2020,positive,lots of action good acting entertaining great makeup and wardrobe
Jan 6 2020,positive,answered and closed all
Jan 6 2020,positive,the best thing about it was that after all it was star wars  however the acting was poor and the story felt contrived i almost felt like i watching a 1950s b movie science fiction thriller  but it was star wars
Jan 6 2020,positive,i loved it cried through most of it so dang emotional and triumphant
Jan 6 2020,neutral,can be entertaining with some cool ideas but plagued by lack of development for anything plot contrivances and massive pacing issues
Jan 6 2020,positive,typical star wars action  kept me entertained time flew by so to me a sign of a good movie especially when its long
Jan 6 2020,positive,pleasantly surprised at how this epic adventure has come together
Jan 6 2020,positive,it was a very full and fun experience despite some retcons and a bit of playing fast and loose with rules at times definitely a spectacle though would watch again if nothing else to see the ships as shown in the trailer again
Jan 6 2020,positive,lots of action but way to many faces and facial expressions
Jan 6 2020,positive,not a fan of the series ending

Jan 6 2020,negative,disney ruins this franchise
Jan 6 2020,positive,i loved every part of this movie i dont want to give it away and tell details

Jan 6 2020,positive,i liked the movie in general just not the storyline
Jan 6 2020,positive,this movie had to rise to meet great expectations  it ties off some loose ends cauterized others i felt the jedi of oz pulling strings behind the curtain  which was disappointing  the pacing felt off and the characterization forced it was pretty and was still better than the first sequel
Jan 6 2020,positive,after feeling the disney star wars films were massive letdowns i thoroughly enjoyed this movie  the characters finally hit a point of relatability that the last two films lacked and the intertwining of the legacy characters into the narrative was effective
Jan 6 2020,positive,i found the movie to be very enjoyable   it brought the starwars story to an end
Jan 6 2020,positive,despite the toxicity of the fanbases opinion of this movie i found it well done with a super satisfying ending to the trilogy well done jj
Jan 6 2020,negative,this movie clearly shows that lucasfilm had never a road map to this saga the whole story seems inconsistent with the previous movies it seems they had no other choice to bring palpatine back just because snoke was gone as well to be a crowd pleaser finns character throughout this saga had no porpoise at all being teamed up with characters like rose which was completely forgotten and the new one which i dont even remember the name the final battle had no enthusiasm and seemed like something we have seen a thousand times before btw lando comes back for no apparent reason as well the only things i think they did okay was the way ben and leia were handled im very sad as im a great star wars fan and this whole saga was very weird and disappointing
Jan 6 2020,positive,was not sure whether to see this one since i am not a good follower of the series and heard not so good things from followers i just broke down and saw it today even though it is gorgeous out and would have loved a hike it was worth missing the hikei had a little disappointment that i cannot say and ruin it for others but the scenes were great
Jan 6 2020,positive,very well done tied all the movies together  great finish
Jan 6 2020,positive,enjoyed every minute

Jan 6 2020,positive,the action was excellent the story was a little hard to follow at times
Jan 6 2020,positive,visuals were incredible very satisfying ending to  the sequel trilogy i felt that this movie did a good job of resolving open questions from the previous two films very entertaining maybe a bit long and some of the humor fell short
Jan 6 2020,negative,another bad shot at doing a star wars just really bad
Jan 6 2020,positive,good not greatliked the ending
Jan 6 2020,positive,i liked where this movie wrapped up some story lines and the action sequences were gorgeous a couple things felt a little disjointed and thrown in for this movie however the rest of the story and action more than made up for that
Jan 6 2020,positive,theres not one thing i disliked about this movie what an ending to an epic series
Jan 6 2020,positive,absolutely loved this murder mystery especially  the fresh perspective used in this movie
Jan 6 2020,positive,its star wars   we loves it  starwalks rule
Jan 6 2020,positive,2nd time with the kids well worth it
Jan 6 2020,negative,fun to watch gives fans what they want and it makes no sense as a movie
Jan 6 2020,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed it while i get the criticizers i felt it covered all the bases i really dont think this is the end of the saga though
Jan 6 2020,positive,you can nickel and dime this movie for missing certain things and not answering questions you had but it is amazing the way it is and was entertaining throughout the fan service was lovely and transparent a fitting send off to the skywalker saga 
Jan 6 2020,positive,i enjoyed the film it did a good job tying up the series  i wished it fleshed out a couple of the characters relationships  but the movie was 2 12 hours long in order to tie up everything it would have had to be 2 parts
Jan 6 2020,positive,the movie was okay there were very predictable moments and still the cgi leia was as weird in this movie as it was in rogue one there were unexplored character moments but overall it was passable movie fare
Jan 6 2020,positive,liked that the bad guy was good guy in the end
Jan 6 2020,negative,dialogue was terrible save your money dont see it tell your children there are only 3 star wars movies
Jan 6 2020,negative,what a disaster of a movie
Jan 6 2020,positive,loved how they wrapped everything up
Jan 6 2020,positive,old crotchety palpatine finally gets eliminated again
Jan 6 2020,positive,the movie tied up loose ends of the saga it has a mixed ending of good and bad
Jan 6 2020,positive,too many repetitions from themes  plots of the earlier movies
Jan 6 2020,positive,not perfect but still really good
Jan 6 2020,positive,as a standalone movie it was good lots of action as part of the trilogy confusing and disjointed from the other stories
Jan 6 2020,positive,great movie my first star wars experience thoroughly enjoyed it
Jan 6 2020,positive,wish disney would have just let jj abrams do the whole trilogy this movie was the perfect ending to a storied franchise
Jan 5 2020,positive,loved it all star wars cant wait till they come up next
Jan 5 2020,positive,the movie was awesome filled in a lot of blanks for me cant wait to see it in bluray

Jan 5 2020,positive,loved it the movie was great
Jan 5 2020,positive,fitting conclusion to the saga
Jan 5 2020,positive,the film is enjoyable but has many plot holes and it has massive pacing issues
Jan 5 2020,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed it a great final chapter to the skywalker saga
Jan 5 2020,negative,the story doesnt make sense
Jan 5 2020,positive,pretty good did its best to salvage the horror that was last jedi finn and the wanna be han solo guy whatever his name is are both still noncharacters for the most part which is a shame but you can only pack so many fixes into one film
Jan 5 2020,positive,if you consider the almost impossible task that jj abrams faced on how to close out this epic saga that spanned over 30 years he did a really great job i personally liked the movie a lot my one complaint spoileralert is when rey asked for past jedi knights to be with me when she heard all the voices speaking to her they shouldve flashed pictures of everyone that was talking it wouldve been nice to see all of the former greats one last time except for young  teenage anikan
Jan 5 2020,positive,not exactly what i expected but alot of good stuff in there could have used a 4th movie though
Jan 5 2020,positive,i liked it lots of action  easy to follow from the prior star wars
Jan 5 2020,positive,dont over think it just go along for the ride like we did as kids and have fun
Jan 5 2020,positive,very good movie and ending to the trilogy  ok if there is more movies to come
Jan 5 2020,positive,so much fun to watch amazing ending to star wars
Jan 5 2020,positive,this is the movie that is made for the fans no i dont mean casual fans who barely watch the movies im talking about the people who play the games read the books watch the shows etc   this feels like everything the last movie should have been and more honestly if disney did another star wars like this perhaps prequels to the prequels like the jedi vs sith empire or  jedi vs dark jedi that would be amazing 3  the one thing i had a serious problem with was how the asian woman got the short end of the stick in this movie the consolation prize was seeing a badass african american lady who as amazing as phasma should have been
Jan 5 2020,positive,it was a great movie plot isnt perfect but in no way is it bad wonderful effects and beautiful scenes i really appreciated the nostalgic nods to the previous films a great way to wrap up the saga 
Jan 5 2020,neutral,same storyline as return of the jedi
Jan 5 2020,positive,a fantastic conclusion to the trilogy  it was just a fun ride one last time through the galaxy and nicely recovers from the travesty of tlj  jj truly is a great filmmaker as now this movie makes episode 8 unnecessary to the story  you can watch episode 7 and jump straight to 9 with very little missing
Jan 5 2020,positive,i think the rise of skywalker is a fun enjoyable film with a few problems the biggest being that this sequel trilogy had no plan
Jan 5 2020,positive,a decent movie worth seeing once i still think disney dropped the ball overall with the star wars universe too many things were changed that makes you scratch your head about previous movies still this one is much better that that dreck that was episode 8
Jan 5 2020,positive,special effects were well done and great cast
Jan 5 2020,negative,the only star wars film i felt like leaving half way through should have gone straight to daytime kids tv
Jan 5 2020,positive,questions were answered
Jan 5 2020,positive,a very satisfying story
Jan 5 2020,positive,it was amazing and super intense acting was wonderful and i was filled with emotion must see

Jan 5 2020,positive,the best so intriguing and inspiring evil never ultimately wins good always ultimately wins
Jan 5 2020,positive,this movie was so good for me and my family we all loved it everything fit together so well and had the most amazing story line definitely one of the best star wars movies ive seen
Jan 5 2020,positive,i liked the action and how the movie used the extra footage of carrie fisherprincess leia and i also liked how the movie wrapped up the loose ends  i would have given it 5 stars but i never felt a connection to the characters and their plight like i did in the previous two movies and the original sw movies  there was just too much going on over the entire movie it kept switching from one crisis to the next and it felt like sitting next to someone constantly changing the channels on a tv
Jan 5 2020,positive,a solid finale to a story that started long ago in my childhood
Jan 5 2020,positive,youll like it as a fan critics suck
Jan 5 2020,positive,if i tell what i liked about it i would give away the plot  i loved it  others i went with not so much
Jan 5 2020,positive,i loved it the especial effects and the performance of all the actors was great
Jan 5 2020,positive,i loved loved loved it it is a long movie but i didnt want it to end
Jan 5 2020,positive,enjoyed the whole movie the creativity is awesome
Jan 5 2020,positive,some parts seemed not to splice together well both with the story and the movies cadence
Jan 5 2020,positive,i loved it  satisfying  much better than the last one and i think best of the movies on par with rogue 1
Jan 5 2020,positive,movie was great kinda predictable but otherwise a good rap up
Jan 5 2020,negative,mediocre ending to the saga boo disney  ruined it
Jan 5 2020,positive,i freakin loved it im absolutely flabbergasted as you how this movie got mixed reviews i am 20 i understand long time fans but this movie and trilogy has been fantastic to me ignore negative and positive reviews please watch the movie for yourself
Jan 5 2020,positive,pew pew nice wrap up to the series dont expect a great work of literature  just buckle in and enjoy the ride
Jan 5 2020,positive,an awesome ending to an incredible saga
Jan 5 2020,positive,loved everything about it glad i saw it in the theater thank you it was a great run
Jan 5 2020,negative,nothing new if you seen one star wars film you have seen them all
Jan 5 2020,positive,i thought it was great i hate to admit that ive been watching these movies for 45 years now ouch  so for me it was just a fun ride through the past moviestying up loose ends and seeing characters from previous movies
Jan 5 2020,positive,it was fast paced and had a great ending
Jan 5 2020,positive,it wrapped up the last 3 movies nicely palpatine was awesome sure they dudnt make our favorite books but they are great stories a great ending to the skywalker story
Jan 5 2020,positive,best of the new movies
Jan 5 2020,positive,i almost didnt see this movie because the last jedi was an abomination but i went anyway with low expectations what i liked about the film was that it brought back luke skywalker and han solo and gave them honorable goodbye the artistic design and graphics were beautiful and exciting the minimization of rose ticos character the equivalent of jar jar binks daisy ridley and adam drivers acting was stellar but the rest of the movie was too rushed unexplained confusing and too short there were so many throw away characters the character i connected most with emotionally was chewy when he fell to his knees sobbing when princess leia died thats how i felt about the the trilogy but it was definitely better than the last jedi and i would willingly watch it again if i had to
Jan 5 2020,positive,it was an okay end to the trilogy some good fights scenes but not very original
Jan 5 2020,positive,with clear evidence that there was no plan at the start of this trilogy disney and lucasfilm do everything they can to please the most difficult fanbase of all time the finished product is meant to be a tribute to one of the biggest franchises ever and if you can turn off your brain you may enjoy the ride
Jan 5 2020,negative,the characters and context of the first two movies in this trilogy are totally lost in this nonsensical mcguffin chase hodgepodge
Jan 5 2020,positive,great movie  loved it
Jan 5 2020,positive,it was a great movie that was fun to watch
Jan 5 2020,positive,best of the new trilogy made up for the disappointing 2nd part
Jan 5 2020,positive,great movie  loved it all  great acting and directing across the board  a wonderful ending to an amazing saga
Jan 5 2020,positive,wrapped up the whole thing but left it open for more
Jan 5 2020,neutral,it was ok  some really cliche parts like the end  and the middle  and the reveal  mostly entertaining
Jan 5 2020,positive,the issues people have with this movie stem from issues with the last jedi if the last jedi were a better movie this one would be received better thats the only reason it feels out of place or that things dont connect 
Jan 5 2020,positive,loved everything about it
Jan 5 2020,positive,great story and end
Jan 5 2020,positive,best star wars since the first three its a great ending
Jan 5 2020,positive,love it its a wonderful movie like all the ones before but it was sad to see leía ready eyes just a reminder shes really gone luke and leia are the true stars of why i keep watching these movies ray had big shoes to fill in and she did it wonderfully
Jan 5 2020,positive,its star wars meets harry potter new powers for jedi living and dead abound the emperor returns ala voldemort disneys commercial fingerprints are all over this thing carrie fisher in a major role is kind of creepy on the plus side rey is a good choice for the new jedi and the main characters are all pretty good
Jan 5 2020,positive,love it i have waited for 44 years to watch all 9 episodes
Jan 5 2020,neutral,boring emotionless mess it displays the poor planning on disneys part
Jan 5 2020,positive,what a way to end the trilogy so many emotions flow through you if you love star wars a must see
Jan 5 2020,positive,i loved this movie great storyline and the action scenes were so thrilling
Jan 5 2020,positive,loved it and thought it was one of the best in the series
Jan 5 2020,positive,jj abrams did what he could to salvage the mess that was star wars the last jedi as a die hard star wars fan and expanded universe nut i would have taken the film in a couple different directions but it was an overall good film poe and finn are still worthless characters with no arc or purpose but ill take what i can get
Jan 5 2020,positive,not the best but def not the worst
Jan 5 2020,positive,great action sad ending
Jan 5 2020,positive,nice ending to the saga
Jan 5 2020,positive,an awesome send off for the skywalker saga i believe long time star wars fans will find tons to like about this movie
Jan 5 2020,positive,great start plodding midsection with one of the worst lightsaber duels ever decent ending answering maximus yes  i was entertained was i satisfied not fully to say the least
Jan 5 2020,positive,very nice ending to this amazing saga that i have enjoyed since 1977 when star wars was released no serious dislikes about this film which was the most crucial being the ending film in the saga
Jan 5 2020,positive,i really enjoyed this latest sw saga  it was way too long but it was true to the sw movies
Jan 5 2020,positive,incredible movie loved the action and wrapping of the story
Jan 5 2020,positive,some twists i didnt see coming  good movie action from the start
Jan 5 2020,negative,this film backpedals on almost everything established beforehand  undoes most of the themes from the original trilogy and recots a lot of the best moments  every example on how not to make a film    none of the motivations make any sense and there are literal plot holes that no one has been able to adequately answer  yet nostalgia has people enjoying it
Jan 5 2020,negative,the plot was a bit convuluted and the movie never settled it was also extremely loud in imax enough to be a distraction not a satisfying conclusion to a great saga
Jan 5 2020,positive,felt like a star wars amusement park ride space chases light saber battles incredible cgi
Jan 5 2020,neutral,im a big fan of star wars and unlike many enjoyed the two newer trilogy films however even my love for star wars didnt go as far for me to like this movie the references felt forced and the movie felt rushed there were so many plots and storylines that werent followed up ie finn and rey the whole movie felt like it was trying to clasp the strings of the old movie if not this whole third trilogy felt like a remake they are worth a watch but are nothing like the originals  a lot to live up by tbf
Jan 5 2020,positive,forget the pros who probably werent even born when the first star wars was filmed this is a tail of adventure humor and thrills just like the first one im still smiling two hours later what an outstanding finale or is it
Jan 5 2020,positive,first star wars movie i have ever seen  im a fan now
Jan 5 2020,positive,little slow but overall great movie
Jan 5 2020,positive,great star wars movie my daughter and i loved it
Jan 5 2020,positive,its a good movie
Jan 5 2020,negative,better than the first two films in this trilogy but thats not a high bar to hit disjointed story that once again revived around wrapping i s that can destroy a planet there are a couple of heavily contrived plot devices that make no sense and just left me shaking my head lots of attempts to evoke past glories im so glad this convoluted ill conceived mess of a story is finally over
Jan 5 2020,positive,an excellent way to spend a couple of hours  the critics who panned it were wrong in my opinion
Jan 5 2020,positive,i enjoyed watching the movie a great deal apply your own force power of suspending disbelief to get the most out of watching this finale then just sit back and let the experience sweep over you  enjoy the emotive high points remember that star wars has been space fantasy from the very beginning it was never intended to be science fiction granted they keep adding new force powers whenever it is convenient to the story telling which if used in the earlier episodes would have changed everything  to paraphrase omar khayyam the screenwriter writes and having writ moves on nor all thy piety nor wit shall lure it back to cancel half a line nor all thy tears wash out a word of it
Jan 5 2020,positive,very good conclusion to the saga
Jan 5 2020,positive,good star wars story held to the history of the force
Jan 5 2020,positive,great wrap up to the end of an era
Jan 5 2020,positive,oh look convenient new force powers followed by nostalgia and more nostalgia oh and heres some humor im not sure what i was looking for but it wasnt this i am conveniced that this movie was just a third installment of series of money grabbing movies
Jan 5 2020,negative,this movie does not explore star wars law it does not extend the star wars mythology its not a star wars movie far too many coincidences and messy  rushed scenes to even be a compelling or fun movie what a wast of talented actors and a great composer
Jan 5 2020,positive,a truly excellent film i admit i can see why the critics dont like it and why the public generally do a rather satisfying end to a 42yearold story glad i saw it at the cinema and i really enjoyed it
Jan 5 2020,positive,thank goodness they finally kissed
Jan 5 2020,positive,great film honestly a great film the closing it all deserved
Jan 5 2020,positive,this was a great movie it answered a lot of questions
Jan 5 2020,positive,answered a lot of questions now time for new story lines
Jan 5 2020,positive,it gave me a good ending to the saga there were a few things i didnt like but overall a fun movie
Jan 5 2020,neutral,weak transitions impossible physics too many character loose ends tied up too quickly and an unnecessarily long final battle with a gazillion too many spaceships
Jan 5 2020,positive,good movie but odd pacing wrapped up some loose ends and left others a star wars fan must see
Jan 5 2020,positive,i peed a little such a good movie 
Jan 5 2020,positive,was good loved the cringey kiss
Jan 5 2020,positive,the story is basically a remake of rotj not much new other than disney trying to unravel the storyline of the first 6 movies done under george lucas
Jan 5 2020,positive,great way to end the skywalker saga there were some nice twists too some you saw coming others that you might not have the very end has a nice surprise that hints at where they might go next sure there moments that they borrowed from other movies in the series but i feel it was more of a homage than being lazy or unoriginal enjoyed the movie and excited to see where they go next
Jan 5 2020,positive,dont listen to the critics
Jan 5 2020,positive,better than the reviews i read a lot
Jan 5 2020,positive,really well done ending to star wars saga second time going to see it
Jan 5 2020,positive,its not a terrible movie but its certainly not the way to end a story way too much focus on fan service and not enough attention on making a good story 
Jan 5 2020,positive,makes the trilogy worth watching episode vii was a failed pseudoremake and episode viii suffers from having to deal with the mistakes made in vii while trying to set the ground for ix this one makes it all not only bareable but actually enjoyable fast paced action packed full of cameos and overall a worthy ending of the skywalker saga highly recommended
Jan 5 2020,positive,loved everything about it
Jan 5 2020,positive,a little rushed but overall good movie
Jan 5 2020,negative,ive always used this website to see what movies are good and never really set up an account until now to just say how terrible this movie is visually its good cg is good cinematography is good but the writing is what annihilated this movie it destroys continuity in so many ways not just from last jedi it absolutely erases it but almost the entire franchise that includes the prequel trilogy another way of how the writing is terrible is broken down into four parts subverting expectations trope was done abysmally there is very little time to breathe and take in what happened lightsaber or gun fights at almost all times until about the second half when things start to slow down lazyrushed dialogue and character development and broken logicstrategy if no one came to help on krait why does an entire galaxy show up to help this movie is basically a career destroyer for jj and unfortunately possible for some actors roses actor had to shut down social media at one point
Jan 5 2020,negative,it was practically return of the jedi reboot  this was no good
Jan 5 2020,positive,tied up the story lines good action
Jan 5 2020,positive,like the rest of the sequel trilogy this movie is gorgeous anybody that tries to deny that clearly hasnt watched the movies that being said i had some issues with this movie the plot was weak and the story arcs of some of the main characters remained incomplete at the conclusion i am however getting tired of people saying these movies are bad because they are not all og trilogy actors bring their best to their characters and the actors and characters of this trilogy too are great the weakest part of these movies are their structure and plot i will give this movie a slight pass as they had to deal with the passing of carrie fisher and handle her story in a different way but it still could have been done better than this all in all an enjoyable movie that any star wars fan could like not love but like
Jan 5 2020,positive,i am satisfied with the ending of this saga never perfect but this was not the last jedi  
Jan 5 2020,positive,loved the story line and great graphics
Jan 5 2020,positive,loved the nostalgic feel
Jan 5 2020,positive,captured a lot of the flavor of the original  definitely improvement on predecessor which is only one that ive watched only once  good end to saga
Jan 5 2020,positive,movie was a little slow but turned out to be a really good movie some tear jerkers though
Jan 5 2020,positive,great effects family movie
Jan 5 2020,positive,i as a star wars fan must say that this movie is beyond amazing director pulled it thank you so much for great film
Jan 5 2020,positive,i think that to the disaster given to us by tlj jj makes miracles and really gives us a new hope for the series so to speak welcome back emperor even though a lightsaber battle with the emperor was missing good job
Jan 5 2020,positive,fast pace lots of action stil there is something missing   have anyone taken notice about the robots  r2 d2 and c3po the storys is about their journey
Jan 5 2020,positive,loved it put closure together
Jan 5 2020,positive,the best star wars movie that has been released in many years  this is a must see for any true star wars fan  i really loved how the entire story was brought closure and little things from the original movies which could be easily missed  i could watch this over and over just like i have the originals
Jan 5 2020,negative,yet another franticly paced abrams film where the plot is always convenient predictable and deus machina random solutions and macguffins constantly push the roller coaster plot through green room cgi sets most of the dialogue is cringe one liners typical of most every b rate action film star wars movies are typically cheese movies but this is the new low
Jan 5 2020,positive,another epic star wars movie
Jan 5 2020,negative,more of the same poorly contrived deck
Jan 5 2020,negative,so glad this sw saga is over it was required viewing but got so stupid and politically correct it was tough to stomach the ewoks were tolerable but jarjar was ridiculous purplehaired adm holdo was too much ending luke and leia the way they did was just stupid  hans death at least served some purpose  they had access to any writer and cast and any script they could have possibly imagined and this is what we got  i suspect there will be some spinoffs and maybe even some other prequels and as much as i loved the original trilogy i doubt ill see it at the theater maybe on cable but it has certainly fallen from mustsee territory forever the wheels fell off a long long time ago in a movie studio not so far far away
Jan 5 2020,positive,a fitting end to the new trilogy  brings the saga full circle and leaves the audience with a warm fuzzy feeling as return of the jedi did for the original trilogy
Jan 5 2020,positive,if you come in with no expectations and love star wars it will be a great film however the film does fell packed and rushed with decisions and may have been better longer and some choices changed
Jan 5 2020,positive,the movie its amazing
Jan 5 2020,positive,amazing i dont mind that a lot of it was to please the fans there was so many great moments great job
Jan 5 2020,positive,terrific took grandson and daughter and husband all thought it was great
Jan 5 2020,positive,great movie  the acting of daisy ridley was absolutely amazing
Jan 5 2020,positive,i liked the way it tied the saga up  tears rolled down my cheeks when carrie fisher was on screen
Jan 5 2020,positive,was a spectacular watch effects and characters are great the cohesive story line and the overall culmination of a series this prolific left a bit to be sought after but i know die hard star wars fans that liked it and others than disliked  im somewhere in the middle
Jan 5 2020,positive,doesnt deserve as negative the ratings that it has gotten pretty good
Jan 5 2020,positive,loved it  loved seeing all the characters
Jan 5 2020,positive,same star ears excitement yeah to the good guys
Jan 5 2020,positive,the tomatometer is so inaccurate and i never trust it this movie was solid from start to finish and didnt a great job concluding the journey i didnt even like rey or kylo until this movie and i will say this is perhaps my favorite one definitely go see on the big screen 
Jan 5 2020,positive,it was good much better than the last one and finally answered some questions
Jan 5 2020,positive,a couple plot holes but overall a fantastic way to end the saga bringing back some of the memories and props from the original trilogy i called so many things out that would happen and they did
Jan 5 2020,negative,sloppy filmmaking and messy unimaginative story
Jan 5 2020,negative,this movie was no bueno ruined anakins legacy
Jan 5 2020,positive,it was an amazing movie and i cant wait to watch it again  there just wasnt a single thing about the film i didnt absolutely love  well done jj and crew on bringing it all home in the most satisfying film since the first trilogy
Jan 5 2020,positive,brought the good points and action of the star wars saga without being redundant good action and storyline left one wanting more
Jan 5 2020,positive,i was just so happy and sad to see the conclusion of the entire saga that began 42 years ago
Jan 5 2020,neutral,just fair tired plot line with no new surprises time to go
Jan 5 2020,positive,in all honesty this is by far my favorite of the sequel trilogy and i really enjoyed it  ive like every star wars movie and this one doesnt fail me  i have a few issues regarding pacing and the ending but overall if you enjoy star wars this is worth a watch
Jan 5 2020,positive,absolutely fantastic ending to this story
Jan 5 2020,negative,this movie attempts to revive a dead franchise by trotting out all of the once loved characters of the past  it failed miserably  what a waste
Jan 5 2020,positive,i am a scifi lover  but ive never put on a costume or attended a convention  ive also loved the star wars series because of its cutting edge approach in story line as well as filming techniques  it used to be fearless a kind of us against them attitude that said if you like this film youre cool if you dont youre an idiot  so watching this latest offering smacked of just how far the mighty have fallen  it was as if the pc culture police had an office on the film set  there wasnt a pet cultural icon missing  it was as if the makers thought that checking off the list of expected pc inclusions would earn them favor with the powerful    and the script had moments where i could have written better  at one time someone said something like the galaxy is watching oh please   i do however give points for attempting to bring all the dangling story lines from past efforts into some kind of closure  and the use of cutting edge technology was as wonderful as ever  having a major star present in the film long after her passing was beyond simply being impressive  and placing vintage footage of faces in modern costumes really passed the thats cool test    but the star of the project in my opinion was john williams  the final battle sequence and subsequent victory party was mr williams at his best  the iconic use of musical themes for various characters or emotions was expected  but i was impressed in the fact that john williams could have just coasted past the finish line with a good enough score  but this was a new level of excellence even for him  absolutely breathtakingly delicious    in all without taking all this too seriously if the objective was to entertain they succeeded fully  could it have been better in my opinion yes  but when all is said and done it continued the series objective in one word  fun
Jan 5 2020,positive,great way to end the series 
Jan 5 2020,positive,good movie die hard fans will nitpick small details about the storyline but it is an entertaining movie
Jan 5 2020,positive,was ok but not what i was expecting
Jan 5 2020,positive,ties the whole story together
Jan 5 2020,positive,great ending to 9 films great movie by itself
Jan 5 2020,positive,it was everything i was hoping it would be for the end of the skywalker saga
Jan 5 2020,positive,im definitely going to watch it again masterpiece 
Jan 5 2020,positive,i have been a fan since a little kid when a new hope came out  i am sad to see it end but i was a bit disappointed in how it does the name of the movie is very misleading there is action from start to finish which is awesome if youre fan it is a must see i dont expect any academy awards but it is entertaining
Jan 5 2020,positive,it was good not great much better than the last jedi im happy to see this trilogy end and excited to see what they do next
Jan 5 2020,positive,star wars always amazing
Jan 5 2020,neutral,i do like fast paced movie but this star wars is too fast no character developments at all i was expecting more of it disappointed
Jan 5 2020,neutral,formulaic  well done but predictable  like the last book of a long series being written by a stand in author
Jan 5 2020,negative,just didnt do anything right at all and i already had low expectations i tried to give it a shoot but damn the story makes no sense disney is messing everything up the fight scenes didnt even do anything for me they were boring in all honesty c3po was the only thing keeping it together
Jan 5 2020,positive,absolutely loved it great ending to the saga so many loose ends tied up and amazing battle scenes
Jan 5 2020,positive,great end to the star wars story  action packed with compelling characters
Jan 5 2020,positive,i viewed the rise of skywalker and enjoyed it so much i went a few days later and saw it again  its clear from professional and fan reviews that many wanted something totally new instead of properly closing out the existing storyline thats sad because the missed opportunity was their problem not the films  yes there some issues that concerned me the biggest two of which were how rey progressed in her jedi training so quickly and later why luke would raise the xwing fighter instead of rey  in my mind these are of no real concern to the completeness and enjoyment of the movie  in fact in this new installment i thought it was pure genius to make rey the granddaughter of palpatine  this gave credibility to her level of giftedness and more importantly spoiler alert it made it credible how she could successfully fight and win against palpatine himself  one additional outcome was that it brought a new emphasis to the fact that even if you give yourself to the dark side of the force you are not necessarily lost  kylo may have thought that was the right course but it was clear that rey truly did detect conflict in him  kylo was not lost in the end and reys faith in him also was not lost  many felt that this trilogy was a wasted but the development of rey as a new jedi figure was the natural transition of life wasnt it  someone new was needed to carry on this legacy and the granddaughter of palpatine was the perfect choice  where does it go from here  is this the actual end of star wars  the film seemed to suggest that a new saga could be in the offing but it will be critical in my mind that any new films have to provide a new direction for the fans  all i know is that i will be there to watch them when and if they do arrive
Jan 5 2020,positive,emotional rollercoaster
Jan 5 2020,positive,a good blend of new and old
Jan 5 2020,positive,a very entertaining movie great action and winning performances from adam driver and daisy ridley the best of this final trilogy 
Jan 5 2020,positive,i am not what you call a huge star wars fan but i liked the movies that came from george lucas than the ones coming from disney the rise of skywalker was alright but after watching it i realized that i could have waited for it to come out on blu ray
Jan 5 2020,positive,it answered questions and made me laugh cry and cheer i will miss the saga of my youth
Jan 5 2020,positive,the rise of the skywalker finished the saga with a ton of action while there are familiar themes and scenes it sticks with the overall concept of the original trilogy the only negative is that it could have been slightly longer and wrapped up a few loose ends overall it was enjoyable and met the desired action and adventure required for a star wars movie
Jan 5 2020,positive,this movie was a great end to the skywalker saga  it is a ride from beginning to end  youre amazed you cheer you cry and it was an amazing movie  if you hated the the last jedi or were disappointed by it youll love this movie  if you loved tlj then youll hate it  its that simple  this movie is everything a star wars movie is all about   all things considered it could have been a lot worse with what jj had to work with  the last jedi catastrophe nearly wrecked the franchise  its nice to have things back on track
Jan 5 2020,positive,cant wait to see it again 
Jan 5 2020,positive,enjoyable suffered some pacing issues and writing flaws but i liked it
Jan 5 2020,positive,i enjoyed emeancley there were lots of surprises
Jan 5 2020,positive,i went into this with low expectations after the dumpster fire of the last jedi he had a lot of work after rian johnsons train wreck overall jj did a good job trying to wrap up loose ends answer questions and do fan service with the original characters this film much more like an original star wars film i walked out satisfied and really enjoyed the movie nice work jj
Jan 5 2020,positive,excellent special effects top notch  story line was ok  acting was well done
Jan 5 2020,positive,wrapped the saga nicely  thrilling entertaining and very enjoyable
Jan 5 2020,positive,excellent movie for the diehard star war fans
Jan 5 2020,positive,i loved it i thought it was a perfect ending
Jan 5 2020,positive,loved the movie and would go see it again
Jan 5 2020,positive,the script was predictable and similar to past movies not much changed but the kids enjoyed the special effects
Jan 5 2020,positive,love star wars great ending but dab at the same time
Jan 5 2020,negative,a film with wonderful acting and a brilliant score that is undermined by an underdeveloped plot filled with inconsistencies and plot holes for a series conclusion it leaves many questions unanswered and raises many more along the way  without answering some of those either you could probably get a better plot from 3 fans in the span of 2 hours of development not that the plot doesnt have potential  it just fails to reach it to distract you from this abrams whisks you from scene to scene without much time to process until when you finally do process it you realize that many of the scenes in this movie are pointless and unthought out rise of skywalker was clearly written in response to audience reviews of movies 7 and 8 and incidentally there is no coherent plot throughout them all despite all this it was worth seeing exactly once just to see how bad it was for myself i have no need to buy the movie or see it again
Jan 5 2020,negative,its star wars so its worth watching but what a weak and disjointed plot these last films delivered
Jan 5 2020,positive,the best star wars movie since the original trilogy everything a fan could want wrapped up in a tidy twohour package  even if you didnt like the first two of this trilogy give this movie a try
Jan 5 2020,positive,loved it sad its the last star wars movie
Jan 5 2020,positive,it was very good fan service and a fine way to end the skywalker saga there are a lot of holes and fleets of fancy and jj abramskathleen kennedy should both stop doing anything related to star wars that being said i found it to be enjoyable however implausible it may be and the interaction between daisy ridley and adam driver was easily the best part of the movie
Jan 5 2020,positive,i loved it i cried a few times
Jan 5 2020,negative,all over the place no real story
Jan 5 2020,positive,great ending to the saga good bye skywalkers
Jan 5 2020,positive,another example that the critics dont get the whole scifi category awesome movie well writing and i great way to finish the new batch of start wars highly recommended
Jan 5 2020,negative,this movie doesnt doesnt do justice to either the old characters or the new this last trilogy was unecessary and ended up being shockingly cruel for all the beloved ot characters  no more skywalkers no more solos so im not interested in sw any more despite being a fan for years  the lack of consistency when you consider the three movies should have worked together as a whole and flown into each other seamlessly is so frustrating they should have worked together as a whole but the dont i wonder whose idea it was to gift us all especially the childrenwith such a depressing hopeless ending wasnt sw supposed to be a series of movies for all the family who thought it was good idea really jj
Jan 5 2020,positive,great acting story line was good fun watch
Jan 5 2020,negative,34 of the movie were irrelevant and uneeded and alot of it did not make sense if you think about things
Jan 5 2020,positive,definitely better than what ryan johnson did for tlj
Jan 5 2020,positive,not bad im not the biggest star wars fan but i enjoyed this movie
Jan 5 2020,negative,i kept falling asleep directionless mess wasnt funny or engaging sad
Jan 5 2020,neutral,just as the the last two movies to concude this saga this movie is not really good and the last movie that skywalker deserved it is let down by bad storytelling bad casting with the exception of daisy ridley as rey to much copying of the old trilogyplot even some bad visual effects blowing up of kijimi a feeling of a lack of passion and the much focus on fan and crowdpleasing  it is ok for a evening of entertainment and some moments are gorgeous and make you feel the excitement you had when you watched the orignal trilogy but on the overall it dosent even come close to a happy closure of the skywalkersaga the original trilogy deserved a better closure anno 2020
Jan 5 2020,positive,i liked how all the movies tied back to this new installment the special effects were great only wished yoda was involved in reys training and finn finally told her what he wanted to tell her
Jan 5 2020,positive,as a fan of star wars i was obligated to watch liked it more than previous 2 movies but still not the same atmosphere as in prequel which i consider as a model
Jan 5 2020,positive,great movie it was more like the original 1st 3 movies and the last one movie had several of the original cast was enjoyable to see but not to much of them the effects were outstanding if you like star wars youve got to see in in the theaters
Jan 5 2020,positive,thank you jj abrams for undoing what rian johnson did
Jan 5 2020,positive,rey and kylo had an excellent journey as characters finn was used fantastically in this film a lot of heart a lot of humor a fitting end to this saga
Jan 5 2020,positive,i got such a warm star wars feeling by the end sure i felt like the start was a bit disjointed and some of the ending was a bit farfetched but they did the best job i think it was possible to do given the massive expectations i and other fans had
Jan 5 2020,positive,by far my favorite star wars movie of the sequel trilogy and the best star wars movie since rots i expected to hate this movie like i did with tlj but i was pleasantly surprised
Jan 5 2020,positive,i loved how they brought the original characters back for this movie  if only for a brief moment 
Jan 5 2020,positive,great action packed movie
Jan 5 2020,positive,the best star wars movie ever
Jan 5 2020,positive,i couldnt disagree with half the critics more  i dont think giving me everything i wanted to see is a bad thing and this movie certainly does not disappoint save the unexpected for another franchise and give me my nostalgia please  thank you well done jj abrams i had chills during the movie and i left the theater with a smile bravo
Jan 5 2020,positive,average didnt really enjoy the first two so to be completed honest im just happy its over if theres more to come i really do hope they start fresh these new additions just dont cut it for me great animation and all but story is just lacking and if you dont have a good story i could care less for the animation
Jan 5 2020,positive,super entertaining i didnt totally follow the plot and a lot of moments were definitely contrived to pluck those nostalgia heartstrings but even with no real surprises in the story i was entertained
Jan 5 2020,positive,the ending scene where all the media speak to rey
Jan 5 2020,positive,despite some rather questionable plot points the rise of skywalker lives up to the task of dishing up the thrilling ride we ask from a star wars adventure  wonderful characters emotional confrontations nailbiting situations  and the nostalgic nods appreciated and not overdone
Jan 5 2020,positive,thanks i loved it even the obvious parts
Jan 5 2020,positive,enjoyed the special effects and how the story unfolds
Jan 5 2020,positive,i dont get the negative reviews  i loved it and thought it was exciting emotional and a perfect ending seeing all the characters come back was a real treat best thing to ever happen to star wars was getting rid of george lucas
Jan 5 2020,positive,i liked how most things were resolved  we finally know who rey is  she was wonderful  it was nice to see han solo again that was a nice surprise  cool that rey had even more power than realized with being able to heal and shoot lightening from her fingers
Jan 5 2020,positive,it was a good conclusion to the saga
Jan 5 2020,negative,absolute garbage pile  that spits on the grave of classic star wars its a bit better than the previous flaming garbage fire that is the last jedi but that is hardly a high bar   if you want a shallow pathetic nostalgia trip and are able to completely shut off your brain in order to consume media then feel free to waste your money in theaters
Jan 5 2020,positive,a nice but sad conclusion kinda left it open for more of them if they decide to continue with rae though
Jan 5 2020,positive,great action great acting phenomenal special effects cool plot twist only downside was a ton of story crammed together
Jan 5 2020,positive,loved all the closure and full circle ending of it thanks for the ride
Jan 5 2020,positive,they saved the best for last i was kinda getting bored with the same or similar track of all the star wars movies with some character continuity but the last this particular movie ended properly for me  done
Jan 5 2020,positive,great ending to a great story it was an amazing movie 
Jan 5 2020,negative,style over substance
Jan 5 2020,negative,no new gizmos in this using a dead woman very unsettling  carrie fisher is gone
Jan 5 2020,positive,mediocre at best by far the better of the three current films but this latest trilogy are basically standard scifi films i feel too much damage has now been done to the star wars legacy
Jan 5 2020,positive,loved the special effects in the movie  didnt like that ben died in the end  it was a great movie  my grandson and i are great fans of the star wars movies
Jan 5 2020,negative,seen it just to confirm what i had readseen on the internet first half of the film is damage control fixing the issues the last film caused last half is really a race to the finish  thank god its finally over
Jan 5 2020,positive,this was one of the best star wars movies ever  i loved how abrams wrapped up the saga and there were so many great moments in this film that i was in tears and so happy by the end of it  i cannot believe that this movie would have anything less the 90 in rotten tomatoes which actually was the reason my boyfriend and i waited so long to see it  but seriously this was a fantastic movie with lots of shocking reveals and twists on the saga but also great storytelling acting action and pace  definitely a must see
Jan 5 2020,positive,story and visual effects
Jan 5 2020,negative,just ok another missed opportunity to tell a different jedis story that expands our knowledge and history of this star wars mythology
Jan 5 2020,positive,if you have ever seen the other star war movies played the video games or known someone who loves star warsgo see this  loose ends are tied  little snippets mande me tear up i must admit  i went to the theater in 1977 to see the first onebeen to all of themat a theater  you need that experience the smell of popcornget into your happy place and enjoy
Jan 5 2020,negative,i thought it was horrible there was way too much action and it lacked terribly with storyline and human element the fact that finally ben is turned around and falls in love with rae and they kiss was wonderful but that was short lived when he was killed off  it ruined the movie  and the end was confusing  i was not able to figure out why she is now a skywalker  this movie was the worst of the series  ashame for what george lucas accomplished
Jan 5 2020,positive,solid film i had a few minor gripes with overall i had a lot of fun
Jan 5 2020,negative,formulaic and shoddy writing  jj and crew should not be proud of what they have done to the franchise
Jan 5 2020,positive,great film definitely go and see it there are a few things i could critique about what decisions they made but overall a must watch awesome action too
Jan 5 2020,negative,this was shit compared to the other ones
Jan 5 2020,negative,an unsatisfactory end to a directionless trilogy with no real story vision or plot which makes me feel sorry for the waste of this talented use of actors
Jan 5 2020,positive,brother and i had the same reaction  this is objectively not a good movie and we enjoyed it so much  thoughts with some spoilers  i actually thought they did a good job redeeming kylo  wasnt expecting them to given the magnitude of what he did and how so many people seemed to love him anyway but the end felt satisfying and i didnt expect that  so very many plot holes how did several characters survive how did they leave a planet without a ship who actually made that dagger what actually is time andor space what can the force not do at this point what did finn want to tell rey  everything was too much  every time carrie fisher was on screen i wanted to cry i dont think they did a great job incorporating her alreadyfilmed scenes into the movie but its hard to complain about it  merry  did we really need another droid  i also kind of loved the new droid  wedge  poor kelly marie tran  poe and finn are absolutely in love and there is nothing you can do to convince me otherwise  it would have been nice to have more than two seconds to absorb finding out who the spy was before killing him off but kay  i kind of want to watch it again immediately
Jan 5 2020,negative,they simply ruin everything about star wars sooo disappointed
Jan 5 2020,positive,palpatine is back and was building sith eternal behind the scenes likely with his trusted imperial dignitaries we saw in return of the jedi now his plan has come to fruition loved everything about this the aliens the planet settings the epic battles this is the star wars we know and love
Jan 5 2020,positive,amazing soundtrack great camera work beautiful and exciting visual however the plot was meh and seemed very close to the original trilogy  i would have personally like to see them take more risks in this trilogy to break the cookie cutter star wars plot of god find the bad guys base turn the bad guy good and with the power of the combined force take out the base and save the day blah blah blah  the prequels tried to create their own story but werent great  but i feel it could have worked if they just did it a little better another thing of note is that the dialog came of as cheesy quite a bit and almost felt like there was too many moments of trying to get cheep laughs in moments that didnt need it or where it just didnt flow with the story
Jan 5 2020,negative,entertaining but has several plot holes i  think with killing off han solo and luke skywalker in the previous movies that the plan was to focus of princess leia which of course went up in flames due to carrie  fishers death   yes the plot was rushed with many wtf moments but i think they did the best they could though with what they had and ended it in a decent way   super fun movie  but fans of the saga will notice the plot holes
Jan 5 2020,positive,this movie is a blast  its not perfect by any means but it was definitely a fun and emotional movie
Jan 5 2020,positive,i thought it was a great ending to a great series
Jan 5 2020,positive,neatit felt a little like the movie was pandering to the fans there were also too many characters but apart from that 4 stars
Jan 5 2020,positive,action from start to finish i enjoyed the movie a lot
Jan 5 2020,positive,i think that this movie ended of the skywalker saga in an amazing way
Jan 5 2020,negative,garbage disney ruined star wars thank you disney
Jan 5 2020,negative,not a good movie and a very bad endingluke and leia personality is not the same at all they must be sad to see thisthe sword fight is stupidthey scream more when attacking as if they are not even a jedi not a lot of alien than before a lightsaber that cant cut people like beforea lightsaber that can be used by everyonehahahahaha revenge of the sith is the best and the old ending is much better than thisstop doing something stupid just to get money atleast read the comic
Jan 5 2020,negative,if i were to write the entire reason why this movie is dissappointing it will come out as an essay and this movie doesnt worth that much attention   the simple reason is that tros suffers from a heavy case of bad writing and it wastes too much potential that i cant forgive it no matter how flashy the actions or how cute the creatures are at least the actors are all great and bring their best despite the messy story
Jan 5 2020,positive,lots of excitement and really ties the whole series together  fun
Jan 5 2020,positive,loved it i think the critics need to rewatch it  i think many opinions could change as they absorbed more of the heavy plot lines
Jan 5 2020,neutral,disappointing end to an amazing saga  plot disjointed with poor explanation  too much homage to prior episodes
Jan 5 2020,neutral,it was a movie full of fetch quests get this dagger get this translated get chewie get this triangle destroy thisoops wait what now never mind now destroy this one it was full of plot holes and filled with garbage characters plots of previous movies were destroyed by this one its just messy
Jan 5 2020,positive,we felt that it followed the first movies story line and production loved it
Jan 5 2020,positive,well madeproduced still giving me goosebumps since the first episode i saw 33 years ago
Jan 5 2020,positive,like how all characters were brought out to a point to show how it was all connected loved my last star wats movie
Jan 5 2020,positive,it was amazing the storyline the character development and the emotional connections were perfectly written the effects were of course amazing as well the closing scene was genius and leaves you wanting to know whats next loved it
Jan 5 2020,negative,the best that could be done with the trianwreck of the last jedi weighing it down this movie still suffers from plot holes dizzyingly unnecessary plot twists and a frenetic pace from start to finish its entertaining but ensures that this star wars trilogy will forever be a black mark for the franchise
Jan 5 2020,positive,as a star wars fan i was very dissapointed the way this movie uses the force is as if you could take on a god
Jan 5 2020,positive,i really enjoyed the movie especia
Jan 5 2020,positive,choppy cinematography at the beginning had me wishing for more continuity in the flow of story but the rest of the movie was superb have a few questions still even with all the closure
Jan 5 2020,positive,special effects were amazing it was intense funny and good storyline
Jan 5 2020,negative,least appealing of all star wars movies lack of excitement we fell asleep in 3 d movie
Jan 5 2020,negative,took itself too seriously no chemistry between the characters  same old tired star wars themes my relative is evil will i be good and war some of the landscape shots were cool but the general trajectory of the movie was meh too scary for my 10 yo child left 90 mins in
Jan 5 2020,negative,this film was pretty bad in a lot of ways i would need to see it again to have better perspective but i dont really have a desire to  as opposed to the the force awakens which i saw three times in theaters   it felt like the first half of the movie was running from scene to scene trying to tie loose ends from previous films or in some cases reframe them and that the choices didnt always work the scene cuts were often so fast that before i had a chance to feel the affect of a scene the film had moved onto the next scene the result was i didnt feel much of anything for the characters or their storylines   with this trilogy i feel disney mishandled rey ive watched three movies where she was the focus and by the end i didnt really feel any attachment or connection to her character or story  which sucks because i wanted to i dont want to spoil the movie so ill tread lightly but there is a scene where she really accesses her anger for the first time and the consequence felt like it had real impact on another character and her   until it didnt i also dont feel much for finn or poe or really any new character in this trilogy   in the best dramatic storytelling we care about characters no character feels safe we mourn their loses and we celebrate their wins as of theyre our own this movie struggles to do these things well i did start to feel some emotion towards the climax but it was more out nostalgia because ive been watching these films since i was a kid and i care about the star wars world but honestly i felt more emotion in the first ten minutes of pixars up than this entire trilogy   i read that after carrie fisher passed key scenes had to be rethought that muddled the plan for the trilogy including a scene in the second film where she would have emerged as a jedi master wielding a lightsaber this would have been a cool transition into the third film im sure carries death had an impact on the choices made for both the rise of skywalker and the last jedi but the filmmakers really failed to step up to that challenge this actually makes me sad as a fan this might be the worst of the nine films    with all of this said i loved the mandalorian if youre a star wars fan  watch it  i hope disney  takes what theyve learned from that project and that they apply it to future star wars movies i want to see simple emotionally driven stories about characters i care about
Jan 5 2020,negative,spends an aweful lot of time to shit on its predecessors senceless unemotional story with an unearned finale
Jan 5 2020,positive,i think the movie is fine  i dont understand what the critics are looking for  there is a lot more of character development in this one than tlj  its unfortunate the star wars saga ended when we have finally gotten to know all the new characters
Jan 5 2020,positive,good movie i enjoyed it but there were too many plot holes
Jan 5 2020,positive,the best móvil of the last trilogy
Jan 5 2020,positive,great overall i would give it 5 stars if the ending had been better
Jan 5 2020,positive,i thought this movie was fun and a great closing to the story
Jan 5 2020,positive,44 years old and have always loved star wars if you are like me then you will really enjoy the finale very well done ive now seen it twice and it is packed with new adventures the right amount of humor and an ending fitting of the franchise
Jan 5 2020,negative,the plot of this movie was a complete 180 to the prior movie
Jan 5 2020,negative,boring and predictable
Jan 5 2020,positive,great movie definitely worth watching im theaters the only negative is it feels a bit rushed and honestly could have been broken into two movies with greater detail
Jan 5 2020,positive,that feeling of good against bad and the power of simple people making a difference came through loud and clear
Jan 5 2020,positive,i cant go into details without spoiling the movie theres plenty of spoiler moments but i will say that i was disappointed with the direction of the story and some of the reveals i think the biggest challenge for jj abrahams was trying to undo the storyline mess that johnson created in the last jedi visually the movie looks awesome the special effects are some of the best you are going to see
Jan 5 2020,positive,i think there where some things missed in the making if jedis can levitate why are they always climbing things  i enjoyed it and loved the ending just wish they had payed attention to some of the small things like reactions matching the situation
Jan 5 2020,negative,im not sure what i watched but it was not star wars droids having human emotion the dead using the force so much aweful content crammed into 25 hours i literally almost walked out several times i cant i might actually be done with star wars all together if this is how disney christmas closed off the skywalker saga no class
Jan 5 2020,positive,fastpaced fun and a little heartwrenching for fans of the skywalker saga definitely requires multiple viewings to take it all in
Jan 5 2020,positive,great ending for series lots of cool fight choreography and of course amazing special effects
Jan 5 2020,positive,it was a fun tale the end of which was predictable as is disney still enjoyed it very much
Jan 5 2020,positive,my grandson loved the movie and was thrilled to have watched it
Jan 5 2020,positive,storyline was good and tied the trilogy together unlike the second movie
Jan 5 2020,positive,i thought it was a great movie and fitting end to the saga
Jan 5 2020,positive,saw it twice already
Jan 5 2020,negative,too much hype to see this this movie was a remake of episodes 5 and 6
Jan 5 2020,positive,i liked the movie and would recommend it to anyone that has seen the others
Jan 5 2020,positive,wraps up 40 yrs of storylines well done
Jan 5 2020,positive,action storyline characters actors past and present make this an enjoyable story see in 3d with motion seats motion seats alone just doesnt cut it
Jan 5 2020,neutral,it was to long  it still left it open for more storylines i wasnt impressed with the latest chapter in the star wars story
Jan 5 2020,positive,overall it did what the fans wanted and thats more important than what critics think and makes me question what need there are for critics when what really matters to most people is if other people liked it witch clearly they did it should be audience score first then critics not other way around
Jan 5 2020,positive,actionpacked emotionally charged and visually stunning thoroughly enjoyed this movie
Jan 5 2020,negative,really bad installment like the other two in the sequel trilogy it lacks anakin skywalker as the chosen one anakin is the backbone of the skywalker saga  whats supposed to be the finale of skywalker saga without anakin skywalker himself can not be a decent finale the fact that the emperor returned ruined anakins legacy as the one who destroyed the sith and brought balance to the force and its even worse to leave the role to rey  a newly introduced character whos technically not a skywalker at all the title itself rise of skywalker is a misleading one
Jan 5 2020,negative,better than episode 8 but still a complete failure to live by the legacy of star wars
Jan 5 2020,positive,i was disappointed  the movie is lacking something  im not sure if its the acting or the storyline or the editing but just did not measure up to many of its prequels
Jan 5 2020,positive,great movie it has a lot of things packed into a small time frame so be aware unlike the last jj star wars film it doesnt feel like a remake of another film some of the comedy was corny and a bit cringe but overall the movie was fantastic
Jan 5 2020,neutral,my opinion is that they tried to put way too much information and in your face action scenes especially at the beginning it looked like it lacked in direction contrary to the first one from jj abrahams its like it needed to be finished quick
Jan 5 2020,positive,good moments and concepts story is an utter mess especially when considered among the other movies and content
Jan 5 2020,positive,loved it best star wars film ever tied all the story lines up really well please make another
Jan 5 2020,positive,hit all the right notes answered questions and said goodbye all i needed
Jan 5 2020,negative,not good guys it looks like 2 movies in one the first one trying to excuse himself for the episode viii the second one trying to finish this trilogy unfortunately as none of the new characters have been well established with goals and personnality we dont care about what happens to them everything goes way too fast and adding new characters was a bad choice as we cant care less of them  the saddest thing is watching all those old characters and feeling nothing for them neither thanks disney jj and kathleen for this 1 billion fan trilogy may star wars rest in peace now cause it finished 36 years ago in galaxy far far away
Jan 5 2020,positive,not sure what the complaining was about  tied the old worlds and new together nicely  well made dramatic  loved it
Jan 5 2020,positive,if you have been a fan since the 1977 release of the first star wars movie you will like this movie go see it
Jan 5 2020,positive,it does a great job of continuing and tying up the jedisith mythology its fun it has surprises that make sense and terrific adventure
Jan 5 2020,positive,great ending for the saga down to the last minute
Jan 5 2020,negative,i know its a star wars film so total plotting is not always needed but how did the emperor return like any clue at all  in the original trilogy and even the prequels you get drawn in by looking up answers for these things and finding out depths to the films here you just go huh threw away all the interesting world building in the previous film too
Jan 5 2020,positive,great action with an almost perfect story 
Jan 5 2020,negative,terrible ending it was messy all over the place and you can tell its a very rush script if you turn off you brain you can enjoy just the star wars visual otherwise the story is not coherent with saga its not about the skywalkers saga dont waste your money wait till it goes on cable which is always free
Jan 5 2020,positive,thank you for sticking to the classic formula  we saw it in 3d imax and that made it all the more special  it was everything we have come to expect in the series  we found the many homages to those passed very heartwarming
Jan 5 2020,positive,not sure how this movie got any bad publicity it was amazing i left wanting to buy another ticket and watch it again
Jan 5 2020,positive,it was awesome and so perfectly tied everything together
Jan 5 2020,positive,predictable but entertaining
Jan 5 2020,positive,classic star wars fun
Jan 5 2020,neutral,action was great but storyline had holes
Jan 5 2020,negative,sophomoric dialogue predictable plot
Jan 5 2020,positive,the star wars saga finally ended in silence just as it began i was hopeful that jj abrams could bring us a memorable ending but he fell short of that goal seems that all of the sequels and prequels had the same plot just with different characters they had to resort to bringing back longdead jedi to remind us this movie was somehow connected to the original george lucas masterpiece some cute new characters but many were just human bodies with some animal or fishtype head on top strange and the storm troopers they must be the worst army in history as they never hit anybody in the main cast and get killed like toy soldiers same goes for the new order fleet which looked so imposing yet was easily destroyed by a small fleet of junked star fighters all in all very disappointing and have to admit i nodded out a few times during the way too long debacle
Jan 5 2020,positive,can jj abrams somehow erase force awakens and last jedi and remake them rise of skywalker actually felt like you were watching a star wars movie instead of wasting time and money on garbage
Jan 5 2020,negative,it is safe to say that disney burned the entire movie fanbase no continuation of the main story of star wars will be coming for a while with the success of the mandolorian there will be more spinoffs a predictable downfall for sure
Jan 5 2020,neutral,if you dont really know the lore of starwars then the action will be amazing but for those that know the lore will not like the plot and youll have a lot of questions
Jan 5 2020,positive,anyone that tells you they didnt like it is either a liar or just not a movie fan of star wars
Jan 5 2020,negative,rey killed chewie sike  rey killed kylo  sike  ben fell into a bottomless pit and died  sike  rey died  sike  reys gone into exile  sike  c3po has lost his memory forever  sike
Jan 5 2020,positive,it was big and loud with lots of things blowing up  true to the star wars brand
Jan 5 2020,positive,excellent conclusion to the saga
Jan 5 2020,positive,great overall liked bringing back original characters
Jan 5 2020,positive,brilliant magnificent overwhelmingly satisfying and the best film in the saga i dont understand how anyone could dislike this film
Jan 5 2020,positive,great movie with super special effects
Jan 5 2020,positive,enjoyed it a lot but a lot of really strange lines and very predictable big picture moments regardless definitely worth seeing and overall a fun movie stays true to the originals in some good ways
Jan 5 2020,positive,loved it without question best one of the series didnt hesitate it is fantastic
Jan 5 2020,positive,such a great way to wrap up everything  and i mean everything
Jan 5 2020,positive,great movie action pack with a twist of humor and romance
Jan 5 2020,positive,has a few flaws but puts a beautiful end to many storylines especially from the last jedi the only thing im sad about is the storyline of rose just because some fans didnt like her
Jan 5 2020,positive,a typical star wars extravaganza fun loud crazy characters lots of action as usual the plot was the same as all evil vs good good job tying up loose ends nice to see some of the early characters i would watch it again to look for the minutiae which is always interesting
Jan 5 2020,positive,great installment to the saga very good ending
Jan 5 2020,positive,special effects and story line
Jan 5 2020,positive,a beautiful ending to a beautiful saga an unpopular opinion maybe but i personally enjoyed it more than the previous two tfa tlj
Jan 5 2020,positive,the movie ran too long it was drawn out at times the ending was not rewarding enough to justify the long time spent in the seat the special effects were good but i think we have already seen too many aerial battles in aircraft and too many swordfights with light sabers i dont want to sound like a hater it was mostly pretty good
Jan 5 2020,positive,too much chaos at the beginning overkill on the action before getting into the story
Jan 5 2020,positive,aside from a few plot holes the movie was brilliant  it had a great emotional heart and delivered far stronger characterization than we have seen in star wars for a long time ridley and driver blew it out of the park and anyone hating on this movie is just being contrarian for the sake of it
Jan 5 2020,positive,nothing to write home about
Jan 5 2020,positive,not bad but a bit rushed
Jan 5 2020,positive,loved all the action shed a few tears however i was slightly disappointed about the ending just give the people what they want for a change and some of the ending didnt make total sense
Jan 5 2020,positive,liked that they brought back the original characters
Jan 5 2020,positive,its a great movie and a end of  an era
Jan 5 2020,positive,great resolution of stories
Jan 5 2020,negative,the movie was totally rushed and basically crammed damage control in to fix the mess of episode 8 this trilogy has been anything but good and definitely inconsistent in the plot
Jan 5 2020,negative,i guess they did the best they could after the last jedi so many horrible little things like ray is sailing a boat in huge seas and rain and her cloths are dry fin is a total disrespectful twat to po suddenly ray can heal things the bad guy is a spy ah they just make it up as they go thank goodness its all over
Jan 5 2020,positive,awesome movie no clue why it received all the negative reviews saw it twice second time was even better  very satisfied
Jan 5 2020,positive,excellent best of the last 3 and as good as the very first great job jj
Jan 5 2020,positive,it tied up a lot of loose ends i just really enjoyed it
Jan 5 2020,negative,i enjoyed it when it was over but after a short while i began to think about what i had just watched and gradually felt disappointed wasted potential throughout
Jan 5 2020,negative,great visuals fast paced action  nothing makes any sense theres force healing now being thrown around anakin missed that class and i guess the emperor is back but we never hear why or how
Jan 5 2020,negative,i have two words to describe this movie unbelievably dumb
Jan 5 2020,negative,the whole plot  caracter development ending doesnt make any sense
Jan 5 2020,positive,if u love character on skywalker saga it no reason not to watch
Jan 5 2020,positive,not as bad as the general consensus makes it out to be  perhaps there is just too many feelings around the skywalkersjedi history  canon that disney would do well to continue with nonconnected characters like in rogue one and the mandelorean  its time to finally leave the classic character behind and safe  if this movie serves to help the audience appreciate the underrated the last jedi a little more  another movie trying to focus more on our new characters of rey finn poe  kylo  ill appreciate it  the rise of skywalker proves a fitting transitionalending chapter but does not cross into the higher tier of star wars films like empire revenge rogue  last jedi imo and the original new hope  skywalker will rank somewhere amongst the middling films return attack  force awakens
Jan 5 2020,negative,a rushed movie that jumps all over the place
Jan 5 2020,negative,dreadful patchwork movie with copy paste content both literally in terms of special effects and plot line spends more time retconning than building a plot and begs the question of why make this trilogy to begin with the answer is that as a standalone story it would be a bland mess whereas shoe horning old cast members makes money im relieved this trilogy is over and hope that i dont need to watch anymore star wars in the future the half star is to also represent my disappointment in the cast themselves daisey rarely ever closes her mouth adam is over hyped as an actor and looks gormless throughout and john lacks the charisma that he desperately tries to bring to the role this is so bad that my appreciation for the original content has even weakened no longer a fan and will give these a miss in the future
Jan 5 2020,positive,movie wasnt bad but it wasnt good either it has many plot holes and its so fast you dont have time to process what you see it has good visuals and music performance was good too some story arcs were wasted and the movie wastes so much time fixing the mistakes of tlj the fan servise was also too much and kinda turned me off while i enjoyed the fact that some of the plot was inspired by the dark empire trillogy
Jan 5 2020,negative,no plot mini quests a lot of lore is just trown away i did not enjoy the movie i wanted my money back it makes me sad star wars is dead it was close enough to got ending
Jan 5 2020,positive,i liked it my sister loved it she follows starwars closer than i and would robanly give it 5 stars if i saw all of them like she has i am sure i would be giving it 5 stars as well it was very good
Jan 5 2020,positive,fantastic   great action special effects and a ending that did not disappoint
Jan 5 2020,positive,great graphic new story myth just bad directed
Jan 5 2020,positive,jj abrams did a fantastic job salvaging the franchise for its final entry the story flowed well and although structurally very similar to the return of the jedi it has its own flavour
Jan 5 2020,positive,a trully star war story o could not loved it more it feels the same as old star wars
Jan 5 2020,neutral,it lacked excitement
Jan 5 2020,negative,movie fucking sucks dude
Jan 5 2020,positive,good could be better rylo ken
Jan 5 2020,positive,while it has many flaws and tries to be all movies at once it is a great damage control to the monstrosity and failure that tlj was and tries to undo many mistakes this movie steers the ship in the right direction but it doesnt save the trilogy mary sue is still invincible and the potential for some crazy plottwist turns to sand while playing it safe
Jan 5 2020,positive,its a good star wars movie tainted by the last jedi
Jan 5 2020,positive,it just feels like disney took a scrap book and shoved in anything for fan buzz poor george lucas he must be regretting the sell now
Jan 5 2020,positive,dont know what all the negativity toward the film is about it was pretty entertaining worth it just to see chewie get his medal empire was destroyed emporer palpatine diedagainall good
Jan 5 2020,positive,a solid end to amediocre trilogy
Jan 5 2020,positive,i was tired and didnt have my grandchildren to kick my light head in when i fell asleep but thats what i did for approximately 15 minutes mid point not a foggy what happened in that time   in my defence im 55 was an original sw kid lightsaber vader voice honed to perfection in gruelling school competitions hatinglustingwet dreaming over leia yes i was defo there yes this does past muster but nothing more
Jan 5 2020,positive,first let me say i love the originals i love the new fin rey po bb8 kylo but im sick of the the poor story writing and power inconsistency its just bad  writing and directing to have character who can fly and leap huge distances to then struggle to climb a tower face palm the movie is long places where it should short sappy about losing someone who we theoretically dont know is dead and why can some jedi be powerful ghosts while others just die but there are some true amazing visuals and cgi some gem one liners and a couple feels
Jan 5 2020,positive,pretty hardcore fan who hated tlj this movie clearly went out to right wrongs and tick boxes which it did i loved it i cried tears of joy way too much just makes the tlj pointless which is a good thing
Jan 5 2020,positive,im not the biggest fan of the sequels but i absolutely loved rise of skywalker i cant decide if i loved it more than revenge of the sith after a week of thinking fantastic movie
Jan 5 2020,negative,this movie is some how worse than the last  they spend so much time trying to correct the sins of the last movie that nothing actually takes place  to make matters worse its the same as the last  empire has guns we have only a few hours lets go to 5 generic planets fight sith looks like hero dies hero doesnt die good guy wins  terrible terrible terrible
Jan 5 2020,negative,for me a very bad film it feels like jja went through the craziest fan theories on reddit and put ist together to a story 1 star for the great actors of ren and ben
Jan 5 2020,positive,it was good movie made me remind 40 years ago the first movie of star wars
Jan 5 2020,negative,convoluted rushed poorly paced and stupid just awful
Jan 5 2020,positive,it was great a little of all the first ones
Jan 5 2020,positive,if you are a star wars fan you will not be disappointed very happy to have watched it
Jan 5 2020,positive,loved the ending to this amazing saga
Jan 5 2020,positive,absolutely loved this movie our grandkids 11 and 15 loved it and all the other star a wars movies also  a must see           i tell all  
Jan 5 2020,positive,amazing the whole thing
Jan 5 2020,positive,i thought that it ended the saga well  i loved the lore that it kept and parts of the story that it closed
Jan 5 2020,positive,did the absolute best they could with what the last jedi left them its a shame that they didnt plan a cohesive story from the beginning   i could forgive all the flaws in this trilogu if they hadnt of shown such disrespect to luke skywalker and mark hamill
Jan 5 2020,neutral,acting seemed forced came off like a made for tv movie special effects average very disappointed
Jan 5 2020,positive,they tried to fit a lot into one episode but still all in all a good ending to the series
Jan 5 2020,positive,i was excited but sad because this is the final chapter of the skywalker saga after 42 years  4 decades in the making by george lucas also the 3rd  final film in the sequel trilogy i was very concerned of the entire plot will turn out of each of the characters in the star wars universe glad mark hamill harrison ford billy dee williams came back for one final time including carrie fisher in spirit the original characters meet the new generation i saw it at the el capitan theatre on a late night show  i knew the staff gave us a photo opportunity with the stormtroopers before they displayed an amazing laser  show it was magnificent i want everyone to respect the film  the legacies of carrie fisher peter mayhew  kenny baker the film was amazing  emotional as well i felt a tiny bit of tears in my eyes when leia dies  now one with force with luke even surprised of kylo ren  ben solos redemption  sacrifice for his family  rey i thank george lucas  everyone who are part of the star wars franchise
Jan 5 2020,positive,enjoyable not a bad way to finish the saga if it is 
Jan 5 2020,positive,me and my entire family love the show
Jan 5 2020,positive,very excellent movie great closure to the star wars saga
Jan 5 2020,positive,it was total redemption from the first two the film filled in story plot holes catered to the fans and delivered a fantastic starwars movie as it should be
Jan 5 2020,negative,whiplash the movie
Jan 5 2020,negative,this movies tag line might as well have been we dont care who wins we just want tlj and rian johnson to lose
Jan 5 2020,positive,pretty good kinda disappointing
Jan 5 2020,negative,arguably the worst movie of all time and unanimously the worst star wars film ever created
Jan 5 2020,positive,its no secret that although being the longest running star wars film at over 2 and a half hours j j abrams had to make do with as much storytelling being crammed into one movie as possible although many fans of the new trilogy find the film to have lost its track of direction many fans of the original star wars have found as a standout favorite in the new trilogy this film manages to touch home for the true star wars fans at heart who yearned for nostalgia while not the best film it is definitely not the worst they ought to even it out with a 10 and then call it good why do we need a trilogy we can just end it all a positive note
Jan 5 2020,positive,the movie was overall pretty good i liked that they rent conned half of the bad stuff out of force awakens and last jedi it was a good attempt to wrap the star wars saga together nicely
Jan 5 2020,positive,great movie kept you on the edge of your seat in typical star wars fashion loved the character arcs still lots of questions left unanswered which is not a bad thing at all lets the audience decide for themselves what happens next for these beloved characters
Jan 5 2020,positive,really good idc what anyone else says about it
Jan 5 2020,positive,the special effects were very well done  i did enjoy the story line  it kept you in suspense and showed not all is as it seems which we all should do in real life  it also showed that you keep going no matter what happens which many peopleforget
Jan 5 2020,positive,wow just wow amazing movie
Jan 5 2020,negative,this movies sucked balls
Jan 5 2020,positive,little rushed probably would have been better as a twopart like infinity war i think jj did a great job and the cinematography was absolutely gorgeous
Jan 5 2020,positive,keep you interested
Jan 5 2020,positive,ok jj i respect that good movie felt like what the second should have been and the third it probably crammed all that info into one movie in all i left the theater feeling better than the second one
Jan 5 2020,negative,after sw8 it only gotten worse  badly tries to connect previous  story plots but lacks overal story line  tried to compensate by remaking all that gone before but this time bigger and worse where a death stat or large planet facility was needed to destroy a world before now they are going to destroy multiple worlds with only small space vessel mounted guns where space battles were fought by a handful of ships thousands and thousands are now needed to blacken the skies and create a laser show where you could attack a person with force lightning now palpatine can shoot thousands of ships selectively out of the sky with one forse lightning
Jan 5 2020,positive,story was a bit cliche and felt too familiar  nothing special in this one
Jan 5 2020,positive,this was the best of the latest saga it was heartwarming and funny and hit all the right notes i loved the hug at the end adam driver and daisy ridley were superb oscar isaac and john boyega were equal parts serious and funny i would watch it again
Jan 5 2020,negative,my wife is angry that we even watched this movie boring predictable so much loredestroying plot choices should have waited for it to be available on disney they tried to coursecorrect from tlj and they made it even worse this new trilogy ended up being just bad fanfic with an absurd budget
Jan 5 2020,positive,wrapped it up nicely
Jan 5 2020,positive,i loved seeing carrie fisher again sadly it was like losing her all over again i did wish a couple of sequences were a bit more fleshed out but overall it was tremendous it grabbed a lot more feeling of the original trilogy for me things came about full circle and wrapped up most of the loose ends i was pleased with the whole experience
Jan 5 2020,positive,totally better than i expected must see on the big screen
Jan 5 2020,positive,liked the progression of finally freeing the universe of the evil
Jan 5 2020,positive,nothing to dislike about this movie go see it you wont be disappointed
Jan 5 2020,positive,was excellent enjoyed it  very much
Jan 5 2020,positive,lots of people complaining about how this movie is tons of fan service and is just trying to undo what rian did so whats wrong with that i thought this was great i thought they wrapped it up nicely i felt like some things were predictable and others were a surprise definitely worth a watch
Jan 5 2020,negative,i dont know why i liked it the least of all the star wars  maybe because it was just nonstop war without a chance to catch your breath
Jan 5 2020,positive,everything i could have wanted from the last star wars very good tie ins and representation story line was good and representative of previous stories
Jan 5 2020,positive,best of the 3 out of the new trilogy incorporates parts from the prequels and the original trilogy and is definitely a step up from the last jedi  will satisfy any star wars fan thats for sure
Jan 5 2020,neutral,not happy with the movie at all it was well kindof predicted especially the ending couldnt they think of a more punchy unexpected ending sth such as ray and kylo join forces together indeed the very boring ending
Jan 5 2020,negative,i just didnt feel the force with this episode
Jan 5 2020,positive,fantastic the story the acting the picture 4dx was fun too
Jan 5 2020,positive,it was a great movie and i would recommend her to anybody over the age of 13 to watch
Jan 5 2020,negative,it closed the saga but it is as bad as the last episode of lost
Jan 5 2020,neutral,disney has ruined the entire series for me
Jan 5 2020,positive,ties in all of the newest trilogy
Jan 5 2020,positive,the ewoks enough said
Jan 5 2020,positive,not great but not terrible neither there were plot holes that you can drive an articulated truck into but all in all if you just switch off your brain youll find that it ties up some loose ends rather nicely  oh i know ill probably get lynched for this but i for one am so glad there was less rose tico definitely a more satisfying movie than last jedi
Jan 5 2020,positive,i saw the 715pm the movie was so good my fiancé and i immediately bought tickets to the 1030pm and saw it again
Jan 5 2020,positive,many scenes felt rushed didnt like how leia felt unnatural in the way she spoke
Jan 5 2020,positive,fun plot happy ending   too much preoccupation with political correctness
Jan 5 2020,positive,loved all the twists and just enjoyed it
Jan 5 2020,positive,the movie fixed many of the issues with episode 8 but at the same time makes me sad that even with the long play time so much of the story had to be rushed to fix problems caused by the previous film
Jan 5 2020,positive,it was a good movie just not sure if it was good enough to be the last one
Jan 5 2020,positive,amazing movie my entire family loved it the best new star wars ever made notice i said new because nothing beats the original three star wars movies i highly recommend seeing this in the theater for the special effects
Jan 5 2020,positive,i loved that it was so like mind blowing  i was bamboozled the whole time like dammmmmmmnnnnn so good i just didnt like that you know who died because i wouldve loved to see a happy ending with him and rey
Jan 5 2020,neutral,too many plot holes for a single movie
Jan 5 2020,negative,i wanted kylo ren to be the sky walker not rey the story doesnt even make any sense
Jan 5 2020,positive,we were definitely surprised by the ending it was a great ending to the star wars legacy
Jan 5 2020,positive,i loved it  fast paced and what you want to see in the name skywalker
Jan 5 2020,positive,awesome action and great to see all the old gang back
Jan 5 2020,positive,the best star wars movie evernuff said
Jan 5 2020,positive,probably should have been two movies  an exceptional ending
Jan 5 2020,positive,sound  seats could be better
Jan 5 2020,positive,the rise of skywalker is a solid star wars movie with plenty of action great character moments and some truly great moments for the franchise  while this film was probably my least favorite of the three sequel films it is still extremely solid in my opinion  that being said it has some major flaws  i think not releasing the 3 hour version to the public meant that a lot of important details were lost and thus made for some extremely confusing points during the film which basically means the viewer is unexpectedly dragged along for the ride instead of knowing exactly whats going on  id consider myself a star wars fanatic and even after watching it and reading dozens of articlesim still confused about everything that happened  i also think the ending is a bit overdone  we could have had said epic battle at the end the same way with fewer ships  id highly recommend watching this film and even recommend watching it twice
Jan 5 2020,positive,great special effects and some surprises i gave 4 stars only because the ending satisfies but not much more
Jan 5 2020,positive,absolutely amazing great plot great acting and great storyline the first really good star wars in decades some twists and turns but worth every minute loved it
Jan 5 2020,positive,from start to finish it was great
Jan 5 2020,positive,a great end and new beginning
Jan 5 2020,negative,thank god theyre trilogy is over finally
Jan 5 2020,positive,finn never got to tell rey he loved her
Jan 5 2020,positive,movie was outstanding ive never been a star wars fan it was emotional and exciting and left me feeling like somehow the world outside the theater should have been changed when i left
Jan 5 2020,positive,maybe the best one yet
Jan 5 2020,positive,ends the skywalker saga in a nice way
Jan 5 2020,positive,visually stunning full credit due for the editing and cinematography lots of fan pleasing in the movie which at times  was complete overkill but i guess thats completely expected when youre watching the finale of a movie that has entertained for generations cant help but point out the holes and questions it leaves in the the aftermath  thats a big concern for me i feel like ive been to an expensive restaurant for a dinner date the food was great and im content but just expected something with a more powerful kick but im content
Jan 5 2020,positive,good production quality a bit over edited loose script  great actors
Jan 5 2020,positive,the movie is quite kinematic and its plot wraps up the whole saga splendidly
Jan 5 2020,positive,i liked it  im sure there are flaws but the movie had the closest star wars magic to what i remember as a child
Jan 5 2020,negative,40 years of fandom ends with a whimper  the final installment made so little sense had so many useless twists and side quests that it honestly made me sad  i remember going to the drive in as a child to see start wars i remember being captivated by the story the characters and the wonderment it created   this last installment had none of that
Jan 5 2020,positive,answered a lot of questions
Jan 5 2020,negative,no interest in watching  lucas disney and star wars can bugger off  i loved new hope empire and return of the jedi   i shall enjoy those over the years and even watch rogue for fun as a good lead in to new hope    seriously how can you mess up a story this badly
Jan 5 2020,positive,without spoilers overall i really enjoyed all of it there is only 2 things i thought shouldve been different however still amazing
Jan 5 2020,negative,the plot was scattered and it seemed like they tried to fit in a bunch of disconnected themes  honestly it made no sense and i would recommend you not waste your money  instead wait for it to show up on tv  believe me you wont have missed a thing waiting and will feel loads better that you didnt waist your money in the theater
Jan 5 2020,positive,plot holes but still good
Jan 5 2020,positive,one of the best movies i have ever watched i thought it tied up the series really well
Jan 5 2020,negative,the writers ran out of new material there were no memorable moments like in previous episodes
Jan 5 2020,positive,amazing jj came through and saved it
Jan 5 2020,negative,very confusing story also just threw everything fans would remember from the old movies just to try to play off the nostalgia
Jan 5 2020,positive,a good movie but made me dislike the the last one even more i feel as if the past one could have been skipped there was little to no setup from the previous one also why was palpatine alive no story on that either not bad but not great
Jan 5 2020,positive,i loved it beginning to end
Jan 5 2020,positive,its a fun movie that fixes all the mistakes of the last jedi
Jan 5 2020,positive,good end to a long saga
Jan 5 2020,positive,battles were way too long  rosefinn relationship was completely sidelined there seemed no real reason why ben made the sacrifice he did basically the script needed a doctor
Jan 5 2020,positive,i liked it but i was expecting more palpatine was great though he made the movie for me
Jan 5 2020,positive,a very random movie didnt like the spontaneous adding of non important characters great cinematic moments tho loved lando
Jan 5 2020,positive,a good use of the money the ticket cost butmuch like the other films in the third trilogyit lacks the intangibles to contend with the other two in terms of engagement and storytelling  kylo ren still never receives proper villain treatment and rey is once again a foolproof hero consisting of one infallible dimension the story is missing convincing explanations of key plot elements and is haughty in its expectation of the audience to let so much of it slide   despite this its still a very watchable film on a visual level with amazing special effects and battle sequences the story is very straightforward and easy to follow with good dialogue and wonderful performances from the cast it would be the best picture of the final trilogy if it werent plagued by the same issues of hero worship that ruined force awakens and last  jedi   the main problem of these movies revolves around reys absolute godlike levels of perfection and the films refusal to give any power or depth to its villains making all three a total study in eyerolling predictability that rise of skywalker caps off in all too similar fashion
Jan 5 2020,positive,there has to a rey skywalker story
Jan 5 2020,negative,i would have preferred something with more developed dialog less plot threads tighter character focus and less pandering this is a fine film for the kiddos though
Jan 5 2020,positive,super fast and really confusing
Jan 5 2020,neutral,trying too hard but would recommend it for the special fx
Jan 5 2020,negative,the movie was great but an audience member kept flashing lights during important parts of the movie and all but ruined the moment at least 7 times
Jan 5 2020,positive,had all the fire power and emotion the final story of the skywalker  clan should have including the proper respect a princess deserves
Jan 5 2020,positive,not a good story line of finishing the decades of saga felt like hurry up and close it by a christmas opening
Jan 5 2020,positive,i loved the movie and the dbox seats were both worth the money spent
Jan 5 2020,positive,pure fun my mom says that her and i stood in line for two hours in the summer of 77 to see star wars when i was 9  ive been with this series for 42 years and the finale gave me everything i wanted or at least needed  if youre a fan you will enjoy it
Jan 5 2020,positive,liked it up until the end when all the story lines were tied up a little too neatly good action enjoyed seeing familiar creatures from previous movies
Jan 5 2020,positive,i enjoyed it much more than i thought it was a good movie enjoyable but had its fair share of flaws the villain wasnt a particularly interesting character the only characters who get any relevant screen time are rey and kylo who get a great amount of character development and complete their character arcs the third act wasnt especially strong and its altogether a very forgettable movie the world building it had was interesting but it was too focused on the plot to get very far with that the pacing was fairly slow and unproductive although the screen time still serves some purpose its altogether a pretty big mess although it can still be enjoyed 610 seems accurate not worth watching if you arent attached to star wars in any way
Jan 5 2020,positive,although theres an incredible lack of explanations this final chapter is full of cameos and lots of action that any fan should enjoy could have been two movies to really clarify the story  but well have to do with this one
Jan 5 2020,positive,fun movie there are some plot holes but all together its a good fun blockbuster
Jan 5 2020,positive,i saw star wars the rise of skywalker twice in 2d before seeing it in 3d and i think it was much better in 3d  i thought many of the scenes looked amazing in 3d and was very pleasantly surprised at how good it was in 3d  i highly recommend if you like star wars to go back and see it in 3d while you still can
Jan 5 2020,neutral,satisfying enough story ending too many little cliffhangers that were obviosuly left in case the story continues on but it felt forced  generally it didnt reach any emotional hieights good story but mediocre storytelling
Jan 5 2020,positive,the movie started out with a measured pace that felt in step with the early star wars movies which was great however most of the movie felt like they tried to cram as much fan service into the film as they possibly could by the end the movie had so many cloying or melodramatic plot turns and overblown effects scenes that it felt more like a michael bay transformers film than star wars however after a few hours i was left with the memories of the interactions between kylo and rey which were by far the best parts of the film they almost make up for the rest of the two hours of being forcefed star warsflavored cotton candy almost
Jan 5 2020,positive,fantastic movie lots of action a blast to watch
Jan 5 2020,positive,i saw with low spectations as view from internet but i was surprised to find that i really enjoy watching it
Jan 5 2020,positive,obvious  ending but still a good movie
Jan 5 2020,positive,easy story line to follow  for once
Jan 5 2020,positive,it was fun and entertaining regardless if you wanted to see certain outcomes and didnt get them or maybe this movie wrapped up the franchise nicely  it was a fun ride and enjoyed it sad to see the saga end
Jan 5 2020,positive,the best of the rest in the last few years looking for more please
Jan 5 2020,positive,hokum but better than the previous installment and solo

Jan 5 2020,positive,i marathoned the saga to make sure i was going into this movie with clear eyes after hearing so many bad reviews regarding this sequel trilogy i was bummed to say the least and waited to watch it it was awesome like i cant say anything bad about it they tied a lot of loose ends and left some open ended questions spoiler alert its not supposed to stop here im happy with the resolution do i still have a lot of questions yeah but thats because i obsess over these things go watch this movie as just that a movie goer def recommend
Jan 5 2020,positive,interesting plot twists but editting was jumpy poor character development detracted from storyline
Jan 5 2020,positive,way better than the garbage last movie
Jan 5 2020,positive,action thru the whole moviea great movie
Jan 5 2020,positive,not as powerful of a final chapter as anticipated lots of stunning visuals a few solid plot points
Jan 5 2020,positive,it was just plain fun ive enjoyed star wars since i was in college in the 1970s pay no attention to the so called critics and geeks just let yourself enjoy the magic
Jan 5 2020,negative,better than ep 8 but still horrible
Jan 5 2020,positive,great ending to the saga  exciting along the way 
Jan 5 2020,positive,as always it hits the top due to cgi and amazing affects
Jan 5 2020,positive,just great all in all great story visual effects and wrap up to a nine story run

Jan 5 2020,positive,loved that it covered everything good movie will see it again
Jan 5 2020,positive,not much conversation or interaction amoung the characters hard to remember why they are suppose to be good friends rey spends much of the movie looking angst and telling people to leave her alone good action sequences though
Jan 5 2020,positive,i loved the action imagination and plot twist star wars never disappoints
Jan 5 2020,positive,this would be like my very first episode
Jan 5 2020,positive,best one of the sequels

Jan 5 2020,positive,this movie was amazing i felt like i was in a different world watching
Jan 5 2020,positive,connects the old and new movies together if you are a die hard star wars fan its a must see movie
Jan 5 2020,positive,a fitting end to the saga whether youre a newcomer or a longtime fan youll find something here characters special effects moral choices family drama the eternal struggle between the light and the dark its all here abrams  co had an impossible taskthey succeeded beyond expectations
Jan 5 2020,positive,great movie and awesome plot
Jan 5 2020,positive,great movie but could have been a little bit better
Jan 5 2020,positive,predictable and cliche
Jan 5 2020,positive,fantastic great conclusion to the skywalker saga
Jan 5 2020,negative,horrible movie i am so upset at what disney did to star wars this movies does not deserve the title rise of skywalker what a joke
Jan 5 2020,neutral,predictable unoriginal story line but cinematography was exceptional
Jan 5 2020,positive,i thought that what jj did with the scrap heap that rian left him was pretty remarkable started a little shaky but once the viewer gets their bearings they are able to buy into the narrative rather quickly great film and great way to not only cap the trilogy but the entire skywalker saga
Jan 5 2020,positive,movie was great film quality was the worst ever do not see the 3d version version was so blurry with or without glasses luckily the film itself was great fun
Jan 5 2020,positive,special effects  storyline

Jan 5 2020,positive,i thought it was good
Jan 5 2020,positive,a fitting close to the sequel trilogy  go see it
Jan 5 2020,negative,really disappointing i know they are not the best but this was lazy felt like i had seen it over and over again i liked the previous ones but this one was uninspired and tired

Jan 5 2020,positive,thank you jj for not ruining the finale  loved it  rian johnson made a mess of what what could have be great final trilogy  two out of three aint bad thanks to jj now lets see how disney goes about making some good backstory films about obiwan rey chewbacca lando etc  rogue one and the mandalorian are excellent  solo should have been great but fell short  heres to hoping we get more great films that connect back to the original star wars
Jan 5 2020,positive,amazing movie answered several questions
Jan 5 2020,positive,i really enjoyed the film though there was so much packed into it it could have been longer glad i saw it in theaters
Jan 5 2020,negative,barf i was expecting more from jj considering this was the last chance at saving this sequel trilogy
Jan 5 2020,positive,equal to the original trilogy spectacular story full of mythology for our time  where the light wins and the dark is dispersed yes when we come together we can overcome all
Jan 5 2020,positive,im not an avid star wars fan but went with someone that is i thought the movie was decent a little long and drug outbut overall not bad
Jan 5 2020,positive,soooo good  dont listen to anyone  just go never stops moving 
Jan 5 2020,negative,this is what happens when a movie is made by a committee
Jan 5 2020,positive,amazing an amazing ending to one of the most incredible story ever told and such a journey for every generation
Jan 5 2020,neutral,this feels like a kids movie no drama ive been spoiled with game of thrones
Jan 5 2020,positive,watched all the movies in preparation to watch this one and all i can say is that it ties up everything nicely great movie and the special effects were fantastic
Jan 5 2020,positive,a fitting finale to an epic trilogy  intense at times may be too much for little jedi
Jan 5 2020,positive,i read some bad reviews but had to see it myself it was great im not sure why it got such bad reviews maybe theyre all star wars purists
Jan 5 2020,positive,loved the wrap up of the star wars 40 year saga  i think the movie is really geared toward true fans and those who are fans will be happy with the character development and how the story plays out

Jan 5 2020,positive,perfect ending to a phenomenal saga
Jan 5 2020,positive,i thought it was great escapism and very entertaining  people should not take it so serious its not  real  and you know  the kind of people  im  talking about jj abrams and crew did a great job 
Jan 5 2020,positive,watch it if you want to feel the story completed
Jan 5 2020,positive,same old thing  also they die but keep coming back wth
Jan 5 2020,positive,excellent movie with amazing special effects i highly recommend it
Jan 5 2020,positive,absolutely entertaining it is a must watch for star wars fans too difficult to experience if you have not seen all the movies of course this epic story will carry unreasonable expectations for the finally there are some many opinions about how it should end i liked the film thoroughly and believe it is a solid 85 out of 10 yes there are a few aspects that do not live up to the originals or rogue one but this moving is anything but boring great character arcs classic blend of comedy spirituality hope and suffering incredible end yo a beautiful creation that explains life in a futuristicaltered galaxy thank you lucas jj and all those that contributed  appreciated your work
Jan 5 2020,positive,sooooooooo good  i loved how they tied up a lot of loose ends from the original 3 star wars movies
Jan 5 2020,positive,great movie only disappointed abought not much 3d action
Jan 5 2020,positive,man great story and ending wow
Jan 5 2020,positive,this movie had lots of great plottwists in it and lots of sad moments in it at the end of the movie it recapped the first episode of star wars
Jan 5 2020,positive,great movie an awesome ending to the saga
Jan 5 2020,positive,the movie was good but it just seemed as if everything was squeezed together and the scenes went by at a rapid pace almost as if they tried to put a 4hour movie in the 2 and 22 mins the bad parts were bad such as the horse that didnt really need to be thereand well the good parts were good i liked the movie but it seemed rush ill give it 4 stars because it was awesome and food satisfy my fandom for star wars next time dont fudge up the previous movie so jj can work his magic
Jan 5 2020,positive,it was a good movie however for a star wars fan since the beginning of the saga it was a missed opportunity
Jan 5 2020,positive,enjoyed it very much
Jan 5 2020,positive,incredible recovery from the last jedi which was awful and really made no sense i mean did the director of last jedi even watch the other star wars episodes also does he really not even know about zero gravity in the vacuum of space since you can really drop bombs in space the 9th episode bitch slapped the 8th episode
Jan 5 2020,positive,good movie not great but still enjoyable the last jedi suck so this was a major improvement
Jan 5 2020,positive,solid end to the saga its impossible to give everyone everything they want but its a good effort at wrapping up the story
Jan 5 2020,positive,it was going so well for about half the film and then fell off the path however i did still enjoy the film best of the new movies
Jan 5 2020,positive,even better the second time
Jan 5 2020,negative,i watched it opening day and i have already forgotten everything about it
Jan 5 2020,positive,fitting end to the saga
Jan 5 2020,positive,awesome family movie
Jan 5 2020,positive,a fitting end to the trilogy never surprised or overly amazed but consistently entertained and invested sufficiently in the characters
Jan 5 2020,positive,if failed the wow test
Jan 5 2020,positive,great overall fight scenes and the story wrap up was good
Jan 5 2020,positive,mostly good but i feel they devoted too much of the movie to undoing some of the things the previous film established they did their job with the film but it could have been more
Jan 5 2020,positive,its a lot better than the last jedi however thats not saying muchso much of this movie trilogy has broken previous canon the force powers are too insaneconvenient to the point the protagonist never really has any challenge to overcome kylo ren is the only real character that has any development
Jan 5 2020,negative,a corny campy disappointment only value this movie holds is as a parody to a beloved franchise
Jan 5 2020,positive,they did a great job good finale
Jan 5 2020,positive,this was a great ending to a very long series i loved seeing all the original characters it was jam packed and kept us glued to the screen
Jan 5 2020,positive,very fun and enjoyable movie the second act feels a little unneeded but the epic 3rd act makes up for it and it is everything i could hope for
Jan 5 2020,positive,great story great ending
Jan 5 2020,negative,do i even need to say it
Jan 5 2020,positive,you will not regret going to watch this i absolutely loved this movie
Jan 5 2020,positive,lots of action wraps up a lot of loose ends
Jan 5 2020,positive,the movie is great it is a modern star wars movie at its finest while there are come moments that could have been changed to have a more meaningful or impactful plot the movie does well to tell an end to the franchise and the new trilogy jj did a decent job fusing elements of what makes a star wars movie and merge with elements of the expanded universe prominently dark empire
Jan 5 2020,positive,excellent enjoyed every second of the movie
Jan 5 2020,positive,lasers spaceships distant galaxies the force redemption closure whats not to like
Jan 5 2020,positive,good movie and good atmosphere
Jan 5 2020,positive,it was a fair ending with lots of fan service good guys won bad guys are no more and everyone goes home ha content
Jan 5 2020,positive,loved so much of it being a huge star wars fan definitely not empire strikes back but still a good ending to the best saga ever
Jan 5 2020,positive,definite will be watching again
Jan 5 2020,positive,i really liked it
Jan 5 2020,positive,awesome end to the series
Jan 5 2020,positive,its a satisfying end to the new trilogy not a perfect movie but an enjoyable one that id definitely recommend
Jan 5 2020,negative,with rise of skywalker theres no need to watch any of the previous star wars because none of it matters all previous plots from the previous movies are meaninglessall of itmeaninglessanakin darth vader luke the prophecy  all of the original ideas plot and story  gone when i say gonei mean none of what we have watched for 6 movies means anything for this movie or the other two of the trilogy disney and jj decided to make three stand a lone movies that rewrites all of the star wars series and canon one more thing  if i told you disney would created 3 more star wars moviesto continue the story of the previous cast and none of the major characters would share any screen time together throughout the three movies and all what we learned from the first six movies meant nothing  you would of said i must be jokingwell thats what we got this and the two before this  nothing but a big joke of a trilogy that destroyed 40 years of previous work
Jan 5 2020,negative,the movies plot had more holes than a warehouse of swiss cheese  how did palpatine survive getting tossed by vader or the destruction of the death star in rotj  how did ben speak to is father if han wasnt a jedi what did finn have to tell ray they never got back to it  why have we never heard of palpatine having a son till now  sounds like someone ran out of ideas and said to hell with it lets go with that there are a bunch more but it isnt worth the time  save your money and wait for it on disney 
Jan 5 2020,positive,bitter sweet good story good finish but there were several things i wouldve liked to see amazed to see keri fisher in so much knowing she died a lot i could say but i dont want to spoil it for anyone who hasnt seen it yet
Jan 5 2020,positive,an okay finish it was a finish but nothing groundbreaking
Jan 5 2020,positive,it was so awesome and love it
Jan 5 2020,positive,jj abrahams did a nice job closing some of the story lines it was entertaining and kept true to the characters we have grown to love or hate
Jan 5 2020,positive,follows the star wars tradition   great movie
Jan 5 2020,negative,terrible movie bad acting bad plot for me  harrison ford did great and looked great
Jan 5 2020,negative,plot was a mess how many recycled plot devices does one movie neeed
Jan 5 2020,negative,the movie was a mess it was pieces together like a plot was an after thought it crapped all over the original trilogy and prequels disney should have never made the last three movies and this one process it
Jan 5 2020,positive,loved it  everything i wanted to see from the end of the saga  would go see it again
Jan 5 2020,positive,dont understand why its been getting negative representation its better than all the new sequels and prequels not better than the ogs
Jan 5 2020,positive,despite the mixed reviews i loved it
Jan 5 2020,positive,really damn good fuck the haters
Jan 5 2020,positive,absolutely awesome end to an era of an iconic franchise

Jan 5 2020,positive,my girlfriend rey did amazing
Jan 5 2020,positive,if you are a star wars fan you will enjoy it i watched it in 3d excellent
Jan 5 2020,positive,great way to end the saga of the skywalkers  i wish it wasnt so hurried and had better spacing i could wish that we could had 30 more minutes added to the movie to aid better flow and time to enjoy the transitions however rise of skywalker really tied episode 1 through 8 together very well  thank you
Jan 5 2020,positive,loved the reylo kiss hated that they robbed us of a true happy ending to star wars should have been a third movie with a part one and a part two instead
Jan 5 2020,positive,if there is a complaint it is that the move crams so much in it should have been longer but it was great and the decisions made it in are exactly how star wars is supposed to go the critics of this film follow a check list style grading scheme that no film in an established series should need to appease   if you are someone who watch films especially star wars with the intent on being entertained and not on grading it then you will have a good time   even if your grading it you will likely have a good time as long as the grading is based on star wars and not film school
Jan 5 2020,positive,great mix of all the movies flowed well very enjoyable  a must see for star wars fans
Jan 5 2020,positive,ive seen this movie 4 times now and it just gets better and better absolutely perfect in every way
Jan 5 2020,positive,enjoyed the movie very much
Jan 5 2020,positive,thought it was great satisfying i wouldve liked to see where leias character wouldve gone had she lived 
Jan 5 2020,positive,much better than last jedi i thought it ended the saga pretty well looking forward to watching it on my couch
Jan 5 2020,positive,love the story and the beautiful values it portraits
Jan 5 2020,positive,great end to the saga i dont think the fan service was as bad as what critics made it out to be i went and saw it twice
Jan 5 2020,positive,great story forever star wars
Jan 5 2020,positive,linked both the old and new star wars films in an action packed and delightful way the title led me to believe something totally different which led to a pleasant surprise
Jan 5 2020,positive,it was better the last jedi its was a good film it felt like star wars movie
Jan 5 2020,negative,predictable political and outright ridiculous
Jan 5 2020,negative,why does rotten tomatoes give an almost perfect score 91to last jedi and give this one 50 when this movie was clearly better
Jan 5 2020,positive,it was a good movie  surprised by the ending
Jan 5 2020,positive,i liked everything about it i hope that more movies are still to come in the future
Jan 5 2020,positive,good ending to the series not great glad its over
Jan 5 2020,positive,lots of action and never dull but it felt like 2 movies in 1
Jan 5 2020,positive,awesome movie probably best of the year despite what critics said the critics dont know what a good movie is
Jan 5 2020,positive,i liked the action but i disliked the massive amount of plot holes and the ending
Jan 5 2020,positive,awesome movie for all the haters who mislead peoplethe movie rocked the story was engaging my 6 year old watched the entire movie practically without blinking for all families  go and enjoy this movie
Jan 5 2020,positive,i loved the drama and heart wrench although the ending wasnt what i expected it was still nice
Jan 5 2020,positive,so much better than the last two i enjoyed it
Jan 5 2020,positive,all of it will deff go see again
Jan 5 2020,positive,i can see why fans are so divided on this movie however i  learned after tfa to suspend my expectations and desires for the storyline doing this i have throughly enjoyed jjs attempt to wrap up the skywalker saga i  have already seen it twice and will be seeing it at least one more time with my wife who has not been able to see it yet my only major gripe is the lack of relationship development that was for me the hallmark of star wars i can live with most of the other shortcomings
Jan 5 2020,positive,this movie was incredible i hated the last jedi and had mixed feelings about the force awakens but the rise of skywalker redeems the final trilogy harkening back to the roots of the original trilogy which episodes 7 and 8 sadly forgot the use of the canon lorebased material the struggle focusing on light versus dark the return to the true essences of historic characters and the intricacy of the story all serve to make this a movie worthy of the star wars legacy a strong 5 out of 5 and a mustsee
Jan 5 2020,positive,it was good it felt like a good homage to leia and i was happy with it   people gotta stop setting themselves up to be disappointed let go of your expectations and just enjoy the story
Jan 5 2020,negative,boring weak story that made no sense as bad as the last jedi
