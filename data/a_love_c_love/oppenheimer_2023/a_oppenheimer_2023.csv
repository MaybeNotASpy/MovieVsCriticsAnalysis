Apr 13 2024,positive,maybe nolans best cillian murphy worthy of his oscar as was robert downey jr who reminded us he wasted too many years in the marvel universe
Apr 13 2024,positive,effective enough as it is oppenheimer is serviceable but didnt really deserve the academy award for best picture above more creative and personal projects christopher nolan does bring life to this story but its overreliance on romanticisation and expositiondumping every minute can feel exhaustive at times the lack of visually communicative storytelling is only really uplifted by its complex and controversial subject matter
Apr 12 2024,positive,quite absorbing  brilliant acting kept your interest throughout cillian murphy gave great leading role of a man whos mind seemed elsewhere much of the time
Apr 11 2024,positive,a genius biopic with stunning visuals excellent camerawork and great acting foremost cillian murphy and robert downey jr
Apr 11 2024,negative,terrible film  a film about the most important weapon created in mankinds history  zero scenes of what it actually did to the part of the world and the people it was used on  instead we get three long drawn out hours focused on trying to convince us to sympathise with the sociopathic arrogant twit responsible
Apr 11 2024,positive,its impactful engaging and captivating yes its long but its three hours of entertainment the highlight for me besides the breathtaking cinematography and insane visual effects is the soundtrack christopher nolan always delivers a great soundtrack in his films and this one is no different one of the best movies ive ever seen
Apr 10 2024,neutral,this movie did not play out with a christopher nolan theme it played out as something between a badly edited ken burns documentary and a soap opera would not recommend
Apr 10 2024,positive,a good movie but this was hyped up alot the movie jumped around in different spaces of time far more than necessary to the point where it distracts you from the story this could have probably also shaved off some of the run time aswell     acting had some really good performances especially from murphy and damon whilst other supporting characters seemed bland and not fleshed out enough to leave a lasting impression when they pop up later in the movie     surprisingly i found the fx extremely hit and miss but i also think this came down to how hyped to movie was and the actual content matter so i raised the bar higher than it should have been for myself
Apr 10 2024,negative,just like the bomb it sucked and blew big time all the needless bouncing around and yakking and then when you think its going to settle into the story theres even more bouncing and yakking
Apr 10 2024,positive, 7810      love that rodrick heffley cameo i cheered this is the most ive actually paid attention to a film in a while i did it yay  this film is pretty great it is a little hard to follow but im also not science smart so  yeah that explosion scene  great also my head cannon is this is the prequel to godzilla minus one grade b
Apr 9 2024,positive,watched it with a friend and we didnt even noticed that 3h past id recommand this to everyone
Apr 9 2024,negative,how they managed to make an interesting topic dull i will never know
Apr 9 2024,negative,what a waste of time on what couldshould have been a great story  the writers decided to focus on the most boring aspects of his life with very little time spent on the actual development of his story  coupled with disjointed performances from otherwise fine actors this was a complete disappointment to me
Apr 9 2024,positive,a lot of nonsense sex scenes thats really doesnt help on anything to the movie
Apr 8 2024,positive,christopher nolan regresa a su filmograf√≠a de autor como memento y following
Apr 7 2024,positive,96  a muchdeserved best picture award went to this film so i decided to sit through all three hours of it its safe to say that i would do so again oppenheimer is leagues better than its counterpart barbie given its epic scale and an allstar ensemble that robert altman would be proud of  despite a mammoth runtime this film never becomes boring christopher nolan takes a similar approach to david fincher when making this biopic dramatizing it until it plays out like a fastpaced thriller it was interesting to learn of the historical events that may lead to humanitys destruction a theme that lingers like a dark cloud over the film and makes you think not something i can often say about a film in a shallow modern industry  another point seeing every other famous actor on the planet get a chance to shine in this film was half the fun its always a joy to see jason clarke bully cillian murphy one second then see robert downey jr have a breakdown while alden ehrenreich taunts him the next i could watch the last 3060 minutes of oppenheimer endlessly  two negative comments about the film firstly florence pugh is overly sexualized shes naked for an uncomfortably large amount of her screentime for reasons that i personally cannot grasp secondly and this is only minor i find it triggering that ehrenreichs character doesnt have a name it humours me that an only moderately known actors unnamed and undeveloped character has more lines and screentime than the one and only casey afflecks character this is only me nitpicking an otherwise flawless movie like oliver stones jfk its a three hour masterpiece where the entire cast is a recognizable name or face  this is an oasis in a desert of 2020s trash
Apr 7 2024,positive,masterful storytelling from every single facet of filmmaking an important story as the book of the prophets like isaiah or the odyssey   im looking forward to my next viewing 
Apr 6 2024,negative,incredibly boring and gray i dont get the appeal and the awards i understand the historical and humanity importance emily blunt and matt damon and are two of my favorite actors i couldnt watch past 40 minutes too long slow and gloomy for my taste
Apr 5 2024,positive,masterpiece    its true
Apr 5 2024,positive,cillian was brilliant as usual the cast was excellent blunt downey damon the premise is certainly interesting up to the point of the start of the investigation and mock trials thats where it started to get boring and i stopped watching but the reviews are good so maybe just my weird taste
Apr 5 2024,positive,thought it was a little overrated interesting but veered into sleep inducing boringness with all the committeesenate hearings
Apr 4 2024,negative,what is this god awful practise directors have come up with to tell a story completely out of order jumping from the middle to the end to the start and all over the place mix that in with continuous trippy screens of particles flying about and you have something uncomprehendable 15 minutes in and i turned it off how this won an award is beyond me
Apr 3 2024,positive,good movie seems like they took famous lines spoken and just added them in conveniently cinematography was ok scene switching could be a bit jarring at times pacing was weird sound was amateur couldnt hear the dialogue over poorly constructed background music i wasnt there so i dont know how the man was but it seemed a bit dramatized in the manner they spoke despite it obviously being a true story and insane situation great acting though it was a highly overrated movie but definitely decent a bit too long as a scientist i enjoyed some of the insights into how the bomb was developed though i knew much of the history i learned a bit there too
Apr 3 2024,positive,great film long but kept entertained the whole way
Apr 3 2024,positive,certainly a great film but does have the typical nolan issues of occasional inaudible dialogue and nonlinear story telling that doesnt make it clear what order everything is happening in
Apr 2 2024,positive,really enjoyed this oppenheimer was so interesting great acting great cinematography great script and a fair evenhanded take on the whole nuclear crisis
Apr 2 2024,positive,was a nice movie  good pace  great characters
Apr 2 2024,positive,oppenheimer is on of the best movieswhich ive ever seen i watched this movie with my mouth open i was overwhelmed with emotionseverything is flawless in this filmactorsspecial effects and for my opinionthe best thing about this movie is soundtracksand also why i like this movie is because it was filmed by my favourite directorchristopher nolan
Apr 2 2024,positive,excellent movie its a rollercoaster of emotions from beginning to end the only parts that may be bad for some people is the rhythm of some of the scenes and the duration of the film but i really think it was the best way to tell this story and fit almost every important and incredible moment of it in those three hours of art
Apr 2 2024,positive,christopher nolan is an amazing director and this movie is an example of his excellent work
Apr 2 2024,positive,definitelly an oscar winning movie great acting and immersive plot the events happen very fast and can be a bit overwhelming with the various timelines and 3 hours is just too long still great plot and all comes together in the end
Apr 1 2024,positive,oppenheimer is a mindbending flick thatll make you question everything especially if youre part of the uks average intelligence club this film is like a rubiks cube dipped in quantum physics and sprinkled with existential dread  not your typical saturday night romcom thats for sure if youre the type who still thinks 22 equals fish and that the earth is flat because youve never left your hometown this movie might be a bit of a brain workout but hey who needs to understand nuclear physics when youve got a solid grip on the remote control right
Apr 1 2024,negative,i dont get why this is popular other than the lead actor the story was rushed not told well and it passed over the horrible destructiveness of nuclear war ho hum movie go boom
Apr 1 2024,neutral,powerful individual performances cant make up for an otherwise boring movie with a stuffy script the quantumness gives way to bureaucracy why they chose to focus less on atomic weapons and more on paper pushing i dont understand
Apr 1 2024,positive,great acting from a first rate cast but ive got to say  i did not love it  the film is long a bit confusing and somewhat depressing  for all its accolades and obvious big budget its definitely worth a watch  but i much preferred fat man and little boy circa 1989 starring paul newman
Apr 1 2024,negative,i dont know how it won any awards it was boring and hard to follow
Apr 1 2024,negative,i stopped watching this movie after an hour and change because it seemed to have made its point that historical context and moral relativism exist and so we dont need to bother with story
Mar 31 2024,positive,last hour dragged an older married couple next to me both fell asleep at different points in the film but overall a very fine tuned and crafted production and pleased many movie goers
Mar 31 2024,positive,one of christopher nolans best films
Mar 31 2024,negative,the scientific bitsfor those of us who know some scienceare silly and out of place einsteins quote god does not play dice people who know science know the quoteand people who dont just wont understand it then there are silly romantic scenes hastily done some with unwholesome attempts at artistic character depictions there are way too many characters on the whole and way too many elements add to that the constant change of scenes pastpresent and the movie becomes really difficult to follow even worse the main guy just hangs around not saying muchexcept in the flashbacks and what about people who dont know who hahn heisenberg etc are those mentions are probably just to make the movie sound like it deals with science the movie is a messa hotchpotch of personality portraits politics law science history and at least five more things i could list weave in random bits about communism vs the establishment germans vs americans jews vs nonjews and so forth and so on at one point a woman asks oppenheimer in a romantic way can you explain quantum mechanics to me dr o actually responds by telling her something factual but really ordinary to someone who knows any physics oof that was rotten
Mar 31 2024,negative,its a case of the emperors new clothes so many people seemed to have made up their minds about this films greatness before watching it there is so much unnecessary dialogue that does nothing to propel the narrative accompanied by an effort to make every scene overly dramatic thus reducing the effect of genuinely important ones the film lacks cohesion and needed to be trimmed by at least an hour i recommend lots of strong coffee to finish the three hours without nodding off
Mar 31 2024,neutral,the last third of the movie is boring couldnt wait for it to finish
Mar 30 2024,positive,this was a great movie i almost did not watch it due to the mixed reviews on rt some had trouble following the plot however after watching the movie i thought the directing and acting was phenomenal i have always been a science nerd and watch science shows and documentaries since the carl sagan days it is a long movie and as great as the movie was its not a movie most would watch more than once
Mar 30 2024,positive,as close to cinematic perfection as i feel you will ever see an incredible piece of cinema with a stellar cast led by cillian murphy justifiably lauded at the oscars
Mar 29 2024,negative,this was one pf the most poorly made and over hyped big budget movies ive ever seen it is a pretentious aimless mess difficult to pay attention to and if you do force yourself through it theres no reward at the end
Mar 29 2024,positive,what a masterpiece one of the best movies ive ever seen as a history lover my self it was amazing
Mar 29 2024,negative,yeah this isnt good i feel like folk have been told this movie is good and just went along with it     confusing for the sake of being confusing and far too long
Mar 29 2024,negative,one of the dullest films i have ever seen  if you want to know a bit about oppenheimer and more about the manhatten project watch fat man and big boy a much better film 
Mar 29 2024,positive,its a well done movie acting was vastly overrated based on the awards it won or perhaps there wasnt much competition the lack of special effects for the trinity test was a complete joke how could anyone believe that was a nuclear detention     i was really hyped to finally see this movie but i thought it was mostly boring so i took a star away for the overhyped actors and another one for the trinity mess
Mar 29 2024,positive,at times mesmerizing but overall bogged down by bureaucratic pettiness i know this follows the book but how is a hearing about losing his clearance the most compelling thing about his life
Mar 29 2024,positive,one of my most enjoyed films ever  saw it 2 times in the cinema in imax and bought the 4k copy too  fantastic this is cinema
Mar 29 2024,negative,this movie is kind of boring
Mar 29 2024,negative,disjointed slow and excruciatingly boring i recommend researching the history of oppenheimer before watching this painful drivel
Mar 29 2024,positive,greatest biographical movie for sure 100
Mar 29 2024,positive,the one and only best movie of 2023 nolans direction and all of the cast members did great too
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie is a masterpiece amazing cinematography and the soundtrack the acting is unique mostly clilian murphy and robert downey jr   the writting and the brutal ending of this movie it was haunting and the same extremely beautiful
Mar 28 2024,positive,very long pretentious  only became interested in the second half of the movie 1st half i couldve missed and not miss anything
Mar 28 2024,negative,boring right from the startpurchased it from prime video so felt obliged to watch it luckily the cat needed feeding so that was 5 mins away from the tedium of the movie made a sandwich so that was another 5 mins wasted now 1hr and 37 mins into it another whiskey might helpya
Mar 28 2024,positive,this is the best movie i have ever seen in my life i love the music acting and just the whole lot of it honestly a movie for the ages that will not be forgotten like the godfather or saving private ryan this is why christopher nolan movies are the best it is because of the cinematography cillian murphy and robert downey jr are definitely the standout actors for this movie i love wwii it has so many parts to it and the atomic bomb takes one of the key roles in wwii another thing that i like is that it shows the guilt of oppenheimer after he creates the bomb and becomes the ender of so many lives and most likely the world as we know it the run time is unbearable but it is so intense it goes by very fast along with napoleon and john wick 4 these are my picks for movie of the year but most of all i hope it goes to oppenheimer in total a mustsee movie for any movie lover and my pick for best movie of all time edit it won the movie of the year
Mar 28 2024,positive,in tenet nolan seemed to toy with the question what happens if we have no protagonist in oppenheimer he seems to challenge himself to answer the flip side of his question  what if the movie is full of stars but the star isnt one of the actors the star being the bomb of course my interpretation of course  others have had meaningful discussions on the movie dealing with moral and actual consequences in a world without heroes    oppenheimer is arguably nolan at his peak high praise from the guy who loved the dark knight building an engaging world with a deep introspection that never feels too heavy nolan might be slightly generous to oppenheimer but the movie itself never feels like it takes sides oppenheimers youth growth and involvement in the manhattan project and the subsequent related congressional hearing of lewis strauss are handled masterfully    the cast is also great though i was a mite disappointed by florence pugh and emily blunt whose roles seemed muted but the rest of the cast shone and shone in concert together underpinned by a script that for once isnt expository  all in all its a deeply thoughtful movie that is also beautifully constructed and shot and ranks up there as one of the best movies of the 2020s not just 2023 youll feel the 3 hours but you wont regret it
Mar 27 2024,negative,find it really boring and unnecessary long
Mar 27 2024,positive,in my opinion the movies that universal pictures has shown to the world in its 111 year history has all led up to this very movie the tourdeforce performances of all who starred practical effects that will leave you utterly amazed a score which can go from the stunningly beautiful music of the beginning montage to the terrifying sounds of the detonation of the first nuclear bomb test this is one of the best movies that i have ever seen in my life this could very well be the greatest film to have ever been released or made by universal
Mar 26 2024,positive,a mesmerising example of the perfect film r
Mar 26 2024,negative,very long and hard to follow i didnt enjoy this movie and im confused why the rest of the world likes it
Mar 26 2024,negative,this is a big important hollywood movie personally i found it boring and felt i had seen the movie at least a dozen times before i wonder if it got such rave reviews because it tackled an important topic or because people truly loved the movie i suspect the former played an important part if you value creativity in your movies surprise thoughtfulness  then avoid this movie
Mar 26 2024,negative,incredibly pretentious lacked a story line a waste of time
Mar 26 2024,positive,amazing powerful movie fabulous acting and script visuals were stunning
Mar 26 2024,positive,this was a very well put together movie while it was drug out a little to long i enjoyed every min of it and felt the remorse that oppenheimer felt for creating the beginning of the end of the earth overl 10 out of 10 on this movie
Mar 25 2024,positive,such a phenomenal film yeah its a little long but its still really good
Mar 24 2024,positive,this is everything a movie should be informative interesting and with a message  thanks nolan
Mar 24 2024,positive,this is genuinely one of the best movies i think ive ever watched every single scene always captivated me and the acting only elevated it  hans zimmer and nolan were always a fantastic duo but ludwig just may be my favorite this movie is a one of a kind nolan almost hits home runs in every genre i cannot wait to see what movie he will direct next
Mar 24 2024,neutral,i normally enjoy nolan films but this story was long and boring and disorganized these 25 hour movies i think neglect the audience in favor of their own need to get an oscar grab im kinda tired of it
Mar 24 2024,positive,a chilling film that honors cinema the acting of the actors the direction the construction of the scenes and the soundtrack i only regret the fact that such an incredible film was in part overshadowed by a film as silly as barbie    um filme arrepiante que honra o cinema a atua√ß√£o dos atores a dire√ß√£o a constru√ß√£o das cenas e a trilha sonora s√≥ lamento o fato de um filme t√£o incr√≠vel ter sido em parte ofuscado por um filme t√£o bobo como a barbie
Mar 24 2024,positive,first i dont recommend it to children because it is an r rated movie for a reason however the story was told in a magnificent way and it was shot very well kudos to christopher nolan i may be biased because im a history buff and really enjoyed learning about the father of the atomic bomb so when i say its fantastic i may be overshooting it a bit although imo its my movie of the year and it may not be close with the movie hotperiod coming to an end i will say that its a slow movie that i may watch less than 20 times in my lifetime but i will enjoy it every single time to wrap it up i think it was for sure one of my most favorable intheater experiences and i recommend it to anyone and everyone ps  its kind of crazy when they mention the hanford plutonium site because its literally right down the road and its cool to me that i live close to a very historical site
Mar 24 2024,negative,overhyped the movie jumped around in time and gave almost no clue as to what year it was in it was extremely hard to follow and the artistic effects were overdone  it reminded me of when a mediocre rock band turns up the volume to compensate for lack of talent on the subject of audio the dialogue was whispered in some places and then would follow with deafening sounds  the only reason i could follow any of it was because i already knew the history very well  there was one upside and that was robert downey and matt damons acting still that did not compensate for all of the failings   i want my money back and more importantly my time
Mar 24 2024,positive,an incredible film with an incredible cast cilian murphy is truly won of the best actors out there right now and he portrays j robert oppenheimer fantastically in this 3hour epic from start to finish
Mar 24 2024,positive,a very good movie the acting is superb and the production is phenomenal at the end the movie gets a bit longwinded
Mar 24 2024,positive,this movie was a must watch not only is the acting on point but the storyline draws you in well written acted produced directed all of it
Mar 24 2024,negative,slownot interestingboringi couldnt get thru 20 minutes
Mar 24 2024,positive,fulfilling and historic reverence to the material
Mar 24 2024,positive,its an amazing movie that repeats the history itself my first time seeing it was the sound got earpierced even with the abomb test went off and it was gonna blow me up to smithereens  but cillian murphys role was great and im proud of robert downey jr who supported over the movie christopher nolan is the best director ever
Mar 23 2024,negative,i felt like all of the important topics covered in this movie were only slightly mentioned it felt like it was mainly about his affair the timeline was hard to follow as someone who doesnt know much about oppenheimers life honestly i felt like it was only made for people who either love history or are obsessed with oppenheimer the best thing about the movie were a few of the scenes towards the end and the cinematography of the movie 
Mar 23 2024,positive,expect a thoughtprovoking drama that goes beyond wartime action the movie explores the personal struggles of oppenheimer and the lasting impact of his scientific achievements if youre interested in the history of the atomic bomb the psychology of scientific innovation and the biographical dramas about complex figures then oppenheimer might be worth checking out
Mar 23 2024,positive,every second of this film deserves an oscar
Mar 23 2024,positive,i was scared for not really liking this but wow this movie is so good the pacing was perfect didnt feel as 3 hours at all christopher nolan thank you thank you thank you
Mar 23 2024,positive,brilliant the acting from all angles was superb happy cilian won his first oscar as a lead
Mar 22 2024,positive,christopher nolan has created a masterpiece and a great performance by cillian murphy as j robert oppenheimer
Mar 22 2024,positive,a serious film that over three hours makes few concessions to suspense emotional intensity or development of plot but instead through a brittle mosaic of interlocking fragments takes one through the historical drama of americas development of the abomb its deployment against japan and then the fallout pun intended against oppenheimer its creator the best scenes i found were at the end during the hearings examining oppenheimer alleged communist sympathies and the machinations of his enemies strauss to ruin his reputation on the whole the verdict of the film is the invention of the atom bomb was a disaster and oppenheimer himself felt distinctly ambivalent about his invention well his teams invention what have we learnt not much but the character of oppenheimer is scrutinized in some depth whether accurately or not i have no idea
Mar 22 2024,positive,i was really excited to see this movie because i always wanted to know more about how the atomic bomb was created i did end up enjoying the movie however it left me wanting more from it i really enjoyed the atomic test they made it quite exciting and everything i wanted it to be after that point i just kept waiting for the next thing to happen i felt it really missed out by not at least showing the bomb being used and showing the devastation it created so when i left the movie i felt a bit disappointed
Mar 22 2024,negative,i love historical movies but this would be the most boring movie ive ever watched in my life complete snorefest so disappointed
Mar 22 2024,positive,magnificent cillian murphy transforms himself physically and emotionally into the brilliant poignant naive oppenheimer  it is made clear that oppie fixated on the creation of the bomb as a physics theory but thought that the world will respect it and never use it  he was a better man than most and so sadly wrong it took me a few moments to recognize robert downey jr another masterful physical transformation there was not a wasted moment in this film i cannot emphasize enough the importance of oppenheimer it is a film to be watched more than once every few months or years to remind ourselves how dangerous a species we are bravo to the cast and crew and to the great christopher nolan
Mar 22 2024,positive,there is a reason why it won 7 oscars
Mar 22 2024,negative,i could not stand sitting through this horror film i say horror because any film celebrating the birth of the atom bomb is a horror movie despite the mea culpa of oppenheimer  not a hero in my eyes and this film did not change that sorry bro you helped creat the existential threat we live with on a daily basis cannot laude that in any way and this film did not need to be made imho
Mar 21 2024,positive,great story  must see on big screen
Mar 20 2024,positive,best biopic since finchers the social  network nolan is one of the best directors of alltime and he really dropped a phenomenal historical drama with oscar winning performances from cillian murphy and rdj i loved emily blunt  florence pugh in it too it 100 deserved the win for best picture
Mar 20 2024,positive,oppenheimer got its recognition for best picture of 2024 at the oscars i was captivated from beginning to end with cillian musphys performance and his ability to capture the essence of oppenheimers character from the visuals to the acting to the dialogue this film deserved its awards at the oscars i look forward to watching it a second time
Mar 20 2024,negative,oppenheimer shifted around way too often consciously filmed edited and packaged for the shorter attention spanned modern moviegoers  gimmickey the score was always raging or waning it was like watching the history channel on bath salts and adderall villenueve glazer and even ari aster ascribe to classic cinematic craftsmanship that is as naturally pleasing as thrilling their films echo the works of masters such as david  lean john huston francis ford coppola federico fellini akira kurosawa michelangelo antonioni and stanley kubrick to name a few  i hope oppenheimer is the last tik tok hack job we will ever see getting accolades scotts napoleon and scorseses flower moon were  much  better at crafting suspenseful narratives and artfully utilizing nuanced cinematic framing from historic settings that didnt scrape psychic chalkboards like   nolans oppenheimer
Mar 20 2024,negative,a forgettable movie nothing special good acting
Mar 20 2024,positive,its very interesting
Mar 20 2024,positive,well donefor a 3 hour movie it moved along at a nice pace fantastic acting wonderful screen play beautiful editing but not my favorite 2023 film that still goes to poor things
Mar 20 2024,positive,story and acting were superb but back ground music was too loud
Mar 19 2024,positive,it was an amazing story the actors were great and robert downing jr was so his usual stellar self
Mar 19 2024,negative,very confusing and slow couldnt tell which is past and present and goodluck watching this without a subtitle the only good memorable part was 5 minutes testing the bomb a test and not actually the hiroshima scene was showed turned it off after it got passed that overhyped confusing and boring
Mar 19 2024,positive,intense gripping immersive performances
Mar 19 2024,positive,an amazing cast and story that kept me hooked throughout even though i knew how it ultimately ended for dr oppenheimer
Mar 18 2024,positive,great overall movie enjoyed the music and acting just overall very good
Mar 18 2024,positive,i strongly disliked the lack of dialogue clarity  the same way i would not appreciate a stage actor to muffle under their nose during a theater performance because of this i had a hard time to focus on actors performances and the story in oppenheimer i was not the only one in the crowd most in the audience would turn to their partners to clarify what words were just uttered pretty much through the entire movie   the plot line was all over the place   i salute to the entire acting ensemble though every actor in a small or bigger role was intensely invested in their delivery the same goes for the cinematography  the visual elements of this story the angles of the camera lighting etc elevated the film
Mar 18 2024,negative,oppenheimer attempts to explore complex themes through incessant dialogue reminiscent of subatomic particles spinning around a nucleus however its excessive wordiness sets a record in the guinness book of world records leaving viewers feeling overwhelmed and disengaged despite its ambition the film falls short delivering a tedious and ultimately unsatisfying experience
Mar 18 2024,positive,another masterpiece by prolific film director christopher nolan this 2023 biographicalhistorical drama film about the man largely responsible for the building of the atomic bomb that destroyed hiroshima and nagasaki and ended the 2nd world war is thrilling thoughtprovoking and engaging it is excellently written by nolan powerfully scored by ludwig g√∂ransson meticulously edited by jennifer lame beautifully photographed by hoyte van hoytema and topped by excellent performances of its cast including cillian murphy robert downey jr emily blunt matt damon josh hartnett and florence pugh
Mar 18 2024,positive,great movie and sound system comfortable seating
Mar 18 2024,negative,this is basically a story of a mans fall from heroism and his inability to escape decisions of the past  but the structure of the movie is among the most ridiculously difficult to follow that i have ever watched the entire first half is a crazed jumble of cuts from different moments in history with no clue whatsoever as to when they are taking place  there are probably two dozen important characters who are often poorly identified and impossible to keep track of  i cannot believe that this has been so acclaimed and rewarded  maybe watching it at least twice would suffice certainly you should have some supplementary source to read to figure out what is going on
Mar 18 2024,positive,even though its 3 hours i still want to watch it over and over
Mar 18 2024,positive,incredible film with terrific performances
Mar 17 2024,positive,great story great acting
Mar 17 2024,positive,i specifically liked the second half of the movie when oppenheimer reflects on the impact of the bomb also educated me on this part of history
Mar 17 2024,positive,woah this was a really interesting and surprisingly exciting movie the entire cast is great nolans directing is great as it usually is the only potential gripe i have with this movie is the runtime i miss the days when movies could be under two hours but then again its a really good 3 hours so yeah youve probably seen this movie if you havent go watch it
Mar 17 2024,positive,im colorblind so on first viewing  i didnt get its structure then i read up and watched it again magnificent     ironically i took quantum  mechanics in college didnt get that either  maybe i should have tried that course a second time    at this point in time i think oppenheimer is my favorite movie
Mar 17 2024,positive,good movie  the overall sound on a lot of the conversations poor
Mar 17 2024,positive,big history big cinema must see period
Mar 17 2024,positive,nolan came into making this imaginative biopic as a rookie and came out of it as a director who has arguably brought us one of the best biopics ever made
Mar 17 2024,positive,the history and affect that the event took on america at the time excellent
Mar 17 2024,positive,i dont get the hype  its an ok movie far too long with lots of filler  cinematography was standard nolan which is good but not groundbreaking  acting was ok but downey was the only one who had to actually do some acting  story was true but sensationalised  i wouldnt watch again i wouldnt tell anyone to watch it either
Mar 17 2024,positive,very excellent portrayal of what happened and a good story of the underhanded way politicians misuse people may god judge their souls
Mar 17 2024,positive,christopher nolan blew me away with this movie it was super good i dont think it was the best movie of the year necessarily but it was amazing
Mar 16 2024,positive,having watched it in imax oppenheimer truly lived up to expectations the entire cast shines with standout performances from cilian murphy and robert downey jr everything from the visuals to the sound is topnotch it wouldnt be surprising if it gets multiple oscars while its length may be a concern for some i found myself fully invested throughout
Mar 16 2024,positive,what a good movie and a great actor
Mar 16 2024,negative,even after the oscar i think this is overrated watching as a physicist it seems to me as a boring and simple story told in a unnecessarily confusing way with historic physicists made to say cringy words and a bunch of toodramatic side characters all the tension in the cut music lines and fancy camera movements just built up to a disappointing boring and bland climax
Mar 16 2024,positive,masterpiece needed another hour
Mar 16 2024,positive,my son and i were absolutely amazed as the film is fantastic all who won an academy award were definitely worthy i am so thrilled we were able to see it in a theater as the entire 3 hour movie was a pure thrill
Mar 16 2024,positive,excellent film about los alamos during the making of the abomb and the persecutions of communists during the redscare 1950s you really believe cillian murphy and what hes going through knowing he has to end the war but at the same time knowing what it means for the future
Mar 16 2024,positive,just like j robert oppenheimer during the testing of the gadget i am speechless because there are not enough words to describe the mastery this movie possesses to fixate the viewer through the life the choices and the consequences of them for one of the most important not for every right reason scientists in the planets history
Mar 16 2024,positive,the movie is loud i was thankful a friend had recommend earplugs and it wasnt just the bombs some of the dialogue was too loud than other times the explosive background noise overwhelmed even the overly loud dialogue
Mar 16 2024,positive,huge nolan fan so everything was great as always but the concept as a whole just lacks excitement
Mar 16 2024,positive,a very good movie i thought i would struggle to stay watching for 3 hours but it was no problem
Mar 16 2024,neutral,beautiful and thought provoking but certainly not up to nolans usual standards of creative originality
Mar 16 2024,positive,utterly sensational im not exactly a film critic but i can definitely say i havent seen many movies that are as brilliant as oppenheimer
Mar 15 2024,positive,this movie is amazing need i say more
Mar 15 2024,positive,excellent direction superb acting and an undeniably momentus core subject matter make this film well worth watching however oppenheimer is much too long with too many parochial distractions and courtroom digressions the bomb is the important story here not the postwar fate of oppenheimer and not the wellworn postwar redsunderthebed moral panic storyline as soon as the bombs are dropped the film loses all impetus and by the time we reach the final moment of judgement the tension has been squandered worse films have won as many oscars but plenty of better films did not
Mar 15 2024,neutral,its a great retelling of a period in history of course but the complexity goes too far in this moviegreat acting and visuals save it from not worth watching
Mar 15 2024,positive,i think the inflated ratings for this movie are due to it being a great but not spectacular movie in a year of otherwise garbage it suffers from some marked pacing issues and questionable stylistic selections but otherwise is an absolutely solid biopic on a complex historical figure
Mar 15 2024,positive,this was a great movie it includes real physics knowledge in the movie id assume i really enjoyed the acting a movie directed by christopher nolan is enjoyed all the time
Mar 15 2024,positive,great movie a bit slow at points but extremely well acted
Mar 14 2024,negative,this film is a long boring badly written and overhyped film about glorifying weapons of destruction the american way   nolan knows about blockbusters and to get blockbuster paydays taking home an obscene 100 million for this badly written syrupy propagandized and big ticket marketing effort  the true story of oppenheimer is completely lost of course  and this was just a pissing contest with barbie to get butts back in seats after covid  its all about the money
Mar 14 2024,positive,sound was to loud and background music also to loud drowning out dialogue
Mar 14 2024,positive,oppeneheimer is cristopher nolans most downtoearth film it has depth and a sense of history the film rightly earned 7 oscars when it comes to acting it was through this film that cillian murphy finally got rid of his image as the tough gang leader he played in peacky blinders he showed that he could touch deeply on the moral dilemmas within the man himself also to be mentioned is robert downey jr who played his role as lewis strauss to the full despite looking nothing alike
Mar 14 2024,positive,great movie would recommend
Mar 14 2024,positive,good costumes makeup authentic science too long time swapping could be confusing interesting story
Mar 14 2024,positive,an absolute masterpiece nolan strikes again 910
Mar 14 2024,negative,the movie was boring and hard to follow  i do not believe that over 90 of the people who sat through the movie liked it  i talked to five people today who saw it and they said the same thing  what the heck
Mar 13 2024,negative,i walked out of the cinema this is really poor storytelling there is no intro it is just a sequence of bits told in flashback mode the sound is so poor i can barely understand the actors talk i feel this movie has been blown up by marketing up due to the stellar cast this is the most awarded movie i ever walked out of
Mar 13 2024,positive,enjoyed this movie very much
Mar 13 2024,positive,good not great some scenes felt unnecessary
Mar 13 2024,positive,for my this movie is bored but really is art
Mar 13 2024,positive,a nearly perfect film
Mar 13 2024,positive,everything well done blobbo deduct 12 star because is three hours long
Mar 13 2024,positive,christopher nolan does it again with an engrossing spectacle of a movie that sucks you in the moment it starts with engaging performances and beautiful visuals its hard to look away from oppenheimer for even a second
Mar 13 2024,negative,my wife and i were lost great actors and acting but i believe i am too uneducated on the subject matter
Mar 13 2024,positive,first two hours not really special but interesting last hour exceptional
Mar 13 2024,positive,after seeing the buzz at the oscars i decided to see this movie on the big screen before it leaves the theaters  wow what an amazing film  everything about it was incredible the story the actors the cinematography   the 3 hrs flew by and i was entertained and engaged the entire time  just amazing
Mar 13 2024,positive,it is the best movie i have ever seen
Mar 13 2024,positive,love my man cillian murphy in this he was just at the top of his game in this role the music was just so interesting i learned so much about history of the time and science in general great supporting actorsactresses as well long movie but was riveted every minute
Mar 12 2024,positive,not my favourite from nolan the story is interesting but i was expecting a little more 3 hours and nothing interesting  for me  happening   its a good movie yes but for me something is missing  cilian murphy super good sound as always superb and photography amazing
Mar 12 2024,positive,when i first seen what this movie was about i thought it was gonna be boring but honestly it kept me engaged and wanting to watch more
Mar 12 2024,positive,an impressive and engaging film that lacks the narrative magic of nolans better work
Mar 12 2024,positive,when it finished  i clapped for two or three minutes  dont know it was for nolan murphy or the oppenheimer himself  but that was the greatest movie ive seen
Mar 12 2024,negative,3 hours wasted it was alot of dialog with heavy dramatic yet unnecessary instrumentation and sound effects the 5 min bomb scene was decent otherwise this movie really drags on
Mar 12 2024,positive,the only film i watched at the movies 3 times stellar performances sound effects and script
Mar 12 2024,positive,kept my interest from beginning to end of movie it was one of the best i have seen this year
Mar 12 2024,negative,three hours of your life youll wish you had back 
Mar 12 2024,positive,i mean no one can argue its not technically a great film particularly the amazing performances of its cast however i really dont want to watch it again its definitely too long and while superbly acted there werent any characters i wanted to spend time with especially not this much time so much time listening to his hearing for his security clearance who wants to watch hours of that the sex scenes such as they were added nothing i have no idea why nolan and co believe their own hype on that
Mar 12 2024,positive,oppenheimer 2023 is a tour de force movie that is so tightly edited and wellacted that even though it clocks in at a little over three hours im kept at the edge of my seat the whole time its the story of a man who like the dying stars he studies finds out that the bigger the star the more violent its demise spoilers he has a mozartsalieri relationship with admiral lewis strauss the head of the aec who both admires and reviles oppie as his cultists call him and it is oppenheimers arrogance his egotistical demands that he be seen as the father of the atomic bomb without any of the accompanying responsibility for the deaths of two hundred and twenty thousand people cillian murphy is astonishing as oppenheimer having lost 28 pounds to get the gaunt silhouette necessary for the role he not only embodies oppenheimer we see through his eyes or rather in the ways he doesnt look at usaudiencethe camera the primal narcissism of this man  an astoundingly great supporting cast led by robert downey jr make this film one for the ages and it is my contention that oppenheimer is not an american prometheus but rather an american icarus  who made himself wax wings and deliberately flew as close to the light and heat as he could knowingly only to plummet and bring the entire earth with him
Mar 11 2024,negative,oppenheimer is a passenger of his own actions
Mar 11 2024,negative,waited long time to see it and was awful   i wanted to forward it to best parts which there are very few    the trailer had shown all the best parts   acting was predictable
Mar 11 2024,positive,a magnetic masterpiece around the mythical episode of a truly incredible man one of the best and most wellbuilt movies of all time for sure step by step you are taken on a unique journey from simmering life and brewing tension to a literal explosion of what life can be under the harshest of circumstances left in awe every scene cillian murphy is at his usual best just the best and he proves it here blunt is great the entire cast is great florence pugh in a scenestealing role even though she doesnt appear a lot she really does shine for a movie that is centered around a cataclysmic event and a tense complicated situation it is made remarkably approachable and you are invited to understand each step along the way in a human sense coupled with brilliantlyshot scenes and a flawless script this movie is a surreal achievement
Mar 11 2024,positive,im not saying i disliked oppenheimer but i did think it was overrated based on the hype essentially its what youd think a nolan bio would be like dramatic music constantly played throughout dynamic editing including some special effects images but i think in combination all of that detracts from the story by making it seem less personal cillian does a great job portraying oppenheimer but its a fairly one note performance with cillian starring off into the distance with a monotone voice throughout downey jr did a serviceable job however i dont think he was the best choice downey has a certain kinetic energy and certain vocal intonations that dont seem fitting for an older man of that era to put it succinctly downey has the vibe of a coke guy ha which works well for other roles but wasnt ideal for this one imho he toned down the downey thing compared to other performances but it still came through     also i thought florence pughs performance was absolutely wooden we often praise british actors for doing passable american accents but their performances can be very flat as was the case with pugh she does this thing british actors do while performing an american accent that i call swallowing their words because instead of speaking in a naturalistic way or projecting their words their mouths are overly involved with enunciation and their dialogue sounds kind of muddled as a result along with lacking an emotional connection with what theyre saying     overall id say its a good film but it didnt really live up to my expectations and its not a film that im in a rush to watch again anytime soon especially with the 3 hour running time
Mar 11 2024,negative,this movie is so overrated 3 most boring hours of my life wasted the storyline timeline is way confusing you dont know when is the past the present or the future and dialogues full of cringy phrases im sure that oppenheimers life was way more exciting than this movie
Mar 11 2024,positive,musical scoring alone makes this film worthwhile true story films poses the challenge of having limited control and of course the inevitable predictability i appluad the creative choices that makes it an emotional journey rather than an informative one leaves a lot to the imagination
Mar 11 2024,positive,was amazing given that ive never really been interested in oppenheimer as a historical figure however his wife though very much supportive and seems like the person who pushes him into the right direction weirdly is also a mess the sexnude scenes with florence pugh wasnt needed please be honest what did i need to see that for what did that add to the story we get it thats his mistress who is also one of the main reasons why he never got his full security clearance why did i need to see her naked
Mar 11 2024,negative,dont really care about a movie about a bomb boring 
Mar 11 2024,positive,truly a monumental film the performance of each actor in oppenhtimer was so realistic you felt you were actually there direction was superb i would have given an academy awardnot only to this picture and director but to so many of the actors in this presentation i will watch it again there was so much to absorb it truly was an emotional experience bravo to each member of the cas wellas direction photography et cetera
Mar 11 2024,negative,oppenheimer one of the most overrated movies ive ever watched so much pointless dialogue murphys performance was nothing special didnt blow you a way awful movie   if you want to know the story of the birth of the atomic bomb id recommend watching one of the many great factual documentaries
Mar 11 2024,positive,love the pictures the action very informative great movie
Mar 11 2024,positive,3 hours of incredible cinema and the amazing editing made it feel like 2 hours the performances are excellent the story disturbing but well handled incredibly important to think about intense fascinating and really is a great film happy to see cillian get lots of love we need more amazing long films this truly was excellent id see it again
Mar 11 2024,positive,its cillian murphy fella this man is the man  ok criticism would be now its an excellent adaptation of what really happened irl with the best actor of the decade three hours well spent of my life i watched it twice so six hours i would watch it like another 94 times in a row n that would be approximately 282 hours i would eat another 282 hours of oppenheimer without any prize or reward  fuck this film is the best ive watched in a good few years just watch rn study history so it doesnt repeat itself
Mar 11 2024,positive,three hours of palpable boredom found the lead actor wooden the pacing odd and the historical facts of a worldchanging invention oddly shoehorned into a story about a mans ego
Mar 10 2024,positive,a classic movie for a special and infinitely important point in time in the history of mankind  top notch movie making story telling  hits on all cylinders  long but riveting all the way
Mar 10 2024,negative,totally overrated and hard to watch movie
Mar 10 2024,positive,its good but not as good as red eye
Mar 10 2024,positive,i valued for historical perspective and excellent acting and at times interesting cinematic effect and art however the movie dragged on too long they could have cut 30 minutes out of this movie it moved a little too slow at points and some developments became redundantoverkill overall the film is worth watching but clear out your schedule
Mar 10 2024,negative,painfully slow and disjointed
Mar 10 2024,positive,despite the length of the film it kept me engaged the entire time excellent 55 
Mar 10 2024,negative,unfortunatelly i really did not get into this movie the acting is good and the design and overal look are great but i simply found it boring i dont get all the great reviews for me this was nolans worst movie so far
Mar 10 2024,positive,one of the best history movies of all time and i hate history movies
Mar 10 2024,negative,this movie was like cooking a 5 course meal masterpiece and adding too much salt thus ruining the experience    i really want to agree with everyone else on the brilliance  theres so much to love and so much detail hard work brilliant acting set design costume design and love that went into this movie but i cant even finish it so disappointing    music is too loud the exhausting camera shots jumping from angle to angle camera movements scene to scene jumping constantly flashes of nuclear reactions depictions all over the place and all of the jumping from past to present i cant do it its disorienting    i completely agree with other reviewers regarding criticisms of the overall experience
Mar 10 2024,positive,great movie depicting a world changing time the acting was superb
Mar 10 2024,positive,oppenheimer    oppenheimer follows the life of american physicist robert oppenheimer this journey goes from his days as a student through his pivotal role in developing the atomic bomb during world war ii to his security hearing in 1954    oppenheimer hails as the most visually stunning movie of 2023 christopher nolan delivers a brilliant feat of filmmaking in this movie theres an undeniable triumph across the board the film delves into humanitys fascination with destruction and our relentless pursuit to enhance the means to achieve it    character study is pivotal to the success of oppenheimer and a brilliantly layered examination is present here this movie is mostly about oppenheimer and cillian murphy is up to the task as he delivers a brilliant lead performance robert downey jr exceptionally complements murphy with a final act that shows him at his best matt damon emily blunt and florence pugh round up this stellar cast    pacing isnt perfect here and thats impacted greatly by the extended runtime but oppenheimer weaves through a fragmented nonlinear plot that ends with a slam dunk    oppenheimer concludes as a brilliant biopic and a masterclass in filmmaking    910
Mar 10 2024,positive,one of the best movies ive ever seen i felt like i already knew this story but boy was i wrong learned a lot and the storytelling here is impeccable there better be a shower of oscars for this one
Mar 10 2024,positive,really great storyline would definitely watch again
Mar 9 2024,negative,way overrated hashing the multiple stories together made for many disorienting time jumps completely gratuitous nude scenes you dont expect in a highclass movie at least an hour too long with tedious details of the manhattan project and needless namechecking of physicists who are superfluous to this story
Mar 9 2024,positive,this movie is what helped me get girlfriend and have kids 911 movie
Mar 9 2024,positive,i found i couldnt stay interested for very long and i got bored story came alive a bit near end in the meeting to take him down that was it cannot believe all the hype and academy buz many of the other nominees were more interesting exciting with far more character definition and development also stimulating and visually dynamic picks dont understand downey jrs nomination and i like him
Mar 9 2024,positive,call me mr contrarian but i really dont think oppenheimer warrants the incredible buzz it got is getting  its oscar time excellent performances for sure i thought cillian murphy and robert downey jr were very good and add emily blunt into the mix but i think these ensemble star productions have an inherent flaw every time a marquee name pops up its heythats rami malek who was pretty good in his 45 minutes or thats casey affleck in his 3 minutes  i think it actually detracts from the film thats why we have 2nd tier actors it all reminded me of the longest day 1962  you could look it up every star in the book and that was distracting  too long pretty sure reasonable editing could have taken 2030 minutes out once youre past 2 hours you better have a very very good reason or else its just an exercise in selfindulgence    finally all my friends said no dont watch it on tv you have to see it in the theatre why im guessing the atomic bomb test was pretty amazing on the big screen but the rest people talking in rooms how is that special to a big screen  no a pretty good film too long too many stars  did i mention im a bit of a contrarian
Mar 9 2024,positive,interesting and sad but there was a lot you needed to already know about oppenheimer and the story in order to really follow it
Mar 9 2024,positive,absolutely enjoyed this from beginning to end suburb acting beautifully directed and told  its not easy to make this a compelling story without turning it into a war film i really appreciated how they highlighted the complexity of peace  and the irony of how developing a wmd could keep it we watched it in two sittings because it was quite long but well worth the journey must see
Mar 8 2024,negative,boring documentary type movie absolutely obnoxious sex scenes shameful those arguing sex scenes are ok why dont they show real peni and vagi show real uncensored porn to depict the life of the person even more realistically
Mar 8 2024,positive,it is a absolute masterpiece 1010
Mar 8 2024,positive,86  liked it but definitely didnt love it was really a deep dive into the developing testing and preparing for the deployment of the bomb which was essentially just a biography of oppenheimer and coinciding with a trial afterward to get his security clearance provoked since he was speaking out against the continued development of a bombs the lead up to the testing of the bomb was the coolest party the rest was really just a ton of dialogue 25 rewatch
Mar 8 2024,positive,there is nothing short of amazing in all aspects of this landmark film nolan gives us a dazzling biopic in the guise of a thriller while also playing as a cautionary tale that both visually and grammatically gives us the beautiful and devastating science behind mans possible end with outstanding performances led by a careerdefining murphy groundbreaking feats in cinematography and practical effects plus extraordinary sound and music this is one of those rare films that defines filmmaking not only in its creative and technical process but how it is enjoyed by all who see it
Mar 8 2024,positive,beautiful the cinematography was great and so was the acting the pacing and basically everything i absolutely love this film and would definitely recommend
Mar 8 2024,negative,long it took maybe an hour to see something interesting but it was just for a second then it was confusing and just bad to be honest not for me
Mar 7 2024,positive,by far the best film of the year one of the best biopics ever cillian murphy with the best performance of his career ludwig killing the score as always and nolan doing nolan things
Mar 7 2024,positive,hard to get to the starting point  long build up  dragged at points  fine acting  many stars  liked ending
Mar 6 2024,positive,christopher nolan once again proves you can take absolutely nothing and make a remarkable film about it dramatic and informative rdj gives a no surprise here oscar worthy performance cillian murphy finally gets a standout role worthy of his onscreen presence
Mar 6 2024,positive,until the movie started steadily depicting los alamos and beyond i bounced around like a pingpong ball i was wondering how this movie was good it seemed like it was all over the place and would never settle down into a story i didnt know oppenheimers story except for documentary pieces so all the pretexts of his relationships schooling and time travel that the movie showed had me confused and hating the way it was put together it was like going through a rough sea to get to smooth open waters but wasnt sure if the storm was worth the prize all i can say is just grit and bear it  the smooth waters are worth it i watched documentaries that came out in the shadow after this movies release before i watched this movie in march 2024 but it seems christopher nolan did a pretty damn good job sticking to reality and putting you in oppenheiemers shoes even if not at first let it get to los alamos or around 40 minutes in before you judge im just a guy who watched this and my views are no more important than anyone elses but my final opinion is this movie is gold and deserves to be watched as a work of art
Mar 6 2024,positive,a long movie but hooks you from the opening scene
Mar 6 2024,positive,pretty close to perfect
Mar 6 2024,negative,im not an uneducated yokel that doesnt understand the movie that said the movie is too long and frankly after a while it gets boring robert downey jr however deserves the oscar he is nominated for
Mar 6 2024,positive,i did not expect to like this movie but i end up loving this movie the storytelling here is what a movie should be and the acting was great no ego no hype just great acting
Mar 5 2024,negative,the bomb was absolutely mid the main selling point of the movie was a nuke without cgieven mrbeast has better explosions on his videos
Mar 4 2024,positive,another christopher nolan excellent movie borderlining being a masterpiece with superb acting performance from each and every big wig starring in the movie   congratulations  p s i watched equalizer 3 just after and although i understand its not addressing the same demographic or core audience i cant wrap my head around the very similar rating both from professional wrestling critics and regular movie goers
Mar 4 2024,positive,significant and fascimating subjectbut  very confusing due to an avalanche of side issues and mushy hard to understand dialogue and insufficient editing  too bad
Mar 4 2024,positive,this movie was amazing  the art direction casting script and photography were all in point  my only gripe is with some of the timeline swaps but this is one of the best dramas i have seen in years  christopher nolan is a master at his craft
Mar 4 2024,negative,my pastor said that this movie was slow and boring
Mar 4 2024,positive,this movie was insane  incredible acting incredible writing the plot was crazy and the story was nuts  i cant believe how this movie was done with all the different plots going on at once  what a good movie
Mar 4 2024,positive,good third act is kind of long and boring
Mar 4 2024,positive,beautifully lit and shot with amazing performances from the whole cast pacing in the later half is a convoluted the film also suffers from typical christopher nolan audio issues that plague most of his movies things are either super quiet or super loud overall quite good the first half of the movie was more enjoyable than the second half
Mar 3 2024,positive,good enough for a watch but i believe i learned much more about the real historical figure than needed from the movie the movie also offered visual and audible effect but very little inspiration and somewhat awkward sexual tension which i could not claim i understood 
Mar 3 2024,positive,fantastic movie with a lot of good info on history very deep
Mar 3 2024,positive,another piece of art of christophers absolute brilliance and visions  the making of oppenheimer took the real story and tried to creat something as similar as it gets to the real one
Mar 3 2024,negative,too much talking and unnecessary complicated
Mar 3 2024,positive,best movie of the year for sure amazing acting
Mar 3 2024,positive,quite boring for some unknown reason the movie focused on some security clearence discussions years after the war which noone should really care about instead of showing us the turbulant times of the manhattan project where oppy shined as a manager who made many important decisions the movie skipped straight to the first bomb experiment i had high hopes but was utterly bored
Mar 3 2024,positive,excellent acting writing directing worthy of all the awards
Mar 3 2024,negative,so slow with over the top acting i stopped watching it an hour in because i kept checking my phone
Mar 3 2024,negative,the over the top score ruined it i thought it might be my speakers or some audio setting but no its intentional apparently over the top mood music to guide you along like some sort of thoughtless moron i could get through it and had to tie it off actually too bad because its a fascinating story and told with fantastic actors who decided to tie up the music to 11 it ruins it simply like adding too much salt in any recipe yuck cant even finish the dish
Mar 3 2024,positive,top tier movie could be a little shorter
Mar 3 2024,positive,my husband and i loved oppenheimer  just before coming to the film we had watched a twohour documentary about oppenheimer  the movie fit what was shown in the documentary  at the end of the show i was surprised to discover that i had not recognized the actors matt damon and robert downing jr  i also learned a lot about the development of the atomic bomb that i did not know
Mar 3 2024,neutral,basically this movie was ok id say its not deserving of a best picture but oscars make dud decisions so often it doesnt really matter who gets awarded what  there was a lot to like about it but ultimately it is wounded by far too many flaws for example   nolan has a really good template for action films  for some reason hes applied the same template to a talking drama  it feels clunky and silly at times maybe nolan doesnt know how to do any different   the excessive nudity was pathetic  just a cheap way of getting back audience attention its so sad to see nolan stoop to this level after such a good run of movies avoiding excesses of nudity gore and bad language  hollywood sleeze must have rubbed off   definitely needed some editing to reduce run time   characters are not engaging and it is really difficult to empathise with them   most irritating is the treatment of the victims of the bomb  thousands of civilians who had nothing to do with the evil of their government got wiped out by this adventure but it is all covered in a brief and hamfisted lecture scene and a few unconvincing expressions of guilt  it seems whats really important is actually oppenheimers petty and probably exaggerated feud with an old man and the injustice of losing a security card seriously   finishing on this note  having visited hiroshima and experienced its deep and unsettling power this whole barbenheimer frivolity pushed on us by the marketing department seems astonishingly distasteful and disrespectful but i guess it worked for them so i must be the minority
Mar 3 2024,positive,such an interesting time era  mccarthiusmcommunism    why did oppenheimer want his brother to come to los alamos so bad    fantastic acting by all
Mar 3 2024,positive,this is feeling like its going to be one of most overrated best picture at the oscars  i just dont feel the emotional connection as with all nolan films and despite zimmer not scoring this time the score is still loud and distracting to the enjoyment of the film  editing is all over the place and you wud have to follow the movie carefully to get any continuity of the events  one critic commented on a weak third act and although it was indeed boring it was not much of a third act because thats how the movie started with oppenheimer being interrogated by govt officials  there are much better films last year like the holdovers and american fiction with actors stronger than murphy or downey jr
Mar 2 2024,negative,the movie is fine and enjoyable especially the first half but the next half is unreasonably long and it wasnt even about anything important just his clearance card which who cares 93 is an insane score there is no way stop watching after the bomb goes off and youll enjoy it fine
Mar 2 2024,negative,very hard to watch jumps around chronologically without giving enough context clues to allow one to form it into a coherent story not worth the time needed to watch it
Mar 2 2024,positive,its kinda slow paced but its good
Mar 2 2024,positive,brilliant movie didnt even feel it was 3 hours long a well put together movie great actors and acting and was interesting all the way through
Mar 2 2024,positive,stunning visuals transitions and great actors amazing score as well
Mar 2 2024,positive,brilliantly done and exceptionally well executed bravo
Mar 2 2024,negative,over directed and an hour or more theatric nonsense
Mar 1 2024,positive,best movie that ive never seen before
Mar 1 2024,positive,for a subject matter that most might not consider riveting or thrilling and with an outcome were all aware of they really pulled this off expertly acted and thoroughly enjoyable
Mar 1 2024,positive,there could be no better treatment of the subject manner than oppenheimer received nolan proved his capability as the director of a biopic and made good use of a deep pocket for top quality effects and an expansive cast i wouldnt be able to tell you the names of over half the characters in the film but thats not the important thing here i could tell you oppenheimers story a story i did not previously know
Mar 1 2024,neutral,did not like the movie saw it online probably it looks great on large screen and better on imax but actingwise plotwise and character development wise i didnt like it at all what a dull movie with no story and character development not my cup of tea
Mar 1 2024,positive,great history information not widely known
Mar 1 2024,positive,i enjoyed this much more than i thought i would a great historic biopic with a little flair
Feb 29 2024,positive,this is a masterwork the acting direction story cinematography music all come together in an epic telling of oppenheimers life and role in the creation of the atomic bomb
Feb 28 2024,negative,here we go again another movie pumped up sky high and was nothing but a huge disappointment how are these movies being evaluated for awards
Feb 28 2024,positive,either nolans best or a close second to dunkirk this guy should stick to true stories or at least movies that are more geared towards adults and i deeply appreciate that the movie is more about the contradictory and complex motivations of individuals and how those complexities are weaponized against them rather than the mechanics of atomic bombs it has some great performances murphy especially and while many will be mad the movie isnt really what was advertised i found it refreshing and one of the best biopics in recent memory
Feb 28 2024,negative,one of the most boring  overrated
Feb 28 2024,positive,this movie is probably the best historical movie ever christopher nolan has yet to fail me in any movie this movie would be 5 star if they showed the bomb but everything else about this movie is perfect having different stages of the movie have different color frames of the time of the movie it crazy how this movie really explains and gets you engage through the whole thing it made me feel like i didnt know what was going to happen next the cast of the is movie is crazy good they truly show the emotions of how the character should be i hope to see more work from this director like this movie
Feb 27 2024,positive,incredible another master piece from nolan
Feb 27 2024,positive,oppenheimer was one of the greatest movies in 2023
Feb 27 2024,positive,movie was very good cillian was good as always but rdj had a amazing performance as well
Feb 27 2024,positive,in oppenheimer the plots approach and development especially the escalating tension leading to a climactic moment contributed to a thrilling viewing experience the ensemble cast coupled with christopher nolans directing elevated the acting to a commendable level despite its length and occasional complexity the film left a lasting impression emerging as a mustwatch by the end as expected from nolans work the cinematography was outstanding with meticulously crafted shots and sets nolans direction a hallmark of his films showcased his toptier skills bringing out the best in both acting and cinematography solidifying oppenheimer as a captivating cinematic experience
Feb 27 2024,positive,i thought for sure id be bored out of my mind because it is so long but i was completely enthralled the entire time  the jumps between the 2 timelines was seamless and executed very well  everyone is very well cast in this film and the depiction of the time period is flawless  i actually felt like i was back in 1942 im not a huge history buff but i really enjoyed learning a little more about this time in history even if it was dramatized a bit
Feb 27 2024,positive,oppenheimer was always destined to be one of the best films of 2023 and will likely give nolan his long derserved best director award the outrageously stacked cast are all on top of their game delivering snappy dialogue in the well written perfectly paced and masterfully directed spectacle special mention must also be given to the hauntingly beautiful score by ludwig g√∂ransson the visuals and lack of cgi is impressive but my only criticism is here where the trinity test could have looked more realistic with a bit of embelishment cillian murphy perfectly embodies the american prometheus through a career defining performance and robert downey junior stands out amongst a great supporting cast im glad i caught this one in imax
Feb 27 2024,positive,the first half was tedious and self important it flitted annoyingly about in time the sex scenes felt unnecessary and exploitative the second half was much more engaging beautifully shot some great performances but overall not a great film not bad but not great cannot see the reason for all the awards unless its american guilt over dropping the bombs in japan and the weighty important  subject matter
Feb 26 2024,negative,beautiful cinematography  performances couldnt save this snoozefest
Feb 26 2024,positive,just shiny perfect would  get a 5stars if it was pleasent to be watched at home just like it is to be seen in a movie theater
Feb 26 2024,positive,nolan once again asserts his unique mastery of cinematic structure and form and the result is sure to delight his devotees still some viewers may question the necessity of its presentation and perhaps even see it as nothing more than a diversionary tactic intent on manipulating rather than persuading or winning over whichever the case the powerhouse of performances on display can not be denied
Feb 26 2024,negative,what a waste of time  story hops all over the place  could not watch it all  stinker of a movie
Feb 26 2024,positive,this is what acting is supposed to look like
Feb 26 2024,positive,simply superb the story is matched by the excellent cast who are all on top of their game
Feb 26 2024,positive,amazing great movie great acting and it was superbly done 
Feb 26 2024,negative,complete waste of 3 hours movie is boring and definitely not intense
Feb 26 2024,negative,not good  i thought the movie would focus on his work with the manhattan project rather than his personal life  it rambled and skipped around in time  i was bored after the first 10 minutes
Feb 25 2024,negative,it was so confusing the timeline jumps all over the place making it hard to follow the actors mumble and the absolute gratuitous pornographic sex scene is 1000 unnecessary its so easy to imply infidelity without showing every ridiculous detail     without the sex scene id give it 3 12 stars
Feb 25 2024,positive,a masterclass in directing christopher nolan brings an absolute masterpiece to the big screen with oppenheimer stunning visuals amazing sound design and superb storytelling and acting are things to love about this film but most of all cillian murphy is superb as oppenheimer he gives one of the best performances of all time the supporting cast including robert downey jr emily blunt and matt damon are also perfect in their roles this film of one of nolans best and a must see
Feb 25 2024,positive,big fan here of christopher nolan movies and oppenheimer didnt disappoint its amazing to me how the slow intensity builds throughout the movie as the story unfolds and is sky high by the end oppenheimer was a complicated imperfect man that had a huge impact on the world and the world was a morally complicated place  that shown through perfectly in this movie it was a little long on the run time for me though thus half a star away from being five stars
Feb 25 2024,positive,nah thought paul newmans fatman and little boy and fatboy was a better film overrated
Feb 25 2024,positive,i felt more intelligent after watching this cinematography was beautiful robert downey jr was incredible cilian murphys cheekbones are wild on a cinema screen
Feb 25 2024,negative,just a lot of nothing  why was this so long i would have been livid to have tried to watch this in theatres
Feb 25 2024,positive,i loved this movie  ive watched it four times and it still hits  just awesome casting and cinematography
Feb 24 2024,negative,really awful and very disappointing given all the hype and awards similar to tenet also directed by nolan in that it felt like i was watching a trailer for the film rather than the film itself the entire film is one long montage sequence mumbled dialogue and incessant loud overbearing and mawkish music it must have been edited by a committee who thinks that the public cannot understand nuance it is obviously aimed at the lowest common denominator which suggests that the producers believe that the viewing audience are generally ignorant of history
Feb 24 2024,positive,biopics tend to have a ceiling on how interesting they can be this one transcended that ceiling with great storytelling techniques
Feb 24 2024,positive,one of the best movie of the last few years it keeps you on the edge of your seat for 3 hours some much is happening even tho its low on action
Feb 24 2024,positive,this movie is well made and well acted but the story is a mess the timeline isnt addressed well and the flow is not there if this is what people consider the best movie of 2023 it just demonstrates how mediocre to bad 2023 was
Feb 24 2024,positive,it was an eyeopener for me a bit dragging but entertaining nonetheless
Feb 24 2024,positive,sex scenes were gratuitous and lots of pandering to the commies but otherwise interesting and well done
Feb 24 2024,negative,boring and confusing   the story is great and interesting and very important the acting and filming are magnificent now how to make movie out of this great story pretty simple  film it cut the film in 35 minutes pieces and show them in random order and let viewers guess which time is it who are these people and whats going on what is the best way to have viewers confused and disoriented if it was the purpose of film director he did a great job
Feb 24 2024,positive,its awesome as a history movie i was really entertained with the theorys and everything great job
Feb 24 2024,positive,overall a worthy film with great performances from murphy blunt and downy jr but a well put together cast carries some of the confusing time jumps the start of the film is fragmented and takes time to find its groove it was in danger of losing the audience until it gathered pace and focus about 45 minutes in the inevitable outcome felt a bit delayed and i was wanting the conclusion to be tighter and more expediently delivered to the point that the denouement was a relief rather than a climax overall an enjoyable and well made film that suffered from loose editing and almost losing its way worth watching especially for the outstanding acting performances but the story could have been delivered with better timing and conciseness
Feb 23 2024,positive,excellent movie that lives up to its reputation
Feb 23 2024,positive,the movie was great it had over the top acting cinematography especially with the imax recording cgi and overall beautiful and amazing movie but i will say the movie was quite boring and too complicated but overall an amazing and great acting
Feb 23 2024,positive,very entertaining movie actors were very good cillian murphy and robert downey jr were phenomenal as usual
Feb 22 2024,positive,with so many touting this film as a masterpiece i feel compelled to say that while worth the watch it is deeply flawed and far from nolans best its run time wouldnt be an issue if it didnt waste so much of it in unimportant unfocused side quests
Feb 22 2024,positive,whiie i am aware that the 157 jump cuts in between every conversation were in fact a creative choice it was a bad one
Feb 22 2024,negative,i watched 1 hour and 22 minutes slaughter house five deserves a better remake than this
Feb 22 2024,positive,good movie but way too long
Feb 22 2024,positive,fantastic movie that i will likely only watch once more purely due to how it makes me feel when its all done
Feb 22 2024,positive,great pacing the movie does not feel like 3h the bomb scene is majestic but all in all i cant say its a movie ill tell people they have to see or thats it gonna be something i return to cool movie
Feb 22 2024,negative,boring one explosion and 3 hours of talking
Feb 21 2024,negative,the story is great and interesting and very important the acting and filming are magnificent now how to make movie out of this great story pretty simple  film it cut the film in 35 minutes pieces and show them in random order and let viewers guess which time is it who are these people and whats going on what is the best way to have viewers confused and disoriented if it was the purpose of film director he did a great job
Feb 21 2024,negative,would have been a much more movie without the unnecessarily loud constant background music  strained throughout to follow the dialog that was being almost drowned out
Feb 21 2024,negative,so boring  so boring so boring
Feb 21 2024,positive,this likely represents nolans most mature work to date   technically it approaches perfection   the film is overall quite enjoyable and detailed but also slow and verbose in many parts it could easily have been 40 minutes shorter without losing significant content   however the true gem lies in the final 3 minutes which answer lingering questions closing several narrative threads in a solemn and apocalyptic manner that is both existentially suffocating and a commentary on the current geopolitical situation   solely for the ending i awarded an extra star easily one of my favorite endings in cinema history
Feb 21 2024,positive,if you have 3 hours i would definitely recommend it teaches you about people who contributed to the manhattan project even people you have never heard of the movie is slow but good a lot of sex scenes but very high quality its a very long movie but definitely recommend
Feb 21 2024,positive,beautifully done but while i never lost interest it was too long for my tastes  however no screen time was wasted and can see why its winning so many awards
Feb 21 2024,negative,i am starting to seriously wonder about some of these high ratings for movies that just dont garner anything above a 25 on the meter  it was boring and tedious  the plot jumped around and was fragmented with no flow  it could have been a much more captivating film but wasnt  the highlight of the movie was the bomb test at the end  wait until its free and then fast forward to the end
Feb 21 2024,positive,brilliant all around one of the best movies ive seen in years
Feb 21 2024,positive,this film jumps around time like a jack rabbit continuous talking the film is a good reminder that the world still has these terrible weapons i wanted more science than artsy nude scenes  truman is presented as cold hearted even bragging he dropped the bomb twice i thought the film was good at presenting 1940s american values the communism sub plot was confusing and distracting the acting was good but felt like a soap opera at times i never really got the idea of the science behind making the bomb the heart of this film was the truman scene and makes it worth watching sobering  murphy damon and downy were good in the film the ladies pugh and blunt were good too cheers
Feb 21 2024,positive,this movie drew me in from the very beginning and kept my attention until the very end  excellent acting directing and staging
Feb 21 2024,positive,awesome movie  perfect
Feb 21 2024,negative,awful boring disappointed with such a star studded cast
Feb 21 2024,negative,with all the attention and awards nominations and given the cast and director expected this to be pretty good  it was long which would be fine my attention span is fine for a 3 hour movie  but this was incredibly boring and confusing  which i blame the director for  jumps around time actors look too much the same couldnt tell for the most part who was who amongst professors the point was unclear was it just that people did or did not feel guilty building bombs no surprise or news there what did this have to do with strauss and why were we to care  there were some great special effects mostly wasted  youve got a gratuitous sex scene actually twice in the same tryst where maybe the second part with weird quoting of psychobabble made a point and then flo and cillian are  sitting nude in another scene where the dialog was pertinentnudity wasnt maybe more stuff got left on the editing floor but as florence pugh should be upset   at the exploitation  then there is the casting mostly of creepy cillian murphy which were supposed to be creeped out by robert oppenheimer  movie is just a long boring  mess and it rt rating and audience rating is baffling
Feb 21 2024,positive,a flim that shows what hollywood can do when the put there mind to something a truly beautiful movie
Feb 21 2024,positive,such a surprising departure from some of the science fiction based nolan movies this movie was brilliant and very true to history  nolan was still able to put in some eggs for history buffs  the acting was oscar worthy and honest very powerful
Feb 21 2024,positive,movie is alright but overhyped  storytelling could be more thrilling
Feb 20 2024,positive,a great retelling of oppenheimers role in the manhattan project we found the movie was waaay too long could have been shortened and be just as effective
Feb 20 2024,positive,visually stunning cinematographical masterpiece outstanding storytelling this film transported me into a time when communism was seen as a crime physics discoveries were thriving and the world was at war with one of a kind performers and a duotone lens into the lives of these very important set of characters i couldnt stop watching although sometimes it felt a little too long and it definitely is one of the movies of the past year nolan nolan nolan cheers to you
Feb 20 2024,positive,it was a bit too long but still kept my interest throughout all the actors were on their agame with cillian as the standout i suspect hell be holding the oscar soon enough
Feb 20 2024,positive,very good movie loved the educational aspect of how they made the atomic bomb as well
Feb 20 2024,negative,not very good that i thought it had no good character
Feb 20 2024,positive,i missed this the first time round at the cinema but today was rerun hyped and winner of many baftas could have spelt disaster for my expectations but no   i did get a little worried at the beginning when time jumped back and forth and i was getting anxious i was getting lost it didnt take long as my brain got a grip and i was hooked i have seen a few movies recently that the characters lacked depth but nolan has dug deep in developing the cast mind you he had plenty of time to do so as this is a bottom aching length of a movie   the score also needs mentioning as it is a triumph as well as sound the testing of the bomb was beautifully done focusing on oppenheimers breathing silence and then bang very cool  i definitely see why oppenheimer has so far been successful in the awards so far and the dig one is still to come
Feb 20 2024,positive,christopher nolan one of the best movie making oppenheimer it tells a great story of during war making nuclear bombs
Feb 20 2024,negative,overstuffed yet undeveloped in every way each supposed payoff is hinged on thin plotting and cardboard cutout characters this is empty verbosity at its most pretentious and emotionally tone deaf
Feb 20 2024,negative,unpopular opinion but i will be honest  the story could have been told in less time
Feb 20 2024,positive,amazing if you like atomic and nuclear energyreactions and wish to know more about it i do recommend watching might learn something you didnt know yet  it is a serious movie you need to like the topic to even enjoy it
Feb 20 2024,positive,its long but great film about one of the worst choices ever to build or what not to build
Feb 20 2024,positive,this movie is a masterpiece and i find my self going back to watch it all the time the fact that i can stay interested for three hours like i am with this movie is amazing
Feb 20 2024,negative,i turned it off after the first 15 minutes too slow moving the movie about a bomb that is a bomb
Feb 20 2024,positive,a riveting movie the cenimatography was some of the best ive ever seen the acting was amazing and the cast was crazy nolan did amazing the only thing i didnt like was how all over the timelines were
Feb 19 2024,positive,i have mixed feelings about this movie seriously this is not the best movie this year all the acting is superb but the storyline is longwinded and needs high concentration all the time
Feb 19 2024,positive,pretty perfect movie not sure of the accuracy but it doesnt really matter understanding the emotions and motivations were enough
Feb 19 2024,positive,i thought it was very well done to give you a multi faceted view of the drive to create for what was perceived as safeties sake the horror of the creation the hope of humanity for what we would do the devastation of the truth
Feb 19 2024,negative,the movie is a hot mess before watching research lewis strauss vendetta against oppenheimer also learn ahead of watching who the other major players are in the movie its a whole lot of dialog not much on acting
Feb 19 2024,negative,long film it could have the same effect with 130  story without any emotion
Feb 19 2024,positive,the script never misses an opportunity to have a character tell us that oppenheimer is superior to us mere mortals and above the regular rules and expectations of normal society  the film itself is awkwardly pushed together as a series of vignettes superficially conveying information rather than dramatically portraying it the film intends to shove down the throat of the audience that robert oppenheimers clearance to work on classified atomic programs was unjustifiably rescinded and his reputation smeared needlessly all the while an attentive audience may well wonder how it was that he gained such clearance in the first place when fermi was available and the film quietly very quietly observes reasons that oppenheimer might have served better in a more tightly supervised position after the successful detonation of the nagasaki bomb back to the movie itself though it is superficial when it might offered new insight and information  too bad
Feb 19 2024,positive,excessive yapping and some awkward and unnecessary scenes but still holds up in visuals and correctly potraying oppenheimers life
Feb 19 2024,positive,to state the obvious what makes this movie is the main character oppenheimer  oppenheimer is a great leader  a character who is constantly easing other peoples concerns with confidence while also struggling himself with those same concerns later in private  although he is very smart well driven and a great leader he also has his flaws   him and kittys relationship is what brings the whole film together  although the marriage is flawed and has highs and lows in their intimacy and love for each other  in the end they will always have each others back and stand by each others side
Feb 19 2024,positive,very good movie personally always thought the story of oppenheimer would be better as a tv series
Feb 19 2024,negative,really difficult to follow as timeline jumps all over hard to follow who people were unless youre already well versed in the history extremely unnecessary nudity and sex scenes after all the oscar hype i was very disappointed
Feb 19 2024,positive,it was a part of history i never knew about  i enjoyed the movie very much never felt like 3 hours sitting 
Feb 19 2024,negative,like in the movie  get shorty   ive seen better film on teeth 
Feb 19 2024,neutral,the first two hours were ok however they depicted scientists as competitive not empathetic the last hour took an irrational 180 they also depicted truman as a mocking evil man which is far from historical accuracy people watch this movie as education not entertainment  the reviews state as much relying on it for historical accuracy  getting truman so wrong turned us off as the last hour digressed for those of us who study letters journals and histories its interesting that many of these actors protested ai in hollywood in the protests these celebs wanted to prevent companies from using their likenesses in ai now and in the future without permission  yet hypocritically they make a living off the unapproved and often bias likenesses of others without their permission or historical review  this movie is not worth 5 stars
Feb 19 2024,positive,one of the most historic movies in years and we all have to live with the results  lets hope that russia has a moral responsibility and does not follow suit otherwise it could lead to the end of mankind courtesy of mr putin dictator  we only come this way once in this life and there are no trial runs or second chances
Feb 19 2024,positive,a 3 hour long history lesson lots of great actors but the storyline was meh all about how oppenheimer was screwed over award winningwhy ive seen a lot of actors in this film in better films
Feb 19 2024,neutral,hard to follow with multiple time lines i thought it was hard to understand at times due to rapid and slurred speech while its a great story it could have been presented on an easier to follow format and better story line
Feb 19 2024,positive,interesting take on such a famous person who helped shape our world obviously its a movie not a documentary but overall i enjoyed this movie very much great cast and great acting all around
Feb 18 2024,negative,horrible long boring and all over
Feb 18 2024,positive,great film great cast truly entertaining
Feb 18 2024,positive,oppenheimer is a brilliant thought provoking film about a man who has an incredibly complicated life once he created the atomic bomb and ended world war ii he was horrified of the technology he helped create he was afraid that this technology could end the world both the acting and visuals in this film are absolutely incredible and the scene where the atomic bomb was tested was absolutely stunning overall oppenheimer is an absolutely amazing film and is definitely for sure one of the greatest christopher nolan films
Feb 18 2024,positive,this film was worth three hours  the beginning was a bit disjointed  but then it pulled together  murphys performance was exceptional  emily blunt has a great scene as well but i was surprised she was not in the film more  worth watching once  45 stars
Feb 18 2024,positive,cillian murphy and christopher nolan are a match made in heaven
Feb 18 2024,positive,absolutely fantastic  i hope it sweeps the oscars
Feb 18 2024,positive,totally awesome actors are amazing subject matter is crazy and protruding very honestly  id recommend it to anyone
Feb 18 2024,positive,a strong cast making the heavy plot move forward personally i am more interested in the after story of the nuclear bomb but it was not the focus of the movie    regardless a really good movie to see
Feb 18 2024,negative,little to no character development so i did not care about what was happening to oppenheimer or his wife revealing that rdj was behind the persecution of oppy like it was the climax a murder mystery was laughable the plot was far too jumbled and their relationship too tenuous for me to care about downeys motivations  usual nolan inaudible dialogue thanks to the overwhelming score   utter waste of florence pughs talent
Feb 18 2024,neutral,overrated its a structural mess  its hard to follow not because its smart but because of its choppy structure and poor character development its hard to be immersed in a story that cuts and jumps so often always punctuated by an obtrusive soundtrack and its as if all the characters are made of paper as seen through oppenheimers eyes they are just things that happen to him its too plotdriven to be the character study it sometimes tries to be it needed to slow down and pick a lane it lacks the epic storytelling prowess of killers of the flower moon and lacks the deftness and heart of the holdovers making it no better than the 3rd best movie of 2023
Feb 18 2024,positive,i found oppenheimer to be an impressive and towering work of cinema as a nolan fan i think it important that great directors stretch themselves and risk failure in a bid to produce ever greater works held together by the directors original vision   in this respect the serious historical subject of the doomsday machine the destroyer of worlds was a great opportunity for nolan to take his filmography to even more ambitious heights this was not an opportunity lost nolan nailed it and he rose to the occasion even when oppenheimer sometimes felt a bit too tedious to commit to     pugh who is still all the rage once again delivered a flat performance and i cannot understand her widespread appeal thank goodness for emily blunt and of course murphy who was great in the lead role
Feb 18 2024,positive,an absolutely incredible movie i have not seen acting on this high of a level since good night and good luck with david strathairn and all those who acted with him this is as well done as i think a movie can be  thank you
Feb 18 2024,positive,good lordthe music was so overpowering and overdone that it made 3 hours a test of resilience good acting and i learned a lot
Feb 18 2024,negative,are you kidding me the movie was awful first time ive ever seen cliff notes turned into a movie i watched the first hour and couldnt stand it anymore the pace was so accelerated it felt like i was watching one long trailer i didnt care about any of the characters the plot was boring maybe there was some good acting in there somewhere but who cared enough to notice academy award do t insult my intelligence
Feb 18 2024,negative,i love the idea of the movie but this is a jumbled mess it bounces all over the place so hard to fallow anything in this movie it seems like the director was on some serious drugs i dont mind movies that have flashbacks but this is just ridiculous its so hard to keep track of whats happening and when
Feb 18 2024,positive,one of the best movies of the 21st century in depth historical character study of one of the most famous person to ever live
Feb 18 2024,neutral,this overly long film was diminished by having so many famous actors in the title roles and certainly did not deserve the hype there was too much jumping around for my taste an average film about an incredible event and time in history the soundtrack was wonderful but i fast forwarded through several parts that were just space fillers and still got the points
Feb 17 2024,positive,outstanding in every regard a cinematic masterpiece the sound design is one of the greatest in cinema history but what most critics overlooked is the magnificent score by ludwig g√∂ransson robert downey jr is magnificent as the antagonist strauss the cinematography is superb
Feb 17 2024,negative,didnt like this movie at all  looonnggg kind of boring considering the extraordinary actors
Feb 17 2024,positive,excellent movie definitely worth 5 stars i like this movie because it gives you an idea of what oppenheimer emotionally had to go through in the creation of the bomb and after they were dropped i highly recommend seeing this movie not a good movie for children to see because of nudity and sexual scenes
Feb 17 2024,positive,fine movie but given the amount of time given over to the government hounding of oppenheimer the title could have been changed to the passion of robert oppenheimer
Feb 17 2024,positive,yet again a good interesting and different film with pointless sex and nudity why ruin it
Feb 17 2024,positive,i realize this is a very minority opinion but here it goes i think because this is a film about extraordinary people in extraordinary circumstances the film itself is being mistaken as extraordinary also and i just dont think it is now dont get me wrong  there are awesome inspiring jawdropping moments scattered throughout and i was more appreciative of the film in the last third when some of the supporting characters start getting a chance to shine maybe its my lack of intelligence but the first couple hours were a confusing slog for me to sit through i couldnt keep track of who was who and everyone spoke like they were in a 1940s newspaper comedy i cant help but think those not familiar with the story beforehand are going to be lost i will say this  murphy is outstanding throughout and i wont holler if he wins the best actor oscar downey and blunt do what they can but the roles are not awardsworthy i found blunt particularly underutilized  im so happy she finally has an academy award nomination but i wish it was for something more substantial as i said the last third is what leads me to an overall recommendation the scenes in which oppenheimers loyalty and allegiance are being questioned feel brutal and often heartbreaking and this is where murphy gets to shine brightest technical aspects are unsurprisingly top notch  the sound work is especially amazing i can imagine this being a more overwhelming viewing experience when seen in a theater but right or wrong my thought has always been a good movie is a good movie no matter where youre watching it i sadly cant jump aboard the oppenheimer express but this is an occasion on which i totally understand why others love it and would never question why im glad i watched it and im glad to know more about the subject but i wouldnt call it one of the best of the year  jeff marshall movie blogger facebook
Feb 17 2024,positive,i can honestly say that it is a delight for the human eye everything in this film is perfect the adaptation of an event that marked japan and the united states and the format in which they worked he talked about imax it is an exceptional work all this leads me to say that cristopher nolan is one of the best directors of recent years
Feb 17 2024,positive,sometimes it was a little bloated but it did a really good job of pulling the audience into the suspension and drama of the time despite us knowing what happened
Feb 17 2024,positive,such a well written movie if you dont know a lot about quantum physics youll be a little lost in this movie at time but the overall story keeps you from losing interest i definitely recommend this to everyone
Feb 17 2024,neutral,overall the movie was quite good though i have to admit i in was very disappointed christopher nolan included a couple of nude scenes something ive never seen in a nolan film prior to this one they were pointless and added nothing to the story is it asking too much to he able to watch a movie where everyone keeps their clothes on
Feb 17 2024,negative,perfect movie to fall asleep seriously  i created this account only to write my first review about this movie  thats how bad it was  most pretentious movie ever written its basically one long trial about rather oppi is a communist or not  do not let these good reviews full you  not to mention theres no way you can watched this movie without subtitles  i even read the wikipedia on every character before i watched the movie to get a better understanding and still it bounced around so much with way too many characters  sound was way to loud and the speech was way to soft good acting though
Feb 17 2024,negative,was so looking forward to this movie i just could not get into it important story to tell including ww2 aspect just was too slow and disjointed tbh i fell asleep during middle hour probably win oscar for best movie and maybe others i fell asleep during barbie too but that movie was better slightly
Feb 17 2024,negative,this movie was a waste of 3 hours
Feb 17 2024,positive,overall a good movie that was about an hour too long
Feb 17 2024,positive,this movie was an absolute perfect 10 it should win best picture and nolan best director the cast was phenomenal
Feb 17 2024,negative,horrible movie i have wanted to see this movie for a long time and it was bad it went on way too long and there was so much talking i dont know how anyone can like this movie the cast acted well but there is no saving this movie
Feb 17 2024,negative,when you look up pretentious moviemaking in the dictionary this movie should come up first
Feb 17 2024,positive,i watched this imax gt 70mm film on the premiere night and when i finished the 3 hour monstrosity i went home speechless so i watched it 4 more times in that theater and another standard ratio format playing 70mm and was filled with awe every time i saw it first time i saw it i missed quite a few things and didnt understand some concepts so i worked on my german and relearned basic quantum physics then watched it again to dive deeper into the film this is movie is gonna be studied in film schools in less than a decade from now
Feb 17 2024,positive,loss for words watch the movie its easily in my top 15 films ever watched out the hundreds
Feb 17 2024,positive,too long for my taste but still good
Feb 17 2024,positive,great movie highly recommended a 
Feb 16 2024,positive,great movie i really loved the visuals and the cast there were so many good actors that i recognized and robert downey jr was the best
Feb 16 2024,positive,nothing much to say just a masterpiece movie thats all
Feb 16 2024,positive,this film is a must see for history physics and cinema fans of which i am all three stellar performances are delivered by the cast with the best in my opinion being rdjs fantastic portrayal of lewis strauss which left me in awe due to the raw emotion in line delivery ludwig g√∂rransons score can you hear the music is one of the most beautiful and wondrous pieces of music i have ever heard not just in a film but in general and of course christopher nolans fantastic artistic vision is delivered very well with the narrative raising questions about whether our creations and scientific advancements have become too powerful for us to control and what effect could this have on our earth my one criticism would be that the film is slow at times which would be a given due to its runtime overall a great watch and i highly recommend
Feb 16 2024,negative,surprisingly bad for an acclaimed movie it is very choppy and hard to follow there are way too many characters who are poorly identified and poorly differentiated the acting is good but i was often not sure what particular characters were so excited about having the two love interests look alike is a dumb mistake   oppenheimer himself should have been made at least a slightly sympathetic character he was a self centered jerk most of the time the switching around in time periods was mostly able to be followed but given how garbled most of the plot was it was another negative
Feb 16 2024,positive,oppenheimer directed by the visionary christopher nolan is a cinematic masterpiece that delves into the complex life of j robert oppenheimer and the creation of the atomic bomb garnering widespread anticipation for its profound narrative and nolans signature directorial prowess the film is a monumental addition to the historical drama genre the film unfolds the intricate and morally ambiguous journey of oppenheimer the father of the atomic bomb without divulging crucial plot details it masterfully navigates the tension between scientific innovation and ethical responsibility set against the backdrop of world war ii and the cold wars onset oppenheimer intricately explores themes of power guilt and the consequences of human ambition christopher nolans direction in oppenheimer is nothing short of brilliant his ability to weave complex narratives with emotional depth is on full display offering a nuanced portrayal of oppenheimers life nolans use of practical effects alongside nonlinear storytelling elevates the film immersing viewers in the historical context and the internal turmoil faced by its characters the lead actors portrayal of j robert oppenheimer is a tour de force capturing the scientists brilliance internal conflicts and the weight of his contributions to history supporting performances including those by actors portraying key figures in the manhattan project add richness and complexity to the narrative making the historical figures feel deeply human the cinematography in oppenheimer is breathtaking with each frame meticulously crafted to reflect the eras aesthetic and the storys escalating tension the visual effects used to depict the atomic bombs creation and detonation are both haunting and spectacular serving as a stark reminder of the events gravity the films score and sound design are integral to its storytelling enhancing the emotional resonance and heightening the sense of urgency the music complements the narratives scale from the intimate moments of reflection to the climactic scenes of scientific breakthrough and moral reckoning oppenheimer is a cinematic triumph that solidifies christopher nolans status as one of the most compelling storytellers of our time its a thoughtprovoking film that challenges viewers to consider the complexities of scientific discovery and its impact on humanity with its masterful direction powerful performances and technical excellence oppenheimer earns a welldeserved 5star rating a mustwatch for fans of historical dramas and those intrigued by the moral dilemmas of scientific advancement
Feb 16 2024,positive,if i tried to review this movie it would probably be 40 pages long and id still only be scratching the surface on all the amazing things here i could never properly do this justice and pay full respects to all the brilliance achieved here so ill keep it brief for now besides this everything has already been properly dissected in full glory by now with this movie releasing over 6 months ago    phenomenal writing dialogue casting acting direction sets analog effects with no cgi and sound production    standouts for me were cillian murphy robert downey jr and matt damon but picking just 3 out of a stacked cast who pretty much all gave their very best here is selling the others short its like picking a favorite child    nolans decision to remove all sound at the moment of impact was genius allowing viewers to see this play out with just the lightest of breaths barely audible    my favorite movie seen in 2023 i genuinely hope this cleans up at the oscars    nolans interview on stephen colberts late night show two nights ago was insightful as usual and a must watch for fans of this film or any of his prior works his imax interview afterwards with the director of dune 2 was also terrific    christopher nolan is the premier mastertalent working director in hollywood today next level
Feb 16 2024,negative,it wasnt my cup of tea tbh it was boring to me felt like a history class made me wanna fall asleep but thats just me im not much of a nerd or a history geek to care
Feb 16 2024,positive,disappointed in the unnecessary nudity and sex that lent nothing to the storyline but the rest of the movie is good  terrible how they jacked him so bad after his success  gutwrenching that our government does that to too many people who try to do good things for the nation
Feb 16 2024,positive,as lucky as people who grew up watching albert einstein use his brilliance to chance the world i am equally great full to be in the time of the nolan brothers brilliance
Feb 16 2024,positive,this movie is one that is thoughtful and electrifying a must see
Feb 16 2024,negative,really didnt go into the project at all basically its a personality biopic about oppenheimer himself and not about his genius or anything other than his flaws
Feb 15 2024,positive,just incredible nolan is in top form all the acting is stellar
Feb 15 2024,negative,this film was so boring gave up before the end totally dull  overrated would rather watch paint dry more engaging than this film
Feb 15 2024,positive,love love love this movie im a sucker for historical movies and tv shows that are intense and accurate if you like this movie watch the show chernobyl
Feb 14 2024,positive,the only good movie released in the past few years highly recommend
Feb 14 2024,positive,lives up to the hype murphy is excellent as always
Feb 13 2024,positive,it has it all great characters drama but i think it undermined the real scale of the real story overlooking that it is a great biographicall thriller
Feb 13 2024,positive,gripping from start to end keeping me wellentertained and feeling like i learned a bit more about the world when peak acting and scriptwriting clash masterpieces like these are born though it is extremely heavy on the dialogue and is a long movie so it might not be for everyone
Feb 13 2024,positive,honestly margock roby was kind of overated in this hole thing ofc still hit tho  ken too holly cow like that ryan reynolds guy dos not mis gyat acting up frfr  give it a solid 2ax2  bx  c  america ferreira voice got my want to jump off the eiffel tower and eat some gotdang bigets    still hit tho
Feb 13 2024,negative,three times i started this movie three times i turned it off thankful i never went to the theater to suffer through this dreadfully bad movie save yourself the struggle no matter what the critics had already decided this movie would be even before release this thing is god awful
Feb 12 2024,positive,great movie but i doubt it should win best picture soon we will watch it again with subtitles  however it is choppy with too many flashbacks ruining continuity cillian shouldve also been nominated for an oscar yet it could be because his character wasnt multifaceted  oppenheimer himself deserved better treatment by the government he dutifully served
Feb 12 2024,positive,a compelling story with a magnificent soundtrack
Feb 12 2024,positive,boring as hell the movie shouldve been  2 hours shorter to convey what is important but is a convoluted story that dragged out in a way that my wife an i dozed off a couple of times til the end
Feb 12 2024,positive,some good visuals and acting but the first nolan film id say ill never watch again and ive seen tenet 3x
Feb 11 2024,positive,outstanding  you have to experience it in the true imax format
Feb 11 2024,positive,i really liked the script for this film the facts told out of chronological order were very well linked making the narrative exciting at all times despite this i had difficulty understanding who several characters were as most of them looked very similar and didnt appear long enough for the brain to record their appearance the scene of the leaders choosing from a list which city would be bombed was stomachchurning but in the end the film managed to convey reasonably the idea that creating the bomb was something horrible
Feb 11 2024,positive,ive watched it so many times and cant believe how interesting it is and how much drama came out of this both during the creation and after amazing beautiful performances from everyone
Feb 11 2024,positive,this movie is incredible christopher nolan is just a top notch director who gives everything his 100 best and this movie is no exception the cast is starstudded and the writing directing production editing cinematography everything was just top notch absolutely phenomenal film
Feb 10 2024,positive,absolute perfection i can watch this over and over and i still pick up on new things every time its just pure entertainment and filmmaking at its absolute finest
Feb 10 2024,negative,the acting was horrid every other sentence was theory can only take you so far the movie felt rushed and not well played out the history behind this movie is rich  amazing but the actual movie was poorly thought out 
Feb 10 2024,positive,absolutely awesome movie learnt all about the history of the hydrogen bomb and cillian murphy was the perfect choice as lead
Feb 10 2024,positive,one of the best movies of 2023
Feb 10 2024,negative,i dont get it this movie made tons of money awards and people love it i like nolan movies so i wanted to like this one i turned it off 23 way thru to long to boring not very interesting and not really entertaining like i said i dont get it to each his own but for me and my wife were not a fans of this one 
Feb 9 2024,negative,one of the biggest disappointments of my movie life  as i really liked nolan movies  the entire movie feels like montage of 2 minutes scenes where we barely establish who is who and what is happening so no time for actually quality dialogue   and scenes are like flashbacks to an interview that refers to an interview that talks about discussion about communists  i hoped it would be more like in better call saul when they were building the meth lab and challenge of it or the hummingbird projec where they were making fiber optic line to do stock trading 1ms faster  its not  its not about engineering difficulties its about oppenheimer being lefty and for unions and his infidelity and about guvernmant daring to investigate him and its a such a badly paced movie this is probably the worst highly rated movie i ever seen
Feb 9 2024,positive,great movie its an incredible telling of oppenheimer and the story of the atomic bomb although it was a long movie i still was invested throughout the movie
Feb 9 2024,positive,masterpiece christopher nolans magnum opus is a true crowning acheivement for his directing and writing cillian murphy as oppenheimer is perfectly cast and he kills it in fact the whole cast is remarkable robert downey jr is disturbingly kinetic in his portrayal of luis strauss the score for this film is outstanding the editing is nerve rackingly superb the production design is exquisite and apparently exceptionally accurate this film plays like a horror movie in the 3rd act and it is indeed haunting as hell oppenheimer himself clearly was a troubled soul with a burden no other man in history came close to having to bear according to this material if nolan must get this directing oscar for this film
Feb 9 2024,positive,absolutely amazing nothing more to say
Feb 9 2024,negative,lazy writing boring pretentious adhd paced and still somehow unnecessarily long runtime in 3 hours we still know so little about the characters what really makes them tick their motivations beyond these straw man depictions verbose sentences and unnatural conversation the type of people who like this film are the kind of people that feel like somehow it makes them smart the whole thing feels like a scattered brain skit glad i only rented on amazon and even then i wish i could request my 599 back
Feb 8 2024,positive,this is a nolan flick which means simply if you love his movies you will think this is his best movie especially for biopics  first 2 hours is a time jumping biopic the last hour turns into a drama thriller that comes out of no where i thought it was excellent    however  im hearing a lot of non nolan lovers hating the film siting its boring and couldnt keep track of everything    again this flick is for true nolan fans caution to reg peeps it will go over your head
Feb 8 2024,positive,nolan creates another great movie
Feb 8 2024,positive,christopher nolans visual magic has entered a new level  a multilayered structure that is intelligent handsome and full of metaphors  two climaxes in different chronological order intertwine and the excitement and tension of the audience reaches its peak
Feb 8 2024,positive,excellent story excellent acting a great portrayal of american history the good and the bad
Feb 7 2024,positive,i expected a lot as there was a lot of hype around the film but for me it was just ok
Feb 6 2024,positive,its as good as it gets
Feb 6 2024,positive,a truly instant classic epic film great perfoamces throughout and a great story
Feb 6 2024,positive,oppenheimer  93  so changing it up a bit and doing a review for a movie here because of all the hype behind this one i had the pleasure of seeing this a day before the premiere and got a sneak peak of all the madness so to start it definitely lives up to the hype and i would highly recommend checking this one out imax 70mm is the ideal format but i would say that seeing it regardless of imax or not is still worth it my biggest knock on the whole thing is the length yes i was thoroughly enjoying the entire movie but 3 hours is still 3 hours it really does feel like a long movie but at times i would check my watch and be hyped knowing i still had an hour left  the storyline was really interesting and i really learned a lot from the movie realizing i knew nothing of this going in the biggest dumbfound i learned was that albert einstein lived in this era for some reason i assumed he was so much older the cast is simply phenomenal the biggest names of the biggest names all took the stage and really delivered cillian murphy has to be a mortal lock to win the oscar for best actor he took this role to the next level robert downing jr as the best supporting actor looks like it might have punched its oscars ticket as well visually this movie is by far the best of the year and one of the best movies of this decade this was a true cinematic experience christopher nolan simply does not miss  even with it being a based on true events it still had a thriller feel to it with how all the events unfolded this movie really ends with a bang and is one i highly recommend booking your tickets to asap movie special official sundaynightstreaming rating of 93
Feb 6 2024,positive,hard subject but wonderful and interesting must see
Feb 6 2024,negative,was very excited to see and was very disappointed acting was good but story long and boring and choppy
Feb 5 2024,positive,well done   good period piece
Feb 5 2024,negative,this movie easily could have been an hour and a half i think i took 4 separate bathroom breaks and somehow didnt miss a thing
Feb 5 2024,positive,the only one question that was bothering me during this film is  what happened to emily blunt face
Feb 5 2024,positive,like most of nolans work this film has a pulse and its impossible to look away there are some slight stumbles in the third act but it doesnt overshadow an excellent film
Feb 5 2024,positive,absolutely brilliant amazing cast and performances artful script and direction  geniuslevel  movie making i didnt think hollywood was capable of making a classic but here you have it we watched it over two days online
Feb 5 2024,negative,this site is exhausting i was totally looking forward to this film and made it halfway through before shutting it off due to boredom and trying to follow the script the scenes are flashy and choppy and visually difficult to follow along are all the other reviewers related to people who made this movie
Feb 5 2024,positive,excellent acting cinematography and story made you reflect and think about tomorrow
Feb 4 2024,positive,i loved it the story telling was great and just amazing to watch
Feb 4 2024,positive,very complicated story told well
Feb 4 2024,positive,had the benefit of covering an extremely interesting historical topic and hits the mark cillian murphy was a great choice his very essence seems to be complicated and so was oppenheimer the movie was actually remarkably straightforward for a christopher nolan film though they did make a up a few things a lot of the einstein stuff to tie the story together nicely
Feb 3 2024,negative,boring as hell and a waste of time
Feb 3 2024,positive,the history of this movie is what impresses me the most the little intricacies are amazing 
Feb 3 2024,positive,the movie was better than i expected i thought between barbie and oppenheimer the first one wins in my top but expectations was wrong amazing biopic cinematography music editing
Feb 3 2024,positive,yes the film is long and take its time overall but to be honest i didnt felt the time passed inside the theater the photography of the film is beautiful and the cast perfect
Feb 3 2024,positive,oppenheimer is a very good biopic and deserves all the accolades it has received and will receive in the future cillian murphy is mesmerising in the lead role ably supported by a host of solid supporting cast including robert downey jnr matt damon florence pugh emily blunt gary oldman josh hartnett and many others well worth the long run timeanother classic from the master storyteller christopher nolan
Feb 2 2024,positive,i thought it was a fantastic historical movie however i thought it was a bit too long and at times i wasnt sure what was going on as the plot was slightly confusing
Feb 2 2024,positive,prefer my movies to be entertaining  everyone i have spoken to about this movie had the same response i didit was okay
Feb 2 2024,positive,the reason why i didnt give it a full 5 star was because it is not my typical kind of movie and it did feel a bit slow at times but the way the movie was shot and acted was so good there was one scene i just watched 5 times over because it was acted so well i am glad i pushed myself to watch this movie and i hope others will do the same this was by far my favourite movie of the oscars this year
Feb 2 2024,positive,heavy material obviously and a lengthy runtime but absolutely engrossing
Feb 2 2024,positive,excellent movie would definitely watch it again very informational  intriguing made me want to dive into the story of j robert oppenheimer
Feb 2 2024,negative,too long about 1 to 15 hours too long didnt stick with the subject matter at hand a bunch of hype thats for not no way i could have watched this at the theater it took me two days to watch this at home
Feb 1 2024,positive,very good film great performance from cillian murphy although can feel lengthy to watch
Feb 1 2024,positive,smart visuallycaptivating enthralling great movie
Feb 1 2024,positive,simply spectacular one of my favorite films by nolan yet
Feb 1 2024,positive,perfect oppenheimer is perfect amazing visuals scenery cinematography oppenheimer looked good but as it was a biographical picture i was wary but after watching i immediately bought the 4k version knowing id rewatch it and watch it in its best version do yourself a favor and watch this movie
Feb 1 2024,positive,great scriptexcellent acting
Feb 1 2024,positive,as elite of a film can be
Jan 31 2024,negative,i could not get into the story because oppenheimer as portrayed in the movie was not likable or remotely fascinating the director seemed to have so much to say about the main character he tried to cover his lifes key points and failed to show who he was was oppenheimer more of a tiny piece of a gigantic system that was tweaked and fondled by power and desires or was he a lone fighting scientist pursuing his idea and ended up creating a bomb that could destroy the whole world or was he a mere man who had no clue what to do with his life after watching the movie i still dont have a clue what this movie was all about it is certainly not about the atomic bomb if it were he wouldve spent all three hours or more on how it was developed as we can see from the title this was a docudrama about a brilliant man who happened to be in the period when all the worlds superpowers wanted to compete and dominate the world scene if that was what the director intended to do he did but then he didnt have to show so much of the development of the atomic bomb which in this movie became a mere background unfortunately that was the most fascinating part of the movie and other issues communist involvement trials and such became flat they didnt become anything beyond a courtroom drama we had seen many times in the end the director perhaps was oppenheimer in making this film he thought he knew what he was going to do but was lost somewhere in the middle and blown up by the power of the bomb he created
Jan 31 2024,positive,excellent acting i learned a few things i did not know and enjoyed it enough to see it twice
Jan 31 2024,positive,lots of talent put to good use
Jan 31 2024,positive,just go see it in the biggest theater you can this is an explosive movie in every sense
Jan 31 2024,positive,christopher nolan cementing himself as one of the greatest filmmakers of our generation
Jan 30 2024,positive,a mustsee movie and this is coming from someone who generally does not like bio pics the cinematography and writing and chemistry all are superb went in to the theater with high expectations and was not disappointed at all this is a star studded cast and everyone earned their place and did this story justice standout performance in this film really goes to emily blunt who takes what could have come across as a onedimensional background character and makes her leap from the screen like an actual person she eviscerated ate left  no crumbs conquered
Jan 30 2024,negative,it was just ok for me fell asleep through the first third of the movie and had to restart it which sucked because its a 3 hour movie it was good and definitely not great thats for sure best part was a naked florence pugh and even she isnt that hot pretty strong acting all around but was just boring
Jan 30 2024,positive,as you would expect from christopher nolan a phenomenal movie with a fitting and beautiful soundtrack casting is amazing visuals are beyond perfect a movie you can easily watch many times over
Jan 30 2024,positive,riveting  the film was excellent
Jan 30 2024,positive,thought provoking yet confusing at times 
Jan 30 2024,positive,yep a quality film    oppenheimer lived up to the billing to me not that that was ever really in any doubt with christopher nolan at the helm and cillian murphy in lead alongside all the acclaim that i have seen this receive since its 2023 release the near 3hr run time is no problem whatsoever despite more talk than anything else the film simply doesnt hold any slowuninteresting moments  tis all fascinating    ever since i found out about his casting i knew murphy would deliver a sensational performance and thats exactly what he produces here which is not even a tiny bit surprising  anyone who has seen televisions peaky blinders for one would know that loved every single second of him onscreen    as for the rest of the cast where do you start emily blunt is impressive again not a shock as im a fan of her from other things  shoutout the adjustment bureau matt damon stars alongside blunt in that aforementioned great flick he himself is very good in this robert downey jr shows quality too all others have much less screentime but do a fair bit with it for example jason clarke and florence pugh    it was impossible not to be fully engrossed in this at least for me it is not my favourite nolan movie inception and interstellar surpass but to be honest its the definition of splitting hairs as his films are of such a high standard for example dunkirk and tenet move me less but are still ones i rate highly    final words on this watch it if you get the opportunity one of the big uns
Jan 29 2024,positive,waiting for a lot of oscars to this movie
Jan 29 2024,positive,incredible experience first time seeing a movie in 70mm imax format this is an absolute must for all film lovers this is my second watchthrough of oppenheimer and i would argue it was better than my first
Jan 29 2024,positive,well written and very well done
Jan 29 2024,negative,fixated on avenging a wrong corrected by history instead of what youd expect to see in a movie called oppenheimer having watched the movie and read more than most about the manhattan project i still have to look up the name of his nemesis lewis strauss chair of the atomic energy commission aec add to it the unnecessary jarring sex scene it leaves out the most instrumental scientists to stick to a vindictive narrative
Jan 29 2024,positive,i liked the music overall being surround sound however im confused as to why the dissociate from the movie was not
Jan 29 2024,positive,my 5th time watching the movie still the best
Jan 29 2024,positive,it is a very good and an interesting movie
Jan 28 2024,positive,i loved this well written acted  directed movie interesting and visually beautiful some of the later seems were a bit lengthy but its a great film that deserves an oscar
Jan 28 2024,neutral,its okay cilian murphy was quite incredible and a good fit for this role i however didnt enjoy the premise of innocence and vulnerability of his character he knew what he was doing in creating an abomb not sure why he was so surprised when it was used unjustifiably so his naivety seemed contrived and he is culpable to some extent
Jan 28 2024,positive,while the individual actors were excellent the film lacked real dramatic tension and the choppy timeline was detrimental to the narrative a good film never fails to actually tell the story  the focus on the rather dull and unexplained post war hearings drew away from the real interest of the development of the bomb and oppenheimers ambivalence towards the destruction it would wreak  any cinematic opportunities offered by the new mexico settings were not taken and the movie was visually very dull   moments that could have really provided some drama  such as the detonation sequence  were spoiled by the intrusively loud and inapt music score that with its scraping violin and cello lines effectively scratched out any dramatic tension as well as the dialogue  a great tale poorly told
Jan 28 2024,negative,the first three quarters of the movie had a strange pace it felt more like a trailer than a movie the background music was terrible i honestly dont know what they were thinking with the screechy violin i almost shut it off a few times because of that    the acting was okay nothing special lots of famous faces im sure it cost a small fortune    the best part of the movie was the end with oppenheimers security trial and the senate confirmation hearings if they had stuck mostly to that it would have been much better    of course this is an important story what they unleashed on the world is horrendous and we just dont learn our damn lessons as humans so we need to keep being reminded the abuses of power orchestrated by a foolish man imagining slights should be something we recognize that we should not give these people power yet the populace votes them in because they are easily manipulated    i honestly would rather have listened to a podcast on the story than this movie it didnt draw me in at all and i dont quite understand what they were trying to get across i can guess at the obvious things
Jan 28 2024,negative,pompeous wayy too long could have done the same in 2hrs boring
Jan 28 2024,negative,the soundtrack on the prime video version was distracting overwhelming at times and drowned out the dialogue much of the time making it virtually unwatchable perhaps the theatrical release was acceptable giant disappointment here ended up turning it off  looking forward to reading the book in quiet solitude
Jan 28 2024,positive,definitely going to be an award winner
Jan 28 2024,negative,a fascinating time in american history with interesting historical figures hollywood turns a 30 minute documentary into a 3 hour movie that drones on and on and on and on
Jan 28 2024,positive,the movie was very thoughtprovoking
Jan 27 2024,positive,rated r because of the communist bewbswhich are sahwheat  theres also something about a bomb or building one i dont know
Jan 27 2024,positive,it was an interesting story but you wait for the climax of the bomb exploding and it wasnt shown
Jan 27 2024,positive,this movie must win the oscars
Jan 27 2024,positive,the first hour which introduced many characters was confusing and hard to follow the acting was exceptional the last hour was riveting however the movie was too long
Jan 27 2024,negative,omg literally this is the first ever movie review ive written  and the reason for that is because of the build up and hype around this movie i really needed to leave my thoughts  i honestly love rdj hes a genius and cillian murphy is fantastic too and the rest of the cast are all renown big actors in hollywood i so wanted to like this film but i really couldnt get into to it i found it extremely hard to follow and so drawn out way too much dialogue which there is no way you could follow unless your studying quantum physics yes its beautifully shot and the acting is fantastic as you would expect from such talented actors  but putting that aside i really found it difficult to watch the whole thing  really disappointed as really wanted to love it 
Jan 26 2024,positive,a must watch for any follower of history  its not perfect in its telling but it beautiful to watch
Jan 26 2024,positive,not many movies i can say its worth watching   but once in awhile we get a gem like this  outstanding story telling  must see 
Jan 26 2024,negative,i probably would have loved it but i had a hard time hearing the dialogue  the music was so very loud that it drowned out the actors  maybe theyll reissue it someday with an adjustment and ill try it again
Jan 26 2024,negative,this film is boring hard to hear at times hard to follow and i felt no connection to any of the characters stopped watching an hour in
Jan 25 2024,positive,what more can be said about this movie that hasnt already been said by everyone in a world in which we increasingly turn our backs on the fundamental questions and reflections that terrify us most oppenheimer forces us to face all this and guides us on a journey into the turmoil of a character whose anguish in the end becomes the same of the spectator the overwhelming technical perfection is just the tip of the iceberg of this monumental work which has the merit of not only being one of the very few examples of impeccability in the history of cinema but above all a warning for humanity in the years to come
Jan 25 2024,positive,my all time favourite film  high tension drama about a complex and interesting historical figure
Jan 25 2024,positive,christopher nolan makes another incredible movie every film of his has just been awesome the testing of the nuke will leave you speechless
Jan 25 2024,positive,i can understand why it was nominated for an oscar but there were just too many scenes that i was wished they had shortened or cut altogether if you like quantum physics and communism youll love it
Jan 25 2024,positive,going into the cinema to watch oppenheimer knowing the run time and the subject matter i was not excited then i emerged nealry 4hrs later shellshocked mind blown and eger to watch again
Jan 25 2024,neutral,literally just 3 hours of talking edited like a joe rogan podcast horrendously tedious and boring
Jan 25 2024,positive,this was the best movie ive seen in a long time it is most definitely worth watching
Jan 24 2024,neutral,long movie to tell a short story 
Jan 24 2024,positive,i wasnt a huge fan of the filming style but it was definitely different good movie 
Jan 24 2024,positive,this is a great complexed story with great storytelling it is interesting all the way through i loved every minute of the film cillian murphy is glorious as oppenheimer
Jan 24 2024,positive,too long and seems to skip past the actual science and detailed development of the a bomb itself didnt think film measured upto the hype
Jan 23 2024,neutral,great poster for the film too bad the film itself was a mumbling mess every single person in this film showed zero facial expression its like the actors were all botoxed so that their faces were too frozen to move add the fact that the dialogue was barely above a whisper the storyline was jumbled i shouldnt have had to work that hard to figure out who was who there were some pretty pictures but i want my three hours back
Jan 23 2024,positive,this would be hundred times better in modern day depending out which country a 1000 times better
Jan 23 2024,negative,too much pathos for one person  the film tries to keep you in suspense that shouldnt be there  again they try to make a film out of a biography for mass consumption
Jan 23 2024,positive,saw this in an imax theater  great visuals ear splitting sound excellent film
Jan 23 2024,positive,finally a movie for adults i loved this movie
Jan 23 2024,negative,accuracy  was ok  set design costumes  very good  acting  very good though matt damon seemed the wrong actor for his character he doesnt come off as a army leader at all here    cons  like the later movie pearl harbor they hollywoodized it making it into a love story istead of a factual documentary about the man and the bomb  this could have a been a highly relevent great movie instead it is typical formulaic hollywood rubbish  making perhaps the most important subject in mans history about sex is so ridiculously silly it is sad they resorted to such a low but hey that is hollywood sanitized completely missed the point on the importance of his work the man himself the times we were in what it mean to the us and eventually all mankind all that was glazed over to make this a love story  if you care about history in the least this is an awful depiction of the man the times the challenges and ultimately the results
Jan 23 2024,positive,its a christopher nolan movie that should be enough for you to go to the theatre and check it out   i thoroughly enjoyed this movie it may be long but if thats not your thing then dont bother   that will just make you rate it on here with a low score haha
Jan 23 2024,positive,great movieamazing theaterscreen  the audio is just incredible we drove 3 hours each way from columbus oh to see oppenheimer in imax 70mm and would definitely do it again
Jan 23 2024,positive,nolan never disappoints amazing cast
Jan 22 2024,neutral,another overly slow and underwhelming nolan outing he must be sucking the right cocks in hollywood i assume oscar worthy  absolute joke literally passes the time but i lost interest in various areas skips over an awful lot on this subject too it neednt have been so drab but i think all nolans  films are massively overrated to be honest
Jan 22 2024,positive,superb excellent story directing and cast must see
Jan 22 2024,negative,i was really disappointed in this film especially with all its hype the music overpowered the actors making it hard to understand what they were saying we almost turned the movie off a few times  matt damon just wasnt believable as a colonel  the story was hard to follow most of the movie   it really dragged on and unfortunately was boring
Jan 21 2024,negative,confusing  jumps from scene to scene no context no timeline and nolans no rerecording audio style means i had to turn it off after an hour what a shame
Jan 21 2024,negative,interesting story and well acted but way too long and confusing
Jan 21 2024,negative,the sound is way too present not one dialogue without a strident background noisemusicexplosion it felt like 1 sequence after 1 sequence not really flowing only positive is it made me buy the book to actually find out about oppenheimers life
Jan 21 2024,positive,very interesting history
Jan 21 2024,positive,one of the greatest films ever created every shot is masterful this is an apotheosis of the film industry as a whole there is nearly nothing this film could dream of improving
Jan 21 2024,positive,the cinematography is amazing and the actors were great it does an excellent job at capturing american prometheus and leaves you having an impending sense of wonder
Jan 21 2024,negative,this movie could have been accomplished in two hours i found it difficult to pay attention the entire time because it moved too slow the acting and technical qualities including the special effects were great but they could have provided a two hour version for the general public and extended version for egos and film geeks i would rather watch a dry 1 hour documentary on the story of oppie and the great scientists of that time
Jan 21 2024,positive,way too long could have been so much better with a little less back story and maybe show more about the bombs and their aftermath  i realize the movie is about the man but its his work that he is remembered for
Jan 21 2024,negative,beyond boring hollywood wants everyone to think this is a good important movie if you like torture go ahead and watch it one of the worst movies ive seen in my lifetime endless muffled dialogue awful
Jan 21 2024,negative,boring long winded communism positively highlighted shut it off
Jan 20 2024,positive,i have seen this film 3 times now in imax and i love it more each time a must see much anticipated and beyond expectation
Jan 20 2024,positive,excellent well acted movie a history lesson fastest 3 hours i ever sat through
Jan 20 2024,negative,the only saving grace is the great performance by cillian murphy otherwise this movie would be zero stars too long boring selfindulgent this movie tried to throw too much into the storyline if not for it being on trend not sure how that happened since i know the majority of the audience did not follow what was going on this would have been a box office flop
Jan 20 2024,positive,its a very good looking film with terrific performances when you can extract the dialogue from the din christopher nolan has buried his characters words in a smothering racket of a soundtrack  again he apparently considers this musical battering a requisite highly artistic flourish i thought after drowning tenet in soundtrack bombast he would surely never do that again and yet here we are more mumbling amid the storm theres always the option of watching a streamed version on tv i suppose there those interested in decipherable dialogue can turn on subtitles
Jan 20 2024,negative,it was too long too many characters too many time periods and too confusing  it perhaps wouldve been a better movie if they had made it a little easier to understand  it wasnt rocket science ha ha ha it was quantum theory  lets be honest did you really understand what was going on  come on everyones talking superfast everyone has a foreign namethere are several characters thrown at you at one time with maybe four lines of dialogue you need to take notes and physics to watch this film and enjoy it everyone keeps talking about the music being over scored heck who had time to notice the music  perhaps the best part was einstein
Jan 20 2024,neutral,christopher nolans oppenheimer a sprawling biopic about the physicist who led the manhattan project is a visually stunning but narratively flawed endeavor that fails to capture the weight of its subject matter while cillian murphy delivers a captivating performance as j robert oppenheimer the films meandering structure intrusive musical score and superficial treatment of historical events leave much to be desired    nolans signature style of nonlinear storytelling is employed to a heavyhanded degree in oppenheimer the film jumps back and forth in time often without clear transitions or context leaving viewers struggling to piece together the narrative this disjointed approach fragments the story and hinders our understanding of oppenheimers journey    adding to the films shortcomings is its incessant grating score the music composed by ludwig g√∂ransson is an overbearing presence throughout often drowning out dialogue and undermining the emotional impact of key scenes the bombastic melodramatic score feels out of place in a film about such a complex and consequential subject    furthermore oppenheimers portrayal of historical events is superficial and sanitized the film glosses over the devastating human cost of the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki offering only fleeting glimpses of the suffering caused by these weapons of mass destruction this lack of depth undermines the films attempt to explore the moral complexities of oppenheimers actions    despite these shortcomings cillian murphy delivers a compelling performance as oppenheimer his portrayal is nuanced and understated capturing the scientists brilliance moral anguish and inner turmoil murphy is the only bright spot in an otherwise underwhelming film    in conclusion oppenheimer is a visually impressive but ultimately disappointing biopic its convoluted narrative intrusive score and superficial treatment of history leave the film feeling hollow and lacking in substance while murphys performance is a standout it is not enough to elevate this overlong and meandering film oppenheimer is worth a watch for those interested in nolans style but it falls short of expectations as a historical biopic
Jan 20 2024,negative,movie couldnt keep up with story  kept jumping back and forth between past and future stories
Jan 20 2024,positive,just a little too nolanny dialogue but other than that it was amazing
Jan 20 2024,positive,this movie is all talk fortunately its compelling wellpaced and masterfully filmed talk
Jan 20 2024,positive,a modern masterpiece that solidifies nolan as the great director of our times murphy and downey give the performances of a lifetime
Jan 20 2024,negative,pretentious as hell and more jewish than a gefilte fish
Jan 20 2024,positive,amazing  the acting by all were superb  wonderful storytelling capturing the intensity of the situation  just incredible to watch
Jan 19 2024,positive,excellent casting the story was solid and was needed to be told to the mass without giving up its truth
Jan 19 2024,positive,best movie i saw this year masterpiece that deserves all the awards coming its way
Jan 18 2024,negative,bro i wanted a movie about nukes there was one zoomed in nuke i have seen more nukes in my toilet after a kebab and that still had better visuals    overall disappointed it was just my man waffling however there was some boobies so i cant say the movie was all bad boobswin
Jan 18 2024,negative,if you dont know anything goi8ng in its the hardest more randomly put together movie ive ever seen even knowing some history me and my dad stopped watching it had the chance to be good and they butchered it with how it cuts ever 10 seconds to poorly scripted scenes explaining nothing   terrible
Jan 18 2024,positive,a smart watch murphy is probably oscar odds on
Jan 18 2024,positive,loved this movie superb acting across the board downey blunt murphy everyone was first class adult dialogue no spoon feeding of plot motivations and twists and simply a seriously good grown ups movie the soundtrack in the cinema literally shakes your seat at times and i bought this on blu ray the week it was released to enjoy it again at home best movie of 2023 in my viewand its not even close
Jan 18 2024,positive,one of the best films ive ever seen  so many great performances  great casting  beautifully written  i hope the people who did this work found it as rewarding as i felt my time was spent watching it  i am eager to view it again  cillian murphy rdjr and emily blunt were completely convincing and excellent  some of the smaller roles were stunning josh hart  nett hopefully we will keep seeing more of him jason clarke i hated mr robb and that was because of jasons work  so good rami malek omg his hill giving testimony was a favorite scene in this film of so many great scenes and an actor i dont recall seeing before alden ehrenreich i rewatched the ending just to see his expressions as he dealt with strauss again he was perfect  i hope everyone gets to enjoy this monument of a movie
Jan 18 2024,negative,boring boring boring
Jan 17 2024,positive,fantastic movie from beginning to end this movie does not miss a beat some truly great performances
Jan 17 2024,positive,second viewing and first on imax of an epic film by christopher nolan who crafted a terrifically detailed script and directed a stellar cast in a monumental biopic 
Jan 17 2024,positive,the best movie i have ever seen the visuals are stunning and the acting is the best ever
Jan 17 2024,positive,you can only give a good film a good rating butits without doubt at least half an hour if not 45 minutes too long it was a pretty gripping thing until the test bomb went off then it slows down a bit and does an early death worthy of the hype nonetheless very late in getting round to watching but was lucky they still had a viewing at greenwich picturehouse cinema today
Jan 17 2024,negative,i liked nothing about this movie especially the nonstop and utterly awful sountrack that didnt correspond at all with the action and drowned out the dialogue i turned on the subtitles thinking that would help but it soon struck me that the dialogue was intentionally drowned out because it was so bad  cillian murphys face was another problem for me the guy appears to have had a fair amount of cosmetic surgery including an eyebrow lift that made his eyes weirdly open and creepy the limited range of his acting didnt make up for it  but whats worse this movie was a disjointed mess and incredibly shallow in its focus on opps security clearance being reviewed like this was a deep earthshaking matter never mind this very privileged guy was a key player in the gruesome murder of  thousands of innocent children and noncombatants at the end of ww2  at a time when the war was basically already won there was a huge moral issue to delve into here but completely ignored in order to dwell on basically nothing nolan makes another uninspiring movie that manages to retell an amazing historical event in the most cold boring and pretentious way possible
Jan 17 2024,positive,ok so this was an awesome lesson on the atomic bomb hiroshima and historic us and european scientists good acting easy to follow no shocks but enough to keep the interest up brilliant cast great shots overall a good movie to watch but not amazing fall off your seat kind of movie im thinking the fanfare is about the cast more than the film
Jan 17 2024,positive,watched it four times now probably one of the greatest movies i will ever see
Jan 17 2024,negative,long wordy boring this plodding three hours of tedious entertainment was excruciating if you can last this out youre made of sterner stuff than me
Jan 17 2024,positive,nolans flashbacks didnt help much in defining a climax for the movie  it flows like a documentary though interesting did not make for a very entertaining or surprising movie
Jan 16 2024,positive,the merge of different timelines into a coherent narrative is really impressive
Jan 16 2024,positive,oppenheimer a searing historical drama about an important yet complicated man is a masterfully crafted character study and an intelligent analysis on impact and consequences
Jan 16 2024,positive,i had to watch 3xs until i stayed awake long enough to get through it once i did it was good but much too long with not enough going on to hold your attention as much as i love cillian murphy he was too flat for me in this
Jan 16 2024,negative,painfully oversimplified absolutely not recommended to those who have a more than elementary knowledge of atomic physics
Jan 16 2024,positive,a bit too long and drawn out the science was interesting but there is a lot of longwinded dialogue
Jan 16 2024,positive,sorry for thinking too late i just didnt know what to say haha but this christopher nolan film is very good hardworking and with the best actors  their work and everything they have done to last 3 hours haha the effects the bomb lights all  the story of scientist jrobert oppenheimer cillian murphy  it is the best scientist story i have ever seen but everything impressed me the best movie by christopher nolan and the actors
Jan 16 2024,positive,powerful steady intensity start to finish did not feel too long
Jan 16 2024,positive,overall a good movie i found most of the acting a bit flat at times with little character development and too many characters robert downing jr was amazing and stole the show oppenheimers internal struggle really didnt translate on the screen for me maybe if they spent less time on the investigation and more time focused on oppenheimers internal struggle i would have had more of a connection to him and his plight except for a few minor scenes his conflict seemed a bit too cerebral and detached to me perhaps befitting a dignified academic and man of science but harder to identify with  i found the pace of the movie slow and i watched with little emotion until we learned who had betrayed oppenheimer the final dialogue between oppenheimer and einstein was really poignant and thought provoking on many levels the music was so overpowering that the dialogue often seemed muffled the sex scenes seemed gratuitous to me in this particular movie
Jan 16 2024,positive,amazingly done acting was superb best ive seen in a long time
Jan 15 2024,positive,good movie a show of acting but definitely too long
Jan 15 2024,negative,too much talking not enough bombs it was more about communism sympathizers during that time period i wish i would have skipped it
Jan 15 2024,positive,a perfect story for the director and great performances keep this movie tense throughout despite its length
Jan 15 2024,positive,good movie although it was a long movie it kept my interest the entire time on a topic that i knew nothing about
Jan 15 2024,positive,really impressive that he made a straightforward drama so visually compelling and engaging despite the length
Jan 15 2024,positive,this was a very good movie with an excellent script and acting  i learnt a lot watching this  my only criticism is that i couldnt hear some of the dialogue because of mumbling or too quick speaking
Jan 15 2024,positive,65 stars a little creative licensing but that is too be expected amazing movie
Jan 14 2024,positive,brilliant every minute every aspect going again and again while back at imax
Jan 14 2024,positive,long but not boring best if watched in imax
Jan 14 2024,negative,i walked out of the theater after 30 minutes
Jan 14 2024,positive,this is a film that would you leave speechless for a long time cillian murphy and robert downey jr were the mvps of this movie christopher nolan outdid himself with this movie 1510
Jan 14 2024,neutral,its boring slow and confusing jump timelines back forth hard to tell what timeline youre in
Jan 14 2024,positive,very good movie and also very informative i think this movie gets a bit confusing at the end but still delivers the movie doesnt feel like 3 hours at all as it is very entertaining very good acting as well from cillian murphy rdg and matt damon would recommend for anyone above 13
Jan 14 2024,negative,this story is a pivotal moment in our history it could have been a great story for all audiences unfortunately it turned into an artist vision that was slow boring and completely conflicting would rather watch paint dry waste of money the music and the cast were great but did not save this movie
Jan 14 2024,positive,great cast and storyline but certainly could have been edited down to 2 hours and still get the full story across it starts out slow but then picks up halfway through the film robert downey jr deserves the oscar
Jan 14 2024,negative,this movie wouldnt have been a success without barbie too long too boring too pretentious
Jan 14 2024,positive,wow nolan is a true film visionary everything about the movie was excellent the acting the cinematography the music the movie was long but it encompassed the totality of oppenheimers story it deserves all of the oscar categories to win it is a movie for the ages
Jan 14 2024,negative,the movie does not describe what really happened the topic is very sensitive and the fame of this movie in hollywood does not make up for the truth of what really happened we talk about murdering a mass of innocent people in the country of japan despite the time that has passed you cant just pack it into a 4 hours movie that still managed to leave out details especially by not focusing on the victims
Jan 14 2024,positive,this is amazing must see
Jan 14 2024,positive,you already know its good just watch it already cillian is fantastic the cinematography is top class and all actors bring their a game
Jan 14 2024,positive,very good very long
Jan 14 2024,positive,this movie was my favorite movie of the year cillian murphy is excellent in the role of oppenheimer cillian murphy clearly depicts the struggle of guilt that oppenheimer experiences following the events of the atomic bomb
Jan 13 2024,positive,best movie in 2023  i loved for acting screenplay editing and everything
Jan 13 2024,positive,phenomenal movie the acting was superb
Jan 13 2024,positive,director christopher nolans meticulous attention to detail effectively transports viewers into historical events providing audiences with a truly immersive experience overall the 2023 oppenheimer movie stands as a masterful cinematic achievement that not only entertains but also sparks important conversations about the impact of scientific advancements on humanity the movie is a mustsee for history enthusiasts as well as those seeking a captivating and thoughtprovoking cinematic experience
Jan 13 2024,neutral,i went into the movie expecting something great but came out extremely underwhelmed  the pacing is way off there is absolutely no way to justify the lenght of this film i dont think the viewers need to be handfed every single piece of information and this film is almost solely exposition it comes across as attempting to be intelectual while also sensationalizing the events that already are by nature shocking  i watched it expecting a piece of art that would actually make me feel and question something as good films tend to however that was not the case i dont think the movie added anything significant to the story to justify its existence    on a more positive note the cast was great and i think they did a good job overall with the script they were given i also enjoyed the cinematography quite a bit
Jan 13 2024,positive,absolute cinema cillian murphy as robert j oppenheimer and robert downey jr as straus steal the movie christopher nolan has created a mastercraft masterpiece good story telling keeps you engaged the whole time and educates the viewer on history very educational and accurate story telling explosion looked believable  and realistic movie is very long very enjoyable watch christopher nolans education on oppenheimer is outstanding and eye opening this is a certified fresh watch anyone who wants to learn about the man who created the bomb and the fall will love the bio about the father of the atomic bomb
Jan 13 2024,positive,best movie of 2023 and probably the best movie of the last decade at least
Jan 13 2024,neutral,i really dislike nolans style  one gets the sense that hes in awe of his own brilliance    the first and third hours of the movie were bloated and the making of the bomb the only interesting part gets less attention than it deserved
Jan 13 2024,negative,just total trash so boarding  talking heads the whole movie movie summed up in 3 words man makes bomb the end just a total montage of talking heads and more talking heads  one of the worst movies i have seen with so much hype
Jan 13 2024,negative,complete waste of time
Jan 13 2024,positive,accurate period piece  phenomenal cinematography writing and acting  so glad i saw it in imax 70mm
Jan 13 2024,positive,long dry in parts but overall a good experience it was good not fantastic for me i do personally prefer to watch movies that tell a real life story over superhero movies
Jan 13 2024,positive,the movie of the century
Jan 13 2024,negative,bored to tears  did 20 min
Jan 12 2024,positive,super interesting story great acting prosthetics couldve been better kittys  nose couldve been blended better for sure still a great movie
Jan 12 2024,positive,the best actor in the world so good
Jan 12 2024,positive,loved everything about oppenheimer the sets music colour palettes costumes especially cillian and robert
Jan 12 2024,positive,this movie definitely is the best biographical movie of all time that show a scientist life storyand pay attention this movie build to praise of  the father of the atomic boom not about the atomic bomb 
Jan 12 2024,neutral,christopher nolan has an impressive portfolio all the way back to his classics like memento and the dark knight to his most recent epics such as dunkirk    where oppenheimer succeeds is the casting the acting here especially from cillian murphy is superb he sells his role and his dedication is shown in his work the atmosphere the movie uses alongside its cinematography is great theres very few shots that arent interesting to say the least    where this movie doesnt succeed with me is the pacing its the movie that starts to drag and with so many scenes of dialogue with little going on it commits the worse sin a movie can commit    it was boring which sucks for an interesting subject matter like this its a visually pleasing star studded movie with a unnecessarily long run time that wastes so much of the watchers time    one of nolans weakest movies
Jan 12 2024,positive,undoubtedly nolans masterful direction is evident in this film but on a story level it didnt leave me with anything its an endless list of scientists names that creates a lot of confusion when trying to reconstruct the logical thread of the plot this kind of approach will surely be appreciated by those already familiar with the events depicted but for beginners like me it really doesnt leave anything the only thing i knew a little more in detail were the differences between little boy and fat man a topic that was practically not covered throughout the duration of the film im well aware that the trinity test is not the main focus of oppenheimer but this approach certainly didnt alleviate my disappointment when i left the theater
Jan 12 2024,positive,certified masterpiece everything nolan directs is perfection to the max if this does not win the oscar your boy is going to be very mad a must watch for everyone oppenheimer really was the embodiment of america great story on him and understanding the horrors of human kind
Jan 12 2024,negative,long 3 hour story short  guy helps build the bomb  then regrets it  duh  second worst part of it  the corrupt us government lies and manipulates  end of the storyor is it
Jan 11 2024,positive,oppenheimer a movie that has a historical drama about bombs and depression of learning and directed by christopher nolan himself oppenheimer was the best movie of 2023
Jan 11 2024,negative,oppenheimer disappoints with its tedious focus on personal intricacies rather than the monumental impact of the atomic bomb the films excessive length and overindulgence in trivial details leave the viewer longing for substance and momentum in its attempt to explore the protagonists life it forgets the thrilling and pivotal essence of its historical subject a drawnout affair that fails to ignite the expected sparks of excitement or insight
Jan 11 2024,positive,this movie really blew
Jan 11 2024,positive,christopher nolan does it again this film was very sophisticated and interesting from the cinematography and acting and plot nolan does his thing of making another masterpiece with a twist ending once again
Jan 11 2024,positive,perfect movie and brilliant casting cant see anyone else fulfilling the role of oppenheimer other than cillian murphy
Jan 11 2024,positive,oppenheimer is the kind of movie made for oscar season  smart complex compelling an allstar cast in the judgment at nuremberg sense in that it was as talented an ensemble as seen i recent years murphy and downey jr deserve every statue available
Jan 10 2024,positive,christopher nolan keep making movies you remind me why i love them
Jan 10 2024,positive,as usual nolan weaves a brilliant whole cloth from seemingly disparate threads of time and space cillian murphy is superb as the complex and flawed lead and a bravura selfcontained performance from downey as his persecutor beautiful to look at
Jan 10 2024,positive,another masterpiece from nolan
Jan 10 2024,positive,i dont understand all the praise this movie got i waited to see it until i could see it on vid angel to bring the r rating down it almost removed nothing the dirty scenes were so unnecessary but overall the film was interesting i guess the fact that it was about a real guy made it easier the performances were good but the overall film just wasnt as interesting and captivating as other films ive seen i would recommend this if you watch it with other people otherwise i wouldnt watch it through the whole film i was waiting for it to be over periodically picking up my phone because i got bored
Jan 10 2024,negative,awful ridiculously over the place didnt even make sense
Jan 10 2024,positive,a lot to take in and think about oppenheimer is nolans latest film and it is one of his best first of all the performances are all great cillian murphy is nothing but phenomenal in this film he makes you feel connected to oppenheimer robert downey jr proves that he is an actor and not just ironman i was very surprised with how great he was in this film besides them emily blunt although she didnt have as much screen time as i expected was great definitely these three actors are set to win their first oscar however everyone else like matt damon and florence pugh were great and could possibly be nominated besides the performances the film story is just phenomenal the film goes over pretty much the life story of robert j oppenheimer the story and writing were great and the film is told through its own unique structure the score is and sound is in my opinion better than that of dunkirk which says a lot every single shot in this film has beautiful cinematography and lighting thats obvious as this is a nolan film but i got to say the visuals were beyond my expectations i find it almost unbelievable that there is no cgi in this film     all the themes are so big and grand that it hits hard i found myself speechless through most of this film especially during the bomb test everything builds up to that bomb test around the middle of the film there are so many scenes in which i found myself speechless and in awe the only issue i find is the pacing there is so much to take in and think about that only 3 hours feels too short an extra 3060 minutes would have allowed you to take in and understand everything  either way the film is a phenomenal film about the life of robert j oppenheimer absolutely everything about this film is great and the ending is simply perfect
Jan 10 2024,negative,im sure this is controversial but this wasnt good absolutely no clue what the hype was over  1 it was wayyy too unnecessarily long  2 for once it would be real nice if christopher nolan ever directed any movie in his whole life that was put together in common english and made any sense   3 the movie was alllll kinds of over the place     not for me really feels like nolan does this on purpose to confuse as many people as possible
Jan 9 2024,positive,dont have the words nor the stars to tell how good the movie is
Jan 9 2024,positive,another great epic from nolan one of my favorite biopics
Jan 9 2024,positive,a masterpiece this has all the elements of a great filmgreat writing acting directing creating an authentic period of time those who say its too long or too much dialoguewtf does that mean suffer from cinematic attention deficit disorder and probably had their nose buried in their phones
Jan 9 2024,positive,i saw all the reviews about this being christopher nolans best work a masterpiece and was expecting a riveting story but what came was endless dialogue also a man who feeds his ego to create an atomic bomb shouldnt be seen as a hero as this movie portrays i dont know how everyone else can remember 2540 character names and who everyone is while instantly following along with every accusation i would have to stop the movie and ask questions to understand the whole story but then it would take 45 hours
Jan 8 2024,positive,absolutely terrific movie  three hours well spent  now i want to read american prometheus
Jan 8 2024,positive,superb performances story  character development throughout fascinating points in history reflected brilliantly by chris nolan im no physicist but oppenheimer opens your eyes to superb filmmaking and the best way of reflecting the eras of a man the golden boy or not of complex times around him
Jan 8 2024,positive,this movie is wonderful in every aspect the direction the acting the historical accuracies and of course the cinematography and explosions scenes this movie is definetly a mustwatch film that is going to appear in the 2024 oscars
Jan 8 2024,negative,this one of the worst things i have seen in decades all of it but especially the second part was so bad  i only stayed till the end just to be able to wittness that this was  in its whole just boringjust soo sooo bad
Jan 8 2024,positive,immense cast and performances murphy and downey junior being the standouts the bomb testing scene is one of the best pieces of cinematography ive ever seen
Jan 8 2024,negative,given the subject i felt much more could have been done with the movie i am a c nolan fan and loved all of his movies to date but i found oppenheimer very disappointing boring and dull it was slow and seemed to rely entirely on endless dialogues i have never walked out of a cinema showing of a movie but i was very close on this occasion
Jan 8 2024,positive,good movie the only negative comment i can make is the excessive use of flashbacks i understand that this is the way they wanted us to follow the storyline but honestly there are too many  great acting costumes and scenes i recommend it
Jan 8 2024,positive,fell asleep three times watching this love the history on it just a little boring
Jan 8 2024,positive,an amazing movie that christopher nolan works perfectly
Jan 8 2024,positive,fantastic a must see movie
Jan 8 2024,positive,solid movie great story perfect pace
Jan 7 2024,positive,christopher nolan has yet to disappoint
Jan 7 2024,positive,a really good movie to watch once
Jan 7 2024,positive,definitely the best movie i have seen in 2023 taking into account the director and cillian murphy i expected a good movie but ridley scott went overboard he left me speechless the photography is spectacular the acting of all the characters is incredible although i have to highlight the soundtrack  it was the key both to narrating the story and to reaching the viewer and feeling in first person the feelings that each of the characters were experiencing
Jan 7 2024,neutral,the longest movie in existence about a guy losing his security clearance
Jan 7 2024,positive,this movie was the better one with good casting to the movie robot downy jr better actor
Jan 7 2024,positive,watched all the extras on the dvd didnt see it in imax robert downey jr did a great job may have to watch it a second time because there is so much going on a very thought provoking movie
Jan 7 2024,positive,disappointing after all of the hype once again we are advised that communists were just misunderstood and it is terrible that they were treated so badly during mccarthy after 100s of movies with that message try something new please
Jan 6 2024,positive,ohwell what can i say this movie is absolutely fantastic visually brilliant cast are worldwide everything is perfect the movie grabbed me and didnt let go the whole time
Jan 6 2024,positive,one of christopher nolans greatest
Jan 6 2024,negative,i streamed floppenheimer while visiting my mother for christmas i thought it would e fun to watch a movie with her  she still hasnt forgiven me   i guess two and a half hours about a crazy dude who put the world on the brink of nuclear annihilation and kept it there for 80 years is more that anyone can bear  the editing will make you dizzy as you try to figure out whats going on   they fail to introduce characters so you dont know who is what   wildly bad
Jan 6 2024,positive,yet another masterpiece from christopheer nolan guaranteed to win many oscars
Jan 6 2024,negative,40  minutes in and im bored out of my mind ill just read the wikipedia page
Jan 6 2024,positive,for a movie this long only nolan can make you sit at the edge of your seat and leave the movie completely satisfied
Jan 6 2024,positive,a somewhat engaging biopic wrapped around beautiful cinematography and quality acting while i liked it it would never be the type of movie to rewatch or talk about years from now  at least for me
Jan 6 2024,negative,shouldve showered more than it told  absolutely boring
Jan 6 2024,positive,a memorable and important film very well cast
Jan 5 2024,negative,horrible movie in every way possible themes and dialog were repetitive  bad acting by the lead character do yourself a favor skip this or watch it on youtube because it shouldnt even be on a streaming channel
Jan 5 2024,positive,would have given it a 5 star but i decided on 45 because 80 of the characters are only mentioned by name once its honestly the only criticism i have of the whole movie the cinematography is godly and character development is beyond good they also do really well with switching the themes of the movie thats hard to pull off its just hard to follow on who is talking 
Jan 5 2024,positive,this movie is catnip for stemleaning people
Jan 4 2024,positive,it was a good movie but would have been better without the sex scenes and the dropping of the fbomb every few minutes why not make a good movie without the sex scenes and profanity it would still tell the story and open the movie up to a wider audience one viewing was enough
Jan 4 2024,positive,gripping all the way and very wellpaced oppenheimer is a technical and storytelling marvel and yet another home run for christopher nolan cillian murphy and robert downey jr are automatic shoeins for oscar nominations along with a bunch of other nods for the technical aspects of the film the only negative i do have for the film is the constant music that keeps playing in the background while it sort of portrays the panic and anxiousness that oppenheimer felt throughout his life it was at times distracting for audience members all in all  this is a mustwatch imax experience
Jan 4 2024,positive,brilliant mostly dialog but interesting and moving conversations
Jan 4 2024,positive,oppenheimer is a perfect rendition of the amazing story of the atomic bomb it captures tense moments and suspense throughout the whole movie the last 50 minutes of the movie were a rollercoaster and has me on the edge of my seat the cinematography was amazing and you could really tell the power of the imax cameras that were used great acting too though it was not very action packed it does have an explosion near the middle of it perfect movie may seem slow at the beginning but gets better as it goes
Jan 4 2024,positive,one of the all time greats chris nolans magnum opus it was nolans use of sound that stood out most to me as the movie used droning violins and loud bangs to bring anticipation and excitement the crackling of plutonium made the whole thing feel immersive in a way movies have never made me feel every actor is at the top of their game in this cillian murphy robert downey jr and matt damon all give career best performances the story is engaging throughout and the ending will leave you with chills theres really nothing like it chris nolan is a man at the top of his craft the best movie of 2023
Jan 4 2024,negative,movie was like a series of tiktoks  jumps around endlessly leaves out much of the story sad i was looking forward to it having read much about it in the past
Jan 3 2024,positive,i think this is a great movie that would be best seen in a theater  it is both ambitious and long but i think it both described how the minds of the best physicists of the 20th century worked and how the atomic bomb was developed during wwii  it also depicts oppenheimers rocky personal life and his inner turmoils including his unsuccessful struggles to convince american leaders and president truman to support arms control treaties after the war  the visual scope of the movie is huge and deserves a theater rather than tv screen
Jan 3 2024,positive,stellar cast with the exception of matt damon who i found forced his character it was very good but not as great as i expected cillian murphy did an excellent job portraying oppenheimer and from what i know about him and the experiments the story was on point the periodic symbolic visuals for example oppenheimer stepping into a burned body after growing a conscience was poorly done and totally unnecessary i would have preferred they stick to simple facts and straightforward cinematic dramatizations i do recommend the movie for those interested in historical docudramas and superb acting performances
Jan 3 2024,negative,i had high hopes for this film but it was way too long and boring the poor script and  character development left me wanting my 3 hours back
Jan 3 2024,positive,interesting take on oppenheimer and his role in developing the atomic bomb  i am unsure how this could have been told in a more historical context as it hits all the high points and conflict of his life but i must say that overall the movie was boring  it did drag on and perhaps would have been better as a miniseries  the theoretical physics information was very interesting though
Jan 3 2024,neutral,good cinematography slow prolonged and it never feels enough
Jan 3 2024,positive,best movie ever highly recommend it
Jan 3 2024,positive,best movie of 2023 the story the performances the picture the sound just a masterpiece
Jan 3 2024,positive,it took some adjusting to the mtv music video editing speed for the first quarter of the movie seriously this felt like a megaeditcompilation for several seasons of a tv series but after my brain adjusted i enjoyed the movie more as it progressed this is definitely one youll want to see in the cinema the explosions made rows of seats rumble im suspicious wether oppenheimer was maybe a tad too martyrwashed here but the ending was halting
Jan 3 2024,positive,this movie was all that i was hoping for the court cases and exploration of the creation of the atom bomb including the implications that it had made this a fascinating watch along with this nolans directing visuals and the score had me on the edge of my seat keeping me engaged with every facet of the story
Jan 3 2024,negative,aside from an excellent performance by rdj movie is all over the place  his wives should have been more involved or left out just left the baby with a friend and no explanation ok
Jan 3 2024,negative,first let me say i have nothing against this movie it was just not for me i dont know much about history and the world wars and oppenheimer does not fill you in so that was confusing also its 3 hours of straight dialog and i am fine with that but after a while it got hard to concentrate on what they were saying and the movie is all over the place so that was confusing but i can appreciate that this movie does have a soul and you can tell they worked hard on this movie but if you like history on wars then i would check it out also i do have to say that its over rated but its not like i was rolling my eyes or anything but again not for me
Jan 3 2024,positive,its definitely worth seeing  the historical context is outstanding and the performances excellent however it does drag a bit in places which made the experience less enjoyable im glad i saw it once but have no desire to see it again
Jan 2 2024,positive,very good highly recommend
Jan 2 2024,positive,definitely worth watching but i dont think ill ever want to rewatch it great movie but the impression on me will not last
Jan 2 2024,positive,this movie was brilliantly directed written and produced i had to watch it more than twice oppenheimer catches humans at their best and worst the creative intelligent beings that we are but is contrasted by our innate human instinct to destroy this movie really made me sit and think about what human existence means how physics has been such a groundbreaking field but how almost all creations are used for destruction
Jan 2 2024,positive,it was one hour too long and it was very choppy difficult to tell when each scene takes place cant anyone just tell a chronological story anymore it got way too in the weeds during the last hour about the whole investigation and what every single person thought and testified  that was boring if you arent familiar with the story already this movie can be a confusing mess and the constant soundtrack over the entire movie was annoying
Jan 2 2024,negative,i  know nolan doesnt like adr but the sound was sobad i felt like i lost half the movie i shouldnt have to turn on subtitles for an american movie
Jan 2 2024,positive,could have been a spectacular movie based on the content however the storyline on personal details lingered on compared to what should have been the main focus of the film
Jan 2 2024,negative,dialogue is washed out by the background noise and music  endless noise and music drowning out most scenes
Jan 2 2024,positive,there are some breathtaking moments in oppenheimer that manage to instill the audience with some of the sense of awe and horror that the scientists involved in the manhattan project must have felt unfortunately it was washed out with one too many discombobulated art house scenes with pseudofuturistic synth music and nonsense science themed imagery
Jan 2 2024,positive,i cant see it as the masterpiece everyone is pointing it out to be nevertheless it is still entertaining hard to follow at times and and more often than not i found myself playing with my phone rather than paying attention to a slow paced 3hour movie
Jan 1 2024,negative,just watched longenheimer  sheesh  i guess im not normal because i didnt care for it choppy disjointed confusing  maybe when im smarter ill like it  ughenheimer
Jan 1 2024,positive,absolutely riveting cinema  a masterpiece of storytelling and pacing with brilliant performances cinematography and musical score  three hours flew by the best film of 2023 without a doubt
Jan 1 2024,positive,the definition of a slow burn movie slowly builds up to the crescendo of the atom bomb test which is fascinating but then the movie fizzles out again immediately after that scene the actual bombing of japan feels glossed over a small anecdote of the movie 3 hours long and the bombing is only an anecdote feels like the movies time wasnt well spent not a bad movie but forgettable and not worth another watch to me
Jan 1 2024,positive,great film good story well acted although the sound was a bit poor lots of mumbling going on long but well worth the 3 hours
Jan 1 2024,positive,nolan is known for his mindbending movie but for this movie you dont have to worry about that because its not that complex    cinematography of the movie is great there is certain sceneframe which are visually appealing that u would make like to make your wallpaper they are that good    background music was very good its fade in and then fade out at certain points which really rise my heartbeat    callin murphy nailed it in his role i can see in his eyes all the emotions he feels when ok that would be a spoiler so i would avoid that    i feel the length of the movie at certain points and i didnt build the emotional bond with the characters its more like a court room drama    so whether you should watch it or not then my answer will be yes but i would also say that its not for everyone some of you may find it boring but trust me its good drama film
Jan 1 2024,positive,i thought the movie was going to focus a bit more on his regret over building this wmd but that was barely covered much less the toll it took on the japanese once used twice it is a spectacular movie and should be seen in imax to truly appreciate but i think nolan left a golden opportunity on the table
Jan 1 2024,positive,good movie with striking performances by the actors including cilian murphy with the best half at the end it was too long at 3 hours and could have been condensed without compromising the impact and maintaining the attention and interest of the audience
Jan 1 2024,positive,caution  this is a three hour flick   now thats out the way get ready for what seems like a senate hearing with a musical score long and full with some explosions sex and sprinkle in a dash of espionage  all in all robert downey pulls off a masterful role as does emily blount matt damons army  uniform and cillian murphys chain smoking steal their spot light  yet and still 4 stars for effort  entertainment value sprinkled with bathroom breaks
Jan 1 2024,positive,amazing cinematography how i love the clapping sound definitely will win the oscar
Jan 1 2024,positive,could have been 5 stars no need for the sex scenes  im not a prude  but the relationships could have been more intelligently written we get the point of a geniuss mind in turmoil so there was no need to have the flashes of atoms colliding in bright colours good story and acting so why 3 stars that damn music soundtrack playing continuously masking most of the dialogue the music itself was inappropriate and annoyingly drifted across adjoining scenes where there should have been an obvious break
Jan 1 2024,positive,the dramatization of the life story of j robert oppenheimer the physicist who had a large hand in the development of the atomic bomb thus helping end world war 2 is a big undertaking for filmmaker and audience members alike it is long and intense viewing however cillian murphys inhabits the titular character which adds much to the engagement of its storytelling
Jan 1 2024,positive,the most fantastic movie about the atomic bombs father and an excellent addition to the book surely youre joking mr feynman by ralph leighton and richard feynman
Jan 1 2024,positive,ive decided to watch oppenheimer on new years eve   and i have only one thing to say this movie is an undisputed  masterpiece that shows lot of aspects of american society with all its flaws and qualities   and christopher nolan is still the best movie director in my world and has proven his genius  once again  a true piece of art  i would give it 10 stars if i couldfinally a good movie in 2023
Jan 1 2024,positive,by order of the peaky blinders cillian murphy will win an oscar  awesome performance and movie
Jan 1 2024,negative,melodramatic and tedious first 2 hours last hour more interesting but didnt scratch the surface of the post bomb time
Jan 1 2024,negative,too much switching back and forth
Dec 31 2023,positive,good film had a lot of corny and cliche biopic scenes and dialogue     alot of characters played by known actors with absolutely nothing to do
Dec 31 2023,positive,overall interesting story about a key historical figure in the development of atomic weapons i would recommend this film if you dont mind historical narrative with a few lulls i enjoyed how oppenheimers famous quote is cinematically executed  im not a prude in the slightest but the sex scenes with pugh seemed entirely unnecessary and did not work to enhance or improve the plot murphy executes his acting specialty and superbly portrays the flawed and tortured intellectual archetype
Dec 31 2023,positive,technically it was well done if you come expecting a big bang youll be disappointed  dare i admit that i found it kind of boring maybe a tighter edit would have turned this from a good movie to a great one
Dec 31 2023,positive,im really split on this movie i can recommend it as an one time watch so you know what happened and the visuals are at times good but i dont agree with the whole practical is alot better routine like the atomic bomb test that was very disappointing in my viewbig light that was clearly a big light and the atomic explosion didnt really look like an atomic cloud to me lots of close ups to hide that fact it seemed also i was hoping for more show not tell stuff when it comes to big important events like the bombing of hiroshima which is a big story beat here all the performances was great but i really do think a mixture of cgi and practical would have been the best way here it felt like they couldnt do things so we only got a few things however the effects that comes between shots throughout the movie as really well done so is the background at times when oppenheimer has his moments     all the audio was great though
Dec 31 2023,negative,ive just lost 3 hours of my life watching probably the most boring film ever if you want to watch a a good film about a brilliant mathematicianscientist watch the imitation game or even good will hunting this film doesnt deserve anymore of my time detailing how bad it was i wouldnt watch another christopher nolan film again
Dec 31 2023,positive,the story was fine but the soundtrack  the soundtrack was so intrusive that the slow plodding mumbling dialogue was often hard to hear   very disappointing
Dec 31 2023,positive,great movie you must see
Dec 30 2023,positive,who would have thought putting forth a good amount of effort in writing along with a talented capable cast would yield a great movie oh wait literally all of us  take note hollywood this is how a good biopic is done
Dec 30 2023,positive,brilliant profound stunning performances
Dec 30 2023,negative,director christopher nolan repeated the same mistakes he made when directing tenet and extended it to three full hours of boredom the loud and tiring soundtrack and diegetic sounds drown out any important dialogue the pacing is messy the theme is lackluster overall aside from two or three significant scenes everything else about the film makes it a typical shallow prolific actorfilled attempt at something meaningful    nolan does not have the insight or tools to make a historical film of this scale his film adds nothing to the legacy of j robert oppenheimer
Dec 30 2023,positive,not bad at all but a little overly dramatic and expected
Dec 30 2023,positive,nolans most memorable and expressive work that fits all of his cliques but to an extent where it feels substantial than stylish a genuine masterclass in filmmaking 4255
Dec 29 2023,positive,oppenheimer is a mesmerizing dive into one of historys most secretive yet pivotal moments christopher nolans masterful direction breathes life into this tale of ambition genius and the harrowing pursuit of power cillian murphy embodies oppenheimer flawlessly channeling the complexity and torment of the man tasked with an unthinkable responsibility his portrayal is nothing short of captivating anchoring the film with depth and intensity    robert downey jrs portrayal of lewis strauss is a revelation showcasing a depth that deserves accolades nolans directorial prowess turns seemingly mundane dialogues into gripping exchanges keeping the audience hooked throughout the suspenseful music heightens every moment creating an electrifying atmosphere that keeps pulses racing    the genius editing amplifies the narratives impact though the movies only misstep is its length clocking in at three hours oppenheimer tests patience and could have thrived as a miniseries allowing deeper exploration without overwhelming audiences    nonetheless the films brilliance in storytelling and execution is undeniable despite its minor flaws oppenheimer is poised to sweep awards season a testament to its stellar craftsmanship and compelling storytelling nolans meticulous direction coupled with outstanding performances cements this movie as a mustwatch for history buffs and cinema enthusiasts alike
Dec 29 2023,positive,saw this at the theater and it didnt disappoint nolan is one of the goats and cillian getting the recognition he deserves
Dec 29 2023,positive,nolans movie nothing to say
Dec 29 2023,positive,sensationally gripping  beautifully shot perfectly curated cast oh and bloody terrifying
Dec 29 2023,positive,a fascinating film from beginning to end cillian murphy is wonderfull the music is great and despite being 3 hours long it keeps you in suspense throughout i havent seen anything this good in the cinema for a long time
Dec 29 2023,negative,it starts really slow but gets better by the middle of the film overall if it wouldt be so long hours i think it would get a much better rate the good thing is based on realistic events its still worth to watch
Dec 29 2023,positive,i think that christopher nolan is a genius   its not just a movie but an experience   being able to create those sounds being able to create those images is such an incredible job
Dec 29 2023,positive,this movie is going to sweep the academy awards this year  simply outstanding
Dec 29 2023,positive,better than cats and ghost of tsushima
Dec 28 2023,positive,good movie maybe a little too broody and overdone at times but given the subject you cant blame them  you leave the theater convinced that its only a matter of time and thats the correct assessment of the situation
Dec 28 2023,positive,im someone who has a background in history with higher education and i usually love these films but in all honesty ive finished this film and im rather disappointed its hands down one of the best films of recent years but that partly reflects on just how bad things have got with the industry more than anything a good film but not as good as it has been made out to be in my view
Dec 28 2023,positive,the best movies i have seen in years all the actors did an outstanding job it was hard to believe that happened almost 80 years ago christopher nolan and all the actor made me feel like i was right there
Dec 28 2023,negative,background music was too loud to understand what was being said throughout the entire movie what a waste of my time and money
Dec 28 2023,positive,one of the best nolans movie absolutely beautiful the ending has left me speechless definitely the best movie of 23 2010 absolute cinema
Dec 28 2023,positive,that wasnt a nuke
Dec 27 2023,negative,this movie is so so so so boring  cant work out how it got such high rating
Dec 27 2023,negative,an idea plagiarized from a nobody fake smart movie circle jerking scientists for the purpose of what praising murder
Dec 27 2023,positive,movie was bomb florence has tatas as big as that mushroom cloud oppenheimer really gave her that sloppenheimer movie was pefect besides the fact that some characters are commies and they shaved ironman and turned him evil
Dec 27 2023,negative,nonstop background music is the final nail in the coffin for this one a potentially brilliant story quite badly told we dont need 15 minutes of oppenheimer shagging we want the actual story of the bomb
Dec 27 2023,positive,great movie with amazing performances
Dec 27 2023,positive,its above meh it passed the time and i would recommend it however i would not give it the rating the site has the story was fine but it certainly was a slow paced movie i thought it would have been a bit more about the creation of the atomic bomb and also more about explaining the science and technology i guess it was called oppenheimer and not how the atomic bomb was invented but i guess i was hoping for about halfhalf   actors  1010  visuals  710  story  710
Dec 27 2023,positive,i was really worried before i went to see it because im not very knowledgeable about history and science but the movie was really well organized and easy to understand i really enjoyed the movie
Dec 27 2023,negative,i dont know why i diddent find this movie as captive as the one should expect we were confused by the story hopping back and forwards and not always remembering who was who  and not connecting with anyone    i think this movie expect a certain level of knowledge about the persons involved and not from scratch for me a god documentary about oppenheimermanhattan project might just have been a better chose
Dec 27 2023,negative,i was literally screaming boorriinngg at the top of my lungs this was just as bad as the barbie movie now i understand why people kept comparing the two this was one of the worst films ive seen
Dec 27 2023,neutral,well acted and educational but extremely long and boring
Dec 27 2023,negative,im really not sure what the fuss is about sure there is production value but where is the script where is the storyline where is the connection to the characters this film is tedious in a monotonous and taxing way also whoever played einstein make me crack up did they hire some guy off the street cause he looked like himthis film will not date well and plays like a wikipedia page with foot stomps if it gets best picture over poor things ill probably simultaneously laugh shout and throw my hands up in the air 
Dec 26 2023,neutral,a real snooze the hearing in the last hour is just terribly boring  not a holiday view  better suited for lent
Dec 26 2023,positive,christopher nolan has made the less nolanesque pictures of his career finally doing something different by moving away from the sometimes confusing action of his previous summer blockbustres and giving us the closer he can get to author cinema with great cinematography vfx and performances oppenheimer its crearly the main front runner for the next academy awards ufortunately its third act is where the movie really lags
Dec 26 2023,negative,waaaay to long and jumbled and messy  overhyped
Dec 26 2023,positive,movie was hard to understand unless you will focus and listen to the whole movie
Dec 26 2023,positive,its long and slow burning movie its worth to watch it theres a lot to unpack however the movie delivers
Dec 26 2023,positive,first the positive things outstanding cast great visual effects interesting story by its very nature now for the negative things way too long hollywood needs to go back to telling stores in 90 minutes or less  this thing is like 3 hours and i was falling asleep halfway through part of that was because there was so much dialogue that and jumping back and forth in time i hate this storytelling technique that i started getting bored despite the interesting nature of the story if you have the attention span to watch a 3 hour film then by all means but make sure to set aside 3 hours of your day
Dec 26 2023,negative,i really wanted to like the movie but found it very fast paced and difficult to follow an absolute mess
Dec 26 2023,negative,pretentious writing overacting overly dramatic
Dec 26 2023,positive,arguably an engaging expository blockbuster drama on one of the most controversial and paradoxical figures in american history and science christopher nolan dominates again
Dec 26 2023,negative,am i the only one who felt this movie was essentially a remake of fatman  littleboy only done so much more poorly    if i see one more wistful gaze by murphy im gonna hurl my holiday hen
Dec 25 2023,positive,an incredibly upsetting fantastically staged complex film of epic proportions    cinematically a masterpiece nolan once again shows his knack for the complex detailed script work for spectacular effects and topclass casts    in terms of content many lanes are discarded an arc of tension drags on to the test of the atomic bomb then another drags on in chamber playlike negotiations for his conviction an epic that is worth seeing several times and it is too profound and versatile to fully understand    all the actors did their best    8510  must see
Dec 25 2023,positive,i had the preconceived idea i was not going to like this movie but after viewing it i changed my mind   the issue is still before us can we do something about eliminating the bomb from the world before it destroys us
Dec 25 2023,positive,well done in detail orientation and presentation was 1010 with a great cinematic experience
Dec 25 2023,positive,obviously well researched and accurate in many ways but this is another move like dunkirk that was more about technical film making and directing skills than actually being enjoyable to watch for the audience huge amounts of wasted screenplay and a generally messy delivery obviously therefore i dont subscribe to nolans selfobsessed film making style 
Dec 25 2023,negative,read books if you are interrested in oppenheimers story that would make sense  it was pure wasting of time 3 hours boredom extremely overhyped by millions of snobs
Dec 25 2023,positive,a very complex story told well acted well outstanding
Dec 25 2023,positive,very well done my favorite movie of 2023 
Dec 25 2023,positive,the oppenheimer movie is giving gaslight gatekeep girlboss in a major way this movie makes me feel kenough cillian murphy slays in this movie and it doesnt need to be stated that jr oppenheimer does as well
Dec 24 2023,positive,thoughtful exploration of the building of the atomic bomb combined with terrific acting overall but the film loses 1 star due to its plodding nature and overextended runtime it did not need to be a 3 hour film
Dec 24 2023,positive,one of nolans best powerfully acted and engaging throughout
Dec 24 2023,positive,hands down one of the best movies i have seen in a while great performances by everyone and the story was very well written put this one on your must see list
Dec 24 2023,negative,my expectation was to learn about oppenheimer and the development of the bomb instead the bulk of the movie was a court room drama about communism unexpected and disappointing    the story telling jumped around and was not a great technique i also couldnt stand the constant droning music throughout the movie     2 starts for acting but on the whole im very confused why this movie has such a high rating skip it
Dec 24 2023,positive,good all the actors were great loved the scenes but some of the scenes dragged out for a while but not to bad theat all i can say i didnt like really the movie was great go see it now
Dec 24 2023,positive,underwhelming story of one of the biggest points in history the movie seemed like a 5 minute story of each portion of oppenheimers life and seemed to struggle to tell that story coherently
Dec 24 2023,negative,a hot mess  im lost as to why the director thought music needed to mixed loudly across almost every scene in the film he ruined good acting a key narrative moments
Dec 24 2023,negative,one hour story that lasted 3 hours photography went back and forth thought i was watching a tennis match
Dec 24 2023,positive,excellent film with some spectacular set pieces and an oscar caliber performance by cillian murphy leading a superb ensemble florence pugh is also memorable in a supporting role the weakness is the film is way too long the endless interrogation of oppenheimer just goes on and on and on
Dec 24 2023,positive,excellent film the 3 hours felt like 90 minutes one of nolans best movies
Dec 23 2023,positive,there are big hollywood films and then there are christopher nolan films and hes gone and done it again with oppenheimer    synopsis the story of american scientist j robert oppenheimer and his role in the development of the atomic bomb    this is a proper film an oscar winner in waiting    nolan has delivered an incredible film that you really need to make the effort to see its that good the story of a troubled man who creates the most devastating weapon known to man and its horrific consequences should not be something which becomes part of a years pop culture but nolan has delivered that    the cast is one of the best ive ever seen with cillian murphys performance in the role of oppenheimer surely setting himself up for an oscar nomination its really that good robert downey jr is also fantastic and shows his career has life outside of the mcu    this film is a complex look at a complicated and trouble man and its almost perfect    it also looks gorgeous and is dripping with nolans fingerprints and dna    dont miss this    910
Dec 23 2023,positive,writing pacing editing acting visual effects sound design score and direction have all excelled in this bonechilling biographical thriller film that records and holds the decadesspanning journey of doctor j robert oppenheimer from a student to an inventor and from an inventor into the destroyer of worlds christopher nolan had righteously crafted the american prometheus story into a cinematic masterpiece that will always be remembered for its complexity and greatness
Dec 23 2023,negative,im sure this could have been good but it was sloppy choppy flipping from one thing to another it was basically a movie length chopping like a trailer yea it was more a trailer view of the hydrogen bombs life definitely not impressed overall with the finished version
Dec 23 2023,negative,i had been looking forward to watching this movie for some time and this evening my wife and i sat down to enjoy it  after 15 minutes we had to switch it offwhat the flying fk were christopher nolan and his editors thinking when they decided to have loud incongruous music blaring throughout tense scenes full of technical dialogue  it simply became unwatchable and i now understand exactly what some other reviewers meant when they said similar things  what a travesty for what should have been a great film
Dec 23 2023,negative,the most overrated movie of 2023 a story badly explained annoying music that goes nowhere scenes jumping one to another without making any sense a boring movie
Dec 23 2023,positive,this was my favourite movie of the year im not normally a bio pick person but i saw it 3 times in theatres and it was worth it each time the movie goes fast you are in it the whole way even if you dont 100 know what was going on    the cast was amazing and this will win lots of oscars this season     i think its christophers best work yet and strikes the perfect balance of complexity and storytelling that chris can sometimes lean to heavy complexity side of things    amazing must see movie 
Dec 22 2023,positive,must see  i watched it three times on 3 different types of screens  the primary benefit of imax to my surprise was the sound  i thoroughly understood the dialogue in imax but found it to be hit or miss in other formats      anyway it is a grand incredibly well acted and finely scripted film with breathtaking cinematography  must see
Dec 22 2023,negative,another hyped feature that relied on vintage cinematic technique and an overated all star cast to float a missed opportunity
Dec 22 2023,positive,amazing theres a hot girl with no cloths on so 5 stars
Dec 21 2023,positive,really good movie my favorite part was when he said its oppenheimen time and then the bomb went off
Dec 21 2023,positive, oppenheimer is a cinematic gem christopher nolans storytelling prowess shines coupled with stellar performances a captivating blend of history and artistry five stars without a doubt
Dec 21 2023,positive,amazing movie for having the topic be so heavy and intense there was an incredible amount of heart in it one of the best movies ive seen in a long time
Dec 21 2023,negative,wow what a disappointment maybe an accurate portrayal of the perspective it examines but a banal story with trite subplots  i wish i had my time back
Dec 21 2023,negative,i feel like im in the twilight zone reading the great reviews for this movie i also love nolan as a filmmaker adding to my confusion it felt like this movie was a bunch of cut scenes just spliced together it was very apparent it wanted to be a great movie about a tortured geniusa beautiful mind  with all the cutaways and annoyingly contrived dialogue but theres one big difference in a beautiful mind you actually care what happens to the characters theres actually a human behind the legend  this movie was so incredibly dull and full of itself a shame considering all the talent involved
Dec 20 2023,positive,an amazing film on such a difficult subject  showing the journey though his mind was a dramatic effect and i loved everything about the film
Dec 20 2023,positive,i thought this was very well done 
Dec 20 2023,negative,i could not watch it boring tedious uninteresting long and close ups galore nolan needs to go back to screenwriting class and story structure to remind himself about what makes a drama a drama hard pass here
Dec 20 2023,positive,must see historical view of the critical momente when that atomic bomb was built
Dec 19 2023,positive,nolan brings the full weight of his filmmaking talent to bear on the film but it is actually the individual performances that stand out the most
Dec 19 2023,neutral,a well made movie  just not that entertaining i found the old fat man little boy movie much more engrossing
Dec 19 2023,positive,it is a generally good movie the characters are likeable the acting is good and sound and visual effects are  in my opinion  phenomenal the only thing i need to complain about is the pacing of the movie despite it being 3 hours i felt like things were happening too quickly constantly jumping from oppenheimers interrogation to oppenheimers personal life and construction of the bomb made the movie a bit chaotic and left me a little confused
Dec 19 2023,positive,this movie was amazing go see it if you havent already
Dec 19 2023,positive,lauded and much talked about for good reason oppenheimer features transcendent performances from a talented cast the immense talent of the filmmaker and cast shine through i would definitely watch this again
Dec 18 2023,positive,the best movie of the year hands down nolan is a cinematic genius
Dec 18 2023,positive,the movie shines the most when it gets into the science of building the bomb when it gets into the communist inquiry or his love affair the movie starts to drag its not an awful movie it just could be better
Dec 18 2023,positive,fantastic acting by all members of the cast  fascinating and so much we did not know about him
Dec 18 2023,positive,good in true nolan fashion my parents biggest critique is they didnt know what the actors were saying due to the soundtrack  for me the narratives and creative direction still hit
Dec 18 2023,positive,a couple scenes i feel could have been different but it hooks one up and easily the most nolan a movie can get
Dec 18 2023,positive,magnetic from the first scene kept me on the edge through storyscene and score nolan is leaving a legacy for the next generation that would inspire and spark many ideas for sure
Dec 18 2023,positive,from confused to elated this film starts off with me asking myself what is this about but ends with all questions answered and a smile on my face the plot isnt what most expect it to be bit is strong enough to entertain is in spite of our preconceived ignorance loved it
Dec 18 2023,negative,the constant annoying background sound effects which cant really be called music made the movie almost unwatchable and the dialog sometimes hard to hear combined with the constant back and forth between the manhattan project and the postwar communist inquiries the movie was hard to follow and distracting the hallucinations during testimony were weird it could have been so much better had they simply focused on the manhattan project and all that was accomplished with the worlds most brilliant scientists
Dec 18 2023,positive,excellent movie history is the best thing about the movie
Dec 17 2023,negative,unfortunately a film that talks a lot but says remarkably little too much time is dedicated to unremarkable scenes and character decisions which lack consequence or quite frankly importance despite the gravity of the subject matter the story meanders at a overly slow pace and is a forgettable experience
Dec 17 2023,positive,a piece for the historian  scientist but perhaps dont bring your wife for this she will be questions the whole ride
Dec 16 2023,positive,how many times christopher nolan has to prove that he is the best filmmaker and a legend    cant describer how good this movie is just have no words best biopic
Dec 16 2023,positive,photography and acting were very good story editing annoyed me for some reason  in 3 hrs there was no time to even touch the subject of the generations on victims from the los alamos area and in japan
Dec 16 2023,positive,the type of movie that you cannot help but think about afterward watch a 2 hour documentary afterward google change your perception of things easily one of the best pieces of art produced nolan at his best
Dec 16 2023,positive,outstanding directing overall incredibly effective film worth the time
Dec 16 2023,positive,this movie was an absolute modern classic
Dec 16 2023,positive,in my opinion it is the best film of the year 2023 its a masterpiece from the direction the performances the soundtrack by ludwig g√∂ransson is one of the best since dark night cillian murphy is masterful in his performance and is favorite to win the golden globe and the oscar for best actor as well as rdj for his role as lewis strauss
Dec 16 2023,positive,i did not want to watch then it amazed mewelldone
Dec 16 2023,negative,not sure what anyone sees in this movie its full of itself music too loud and overdramatized jumping around nonsensically no real story of interest being told too long boring dialogue etc one of the worst overhyped movies ive seen in a while and i understand the science behind it too woof
Dec 16 2023,positive,good movie enjoyed every bit of it
Dec 15 2023,positive,best movie i have seen all year i have watched it 4 times now
Dec 15 2023,negative,personally i found the first hour a total bore and so i never finished the dvd i know it has rave reviews but i was familiar with the story and i just couldnt get into this version previous movies about this story were far better in my opinion
Dec 15 2023,positive,brilliant cast  acting  great screenplay it does jump around in the timeline so you need to pay attention
Dec 15 2023,positive,fantastic film chronicling a very interesting time in our history great performance by cillian murphy and great direction by nolan
Dec 15 2023,neutral,a disjointed mess of fast paced scenes that mostly last less than seconds on the screen and yet trying to tell what was a compelling life about a fascinating person and time it was well intended but this is a story that could have benefited greatly from well developed scenes told in a straightforward manner and not flashback flash forward and flash sideward the man was obviously a brilliant but troubled character with some interesting relationships besides being primarily responsible for a world changing event yet none of these paths are ever fully developed and if you blinked in certain scenes you missed the message what did we learn from the sex scenes with jean for example  nothing about anything  what is with this fast paced scenes for a second that directors all of sudden are doing as if because faster it told a better story  it doesnt try watching a brilliant david lean movie
Dec 15 2023,positive,i was blown away pun intended excellent movie
Dec 15 2023,positive,its as if a science documentary was turned into a thriller brilliant
Dec 15 2023,positive,powerful movie really gives you a sense of the dilemma that they went thru to built a world destroying bomb
Dec 15 2023,negative,a movie that takes it time to tell a story can be a wonderful thing this is not its is laborious strangely not engaging and unintelligible at times
Dec 15 2023,positive,oppenheimer was rich in character development and intelligent mind candy  dialogue the three hour length was necessary to tell the complete story and im not complaining about it as it flew by     i enjoyed it even more on the second viewing it was so full of nuanced dialogue and superb acting     its one of those epic pictures that will stand the test of time
Dec 15 2023,positive,great movie sex scenes seemed forced and out of place but still a great movie
Dec 15 2023,negative,it was the only time i left the movie theater before the movie was over
Dec 15 2023,negative,first did not need to be 3 hours  second too dense dialogue with nonstop talking even when transitioning between scenes that plus the music over the script for almost the entire movie made it difficult to get into what was being said and to formulate my own emotional connection throughout narrative
Dec 15 2023,positive,this movie was really good the humor was good the cinematography was beautiful  the acting was amazing and the whole movie was written very well but the entire movie was focused on the making of the bomb which wasnt very interesting and the movie was more than three hours long so it felt like a three hour long biography so if you like that kind of stuff this movie is for you but i found it kind of dull
Dec 14 2023,positive,amazing film this movie is very engaging would recommend to anyone great cast great dialogue special effects are on top id rate this movie a 9710 always room for improvement this is a must see
Dec 14 2023,negative,boring messy storyline
Dec 14 2023,positive,oppenheimer comes in at a hefty 3 hours but its a relentless 180 minutes of thrilling drama stitched together by fast cuts captivating dialogue and stellar performances    i was taken by surprise really from what ive known of nolans films theyve always had distinct highs and lows but this project was directed with so much gusto that im often left breathless just trying to keep up    the movie is propelled swiftly into a narrative maelstrom but within it i was able to enjoy some truly remarkable dialoguewriting performed by a cast that seemed to just keep giving many scenes are able to tell so much with so little and i was in constant awe by the technical mastery    the actors are fantastic cillian murphy has so much presence as a leading man that he somehow still shines when supported by such a massive star studded crew    in a lot of ways the movie almost feels too much overwhelming the editing the dialogue the acting how it all seamlessly and quickly comes together to make a highstakes story backed by a powerful character narrative the massive amalgamation of this craft never really gives a moment to relax    dont get me wrong by the end of the ordeal im thoroughly impressed in many ways but also kind of exhausted    i cant help but wonder if the same story couldve been told better with less overstimulated grandeur more concise subplots and a better balance of flow and pacing    either way oppenheimer is a thoroughly exciting ordeal not for the faint of heart every minute is a riveting experience and even though it has a solemn quiet end you walk away from the theatre with a bit of anxiety as you dread over the perpetual atomic threat that looms over us
Dec 14 2023,neutral,i have to sayi lost interest mid movie thats pretty hard to do when youre in the theater it was well scripted and beautiful acting however  i think the story could of been better some nice surprises would really make a difference to keep the audience engaged good movie for the old folks boring movie for the younger and energized
Dec 14 2023,positive,i can honestly say that this wasnt what i expected but not in the best way i found myself feeling lost in what was being presented to me there were details of this mans life that i just did not care about in terms of a narrative visually it was intriguing but that can only go so far
Dec 13 2023,positive,lesser minds might not be able to follow it and find it boring great storytelling
Dec 13 2023,positive,well done worth seeing on the big screen
Dec 13 2023,positive,oppenheimer has christopher nolan written all over it every speck from the writing cinematography and visual effects to the editing and score is precisely on par with what one would expect from a nolandirected biopic cillian murphy carried the film as the genius behind historys deadliest weapon and outshined his costars who were outstanding in their own right its been a while since a movie with a daunting runtime utilized every minute to fully realize its story without dragging on needlessly if only they had a few spare minutes to show the ramifications of the atomic bomb on japan to support oppenheimers stand on the creation and usage of such a weapon and increase the emotional impact of the film even if not by merit oppenheimer is one of the best movies released this year and might get lucky enough to snatch the best picture award at the oscars
Dec 13 2023,positive,absolute perfection this movie masters the concept of morally grey particularly in its examination of oppenheimer and the country he represents this movie does not paint him as an angel or a devil rather as a man consumed with his work and the consequences of it it is neither gungho patriotic like old 80s movies nor is it unbearably nihilistic and cynical as a majority of modern productions are it gives you his choices and the consequences and lets you make up your own mind rather than shoving a forced conclusion down your throat in short christopher nolan is a master and cillian murphy is oscarbound
Dec 13 2023,positive,like on my top 10 ever movie list a tad emotionally hyperbolic but hey entertaining and educational met oppie in the 50s
Dec 13 2023,positive,very gud cillian murphy was good in the movie
Dec 13 2023,positive,a great movie that desperately needed to be trimmed with surprisingly little bomb footage given its three hour runtime
Dec 12 2023,positive,christopher nolan just cant cut anything brilliant acting just was too long best actor nod for sure
Dec 12 2023,positive,definitely should win an oscar amazing movie great story telling and performances
Dec 12 2023,positive,half an hour too long the courtroom drama felt heavy by the end for americans aware of the details of the communist witchhunt years it probably made more sense to a european i wasnt quite sure why he was on trial despite all the evidence the self doubt was played well and murphy handled that with panache pughs naked boobs were a bit gratuitous and unnecessary i felt jarring a little with the rest of the film and when right at the end oppenheimer is given the award just as einstein had predicted it came out of the blue with no explanation of how opinion must have changed over the intervening years so yes a brilliant film flawed though
Dec 12 2023,negative,the occasionallycomprehensible dialogue achieved a comparable nadir to the bbcs jamaica inn the plot was long and selfindulgent with cilian murphys i am suffering look put to good use interminably     the brief explanations of nuclear physics were a good concession as was the sex but the cutaways to disintegrating faces and intermittent inversions said loud and clear this is an important movie which you are going to watch    i was relieved when it ended
Dec 11 2023,positive,cillian murphy is on the top of his game on this movie definitely an oscar worthy performance superb acting all around and christopher nolan knows how to tell a story
Dec 11 2023,positive,felt like it dragged a bit and in some parts was hard to follow acting and cinematography was excellent though
Dec 11 2023,positive,one of the best movie ever made in this century and during this time where nuclear warfare could happen at any moment 1010 its kinda confusing when the movie switches perspective but youll understand the whole story at the end
Dec 11 2023,positive,an important movie with a message but too long with a score which distracts rather than helps the story great performances the third act is where the movie gets profound and really interesting
Dec 11 2023,positive,i like when i know whats going to happen and im still on the edge of my seat a cinematic masterpiece with great acting however it definitely could be seen as boring at times still a great watch
Dec 10 2023,positive,good movie love the sound and story i wish they took out the bad scenes its a little long as well could be shorter good movie but not great
Dec 10 2023,neutral,pretentious and unnecessarily long
Dec 10 2023,positive,nolan films typically look great and edited fantastically add to that the casts always deliver in their performances that being said i thought this film was going to be something different than what it is which is biopic of mr oppenheimer in that sense its a mix bag the film is 3 hours long and its heavy use of dialogue will cause many viewer to check out after 2 hours as being a drama film it lacks suspense and tempo especially its last act overall not a bad film but its not as good as the hype surrounding it
Dec 10 2023,positive,im shocked at how much i loved this movie  im not a huge fan of christopher nolan but this is by far his best film  the acting is excellent especially cillian murphy robert downey jr alden ehrenreich bennie safdie and rami malick  its a technical marvel  i predict multiple oscar nominations and wins
Dec 10 2023,positive,my childhood was highly impacted by underdesk bomb safety drills so watching oppenheimer was an intensely personal experience its a visually appealing period piece that exposes the myriad moral tactical and scientific complexities involved with the development of nuclear weapons yet manages high entertainment value the interplay of complex motivations among many great adult minds is as enlightening as it is fascinating these geniuses impacted my future by inventing the mushroom shaped shadow that looms large over 20th22st century lives their story is masterfully told this is a mustsee movie
Dec 10 2023,positive,amazing absolutely beautiful film and great story
Dec 10 2023,positive,few movies can discuss matters of great technical detail and still be a dramatic and entertaining story to all at the same time this movie succeeds at both
Dec 10 2023,positive,one of the best movies of the year so far
Dec 10 2023,positive,good movie but thought it was a little over hyped and not memorable enough to be considered a great movie
Dec 10 2023,positive,great story and fun to watch
Dec 9 2023,negative,long and tedious miss it
Dec 9 2023,positive,one of the greatest movie of all time
Dec 9 2023,negative,they promoted this movie as amazing ww2 storytelling of a worldchanging event im an avid ww2 and history buff literally have hundreds of books just on ww2 i was expecting a deep dive into the creation and mechanics of the manhattan project with some personal insight into oppenheimer but it just felt like a dizzying story of personal chaos and moral dilemma the nude scenes were ridiculous unnecessary and added nothing meaningful to the movie cillian murphy is an incredible actor but this movie did an injustice by not fully showcasing oppenheimers brilliance and leadership equally important is how his work saved millions of lives on both sides japanese surrender rates were always very low the battle of okinawa there were 11000 japanese defenders only 7500 surrendered war is horrible and grotesque oppenheimers project saved one million american lives by not having to  invade japan plus 34 million american wounded also the losses for our allied partners like britain japanese casualties wouldve been enormous estimates of 10 million japanese killed and 30 million wounded many of which civilian nolan is a brit and he did the dunkirk movie very well and paid tribute to british troops in that battle i was expecting him to repeat that level of respectful and accurate storytelling in oppenheimer but this time for an american ww2 perspective and bring this incredible wartime story to life a critical project that changed the world shouldve been conveyed more respectfully and accurately
Dec 9 2023,negative,ehhhh idk i get it the storys fine  the cast is stacked but its entirely too long  everyone talks like theres a baby sleeping in the next room its incredibly quiet  monotone from beginning to end every character actstalks the same maybe it was to my detriment that i waited to watch it at home vs the theater  however part of me thinks if i were to see it in the theater i wouldve fallen asleep  because i ended up multitasking through it  not paying 100 attention maybe i ruined it for myself but i was bored af obviously my review doesnt mean anything in the grand scheme since everyone else apparently loved it but im not on the hype train
Dec 9 2023,positive,very good film although i was a tad disappointed the characters were out of focus i understand to film on film instead of digital makes focusing a bit trickier but it was a tad distracting for me
Dec 8 2023,positive,a masterpiece of cinema nolan is ahead of the game
Dec 8 2023,positive,really great until the message ending
Dec 8 2023,positive,so much to appreciate  nolan knocks it out of the park with fantastic acting across the board
Dec 8 2023,positive,the score direction and acting assemble together around a forgettable script creating something worthwhile definitely worth a watch
Dec 8 2023,positive,i really enjoyed this movie although it kept switching back and forth from the present to flashbacks usually when movies do this i notice it right away so it doesnt faze me but in this movie it was kinda trippy
Dec 7 2023,positive,wonderful film highly recommended
Dec 7 2023,positive,christopher nolan truly showing off his final form with this movie such a perfectly pieced together film that lets its cast shine in full force i would say that most of this casts best performances are in this its such a tragic story that nolan somehow makes entertaining for three hours straight honestly the runtime didnt wear on me at all because its so damn good and deserves its runtime     the score is some of the best of the year if not ever the visuals of this movie are too die for i need to buy the 4k for this asap i cant imagine how good that looks ive only seen three nolan movies but this may be my favorite i just cant fathom how much i enjoyed this if you cant tell by now this movie wipes barbie in my opinion even though i had loads of fun with barbie one last thing can we all thank nolan for putting devon bostick aka rodrick fucking heffley in this movie and you got dane dehaan rami malek jack quaid josh peck alex wolff florence pugh and much much much more nolan was just going ham with this cast
Dec 7 2023,negative,i am clearly not among the majority with my review but i found that the storyline wandered too much which led to a watch that took much longer than needed and did the skinamax worthy sex scenes really add anything beneficial to the movie other than filling screen time i waited for months to see oppenheimer because the subject matter has always intrigued me and you can imagine how excited i was for the release date to arrive well i was very disappointed with the movie and i have one thing to say to chris nolan can i please have my 2000 back
Dec 7 2023,positive,the subject matter was not appealing and it took me a while to get round to seeing it however as a bio and semi documentary this was a very impressive piece of film making it never seemed long and the multiple time shifts and episodic nature of storytelling were always clear and interetsting
Dec 7 2023,negative,i dont understand all the hype one of the worst movies i have ever seen boring story and wooden acting
Dec 7 2023,positive,well edited well written
Dec 6 2023,positive,in 2023 the world feels as if were entering a 2nd cold war with more players on the field the timing makes oppenheimer and the postwar era represented in the film unnveringly appropriate    cillian murphy is exceptional robert downey is exceptional its a da vinci of a film
Dec 6 2023,positive,very well put together keeps you running in multiple timeframes tbh they could have ended in after 2 hrs with the successful test and it would have still been a very good movie went on longer than needed
Dec 6 2023,positive,masterpiece a film that can be compared to citizen kane 2001 vertigo and lawrence of arabia moves at the staggering metaphorical pace of colliding particles nuanced acting from over eighty speaking roles a score that articulates every mood and character change and a return to mostly simple and compelling in camera effects there are a few stunning cgi moments nolan brings together the attributes of wells kubrick hitchcock and lean in spectacular fashion
Dec 6 2023,positive,great movie highly recommend 
Dec 6 2023,positive,the miracle of hollywood is back now oppenheimer is a great movie that describe the whole fantasy life of j robert oppenheimer in the movie christopher nolan uses a lot of filming technique and the result is really incredible im so depressed of the scene which oppenheimer drop a atomic bomb
Dec 6 2023,positive,important biographical drama the cast is spectacular
Dec 6 2023,positive,one of the finest films ever made
Dec 6 2023,positive,probably my new favorite movie of all time
Dec 6 2023,positive,like most i found the topic to be engaging and the treatment mature and even compelling  as a period piece it was meticulous and educational too  and as human drama the flawed characters were endearing and revealing      on the downside  its long  often disjointed  sometimes overly ambitious really trying to address the obvious  the bombs but also ww ii decision making secrecy and communism scientific na√Øvet√©  sex and love well as a period piece  many interwoven and not interwoven elements colliding and competing for screen time  afterwards i learned that some elements and characters got the hollywood thing  added to hold the story together
Dec 5 2023,positive,i found the story to keep a good even pace throughout a compelling story drives the buildup to the bomb and draws you in from the beginning
Dec 5 2023,positive,i really enjoyed this one the acting was fantastic perhaps top 5 cast ive seen the directing and writing is incredible as we are used to with nolan movies my only real gripe is i wish they would have made it pg13 so it could be shown in history classes in high school it would have been so easy to remove the fwords and not show nudity in the tatlock scenes nudity and f bombs dont add anything to film so that was disappointing but great film
Dec 5 2023,positive,one of the best movies of the year saw it twice in theaters
Dec 5 2023,neutral,not much action regarding the bombs  fat man and little boy was better  more about the investigation into oppies background
Dec 5 2023,positive,it can be hard to follow in some parts due to non linear storytelling  it is tied up fairly nicely at the end though
Dec 5 2023,positive,masterpiece in a one full sweep
Dec 4 2023,positive,interesting film with a compelling story that makes you think however tended to drag at times
Dec 4 2023,positive,great movie istg man so good
Dec 4 2023,positive,one of the best movies i have seen for a while
Dec 4 2023,positive,a truly masterful piece of cinematic storytelling a genuine must watch for all
Dec 4 2023,positive,its an full of mysteries motion picture to me oppenheimer 2023written and directed by my favourite filmmaker christopher nolanwith his partner wife emma thomasof course the scripts making a trap for me robert downey jr and my lovable star matt damon with well done performanceemily blunt is portraying greatthen most of all is the character actor cillian murphy
Dec 4 2023,positive,unlike anything i have ever seen before a must watch
Dec 4 2023,positive,amazing casting acting screenplay and cinematography
Dec 4 2023,positive,nolan does it again looking forward to owning it in 4k
Dec 3 2023,positive,it wasnt just a good film it was masterful the photography the script the acting the special effects often practical everything came together perfectly the incredibly accurate historical references and their very special ability to entertain even if in a documentary the experience of watching every moment is almost indescribable and it will certainly be a film that in the future i will watch once twice three and many more times im suspicious when i say this because im a big fan of both cillian murphy who plays oppenheimer and the eccentric but surgical director christopher nolan however this one who appeared on this years posters is certainly a heavyweight in films which i enjoyed as much as if not more than the revered directors best work interstellar if it were me a simple evaluator to describe such a work in a title i would call it christopher nolans silent orchestra    final score 96
Dec 3 2023,positive,another great film from nolan took a very complicated subject matter across a threehour film and created something that never left me bored
Dec 3 2023,positive,christopher nolan nuff said
Dec 3 2023,negative,my wife and i were excited to see this movie yet very disappointed we rented it the first night available for 20 bucksthe movie is 1 hour too longi like sex scenes as much as the next guy but they were out of place the story was disjointed and hard to followit was one of these movies that you just knew would be greatand then it absolutely was notsad
Dec 3 2023,negative,this is a three hour borefest one dimensional acting from cillian murphy about 300 other characters many of which doing horrible accents and a story about links to communism that no one asked for this movie failed at every aspect it could fail at and was just plain boring and hard to get through many paid and fake reviews were clearly made to draw people to the theatres during the long writers strike save your money oppenheimer was a dud 15 stars
Dec 3 2023,positive,a 3 hour incoherent ramble
Dec 3 2023,positive,an amazing treat of spectacle history and thoughtprovoking presentation  i came away with a sense of sombre respect and reflection a must watch
Dec 3 2023,positive,excellent how was it really like to work on the device that will end the world sobering
Dec 3 2023,positive,wow is this movie too long its good but they could have easily cut a half hour off
Dec 3 2023,negative,unless you already know the story of oppenheimer dont bother watching
Dec 3 2023,positive,its rare that a movie of this length would keep me engaged i was enthralled wirh every moment of this masterpiece
Dec 3 2023,positive,did not do a review for this due to my solidarity with the wga strike but this is a great fantastic compelling and intense film that even still has my body go completely numb during certain scenes definitely a film of a lifetime and one that everyone should see at some point
Dec 3 2023,positive,excellent movie the suspense was palpable throughout the entire film one of the best films of the year
Dec 2 2023,positive,an intense and surprisingly fast moving 3 hour movie about the american scientist who was tasked with building an atomic bomb before the nazis didoppenheimer very effectively captures the scary reality of what was at stake during ww2great performances all aroundnolan made a very entertaining film about a depressing time in world history
Dec 2 2023,positive,i stopped watching halfway through i guess its a great movie but not for me threestars for a movie that i lost interest in over and over
Dec 2 2023,neutral,personally dont want to make a controversial thing here but the film is very overrated im not one of the kind of people to say that often but the film is just way too long with half of it being too cinematic with barebones plot points the whole cast of actors is incredible have to say even the best they couldve chosen its just the direction of the film most of the time is strange in short its not a bad film by any means but its not the contemporary masterpiece everyone claims it is
Dec 2 2023,positive,this movie was really good the humor was good the cinematography was beautiful  the acting was amazing and the whole movie was written very well but the entire movie was focused on the making of the bomb which wasnt very interesting and the movie was more than three hours long so it felt like a three hour long biography so if you like that kind of stuff this movie is for you but i found it kind of dull
Dec 2 2023,positive,without a doubt one of the most magnificent films of the century
Dec 1 2023,negative,boring and it is a confusing mess jumping back and forward in time without telling you it is also half the movie is about the 1 month long hearing about his communist connections and is as boring as that sounds
Dec 1 2023,positive,such a great piece of movie history being made before my eyes i didnt mind the duration of the film because i was so captivated by what was happening on the screen history buffs and movie goers alike will love this movie
Dec 1 2023,positive,theres nothing i can say about this movie thats already been said its a brilliant work of art that leaves you enthralled and engaged from the moment it starts until the very last frame
Dec 1 2023,positive,to me everything about this movie is perfect cinema acting score sound design pacing plot the use of color vs black and white the fact the trinity test splits the movie perfectly in two and the list goes on and on this movie is a masterpiece and my favorite of the year it very well may prove to be my favorite nolan movie and thats saying something for one of the best directors of all time
Dec 1 2023,positive,ive saw this movie three times in theaters and every single time it left an impact on me thats all that needs to be said about this movie
Dec 1 2023,neutral,its an engrossing story that you think would be easy to direct but somehow christopher nolan and his editors managed to stuffup again with their nonsensical approach to timeline sequencing and sound editing  i dont understand why you cant just follow a sequential timeline and why you cant suspend the orchestra during key scenes with important dialogue ive grown tired of your style and wont be watching anymore movies directed by you
Dec 1 2023,positive,commendable performances that manage to salvage an otherwise disappointing directorial effort the cast is powerful and convincing immersing the audience in the characters experiences and emotions the actors commitment to their roles adds depth and authenticity to the film creating a connection  unfortunately the downfall lies in its direction despite the stellar performances the director fails to provide an engaging narrative the pacing feels uneven with scenes often lacking a clear sense of purpose or direction the storytelling lacks focus making it challenging to fully invest in nolans choices in terms of visual style and overall tone distract from the performances leaving the film feeling unfulfilled
Dec 1 2023,positive,this movie was extremely well done extremely interesting lots of great actors overall a great movie to make you think and convince you to dig into the history of the bomb
Dec 1 2023,positive,it was an hour too long and could have easily been condensed with all the super long boring scenes
Nov 30 2023,positive,this movie is just like wow the scenes are amazing and its great if your interested in historical topics like this
Nov 30 2023,positive,best film of the year
Nov 30 2023,positive,possibly the best nolan movie beautiful cinematography fantastic acting writing is nearperfect as always must watch loved it
Nov 30 2023,positive,this is the best movie ive seen this year an absolute triumph of filmmaking it is 3 hours long and i was captivated every moment the mix of emotions you get watching this film is crazy brilliantly acted masterfully directed and the score is out of this world i was excited to see this and it blew my expectations out of the water 1010
Nov 30 2023,negative,a grossly overrated film the only people praising it are either physics lovers or nolan fanboys who worship the very earth he walks over according to me nolans films have been becoming less engrossing with time and the only good ones were inception and the dark knight the first half was mildly entertaining with a few wow moments celebrating oppenheimers genius but the second half was stretched and prolonged almost entirely featuring the trial nolan couldnt seem to find enough of oppenheimers life to fill in the blank spaces of the movie personally visual spectacle moments of the explosion and mushroom cloud do not matter if there is no story which keeps me engaged cilian murphys performance is overrated and was a recreation of scarecrow with those dry lips
Nov 30 2023,positive,am i the only one that feels the background music was often way too loud very distracting from the dialogue
Nov 30 2023,positive,oppenheimer 2023  yes to paraphrase another review  this is essentially just 3 hours of people talking albeit with a whos who of hollywood a list actors    the pacing is incredible and the 3 hour runtime flies by achieved by making this less of a biopic and more of a political courtroom drama    i didnt expect much going in to be honest as based on the runtime id expected a slow plodding affair with excessive backstory i shouldve known better    the only complaint i have is there wasnt much emotional weight to this film but then again given how much the protagonist tries to distance himself from his emotions maybe that was the point      ludwig g√∂ranssons hauntingly simple sounding yet insanely difficult to perform score fits perfectly    9210 a
Nov 30 2023,positive,please give christopher nolan the oscar this is his best movie it is an absolute masterpiece cillian murphy deserves to win the oscar too for best performance it has a fantastic cast the cinematography is breathtaking im proud to own this wonderful film on blu ray christopher nolan is the greatest of all time i loved every moment of it
Nov 29 2023,neutral,i was actually looking forward to watch this movie unfortunately i have to say i was rather disappointed when the movie came to an end    one of the most impressive projects ever undertaken filled with scientifical challenges and performed under immense pressure    that is what the movie should have been all about unfortunately it is not instead all the science challenges and achievements are just glossed over and we are feed three long boring hours about political machinations and his sex life    that is not what i was expecting and it is definitely not what i wanted to watch    trust hollywood to turn science into a bloody soaplike drama    christopher nolan is definitely not a person that should be tasked with making a science or history movie his dunkirk was underwhelming to say the least and interstellar was both a poor movie and a joke when it came to science    i guess i should have lowered my expectations when i saw they gave the movie to him
Nov 29 2023,positive,stunning absolutely stunning
Nov 29 2023,positive,oscar worthy my only regret after seeing this movie was that i didnt see it in the 70mm imax the performances of cillian murphy robert downey jr emily blunt and the rest of the cast are captivating the heavyhitting score of ludwig g√∂ransson and the use of practical effects just sells the story painting the tragedy behind the genius of j robert oppenheimer it feels an insult to call this a movie as its more of a cinematic experience
Nov 29 2023,positive,oppenheimer delivers in story visuals and performances a true masterpiece
Nov 29 2023,positive,another triumph of christopher nolan
Nov 28 2023,negative,i was expecting dry and stale but this one went above and beyond the first hour of the movie is basically just a  boring portrayal of oppenheimers awful lovelife why or how this movie garnered such high acclaim is beyond me
Nov 28 2023,positive,a really good movie a real must watch
Nov 28 2023,positive,my rating is 710  but i didnt liked is about genocide america didnt had to kill half a million of people just to say they were badass  the movie itself is good but i didnt really enjoyed finished it felling small and uneasy bad feelings about it  i didnt liked the story and the fact that the director change a lot of facts
Nov 28 2023,positive,great movie when he imagined how people melted it really happened the prisoners were brought alive for the radiation experimentsthe film also showed how big a persons ego can be
Nov 28 2023,positive,oppenheimers tale  drifts long lost in its own plot  good yet lost its way
Nov 28 2023,positive,absolutely amazing movie great to see something new thats not all special effects great acting by the whole cast
Nov 28 2023,neutral,oh this could have been a great movie the jump cut editing style and dialogue is cloying and and extremely unnatural in a lot of scenes cant they just cut and write these things remotely like real people talk and interact the rightbackatyou dialogue for hollywood movies is intended to make the audience feel smart but it ends up making me feel the writers were idiots
Nov 27 2023,positive,although there isnt much action in the movie its still engaging it could benefit from some trimming but overall its fantastic
Nov 27 2023,negative,the movie is incredibly overhyped and incredibly confusing i recently watched a documentary on oppenheimer that was far more engaging
Nov 27 2023,neutral,wish it focused more on the creation and use if the bomb as well as its terrible after effects instead of just the man who managed it
Nov 27 2023,positive,magnificient movie great plot characters and some of the imagery is just magical 
Nov 27 2023,positive,i have always had an interest in quantum mechanics physics and the harnessing of nuclear energy for both power and weapons so this movie was pretty much made for me i had a lot of anticipation for it christopher nolan does what he always does he creates drama and excitement through beautiful cinematography music and storytelling this movie was pretty much exactly what i expected which was a slight letdown as i felt like it could have surpassed my expectations with a few adjustments the movie does about the best you can to dramatize equations and theoretical physics which usually just takes place in a boring manner it does a decent job of wresting with the moral dilemma of creating and using the weapons but i do wish that this was expanded upon more i also think that the russiancold war themes were unnecessary i would have rather had more time spent on the lead up and consequences of the actual usage in japan this was not explored nearly enough in my opinion but all in all the movie does a great job of showing the process and drama of that time period and what it meant to be the first to create a terrible weapon
Nov 27 2023,positive,great film perfect best film of 2023 imo and one of my personal favourites perfect edge of your seat film
Nov 27 2023,positive,a film for adults    this is an excellent movie
Nov 27 2023,positive,a great film indeed but unnecessarily long its not even nolans best creation
Nov 27 2023,positive,great picture to watch
Nov 27 2023,positive,great story telling very well paced the music is absolutely incredible christopher nolan once again has delivered a masterpiece
Nov 27 2023,negative,that is a terrible movie  a terrible script that pairs well with terrible acting  well more like over acting    it should reflect one of the most difficult times in american history and the writers treat it as if it were merely a soap opera    i want my money back
Nov 27 2023,positive,this movie is incredibly well done and nolans best film every piece of dialogue and scene was completed with incredible intention and precision cillian murphy should win every award for his performance its 3 hours long but the pace is quick and keeps you engaged
Nov 27 2023,positive,solid on nearly all fronts with the exception of pacing this couldve been a lot shorter or at least focused on the more climactic scenes longer special props to rdj he completely nailed this role
Nov 27 2023,positive,it was interesting  artfully done
Nov 26 2023,positive,its not my favorite from nolan but its made with passion and love and the performances are the ones that will win the oscar without a doubt
Nov 26 2023,positive,how a freacking biography documentary became a chef doeuvre
Nov 26 2023,positive,its a great movie i just felt that everything happens so fast and the timelines can be quite confusing at first it really wasnt necessary to complicate things
Nov 26 2023,positive,christopher nolan managed to create a film with a heavy and dense subject matter into an incredible epic biopic that will keep you on the edge of your seat
Nov 26 2023,positive,this movie should have been 2 hr not 3 hr  its bloated   too many scenes drag on   the cutting back and forth between timelines is confusing   the plot regarding the protagonists alleged communist ties and treason was poorly explained and played out  overrated movie
Nov 26 2023,positive,fast paced great acting flawless film making makes this movie the best of 2023
Nov 26 2023,positive,its an interesting retelling of the story from one mans perspective however i dont fully understand some of the cuts and back and forth they didnt hit as hard as they were intended to
Nov 26 2023,neutral,the total does not equal the sum of the parts the story is flat and uninteresting this movie had everything going for it except a compelling story so disappointing
Nov 26 2023,positive,ÿ®ŸáŸÜÿ∏ÿ±ŸÖ ŸÅ€åŸÑŸÖ ÿ®ÿß ÿ™ÿØŸà€åŸÜ ŸÅŸàŸÇÿßŸÑÿπÿßÿØŸá Ÿà ŸÖÿ®ÿ™⁄©ÿ±ÿßŸÜŸá Ÿà ŸÜ€åÿ≤ ÿ™ŸÇÿ∑€åÿπ ÿπÿßŸÑ€å €å⁄© ÿ≠ŸÇ€åŸÇÿ™ ÿ±ÿß ÿ®ÿ±ÿß€å ŸÖÿß ŸÖŸÑŸÖŸàÿ≥ ŸÖ€å⁄©ŸÜÿØ ⁄ÜŸÜÿßŸÜ⁄ÜŸá ÿØÿ± ÿßŸÜÿ™Ÿáÿß€å ÿØÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜ ÿ≠ÿ≥ Ÿàÿ≠ÿ¥ÿ™ŸÜÿß⁄© ŸÜÿ™€åÿ¨Ÿá ÿßŸÜŸÅÿ¨ÿßÿ± ÿ®ŸÖÿ® ÿßÿ™ŸÖ€å ŸÜ€åÿ≤ ŸÖŸÑŸÖŸàÿ≥ ŸÖ€åÿ®ŸàÿØ ŸÖÿ≥ŸÑŸÖÿß ÿßŸÖÿ™€åÿßÿ≤ Ÿà ÿØÿ±ÿ¨Ÿá ŸÖÿßŸÜÿØ⁄Øÿßÿ±€å ÿß€åŸÜ ÿßÿ´ÿ± ÿ≥€åŸÜŸÖÿß€å€å ÿßŸàÿ¨ ŸÖ€å⁄Øÿ±ŸÅÿ™    chatgpt translation  the film in my opinion conveys a tangible truth through exceptional and innovative editing as well as superb segmentation if the horrifying feeling resulting from the atomic bomb explosion were also tangible at the end of the story undoubtedly the rating and lasting impact of this cinematic work would reach its peak
Nov 26 2023,positive,intense cerebral wellcasted movie about the mental and emotional toll the invention and planning of the atomic bomb took upon principal developer robert oppenheimer during wwiis famous manhattan project  this movie lends itself more as a psychological study of what it cost him and the other scientists when their calculations were realized and theyd created an unfathomably powerful novel weapon and helped knowingly loose its destructive power upon the world with the awareness that they would abdicate control to the military and eventually the aec as a new kind of wartime overwhelming defense tactic to defeat hitler      militarily there were no easy answers at that time only slightly less awful choices to be made  i dont envy any of them as their ethical and moral struggles were intensely personal profoundly painful and very conflicted      this movie shows the private and personal as well as the professional toll this event had on oppenheimer specifically  it cost him a great deal and he was never easy with the outcome  when he voiced these concerns during the mccarthy era in the 1950s he was labelled unamerican and a possible communist sympathizer before he was drummed out of the project by less thoughtful government hacks       not a lot about the bomb or its destruction but more about the damage it did to the designers and creators along the way  well done thoughtful take on the choices we must make to achieve peace in the world
Nov 26 2023,negative,i have never been so disappointed in a movie in my entire life  given the high ratings i expected a masterpiece yet i have been watching the clock hoping this is over soon however it keeps going and makes no sense here are the issues too many stars and familiar faces each person that pops up i have flashes of other things they have been in this movie needed some no names even small roles have oscar winners emily blunt completely miscast she doesnt fit in movie way too long story is really confusing and hard to follow    this movie is awful
Nov 26 2023,positive,second best film of the year
Nov 26 2023,positive,stunning movie that hits hard and keeps on coming back weeks after watching it this is what cinema should be amazing actors well written audio an cinematography are all on the highest level
Nov 26 2023,negative,i really dont understand why people likes this movie so much i find it quite interesting till the bomb explosion about the bomb engendering and building but the comunist story is very boring
Nov 25 2023,positive,another crime against humanity made by the usa they never cease to amaze me what else will come in the future
Nov 25 2023,positive,look good sounded good but i could never consider nolan to be one of the great directors i think he over complicates things and ever since tenet i lose interest half way through his films i was really excited about this film and i have read lots of books regarding area 51 he is similar to being at a party with a member of mensa constanty trying to prove how great there iq is at first it is impressive then it becomes a boor
Nov 25 2023,positive,its the same quality that youll find in schindlers list and just as important debatably the best film christopher nolan has ever made 
Nov 25 2023,positive,enjoyable scenes with great performances
Nov 25 2023,neutral,it was an okay movie worth watching  time dragged a bit for such a long movie  visually enjoyable  solid acting  i believe it was hyped a little
Nov 25 2023,neutral,this a pretty good biopic but nothing different or earth shatteringly good theres no really deep meaning to the movie much like our lives often sadly just a man who was complex like the things he created
Nov 25 2023,positive,i enjoyed nolan made a 3hr court room drama relatively engaging
Nov 25 2023,positive,the best film of 2023 christopher nolan has done it again with his latest release of oppenheimer oppenheimer is a mind bending epic biopic of the father of the atom bomb now please note this movie might not be for everyone because it is extremely dense with heavy dialogue and stays true to the real life story in life of oppenheimer those who are expecting an action extravagansa will be sadly disappointed i really enjoyed the visual journey that this film takes you on and it is amazing to me that nolan used zero cgi shots in this film this star studded movie showcases some amazing oscar worthy performances from all of its leads with cillian murphy roberty downey jr and emily blunt even the smaller roles bring all of their a games i got the opportunity to watch this in 70mm imax and when i say this is truly how nolan wanted you to see it as intended i mean it the movie was breathtaking and such an important film to see in this day in age christopher nolans oppenheimer gets a perfect 5 out of 5 for me also i would rank it as one of nolans best films ever
Nov 25 2023,positive,one of the greatest movies to ever come out its thrilling enticing and really quite unforgettable i really cant think of anything that comes close definitely a should watch                                       ps watch it on shrooms
Nov 25 2023,negative,the movie the actors and the storyline was all good the way over the top loudness of the background music destroys the whole thing it needs to be completely  remixed and rereleased as it is now i would never pay to see another one of nolans films yes the music is that bad if you really want to see it turn the sound off and just read the subtitles
Nov 25 2023,negative,all star cast great acting interesting and important story but i really felt like it was all over the placego go go go go i did not enjoy it it felt like it was 5 second scenes the movie almost felt like a long trailer to me constant bouncing to different scenes time periods and strictly visual scenes everyones even talking so fast constantly im an intelligent person that is very good at math and science but if you are not youre definitely not going  like it i was so excited but unfortunately i was very disappointed  i dont want to persuade anyone not to watch it im just curious to what other people think i also cant stand when they never stop the background music the whole entire movie and this music was tense im sure there will be a good number of media professionals tystk feel that it is an excellent work of art which it is but i think the main stream person is not really going to like it  they will probably watch it because of the cast cilian murphy is great as usual one of the best actors of our time right now
Nov 25 2023,positive,the world forever changes    oppenheimer is a 2023 epic biographical thriller film written and directed by christopher nolan      its very good   id recommend it     an interesting history biopic unfortunately there are some scenes which get a bit too bogged down and others which are a bit hotchpotch     the story of j robert oppenheimers role in the development of the atomic bomb during world war ii
Nov 25 2023,positive,masterpiece of a film which fills viewers with an existential terror and dread unlike any other
Nov 25 2023,positive,i read the biography and this nolan masterpiece nails it  its a cerebral and nuanced film brilliantly directed in a non chronological manner   absolutely sublime but im a science nerd  my parents are both of science  this is not for everyone
Nov 25 2023,positive,nolans masterpiecea visual delight
Nov 25 2023,neutral,oppenheimer is a how its made story told via recaps several liberties were taken with the story that could have been left out as they were oddly inserted  overall though this is a very interesting historical film that captivates the viewers making them want to learn more about this time period
Nov 25 2023,negative,the casts is amazing it just the story is not for me
Nov 25 2023,negative,wow what a piece of garbage  the sound editing was awful  background music overpowered the spoken audio  actors whispered for no reason  completely insane visual sequences were supposed to convey emotion when it was already obviously conveyed by the actors own expression  the atomic explosion was unrealistic even with mountains of stock footage available  way too long  the star power thrown at this piece of trash couldnt save it and christopher nolan shouldnt be consulted for another movie for quite some time until he improves his trade craft  still not sure what they story was trying to convey that could be easily read about in five minutes on the internet
Nov 24 2023,negative,the dialogue was awfully boring  the foot stomping which was supposed to create  tension in viewers was extremely  annoying     the overall pace of the movie was disappointing as it certainly couldve been wrapped up in two hours or less    i only enjoyed matt damons character portrayal     the nude scenes didnt add anything  to the story overall  this movie was a huge disappointment i cant fathom it having a 91 rating in rotten tomatoes     please skip this movie
Nov 24 2023,positive,great film with great actors and views  its a definite watch
Nov 24 2023,positive,simply amazing movie
Nov 24 2023,positive,everything about this film is brilliant    from the writing directing cinematography and the most amazing soundtrack a pure masterpiece    the only advice watching this film would be that slight reading on oppenheimer and his story before watching the film would massively help to understand all the nuances of the film
Nov 24 2023,negative,dragging and boring in a lot of parts good towards the end but i wish it was a lot shorter also quite hard to keep up with all the character names
Nov 24 2023,negative,three hours of my life i wont get back  the acting was excellent by all and that is where the compliments end  the movie was a tad over 3 hours long and very easily could have ben edited down  the script was tedious and the back and forth throughout the entire movie was too much  for awhile i was unsure what was going on because of all the back and forth in time and the editing was choppy  you had a chance for some good cinematography in europe and new mexico but you blew it  since there were no other movies of substance made this piece of poop will probably grab a couple of oscars
Nov 24 2023,negative,this movie was far too long and lacked entertainment value i could tell the acting was well done but beyond that it was a very dull 3 hours with too much dialogue and nothing happening the majority of my family fell asleep unfortunately i was awake through the whole thing
Nov 24 2023,positive,hope they make a sequel d
Nov 24 2023,positive,amazing makes you think great cast
Nov 24 2023,positive,oppenheimer just might be nolans magnum opus a film thats as expertly crafted as it is riveting
Nov 24 2023,positive,pretty good about 30 minutes too long
Nov 24 2023,positive,in my opinion this is one of the greatest movies ever made  the cast alone is so impressive it is difficult to mess up
Nov 24 2023,positive,could have been a lot shorter for all the hype i got bored at points
Nov 24 2023,positive,the movie was outstanding  chritopher nolan create a one of the best biography drama  i m sure that no one other director can what nolan did  it is just a great piece of art 
Nov 24 2023,negative,terrible confusing actors are mumbling not in chronological order cannot hear what is being said no story line bedlam   overhyped  got 23 of the way through and gave up  why anyone would waste their time to see this chaotic unintelligible mess is beyond me
Nov 23 2023,positive,can certainly be convoluted at times but the story is so engrossing youll eventually find your way back into the experience the performances are exceptional and what a starstudded cast of characters one of nolans brightest achievements
Nov 23 2023,negative,as a huge fan of c nolan i was completely disappointed with oppenheimer  i was very excited to see it and even ensured i had perfect centre seats at imax for the viewing  unfortunately i found the movie incredibly almost surreally boring and i should note that i am a big history buff and almost fell sleep with the incessant chatter that runs the entire movie  even the exciting part the actual bomb experimentation was hohum at best i really dont see why this movie needed imax treatment at all i sat through the whole thing but quire frankly regret doing so in hindsight that being 2020    being an obvious outlier along with mr logan in this opinion is something that astounds me even more than how dreadful the viewing experience was for me kudos for the hype and marketing that has done a supreme number on this one for sure  still look forward to nolans next one though
Nov 23 2023,positive,i appreciate when a movie is straight to the point this one didnt even feel like 3h it held your attention throughout the entire movie very good actors wellpresented heartbreaking moments makes you question your existence
Nov 23 2023,negative,lets feel bad for the bombers
Nov 23 2023,negative,the editor fell asleep the story does not merit three hours of montage
Nov 23 2023,positive,good cinema well presented
Nov 23 2023,positive,one of christopher nolans best movie absolutely mind blowing
Nov 23 2023,positive,masterpiece christopher nolan did a fantastic job with this picture the acting is very good cillian murphy is spectacular emily blunt is a scene stealer robert downey jr is good this is one of the best movies of the decade so far
Nov 23 2023,negative,watched the first hour and found it very dull  barely anything to do with the science of building the bomb  conspiracy rubbish about security  wasted opportunity
Nov 23 2023,positive,nolans profound booktofilm interpretation gushes with captivating performances images and soundall worthy of recognition as one of the greatest cinematic experiences of all time
Nov 23 2023,positive,visually stunning  the emotion of the characters is translated to the viewer by the use of sound often unsettling or overwhelming or chaotic to portray oppenheimers feelings if overwhelm and cognitive dissonance definitely recommend watching in a theater or with surround sound
Nov 23 2023,positive,actually i didnt really liked as the other ones but it was great
Nov 22 2023,positive,others angry as usual christopher nolans directing capabilities are on point in this film  every scene is packed with something that contributes to the overall marking theme and story of the film every character feels place perfectly in the narrative and for a history movie it does pretty well at making you forget that  the problem with the score of course is absolutely phenomenal and overall this is truly a wonderful film experience my only gripe is sometimes the pacing feels either a little too slow or in overdrive but does not attract away from the film alive  a treat in imax
Nov 22 2023,positive,it was a silent movie cause i like this
Nov 22 2023,positive,oscar best picture  oscar best actor    strangely the utterly long scenes depicting discussions between lawyers and old crooked politicians add a lot to the movie although the parts about creating the bomb itself are better    great actors although damons role is a bit too cartoonish
Nov 22 2023,negative,underwhelming boring and complex
Nov 22 2023,negative,there were elements of it that were great from a filmmaking perspective but as a whole it was just not that interesting or entertaining
Nov 22 2023,negative,total mess constant jumping between storylines and flashbacks feels overwhelming it would be fine if every such episode was adding to the story and was interesting to watch but most of those sequences feel out of place and disconnected from each other the dialogues are rushed like they have been edited to include as many words as possible per minute which leaves an impression of shallowness while trying to look very meaningful its unclear why such a style or editing of dialogues has been selected for a slow paced historical drama like this one wouldnt this movie benefit more from somewhat slower and better edited conversations that carry a bit more emotions and meaning thats a disaster for a movie that is relying on dialogue sequences so heavily and is basically built around them the music and other sound effects are constantly overthetop and are distracting from what is going on oppenheimer is trying to present itself as something significant deep and meaningful but fails to do so and instead strikes as something rather shallow and pretentious to make it even more dull  cillian murphy only has one facial expression i could imagine him playing a detective in some nottooexpensive neonoire movie or tv show but trying to portray a nuclear scientist meh
Nov 22 2023,positive,for the love of god someone petition christopher nolan to make more science orriented films cause from where im sitting it seems like hes the only one who gets the final product as close to the genuine artifact as possible we need more films exploring the cosmos i would love to see people my age and younger turn their heads back to the sky instead of grovelling in the dirt i genuinely feel as though we could inspire a new generation to reach outward from our little corner in the cosmos with engaging films like oppenheimer and interstellar
Nov 22 2023,negative,idk man  why in the world did this thing get a 90 rating here  this movie is a massive throwback movie  he thinks about the past while working on the bomb then it goes to his relationship to his lover it does that a lot and it is boring af when it does  just endless throwback conversations with herblah blah blah  then the movie is mainly about the trials and tribulations he goes through to get the bomb made  it isnt as exciting as it sounds  einstein makes an appearance its basically a nothing scene  boring is the word for this flick  go watch this thing for yourself
Nov 22 2023,positive,loved the visuals and the formatting of the story c murphy is obviously great in the role
Nov 22 2023,positive,i believe a good movie will make you think and think deeply about a lot of things happened before and happening right now the movie oppenheimer is one of such movies i havent seen such movies for years and glad us can finally make one
Nov 22 2023,positive,great movie with amazing cinematography and tense moments the only issue i had with the movie would be the backandforth elements and how the movie was cut together i get that they did that on purpose to prove a point but i still think it would have been better going from points a b and c rather than jumping from a to c back to a to b and so forth
Nov 22 2023,positive,best movie of the year no question
Nov 21 2023,positive,visually stunning but the storyline is hard to follow unless you know the history well i luckily had someone who did and tipped me along the movie so that i could appreciate who the various characters being introduced were why their brief appearances mattered  i loved the plot sequencing which is not chronological but builds the narrative quite strongly  it is not much about physics but more about people emotions passions values
Nov 21 2023,positive,its a fucking 1010
Nov 21 2023,positive,a three hour movie is too much to sit through especially when its 90 dialogue
Nov 21 2023,positive,it was a long 3 hours i knew about this story but didnt know the back story of it i like how it explain everything it happen with the atom bomb it is a great movie to go see for history
Nov 21 2023,positive,absolutely amazing movie everything you could enjoy in one package lust history and a psychological roller coaster the use of color works to portray objective and subjective information is ingenious this film will have you arm wrestle with morality in one hand and thirst for scientific advancement in the other i am a huge science fan and love movies that make me think and this one certainly kept me at the edge of my seat i one hundred percent recommend the watch
Nov 21 2023,positive,absolutely brilliant movie may not be if u dont like talkers storywise its just brilliant
Nov 21 2023,positive,movie is absolutely perfect and wellknowledgeable on historical events and such great movie but not in my opinion the best casting 455
Nov 21 2023,positive,oscar worthy film audio is incredible
Nov 21 2023,neutral,i always suspected that he wasnt a real author now that ive seen dunkirk and oppenheimer im sure of it in this film nolan delegates much of the ambiguity of the character to the somewhat enigmatic mimicry of the good cillian murphy but when he tries to really explain the ethicalmoral concerns of the man of science he does not go beyond very schematic captions that caress the territories of kitsch
Nov 21 2023,positive,i saw oppenheimer in vmax we dont have imax in australia and the only 70mm screen in brisbane is tiny and i cannot stop thinking about it this movie was stunning oppenheimer is both an immense technical achievement and an intense mature drama the trinity test sequence is possibly one of the most thrilling nerveracking scenes of the last 10 years and i barely realised i was holding my breath and squeezing the arms of my chair until my apple watch gave me a high heart rate alert that was definitely a new experience for me lacking any real poor performances every actor brought their agame and seeing continual that guy actors appear throughout was really fun cillian murphy was enthralling and completely believable as the complicated confused and tortured oppenheimer and is surely a shooin for best actor emily blunt was excellent in the few scenes she was given to really shine and robert downey jr was electric as lewis strauss     the ending left me in an emotional and existential puddle on the floor after i was finally able to loosen up my body and relax i need to see it again hopefully in theatres but i cannot think of a single thing i didnt like this is christopher nolans masterpiece and this needs to be seen in the biggest loudest movie theatre you can find    55
Nov 21 2023,positive,this title should have been rated pg13   i dont know the point of the rating it has it can be more appropriate and still be great
Nov 21 2023,positive,this is probably the best movie to come out since blade runner 2049 and interstellar  everything thats wrong with hollywood has been addressed in this movie i want more movies like this that are historical and well thought out rather than being a cash grab this movie respects the audience and expects them to have a basic understanding of the historical events before entering the theater for people who know nothing of the historical events i can see them being very confused but for those who love the history of the manhattan project and have studied it for years this movie is absolutely incredible
Nov 20 2023,positive,this was a movie star studded cast great character study has to be one of the most interesting peopledecisions in the history of civilization 
Nov 20 2023,negative,incredibly hard to follow with all the jumping around
Nov 20 2023,positive,awesome but it was so so so loud i plugged my ears for a solid 40 minutes
Nov 20 2023,positive,perfection my man delivered a masterpiece  christopher nolan
Nov 20 2023,positive,in a film so intimate and immersive at times that it almost feels unsettling to watch christopher nolan tells the tale of the flawed and haunted genius oppenheimer    oppenheimer unquestionably represents a high point in cinematic achievement you feel like the explosions are resonating through your bones thanks to the sound design and the mindbending ludwig g√∂ransson score    it is difficult to predict what effect it will have but the film and its execution feel as monumental and significant as its subject oppenheimer is a film that demands to be seen in all its glory and is only truly appreciated at its finest when viewed on the big screen
Nov 20 2023,positive,another masterpiece from nolan we need more movies like this
Nov 20 2023,positive,theres only one word to describe this film and that word is cinematic
Nov 20 2023,positive,impeccable there is nothing wrong with this wonder it is an epic beautiful and captivating movie it deserves a 1010
Nov 20 2023,positive,it didnt feel like a 3hour movie due to the great pacing and dialogue
Nov 20 2023,positive,rarely do you see a movie that raises serious questions and yet is really entertaining
Nov 20 2023,positive,oppenheimer directed by christopher nolan and featuring an outstanding ensemble cast including cillian murphy robert downey jr emily blunt florence pugh matt damon rami malek and more is a visually stunning and intellectually ambitious film with its masterful storytelling breathtaking visuals and compelling performances it deserves a solid 45 rating however the third act encounters some pacing issues and struggles to wrap up certain plot threads leaving a few unresolved elements that may leave some viewers wanting more closure nonetheless oppenheimer remains a captivating and thoughtprovoking exploration of its subject matter
Nov 19 2023,positive,great acting and a very well handled telling of a sensitive part of history cillian murphy was a revelation and the story moved at a decent pace visually terrific but at times a little jumbled with the plot moving forward and back and einsteins appearance was a little gimmicky and added nothing to the overall feel still very much enjoyed but not quite 5 stars
Nov 19 2023,positive,interesting film but way too many parallel narrative plains  and too many stars involvedwith each requesting its own space
Nov 19 2023,positive,overall it was a captivating film and theres no shortage of praise for the things it does well so im mainly gonna talk about the negatives the movie is surprisingly very fastpaced in fact a little too much so because so much dialogue comes at you very quickly and its difficult for a casual observer to follow without having prior historical knowledge of oppenheimers life     in typical hollywood fashion the film goes a bit over the top in terms of trying to dramatize and make cool events which were in actual fact very dry and mundane administrative hearings and interviews which would bore you to death if you watched the actual footage also there are some really explicit sex scenes and sexual imagery which are totally unnecessary and ridiculous they tried to make everything about these events sexy and epic well cillian murphy is indeed sexy but oppenheimer wasnt sexy he was basically a frail mentally ill nerd so theres a bit of disconnect there between the film and the actual events in that respect     finally i think perhaps the greatest failing of the film is that it doesnt depict any of the destruction of the bombs on japan oppenheimer was haunted by his creation because of its destructive power but they didnt establish its destructive power on actual human beings to any significant extent
Nov 19 2023,negative,booringheimer gratuitous nudity missed the big picture to focus on the boring
Nov 19 2023,positive,my vote for best picture of the year
Nov 19 2023,positive,absolutely amazing for a 3 hr movie it was paced very well and it didnt feel like it was that long great cinematography and sound effects 
Nov 19 2023,negative,flabby and confused
Nov 19 2023,negative,draggingly boring movie that didnt catch my attention
Nov 19 2023,positive,oppenheimer is one of the best christopher nolan professionally made films everything from the cinematography to the acting the story and the score is a masterpiece  this is not a family movie it is a deep character study of robert j oppenheimer and will stay that way nolans oppenheimer is precisely why we go to the cinemas it was a phenomenal experience at the theaters on my behalf especially in imax format
Nov 19 2023,positive,best movie ive ever seen it has excellent music art photography script but what the movie takes is the performance of cillian murphy
Nov 18 2023,positive,a wonderful cinematic film as always another one bite the dust chris nolan as always gave masterpiece of a film  the story is very compelling  the direction it goes through the pacing is awesome like it doesnt feel dragged at anytime the story of oppenheimer would not be delievered as good as great as nolan has presented to us  the shots of bombing and blast are really well made i really loved this film
Nov 18 2023,negative,pure garbage  hollywood circlejerk w bad acting and a very bland story  just do a documentary next time
Nov 17 2023,positive,fascinating look into the minds and personalities of one of the pivotal inventions in history  excellent acting  great pacing for such a long movie
Nov 17 2023,positive,christopher nolan it amazing
Nov 17 2023,negative,i am bewildered by the reviews this movie has received honestly i cant fathom how everyone seems to have a different opinion i watched it with a group and everyone found it confusing dull and ultimately unrewarding most were simply counting down the minutes until it was over the same disappointment occurred with the barbie movie its starting to make me question the reliability of these reviews oppenheimer had the potential for a fantastic storyline it would be interesting if people could share their thoughts after watching the movie but i must caution anyone considering it
Nov 17 2023,positive,despite the movie being a niche genre oppenheimer is able to captivate and hold the attention of audiences for the full lengthy 3 hours beautiful narrative that was taken from real world events and going deep into the psychology and motivations of not only oppenheimer but also those around him beautifully acted by every actor in the movie with fantastic cinematography    there are a few scenes i wanted to specifically mention the sex scene and the trinity test the sex scene felt so incredibly unnecessary not to mention they dropped oppenheimers most famous quote in the middle of his sex scene which felt so off its really my only criticism of the movie i honestly dont know of any reason why the scene is in the movie however the trinity test is the highlight of the movie that everyone is waiting for anyone going to see this movie has at least minimum knowledge of the trinity test through common knowledge it builds up to it the whole movie of course it works but its still an incredibly suspenseful moment that is beautifully done    absolutely one of the best movies of 2023 and ranks high up there for my personal favorites
Nov 17 2023,negative,nasty gross and boring
Nov 17 2023,positive,another great movie by nolan music and visuals were amazing however i believe the parts explaining that oppenheimer was not communist were pretty long and included some scenes that became boring after a few minutes and the movie had some unnecessary nude scenes which were not needed at all the explosion scene gave me chills scientifically accurate sound delay it was nice to experience that in real time
Nov 17 2023,positive,great movie but a bit drawn out
Nov 17 2023,negative,why was this made for imax did it really need to be 3 hours not visually appealing at all editing was the workhorse of this film as well the the nolanesque plot style if i never watched this again i wouldnt be upset
Nov 16 2023,positive,great movie but bad final never seen the big ban
Nov 16 2023,positive,it was good but too lengthy of a film to me considering what story is being told some of the female characters where not as nuanced as they could have been not uncommon in nolans films perhaps some really interesting parts leading up to its culmination with the production of an atom bomb should have been included instead of some seemingly less important parts however this might be redeemed considering that this isnt supposed to be a historical depiction
Nov 16 2023,negative,its a bit of a stinker who knew nuclear destruction could be so boring i was hoping for a decent attempt at ripping off tarkovsky and other greats alas no
Nov 16 2023,positive,absolutely amazing cinematography writing casting everything is perfect the score is brilliant i did a college project on oppenheimer and i was still just as riveted as one who had no prior knowledge of his life or the manhattan project wouldve christopher nolan is a visionary and this masterpiece turns a fascinating story into a thoroughly enjoyable film
Nov 15 2023,positive,not one of his best works unrecognisable even at many points but nolan does manage to create something intriguing towards the end
Nov 15 2023,positive,one of the greatest movies made by christopher nolan the cast was super good
Nov 15 2023,positive,this movie was not really on my list of movies to watch due to the time of three hours but i promise you that time isnt enough it goes by so quick this is one of the best movies ive seen in over 10 years
Nov 15 2023,positive,an absolutely sensational film one of the best of 2023 should win the oscar prize soon
Nov 15 2023,positive,quite possibly the best movie i have ever seen in a movie theater thank you for gifting us with this masterpiece
Nov 15 2023,positive,oppenheimer is an intelligent moviedefinitely is nolan masterpiece with excellent and powerful performances by murphy blunt  downey jr unique cinematographyscenario script and the wonderful amazing score by g√∂ransson
Nov 14 2023,positive,film review oppenheimer 2023    amateurs chase the sun and get burned a fearful line for filmmakers  but to an experienced director like christopher nolan who clearly shows us how he is similar to prometheus who stole fire from the gods and gave it to man nolan gives us this amazing cinematic achievement the film is the biopic to dr robert oppenheimer and how he creates his greatest and most deadliest weapon in history the atomic bomb    the casting is phenomenal one can not really fault that everyone brings excellent and memorable performances from the frontman cillian murphy as oppenheimer himself along with florence pugh as jean tatlock emily blunt as katherine oppenheimer to the talented robert downey jr as lewis strauss and my personal favourite benny safdie as edward teller a special shout out to the set designers and the costume departments the early to mid 1900s style to give them various feelings of being in the past eras were truly exceptional    the editing is my most favourite part of the film although the pacing of the film felt rushed like they had to quickly show you scenes and press on to the next scene quite rapidly at times it was a lot to digest the first time watching it however i cannot fault the beautiful cuts between the scenes of the film and the shots of broll of various chemical water visual effects with lights etc that really added a layer of immersion to the feelings of science and chemistry the excitement one gets when they are performing experiments and finding unique and new discoveries it showed me there are still interesting ways to transition between scenes and shots    one cannot but think the film has been a tad over hollywoodised about the man who created the atomic bomb similar to rocket man or bohemian rhapsody i understand some biopics have decided to dip into the more fictional waters for a more captivating story understandably otherwise it would probably end up as a documentary on the history channel i admit i did not really read the history books my knowledge prior of oppenheimer had pretty much come from the hilarious parody youtube rap battle of history between marvels thanos and the atomic bomb scientist oppenhimer after watching the film i felt like this biopic was somewhat glorified to a man who created a devastating weapon of mass destruction  however with how the story was told it seemed to be if we didnt build it first the enemy would have first a classic tale of for the greater good    overall i really enjoyed the film my only personal minute problem was the confusion with names for the characters trying to remember whose who again for it switches back and forth from the monochrome courtroom scene to the past colourful events yet to happen the courtroom refers to everyone by their last name while in the flashbacks everyone was referred to by their first names maybe thats just me but i was honestly confused as to who they were discussing again regardless the film was exceptional and the ending was good however i did feel very sombre to the thought after that i just witnessed the creation of the atomic bomb and knowing something that devastating was created in this world good thing i saw the barbie movie afterwards    45 stars
Nov 14 2023,positive,great story good movie could of been 45 minutes shorter
Nov 14 2023,positive,a brilliant movie oscar winner all round so good you have to see it twice immediately
Nov 14 2023,negative,boring unnecessary sex scenes completely ignores the story of the atomic bomb shameful waste of resources
Nov 14 2023,positive,challenging watch but a worth one loved it
Nov 14 2023,positive,the movie is impressive but very long and dialogue oriented
Nov 13 2023,positive,they talked a lot about the explosion scene but unfortunately it wasnt good enough 
Nov 13 2023,positive,well it was good but was it that good i doubt it they filled the historically important subjected movie with a bunch of great actors and made it last 3 hours not the biggest fan
Nov 13 2023,negative,just watch until the main story 2hr completely after that the final chapter is completely terrible when robert downey jr and jason clark acting with they character hate it wasted my time
Nov 13 2023,positive,i think this has been one of my favorite nolan films
Nov 13 2023,positive,oppenheimer is an absolute masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of conventional filmmaking delivering an unparalleled cinematic experience that will leave audiences breathless director assuming youre referring to the documentary filmmaker joshua oppenheimer has crafted a tour de force that is nothing short of a triumph in storytelling and visual artistry    from the very first frame oppenheimer grabs your attention and refuses to let go the film is a riveting exploration of assuming its a documentary on the life and work of joshua oppenheimer and his remarkable journey skillfully blending historical footage interviews and stunning visuals to create a narrative that is both informative and deeply moving    the cinematography is a work of genius capturing the essence of each moment with breathtaking precision the use of light and shadow coupled with the impeccable framing adds a layer of visual poetry to the film that elevates it to the realm of true cinematic art every shot is a testament to the directors keen eye and unwavering commitment to excellence    the soundtrack is a perfect complement to the visuals enhancing the emotional impact of the narrative the carefully curated music not only underscores the historical significance of the events depicted but also serves as a powerful emotional anchor that resonates long after the credits roll    the storytelling is where oppenheimer truly shines the directors ability to weave together multiple narratives seamlessly is nothing short of brilliant the film delves into the complexities of assuming its a documentary on a historical figure life presenting a nuanced and comprehensive portrait that leaves no stone unturned    the interviews with key figures provide invaluable insights and the way the director navigates the delicate balance between historical documentation and emotional storytelling is a testament to his storytelling prowess the pacing is impeccable keeping the audience engaged from start to finish    oppenheimer is not just a documentary its a profound and thoughtprovoking cinematic experience that challenges its viewers to reflect on the human condition morality and the consequences of our actions its a film that lingers in the mind sparking conversations and leaving a lasting impact    in conclusion oppenheimer is a triumph of filmmaking that deserves all the accolades it receives its a powerful poignant and unforgettable journey that cements the directors place as a visionary in the world of documentary filmmaking dont miss the opportunity to witness this cinematic gem  its a true masterpiece that will stand the test of time
Nov 12 2023,negative,the narrative structure is awful a hodgepodge that doesnt delve into anything a good director making a mess only the costumes and set design are saved
Nov 12 2023,positive,throughout this wikipedia like but still compelling biography of the man and the mccarthy era i kept thinking ive see this before but where of coursestrauss is the salierii to oppenheimers mozart nice try nolan but minus half a star for that otherwise a thoroughly rewarding film
Nov 12 2023,positive,after watching oppenheimer i couldnt help but feel that although the movie is hailed by many as a masterpiece i failed to grasp why   it is certainly a movie that amazed me however as it so happens with most christopher nolans movies it lacks a heart   its elegant as all of nolans movies are and it gives the audience a nostalgic trip to old the old hollywood way of making movies but somehow lacks feeling albeit honest   i can imagine that such an epic would as so many others before it can curb feeling over structure but i believe it to be more due to the cold and logical creative sensibility of its director  nonetheless it is quite a cinematic experience to behold hence my 4 stars
Nov 12 2023,positive,i enjoyed the acting and the storyline but i agree with other critics that said the movie spent too much time trying to prove that oppenheimer wasnt a communist after a while it got to be a little tedious
Nov 12 2023,positive,i really enjoy nolan movies this was a little hard to follow but i loved the visuals and story
Nov 12 2023,positive,one of the best movies in the past years the cinematography is top notch the soundtrack helps keep the momentum and the emotion of the movie and the main plot and action while obvious i believe it helps us remember about the consequences of our own actions and the fact that no matter which are your intentions good  bad people will always find a way to counter or approve you just like life ups and downs good and bads great movie top 10 of all time for me
Nov 12 2023,negative,when people become film critics it must be that their more natural and intuitive response to movies gets skewed or they review them using other parameters than  was this story told in an effective enjoyable honest way because i read some of the film critics reviews and their perspective puts it in the context of  hard to describe it  maybe film history film language and some of it i admit i dont exactly understand with a quick reading but i can tell you that oppenheimers dialogue was stilted and unnatural and rushed and too often tried too hard to be profound many scenes bore almost no relationship to what occurred moments before and after the music tries too hard to pound into our heads at a volume that nearly causes permanent hearing loss this is a very important moment and nearly every second of the 3 hours was like that oppenheimers overwhelmed wife literally gives their child away when just a few minutes before she was married to someone else and then a little while later shes portrayed as a model wife and mother with not an iota of explanation it was pretentious overly manipulative stilted and every character lacked depth except matt damon tried hard   thank you matt it was the culinary equivalent of kids breakfast cereal i almost walked out early but i just couldnt help thinking that something interesting must happen in the end with all the hype but it didnt
Nov 12 2023,positive,overrated big time its a decent drama but overblown with dialogue like it is an aaron sorkin movie definitely nolans most boring flick its also very scatterbrained constant time line juggling and scene juggling very annoying
Nov 12 2023,positive,loved this movie christopher nolan always delivers
Nov 12 2023,positive,top cast top acting well writen story it doesnt get any better than this movie that will mark a decade for sure nolan never dissapoints and is surely becoming one the most influental directors of 21st century
Nov 12 2023,positive,very well acted and exceptional story
Nov 12 2023,negative,total snoozefest cinematography and performances should be given credit here but oh my god so freakin boring three long draggy hours of absolutely nothing but people standing around talking
Nov 12 2023,positive,this is a great movie you have to pay attention because there are a lot of flashbacks and the movie includes glimpses into the future but it does not thoroughly cover the details of the bombmaking process which in my opinion is a minor downside like the people that got radiation sickness and whatnot
Nov 12 2023,positive,amazing movie the sounds the visuals and storytelling are almost perfect
Nov 11 2023,positive,a masterpiece robert downey jr and murphy gave oscar worthy performances
Nov 11 2023,positive,the movie was boring glad i seen it online free for streaming it didnt need to be three bloody hours theres a documentary which better than this movie
Nov 11 2023,positive,although not as excruciatingly self indulgent as the abysmal tenet this is a slow long unfocused and rather dry movie with the now trademark nolan hard to decipher dialogue at least the inevitable time jumping is confined to only two time periods which i suppose is an improvement not a bad film but neither is it one id care to rewatch in a hurry
Nov 11 2023,positive,only one word to describe the movie    momentuos
Nov 11 2023,positive,amazing movie both visually and for the story it recounts a must see at the movie theatre kind of film the actors are all outstanding the only negative issue is that only the main characters are fully developed and all the background or secondary characters are sketched at best overall another masterpiece from nolan
Nov 11 2023,positive,true cinema a masterpiece few come closer certain moments you forget to breathe realize you have chills all over see history unfolding through a perfect soundtrack this is the type of art that lives forever as long as forever is
Nov 10 2023,negative,i thought i was going to see a movie about the manhattan project what i got was some sort of disjointed series of flash back images seemingly from the memory of a schizophrenic thats only tangentially related to the development of nuclear weapons the fragments of this story all flowed together about as well as a river of glass attempting to crest donner pass
Nov 10 2023,positive,the film ended up being a polemic about vanity and jealously with little or no mention of the losses in japan i was disappointed that the story devolved into this space and not the morality issues if the intention was that man is pathetic in his jealously towards others then it succeeded but this film only worked when it was focused on the mission
Nov 10 2023,positive,oppenheimer emerges as a cinematic triumph boasting stellar cinematography that elevates its visual narrative to an unparalleled level the meticulous attention to historical accuracy weaves a compelling storyline that aligns seamlessly with realworld events the ensemble casts performances are noteworthy breathing authenticity into the characters complemented by a captivating soundscape that enhances the overall viewing experience    however the film grapples with a notable downsideits extensive threehour runtime this lengthy duration poses a hurdle to the movies rewatchability a crucial factor for sustained audience engagement despite the movies undeniable brilliance the reluctance to revisit such a timeintensive piece may limit its enduring appeal    the silver lining lies in the films undeniable impact underscoring the dedication of the actors the prowess of the production team and the immersive quality of its storytelling while oppenheimer might not clinch the title of your favorite its cinematic merits and historical resonance position it as a formidable entry in the realm of filmmaking
Nov 10 2023,positive,oppenheimer was an incredibly well acted movie by the entire cast murphy will absolutely be nominated for an oscar for this the movie itself is amazingly good and a story that needed to be told but it was a little long i think the movie needed to decide what it wanted to focus on and go with it rather than try to stuff oppenheimers entire life into the movie
Nov 10 2023,positive,chris nolan is truly a one of a kind director one of the most compelling movies ive seen this year
Nov 10 2023,negative,my father served in ww2 and parts of this movie are misleading   personally i think it was terrible to drop a bomb like this but the production of the movie  this movie could have been done 10 years ago when more veterans from ww2 were alive and had some input
Nov 10 2023,positive,its a fine movie but severely lacking emotion its about highly interesting subject matter and wellmade and supported by an impressive cast therefore the 3hour run time did not become an issue for me but i believe that in a few years like with most biopics no one is going to be talking about this overrated film much anymore     theres nothing special about the films structure so you wont see any of the innovations that nolans work is famous for in fact its just an oldfashioned biopic told in flashbacks that has the same usual issues for that genre a shoehorned struggle in the subjects life the hearingconflict with strauss taking liberties with the facts eg the meeting with truman who certainly had reservations about dropping the bombs or serving complete fabrications eg the conversations with einstein to tell a sexier story     storywise i didnt find the hearing to be working well as the framing narrativeconflict because it was too much about the far less interesting strauss character other directorial choices such as showing oppenheimer naked at the interrogation table are just cheap worse it carries one of director nolans trademarks by being too blockbustery and pretty much devoid of any deeper exploration of human emotion eg dunkirk has the same issues were not learning anything more detailed about oppenheimer apart from the big gestures were not getting a closer look about what kind of man he was other than that hes conflicted about having created the bomb expressed with graphical overlays and threatening sounds or that hes very sad his ex died a good example is that in its threehour running time we learn little about his family life he interacts with his children for literally just a few seconds on screen it would be interesting to me to see how he sees his own family in relation to the development of this terrible bomb in fact was never emotionally moved or touched by anything shown on screen it just feels more like a dramatized documentary    the director also chooses not to show the effects of the weapon on a reallife city maybe he thought it would be inappropriate but this also ignores the victims who are now just a footnote   finally on a small note i found the trinity test visuals underwhelming due to nolans in this case misplaced insistence on practical effects    in conclusion for me the main interest of this movie is the subject matter which was already a given and the production quality its fine but certainly not unmissable nor a masterpiece just fine
Nov 10 2023,positive,yet another great work from the master only he could make this film the script was so to the point i couldnt take my eyes off the screen for a minute not to mention the performances and the music even though hans didnt make it   i enjoyed every minute of it and im still wondering how people could prefer the bullshit barbie to this
Nov 10 2023,negative,sad to say this but nolans oppenheimer is underwhelming the soundtrack during the entire film was very annoying  it takes away from the conversations being had at any moment  how amateurish of nolan oppenheimers story is a great piece of history and this movie had ridiculous visuals and noise  for no reasonable purpose other than it looks cool maybe i really dont know this movie has one of the best cast of any movie made in the past 50 years like i needed another reason to love emily blunt but it cant save nolans direction of an art piece instead of a higher quality film like dunkirk or better yet the imitation game directed by morten tyldum
Nov 10 2023,positive,fascinating story  extremely well done 
Nov 10 2023,negative,interesting but the explosion that you were  supposed to feel through the screen was pretty standard boring movie but good story
Nov 10 2023,positive,eh it was good but not at all near christopher nolans best
Nov 10 2023,negative,boring its a lame movie with old white men talking for 99 of the time one disappointing explosion it left everyone confused and failed horribly to explain what was happening also there are so many unnecessary scenes of babies crying extremely loud for no reason 010 waste of time 3 hours of my life that i wish i could get back
Nov 9 2023,positive,it was fine didnt need to be shot on imax whatsoever its a slow moving character piece that was entirely too long at getting the point across also nolan should credit the hundreds of vfx workers that worked on this movie instead of belittling their involvement to make himself look better kind of sad
Nov 9 2023,negative,this movie is unwatchable boring it would have been a let down as ae special
Nov 9 2023,positive,the story the acting direction and technical contributions were all excellent
Nov 9 2023,negative,the movie is 3 hours long and the bg music never stops for 25 hours whenever the music stops and you hear the enviroment you feel like you finally watch a quality movie   but then youtube level of editing hits between each dialog exchange and the movie is ruined again what do i mean by that lets say theres a dialog total of 10 sentences there is not even breathing between sentences again just like a youtube video edit where you cut the blanks just to have a faster speech   and the bad doesnt even end there i know every ism and every scientific term they use but that took my 40 years i bet at least half of the audience have no idea what they listen for at least 2 hours as a movie it really fails to simplifyconvert the story to the audience   the movie is not a movie it is more of a documentary thats been over dramatized by terrible sound and amazing visuals     overrated
Nov 9 2023,positive,awesome movie very well acted and exceptional story christopher nolan knows what he is doing i recommend this movie
Nov 9 2023,positive,amazing movie great performance and impressive sound design
Nov 9 2023,positive,outstanding acting by all the cast loved how it felt like we were watching everything happen in real time amazing story outstanding directing by christopher nolan like always
Nov 9 2023,positive,an absolutely brilliant movie from start to finish to anyone who is thinking about seeing this movie do not hesitate
Nov 7 2023,positive,cinema genius cant recommend it more will be studied for years to come
Nov 7 2023,positive,amazing dialogue surprisingly good pace although it can feel to abstract at some points the plot also can be very understandable for someone that doesnt understand physics and chemistry all that well
Nov 5 2023,positive,this is quite literally the best new film that i have seen in many years kudos
Nov 5 2023,neutral,holy cow  its so long i couldve been golfing stellar cast robert downey jr shines  but seriously way too long and way too many historical inaccuracies some topics really dont allow for creative license and this is one of them but even if you arent bothered with nolans distortion of history  the length is a major con if movie makers are going to make movies over 3 hours long  they need to go back to having intermissions at the half way point like they did in the golden age of cinema if theyre going to make it that long if i could do it again this is one i would wait to see at home where i could pause it 
Nov 5 2023,positive,loved the movie but feel  and the history or depicted well acted and gripping it could have been better edited
Nov 4 2023,positive,great movie acting is insane storytelling is on another level the only reason it is not a complete 5star is it can be difficult to keep up at times with the jumps back and forth in time but other than that its a mustsee
Nov 4 2023,positive,phenomenal my 4th seeing it on the big screen absolutely loved it
Nov 4 2023,positive,3 hours yet feels like 1h 30m an absolutely captivating film by nolan and everything is spot on cant even name one flaw 1010
Nov 4 2023,positive,this movie featured a star studded cast great plot and amazing story brought by a cinematic genius
Nov 4 2023,positive,dull and ineffective
Nov 4 2023,positive,boring fell asleep i love heavy slowmoving dramas not this one
Nov 3 2023,positive,christ almighty im in the imax watching it right now and this movie bombards us with theatrical greatness as if its trying to split us like one of opps atoms
Nov 3 2023,positive,yeah nolan i get it you have the biggest dongus in the room and only you value cinema for what it was you are the last director of a sacred white lodge of directors the great gran master of cinema the direct discendent of the lumiere brothers your ego is endless as your pipi   what i can say great film near perfection but i hate the cheeseburger  propaganda
Nov 3 2023,negative,courtroom structured movies are a copout at this point in film history  weve seen enough of them  tell everything in flashbacks ok the oppenheimer character as written is twodimensional and his conflicted morality is cartoonish the real man was clearly a lot more complex the chaotic editing attempted to breath some life into this movie but only served to create a bayhem effect belying that there was nothing real going on underneath  i wonder what oliver stone wouldve done with the same material or scorsese for that matter  hell while not a tarantino fan id rather see what hed so with this story  maybe tarantino would have a japanese beauty parachute in to los alamos for a revenge fantasy ending like in inglorious basterds or once upon a time in hollywood  note to self frenetic editing doesnt make up for poor writing
Nov 3 2023,positive,caught my second epic within a week this time it was oppenheimer if i had any lingering doubt it was extinguished christopher nolan is a genius  i dont know what his magnus opus will be hes still 53 years old so hopefully his best is yet to come but if he left off from here hes left some legacy  if hes not already viewed as the equal of contemporaries of steven spielberg and ridley scott he will be now    i was blown away at the quality of the music score in oppenheimer we me included bang on about our favourite rock albums but without these composing geniuses these movies just wouldnt carry the weight of the visual and audio experience they deliver  as you sit there the sound pulses through you to give you an audio experience to compliment the visual and cerebral senses as the story unfolds  while he didnt have his usual musical score counterpart in hans zimmer interstellar dunkirk inception and collaborated once again with composer ludwig g√∂ransson tenet    at 3 hours a movie needs to keep pace the editing suite is one where magic also has to happen i couldnt even guess at the amount of footage theyd have to work through and in order to achieve the continuity required to keep this moving along and the viewers engaged  and it wasnt just the music score that hit the mark it was the silence youll know it when you see it once again he collaborated with editor jennifer lame tenet    and you dont achieve the visual brilliance required without once again collaborating with equally brilliant cinematography from hoyte van hoytema interstellar dunkirk inception tenet    as far the acting full marks for casting cillian murphy  robert downey jr might have delivered the best acting in a role of their careers and emily blunt apart from being a stonecold fox matches them for on screen presence    yes its long but this cinematographic masterpiece never felt laboured its a story as important as any in history and it was faced with the weight of expectation but how it delivered  amazing what i love about film is the same as when i first sat transfixed in a theatre as a young lad it picks you up and the world stops while you become engaged in what unfolds before you
Nov 2 2023,positive,it is a great movie the plot is spectacular you are always connected to the plot of the movie it is the best movie of the year
Nov 2 2023,positive,this was a terrific movie
Nov 2 2023,positive,hello i think it was a very good movie which leaves great learning and can be enjoyed in a weekend
Nov 2 2023,positive,loud spontaneous very fast pacing
Nov 1 2023,positive,nolan along with the best cast hes ever assembled shows what its like to harness his genius vision and shed light to a story that is historically pivotal in the molding of our current political climate chilly the movie is about as chilly as cillian murphys crystal blue eyes on the massive imax screen i had the privilege of watching this cinematic experience on    there is an eerie disposition that consumer you if you are well aware of the magnitude the moment in time this movie highlights the quick cuts of atoms and sparks of highly combustible particles amounts to an overwhelming feeling of awe the cheers of happy americans knowing the bomb successfully exploded on japan and not knowing what devastation it caused is the most sobering dichotomy of the entire film success hand in hand with perished innocents will develop a pit of disgust in the stomach of any movie goer with the proper wherewithal     its a must see for any movie aficionado but it can very well be overlooked by the casual movie goes due to the lull caused in the secondhalf of the film that transition to a hyperfixation on the documentaryesque approach it encompasses     overall 445 this score could very easily increase with a second thirds and more than likely fourth viewing of this cinematic masterpiece nolan redeems himself after the muddled tenet debacle must watch
Nov 1 2023,positive,the film tries to tell too much in its 3 hour running time
Oct 31 2023,positive,this is an amazing story an amazing movie and an amazing way to tell the story
Oct 31 2023,positive,this is one of the films that i like good

Oct 31 2023,positive,good movie with lots of history
Oct 30 2023,positive,oppenheimer is probably my favourite film of 2023 its incredibly well written which isnt a surprise considering its directed by christopher nolan cillian murphys acting was brilliant and i think he deserves an oscar for his performance
Oct 30 2023,neutral,important topic with great music and cinematography but the movie was linear and boring
Oct 30 2023,positive,wow the movie about intelligence powerfully acted and extraordinary cinematic
Oct 30 2023,positive,this movie is very tense but amazing im amazed he did it
Oct 30 2023,positive,this is a complex look at a complicated man but oppenheimer unequivocally establishes that this is a story worth telling  and that nolan was the perfect filmmaker to do it
Oct 30 2023,positive,this is proof that christopher nolan is the best director of all time
Oct 30 2023,positive,excellent movie  well directed and acted  excellent job expanding the story
Oct 29 2023,positive,an excellent character study on a historical figure i was glad to see it on imax 8510
Oct 29 2023,positive,i loved this movie because of chris nolan and cillian murphy my favorite director and actor nowadays ive been interested in nolan since interstellar 2014 my top favorite movies are  1 interstellar  2 the pianist  3 oppenheimer  4 the mirror   5 requiem for a dream   3 this is not my typa my my fav movie acting was good ash
Oct 29 2023,positive,nolans most important movie  a truly surreal experience about the world were living in and the horrifying possibility of a doomsday this movie has a very good chance of winning best picture and best director at the academy awards    as far as cillian murphy is concerned i wholeheartedly hope that he wins the oscar for best actor because he has absolutely killed it in his role as the father of the atomic bomb    this is what true cinema is all about  nolan has done it again
Oct 29 2023,positive,the best movie in 2023
Oct 29 2023,positive,something so crucial and painful that goes down in history from perspective of science really is something absolutely jarring experience in the theatre must watch for those who understand science acting is phenomenal
Oct 29 2023,positive,this movie was art the performances were top notch it painted the time period in a believable and authentic fashion and highlighted the moral struggle combine with the sense of urgency to create what may have saved the world and also one day may doom it
Oct 28 2023,positive,this movie is amazing with wonderful acting throughout the very talented cast gripping writing intoxicating editing incredibly creative directing and luscious music
Oct 28 2023,positive,this movie shows the importance of science in war by telling the story of one of the most important people regarding it the movie not only shows his background but defends it sadly by not telling the whole story really good movie to watch by those that wants to learn more about history and those who are curious about the world back then
Oct 28 2023,positive,long runtime mellow drama about the father of the atom bomb turns to be a greatpaced wellshot and beautifully acted film definitely one of nolans best work bringing back the feel of originality to cinema
Oct 28 2023,positive,what can i say this movie is just perfect
Oct 28 2023,positive,not my type of movie really but it is really good barbenhiemer is better though
Oct 28 2023,positive,as a history lover this movie was both informative and action packed i definitely recommend for someone who enjoys historical movies
Oct 28 2023,positive,this movie is excellent for a 3 hour true story movie the cast does an amazing job acting every thing feels real in this movie and it is extremely accurate on what happened in real life back then in a big event in the 20th century i saw this movie in a movie theater on july 22nd 2023 with my mom for the first time definitely the best movie of the year so far definitely recommend this movie to people who like true story movies or history movies definitely one of the best movies i ever seen in my whole entire life fantastic job director christopher nolan of the based on a true story oppenheimer movie
Oct 28 2023,neutral,55 as a documentary 255 as a mainstream movie i wasnt prepared for this one felt like a history lesson and in that regard it succeeds but in terms of a movie going experience  it was a pain
Oct 27 2023,positive,christopher nolan nails ita fastpaced engaging historical exploration of the development of the atomic bomb superbly done and the acting is incredible
Oct 27 2023,positive,masterpiece in every way
Oct 26 2023,negative,bomb the savages who did this back to the stone age there are no grey areas kill them all every hamas savage and every hamas supporter on earth bury them with the entrails of pigs  producer of oppenheimer james woods
Oct 26 2023,positive,incredible movie  best movie i have seen since shawshank redemption
Oct 26 2023,positive,top of my must watch again list
Oct 26 2023,positive,dialogue comes at you fast  furious so sometimes hard to understand acting excellent flips  in time  a little confusing to me but im in my early 70s  leaves you with a lot of thought almost need to see it again
Oct 25 2023,positive,throughly enjoyable for the first watch struggled the second time but would watch again in the comfort of my own home acting from majority int his was spot on another films smashed by nolan
Oct 25 2023,positive,loved everything saw it 2 times already visited albuquerque new mexico last month and went to the us nuclear and science museum got pics galore going to see oppenheimer one more time next week
Oct 24 2023,positive,the most poignant scene to me was the deafening sounds of feet stomping in a lecture call oppenheimer was to speak at after the bombs were dropped there was an intense wrongness in the celebration and glorification of the destruction in hiroshima and nagasaki and the audience was tortured alongside oppenheimer himself truly powerful film
Oct 24 2023,positive,big boom go bang     cillian murphy master class ludwig goransson on the sticks emily blunt eye emoji     what more can you ask for
Oct 24 2023,positive,ive watched oppenheimer 5 times in the theaters this is quintessential christopher nolan from directing writing acting editing score and vfx this movie is a masterpiece cillian murphy performs in a way that makes you feel as if hes not acting but actually oppenheimer rdj deserves best supporting actor and the story above all is guy wrenching the story told from oppenheimers perspective is genius writing 1110
Oct 24 2023,positive,the acting was very good  i believe it told an important story in 20th century us history  i disliked the earth shattering sound effects  the sex scenes were highly overrated and minimal and disappointingly bland
Oct 24 2023,positive,my favorite movie of 2023 so far
Oct 23 2023,positive,best movie of the year and one of the greatest docudramas of all time 
Oct 23 2023,positive,certain sections seemed to get a bit bogged down but otherwise it was a great film
Oct 23 2023,positive,excellent performance by r downey jr wow great cast
Oct 23 2023,positive,imax is the way to go jaw dropping historic movie
Oct 22 2023,positive,as a person that loves historical films this movie shouldve been an easy walk in the park for me cillian murphy plays j robert  oppenheimer the inventor of the atomic bomb its also nice to see robert downey jr play someone thats not iron man combine two of the best actors with one of the best directors ever christopher nolan i shouldve liked this movie more than i did while the cinematography by nolan and getting to see the bomb explode is great thats all i could really enjoy about the film theres a lot of unnecessary scenes in here in particular oppenheimers cillian murphy relationship with jean florence pugh doesnt need to be there another huge problem i have with the film is that it is simply too talkative and has an unnecessary runtime of three hours luckily murphys acting combined with nolans directing keeps me engaged enough to sit through the movie without being bored out of my mind overall getting to see the making of the atomic bomb was interesting but the film couldve easily cut some scenes and nothing wouldve felt left out with that being said i still think the tunnel has more light in it than dark
Oct 22 2023,positive,the sex scenes felt unnecessary and christopher nolans directing style can be jarring to get used to  but besides that its a must see
Oct 22 2023,positive,oppenheimer is another nolan best with superb acting and immense intensity
Oct 21 2023,positive,with no clear focus on any particular part of oppenheimers story this plain biopic lacks heart
Oct 21 2023,positive,an absolutely brilliant movie by nolan  possibly one of his best ever which is saying a lot and stellar performances by cillian and rdj and blount and damon who were all phenomenal if oppie doesnt win a boatload of oscars then theres something wrong in this world
Oct 21 2023,positive,fantastic movie great acting and cinematography doesnt feel too long although you can get lost in dialogue sometimes 
Oct 20 2023,positive,love this movie in all areas casting scoring story
Oct 20 2023,positive,a masterpiece worthy of multiple oscar nominations and wins
Oct 20 2023,negative,worst acting  cillian murphy has always only one facial expression
Oct 20 2023,positive,brilliant acting and cinematography sound track phenomenal
Oct 20 2023,positive,cinematically beautiful as usual the story telling was interesting though a bit confusing at times was really the story of the man and not just the weapon that he helped create 
Oct 19 2023,positive,its better than barbie and i really liked it
Oct 19 2023,positive,oppenheimer is not only a great movie but it also tells the story about j robert oppenheimers perspective of the manhatten project what this movie also does well is it shows how fragile the world actually is and thats also what this movie is so good  at because it actually makes you afraid of the world we live in today what i also find interesting is it shows that christopher nolan is able to make a dialogue heavy movie so interesting
Oct 19 2023,positive,this was an amazing movie the ending was crazy and its definitely worth the wait
Oct 18 2023,positive,its  good but overrated also a big waste of emily blunt and florence pugh nolan sure likes his own directorial style doesnt he 
Oct 18 2023,positive,goes against everything  a modern hollywood blockbuster suppose to be  3 hour long historical drama with little to no action mostly people talking in closed rooms but nolan still delivers gripping tale about a complex man with little help from ludwigs incredible score
Oct 17 2023,positive,portrayal the life of one of histories greatest minds in both the past and present adds moments of intense success with a sense of dread of failure which makes it more emotional thanks to its cast members bringing their characters to life we see history in the making
Oct 17 2023,positive,one of the most beautiful film ive ever seen speaking for the cast  its a beautiful but sad movie talking the man that created the weapon to destroy the world   i loved this film best 3 hours of my life   its one of the bests historical films if not the best   i strongly recommend it   shout out to christofer nolan who did another great job
Oct 17 2023,positive,christopher nolans oppenheimer finds the director in top form bringing his knack for gigantic scope and human drama together seamlessly  an allstar cast like ive never seen assembles to tell this story which ponders morality and scientific advancement with equal measure  the film features a great deal of dialogue much moreso than his other films and with a 3 hour runtime there is a danger in losing us but nolan is aware of that and succeeds at keeping us rapt  the editing team is largely to thank for this moving the film along at a pace that mostly clips steadily fast  the sound steals the show from cillian murphy playing the largest part in the film  the score is sweeping and elegant and the sound knows when to be delicate and simple just as it knows when to test our ability to withstand loud noises  cillian murphy has turned in a career defining performance here playing several ages very well and holding the weight of the world on his shoulders with humility and pain  ensemble standouts are robert downey jr jason clarke and emily blunt
Oct 17 2023,positive,a little too much hollywood  including too many special affects
Oct 17 2023,positive,fantastic film and very informative prepare yourself because its long but its totally worth it
Oct 17 2023,negative,too loud too long monotone do not recommend
Oct 16 2023,positive,i enjoyed this movie a lot well donegood actingcomplexities throughout a long movie but it never felt that way good to see at a theater
Oct 16 2023,positive,if oppenheimer does not win ten 10 academy awards or more the awards arent worthwhile anymore
Oct 15 2023,positive,a masterpiece by chris nolan  that is keeping the magic of the cinema alive i had chills in some scenes to live in theatres
Oct 15 2023,positive,excellent movie but i really thought the last hour was not necessary 
Oct 15 2023,positive,superb we saw it twice but the imax theater experience made a huge difference our seats were shaking and the moment the atomic bomb exploded it was like you were there hope they crush the oscars
Oct 15 2023,positive,superb acting great story
Oct 15 2023,positive,this was my second time seeing this movie and my husbands first time  we thought it was an excellent movie
Oct 15 2023,positive,this is the best movie ive seen this whole year it felt so real and alive the acting the cinematography the writing it was fantastic   the scene where the bomb went off was very unreal especially with the 70mm imax screen if you still havent seen this movie i highly recommend it imax 70mm is the best way to experience this movie
Oct 15 2023,positive,great cast and acting  the movie is well done and thoughtfully edicts the political sentiments of the time but the ethical turmoil that openheimer struggles with is portrayed in an insidious way yet permeates the film
Oct 15 2023,positive,a treat for cinephiles and nolan fans
Oct 15 2023,positive,this was our sixth time seeing this movie it is the movie of the century
Oct 15 2023,positive,for a long movie it held my attention and everyone elses the entire time great acting great story
Oct 15 2023,positive,best movie of the year cillian murphy  chris nolan killed it
Oct 15 2023,positive,i have now seen oppenheimer four times  i originally saw it in imax but the last three times have been in a regular theater i never intended to see it 4xs but the opportunities arose and i absolutely didnt mind  as i was telling my husband this evening after the fourth time seeing it i think its the combination of the science im a high school astronomy teacher the ensemble cast cillian murphy and robert downey jrs antagonistic relationship and the relentless pace that make for an event rather than just a movie christopher nolan is a master at casting  as seen in all of his other hits but this one to me is special seemingly everyone involved was expertly chosen and every actor no matter what the part size came with their agame  certainly murphy and downey deserve accolades but blunt damon hartnett etcjust incredible  the score stays with you long after the credits i know there has been some controversy over the absence of the results of the atomic bombs in japan but i was just as moved in the movie as i think i would have been if these images were given more time  in fact the way it played out allows the mind to imagine the worst and murphys internal angst is felt fully hes just a phenomenal actor  period this movie will be remembered for decades to come  btwi did read the book prior to seeing the movie for the first time and im glad i did its worth reading and a rather easy read for all the background information
Oct 15 2023,positive,once again christiphor nolan shines and makes an unforgettable movie expierence from the the way the plot progress to the soundtrack this is a great biopic of the somewhat infamous oppenheimer for a movie without much action it makes you feel like there is action with the way the scenes are played out i recommend alone for the soundtrack
Oct 15 2023,positive,fascinating story told with exceptional grace
Oct 14 2023,positive,if cillian murphy and rdj dont take home the oscars ill be shocked
Oct 14 2023,positive,a great film with a phenomenal cast  cillian murphy and rdj  performances are amazing  the cinematography is top class
Oct 14 2023,positive,cool take on an important part of history great cinematography
Oct 14 2023,positive,excellent movie covers the history but most importantly the complex emotions of the brilliant liberal who developed the worlds most destructive weapon see this movie if you consider yourself a thinker if not theres always barbie
Oct 13 2023,positive,oppenheimer is an epic cinematic journey that redefines storytelling written and directed by the brilliant christopher nolan the film is a masterclass in the art of cinema cillian murphys portrayal of j robert oppenheimer is nothing short of mesmerising and robert downey jr shines as us atomic energy commission member lewis strauss to be honest all of the actors play their parts well    nolans screenplay weaves a captivating narrative that takes us through oppenheimers remarkable career from his groundbreaking studies to his pivotal role in the manhattan project during world war ii and his eventual fall from grace during the 1954 security hearing    visually the film is a treat for the senses thanks to the exceptional cinematography by hoyte van hoytema the use of imax technology immerses the audience in the world of oppenheimer enhancing the entire cinematic experience the sound design further elevates the film creating an immersive journey    im a fan of nolan who isnt especially with a career filled with remarkable films but for me oppenheimer stands out as one of nolans crowning achievement its a cinematic rollercoaster that leaves a lasting impression evoking a range of emotions that will stay with you long after the credits roll this film is a testament to the power of storytelling and the art of filmmaking
Oct 13 2023,negative,nolans oppenheimer feels like he copied and pasted information from wikipedia onto his movie script and started filming
Oct 13 2023,positive,oppenheimer a highly anticipated film with an allstar cast offers a deep dive into the intricate life and work of j robert oppenheimer the man behind the atomic bomb directed by a visionary filmmaker known for his grandeur its no surprise that oppenheimer was shot using imax cameras to capture its sweeping narrative however as i watched the film it became evident that this decision didnt always serve the story well    one glaring issue was the choice of locations and settings many pivotal scenes in oppenheimer were confined to small rooms or tight spaces while this approach might have been an intentional choice to convey the tension and secrecy of the project it did little justice to the expansive capabilities of imax cameras in these close quarters the imax format felt somewhat wasted leaving the audience craving the breathtaking visuals its known for  imax cameras are renowned for their ability to capture vast landscapes and epic vistas with unparalleled clarity unfortunately oppenheimer missed several opportunities to make use of this potential scenes that could have benefited from the imax treatment such as outdoor research facilities or expansive desert landscapes were notably absent or underutilized   in conclusion oppenheimer is undoubtedly a noteworthy cinematic experience but the choice to use imax cameras in settings that didnt fully leverage their capabilities is a curious one while the storytelling and performances are exceptional one cant help but wonder if a more conventional cinematographic approach might have served the films intimate and often confined settings better
Oct 13 2023,negative,its most overrated movie that you think
Oct 13 2023,negative,it was very good but i think not an honest portrayal of the impact of the a bomb development and testing on the land and the indigenous peoples of new mexico do better hollywood
Oct 13 2023,positive,great movie a masterpiece great acting effects and sound effects i didnt feel time passing by even though i believe that the movie becomes more interesting once you have at list a little knowledge about some historical events
Oct 12 2023,positive,wow   i was so engrossed in the film that i didnt notice how long it was
Oct 12 2023,positive,i believe that christopher nolan successfully encapsulated the life and the struggles of j robert oppenheimer in a 3 hour movie the movie is historical drama with many scientist taking part in the manhattan project to built the first ever nuclear bomb the fat man    what i like the most about the movie is the use of practical effect to imitate the explosion of a nuclear bomb it was both awe inspiring and terrifying the cast were amazing and extremely dedicate trying to emulate the character for example   cillian murphy starve himself to look just like him and robert downey jr was unrecognizable the use of black and white to highlight certain moments was phenomenal    the dislike of the film is the fact that it could have ended at the trinity test i personally dont prefer nonlinear storytelling but what  else can you can expect from christopher nolan one weird thing is that famous oppenheimer quote was said before a sex scene    despite the shortcoming its a great movie and i would recommend to anyone who is patient to watch the film
Oct 12 2023,positive,oscars on its way cilliannnnnnnnnnolan is successfully the directer who we can trust
Oct 11 2023,positive,skillfully shot great acting the only problem is the writing it tries to tell a story but it continues to stop into an avengerslike series of big brains so nolan can show off how smart he is    also its in a format which basically doesnt have an appropriate projector so unless you went to a couple of theaters you saw a cropped movie somebody should tell nolan that when you make a commercial project part of the job is making sure people can actually see the movie
Oct 11 2023,positive,an absolute must see movie my advice is to read american prometheus before seeing the movie cillian murphys performance as oppenheimer is brilliant the entire movie experience leaves you breathless
Oct 11 2023,negative,very bad movie my hamster was in ww2 so it was very bad my hamster had a stroke waching this
Oct 11 2023,positive,movie of the year top 10 all time
Oct 11 2023,positive,fantastic soundtrack great acting     some of the time skips caused some confusion but it was overall a great movie that i will definitely watch again
Oct 11 2023,positive,this movie is something that i think no one has come close to making as a fan of nolan even with his most confusing films im talking about you tenet i was excited to see the direction nolan would take with history he had done it in the past but that was dunkirk not just some guy however nolan found the best actors for the job cillian murphy should get the oscar he plays oppenheimer with such talent and the supporting cast all get their fair share of raw emotion and brilliance in their respective acting the film may be long but the setup for the trinity test has never made me more stressed in my life the suspension still sticks with me to this day and with nolans mission to not use 100 cgi i was blown away by how they made some of the shots the music and audio may sometimes be hard to hear as is with most nolan films but i didnt find it intruding as i watched the film also going off of the music the soundtrack of this movie is stacked and the swelling of the music is one of my favorite parts of the entire movie ludwig gorranson feels like hes on the way to becoming the next hans zimmer this review is getting too long so ill end here with this dont let anyone who says its too long or too much talking or even any small negative of this movie make you not want to watch this film you need to watch this film period
Oct 11 2023,positive,oppenheimer was an instant classic of a film nolan really honed in his filmmaking both narratively and stylistically for this one this story could have easily been a long drawnout bore if executed the wrong way and given the all the scientific exposition involved it isnt and it flies for a 3 hour film nolan cuts the film in such a way that it feels like a fastpaced ride neatly balanced with the emotion of oppys personal life the drama of creating the deadliest weapon ever to have existed and gorgeous imagery of fission and the atom at a microscopic level  which felt like it was almost haunting him throughout the film i was constantly blown away at the caliber of talent that showed up in the most trivial roles which nolan is known for doing and really levels the playing field for every actor involved i wont be surprised if multiple actorsactresses are nominated for their supporting roles here i also love how he sticks to shooting on film and using miniatures in lieu of cgi all these things bring that much more authenticity to this film if you havent seen it yet do yourself a favor and watch it on imax its an experience as much as it is a movie 
Oct 11 2023,positive,non stop edge of your seat stuff incredible
Oct 10 2023,positive,absolutely breathtaking filmmaking and a wonder to make a character study feel like a thriller somehow nolan at his finest
Oct 10 2023,positive,amazing visuals a great soundtrack and a stellar cast what more could i ask for
Oct 10 2023,positive,this is cinema absolutely speechless kept me tense the whole time 3 hours feel like 10 minutes
Oct 10 2023,positive,it was an awesome movie that everyone needs to see once but you need to a little bid about the time other way you dont understand it
Oct 10 2023,positive,watched 3 times would watch again
Oct 10 2023,negative,oppenheimer is not a good film its far from good
Oct 9 2023,positive,i loved the constant energy and acting was amazing
Oct 9 2023,negative,this movie was complete garbage so boring walked out after first hour complete waste of money
Oct 9 2023,positive,nolan does not miss a beat in the telling of the manhattan project with robert oppenheimer not only does the film pose excellent questions of the lengths mankind would go to in times of war but it is also aided by the stellar performance from robert downey jr
Oct 9 2023,positive,the movie was really really great a fresh new experience from the historical event of the manhattan project i do have little issues with the pacing especially at its 3rd act with the conference rooms and conversation scenes in rooms and i was kind of ready for it to wrap up 20 minutes before it actually did but that didnt really bother me a lot mostly overall a solid entertaining epic historical masterpiece and an absolute mustsee
Oct 9 2023,positive,i gotta watch this movie again it was so good the hours flew by it was so immersive and visually pleasing every actor gives an amazing performance you have to watch this movie
Oct 9 2023,positive,way too long i hated the clapping and stomping that pops up in the movie a few times and i have no clue why some scenes rdj were in black and white it adds nothing to the film not worth a repeat viewing
Oct 8 2023,positive,fascinating story and superb acting
Oct 8 2023,positive,the movie pointed to the complexities of oppenheimer himself as well as the manhattan project and the scientific community working on the project the movie brings the topic to the table once again the dangers of this project have never died and is still a threat to humankind and all other life
Oct 8 2023,positive,to say that i have many complex and conflicted emotions about this film is an understatement the narrative was not at all what i expected but still made for an unnerving edge of your seat watch     the pros   a much more emotional film than expected oppenheimer unfolds as a tragic and surprising character driven story whose takeaways transcend time    tremendous acting from nearly every member of an allstar ensemble cast notably cillian murphy robert downey jr and emily blunt cameos from gary oldman and tom conti steal the show    quality of costumes hairstyles and makeup made you feel as though you were really living in the time period alongside the characters   sound and cinematography of the bomb detonation scene was masterful    the cons   too much of the plot explored the details of oppenheimers personal life drama and the inquiry after the war at times i felt the work of the scientists in the development of the bomb was more of a subplot   excessive timeline jumping made the story confusing and hard to follow   dialogue was often difficult to understand due to the speech patterns of several characters as well as the tendency of the background music to be louder than required   number of characters felt excessive with most of their appearances feeling rushed and underdeveloped   nudity scenes felt forced and were inconsistent with the rest of the films tone
Oct 8 2023,positive,this was so good there was some overacting and i thought there would be more buildup about the actual building of the bomb i read that nolan wrote the script in first person as oppenheimer which is so cool it paid off in the form of a very intense character analysis
Oct 8 2023,neutral,some really good performances by the cast but hollywood biopics are such bullshit i enjoyed haydn belfields jul 22 2023 vox article cry baby scientist what oppenheimer the film gets wrong about oppenheimer the man more than nolans movie
Oct 8 2023,negative,three long hours of a terrible storytelling this movie is a mess the worst movie ive seen in the  last five years
Oct 8 2023,positive,great to learn about history
Oct 8 2023,positive,i would give it 5 stars which it deserves for its filmmaking but i wanted to see more of the impact on japan
Oct 7 2023,positive,truly one of the best movies ive ever seen
Oct 7 2023,negative,the topic it too important and nolans film does not do justice to it the film pace is too fast there is no place to breathe the explosion is underwhelming and unlike other nolan films there really isnt much to think about when you leave the theater actually i could not remember much of it at all due to the frantic pace it felt like watching cocomelon the subject of dropping the bomb on innocent civilians i know it hurts to read this is not shown in picture but through a weird scene in the theater this is def the worst nolan film for me and im baffled by the praise it received
Oct 6 2023,positive,this is definitely a must see the performances are incredible robert downey jr has the performance of his career top to bottom a fantastic movie
Oct 6 2023,positive,dont got a lot to say was a really engaging movie that gave a lot more insight on oppenheimers personal life would definitley recommend seeing this on the big screen
Oct 6 2023,positive,ever since i saw it i cant stop thinking about it every now and then i got the privilege of seeing this in 70mm imax and it was unbelievable
Oct 6 2023,positive,yeah its that great you cant say anything bad about the movie its almost perfect the casting the acting music the only thing it just went off in my experience was that at the beginnig of the second hour the movie felt a little slow in my opinion just that the only thing i could see like wrong or non perfect
Oct 5 2023,positive,the best movie of the year everything is perfect
Oct 5 2023,positive,i liked that you used the science to not hear the explosion while seeing it go off
Oct 5 2023,positive,el mejor film de christopher nolan
Oct 5 2023,positive,an absolute cinematic masterpiece about the founding of modern america the repercussions of the choices made during that time impact who we are today and this is a brilliant masterpiece showcasing those choices and decisions
Oct 4 2023,positive,slowburnstorytelling
Oct 3 2023,positive,great exploration of oppenheimers character the story was a little hard to follow sometimes bouncing around between senate confirmation hearings for lewis strauss and oppenheimers security clearance trial at the aec and i dont think aec was ever defined anywhere     many of the characters that were instrumental to the making of the bomb are never really identified or followed up louis szilard for example no followup of the other characters at the end of the movie     i thought the sound and visual effects were a little cheesy and there was hardly any explanation of how nuclear fission worked nuclear fusion or the two different types of bomb     i will probably buy the book and see how the real story compares to the movie
Oct 3 2023,positive,im not a fan of back and forth story telling the music was loud the nudity not necessary for those of us unaware of his full story it was interesting to see how revenge and karma played out in the end
Oct 3 2023,positive,loud scores of music over dialog makes for a terrible experience i am missing what everyone else is raving about its a solid movie but its almost all about early character building then an hour and a half about the hearings and inquisition of the man it really is interesting but its boring and long its not the best thing since sliced bread i will never understand why so many people give this five stars no chance they would sit though it again
Oct 3 2023,positive,a compelling intriguing true story that brings perspective to j robert oppenheimer during the manhattan project and the weight of unleashing such a destructive fear inducing weapon and the guilt he felt as well as the consequences
Oct 3 2023,positive,literally amazing everything about it
Oct 3 2023,negative,the editing was not for me tried to pack in too much and made it hard to focus
Oct 2 2023,negative,the nudity was not necessary since we would have gotten the idea without it the music was way too loud during important dialogues the entire movie seemed to revolve around the inquiry was the inquiry the most important part of his life just give the straight story not all the back and forth from different years it seemed as though the development of the bomb was secondary to the inquiry after the war i know a lot of these things are done for dramatic effect but the story itself is dramatic without all the emphasis on the interrogation

Oct 2 2023,negative,it was boring and too much cerebral
Oct 2 2023,positive,the plot is nuclear bomb great but sleepy
Oct 2 2023,positive,it took me some time to go see this because i thought i needed to be in the right frame of mind for a 3 hour biopic it was very well made and the story engrossing 3 hours sped by acting is top drawer and the music creates a special atmosphere
Oct 2 2023,positive,the best movie ive seen in  years
Oct 2 2023,positive,best movie in years  based on true story great acting
Oct 2 2023,positive,dense full of layers film making at its best
Oct 1 2023,positive,oppenheimer is brilliant  the details of historical events  is presented superbly and is a history lesson in and of itself  one gets a true sense of the times and the struggles of the project  special effects are also worth seeing
Oct 1 2023,positive,even though this movie is three hours long this movie is so entertaining the effects and cgi just makes this movie mind blowing and the score and music makes this movie suspenseful and amazing and the plot is just eye catching
Oct 1 2023,positive,excellent coverage of both the historical facts and the emotional impacts on those involved
Oct 1 2023,positive,this movie will leave you feeling completely overwhelmed emotionally drained and just destroyed in a great way nolan always does an incredible job ending his films and this was one of if not his best yet in a weird way it stays with you and makes you want to experience it again just to get to that ending on paper it reads so simple but my goodness what you experience in that climax is incredible hands down one of the best movies of our time i just saw it for the second time and now that i think about it the only other movie i have went to see twice was the dark knight
Oct 1 2023,positive,a cinematic masterpiece by christopher nolan definitely in for a ride of a lot of storyline so have to remain focused to not get lost lead by the line of cillian murphy who does an absolutely incredible job  of his role and keeping viewers engaged one of the best movies i have seen in a while well worth watching
Oct 1 2023,positive,it is a masterpiece from character perspective and the thrill
Oct 1 2023,positive,i was interested by the subject matter but not excited wow love this movie very well put together and the story is stitched like a 5 star michelin meal  superb acting not a weak performance in the entire cast every scene felt like it meant something and not filler one of the best experiences at the movies we have had since the pandemic highly recommend
Oct 1 2023,positive,really well made movie
Oct 1 2023,positive,like it a really good way to tell a story that could be boring but its actually not
Oct 1 2023,positive,if we are talking about the imax then it is awesome wait for the sweeping vistas of the desert towards the end a smart film that keeps it entertaining even with all the dialogue lets call it like it is though  the big explosion is underwhelming and the whole white silence thing is  a bit too obvious and cinematic the trailers lied to us too the blackandwhite only half works but it looks great in imax we really get to know oppie thru the great acting by murphy and all the details nolan put in the script if youre in the imax theatre and you are keeping up with all the dialogue on the edge of your seat definitely a 45 star experience but maybe you are at home not really keeping pace and are tired halfway thru the film then its a 3 star
Sep 30 2023,positive,an audio and visual creative revelation that excels at his unique presentation through scene composition and scene selection its definitely worth watching but it gets a bit nonlinear when it comes to storytelling and you can get a little bit lost watching it because the way it was cut and told
Sep 30 2023,positive,oppenheimer was a thought pervoking film about a guy realizing that bombs kill people i know people have made jokes about that but really the guy was called a genius and yet didnt realize that bombs arent just a expensive bug repellent the word genius was like a rock in a sock back then cillian murphies performance was great he did a bang up job really the bees knees all the celebrity cameos werent just cameos either they actually had somewhat important roles in the movies also that ending it so haunting it actually makes you laugh a bit     1010 performance all around for a 2010 movie but barbie may beat it who knows 
Sep 30 2023,positive,a wonderful intelligent adventure music sound color light it came together so beautifully i didnt matter that it was 3 hours i watched it 3 times cast was superb definitely one of my favourites
Sep 30 2023,positive,loved it great indepth look at the man not just the bomb fyi the government did exactly the same thing they are doing to trump
Sep 30 2023,positive,it was a good movie  i really enjoyed it
Sep 30 2023,positive,overall visually amazing easy to get a bit lost in the storyline but overall a great movie a bit too long for my taste however
Sep 30 2023,positive,there are lots of movies about this  this one from oppenheimer point of view a bit like the one about alan turing
Sep 29 2023,positive,worthwhile overall  exciting and thorough but too many characters involved and sometimes hard to follow
Sep 29 2023,positive,i am writing this as someone who knows very little about science and didnt even know who oppenheimer was before coming into the theater the movie was extremely interesting and i think its only real downside is the amount of characters and if youre like me and you do not know who all these people are youre going to be confused funnily enough tho it was this confusion that made me want to watch the movie a second time and then eventually i decided to go a third this is the only piece of fiction that has ever made me go to the cinema three times in a row let alone a three hour long one i think the most insane thing for me is that it didnt even feel like a three hour movie because i was so intrigued throughout im giving it a 455 because i think there were some points where it could have gone faster  i also wasnt a fan of the sex scenes  except for the vision sex scene in the small court room that one was brilliant for a documentarybiography style movie it was surprisingly jaw dropping and anxiety inducing from start to finish amazing cinematography perfect cast and a brilliantly rewritten story of the father of the atom bomb couldnt recommend this more
Sep 29 2023,positive,christopher nolan is a genius everything from amazing imagery to emotional scenes this movie delivers on its promise to be one of the best of the year oppenheimer could be analyzed for days on end much like nolans other films the depth and deliberate choices make for an excellent storytelling experience seeing the bomb go off for the first time is much like how these scientists felt about the experiment at first it is a thing of beauty and marvel and then the pressure wave hits and reminds everyone of the danger that has been released upon the world worth watching this spectacle of a film more than once
Sep 29 2023,positive,a fantastic viewing experience lessened only by running an hour longer than needed a hallmark feature of christopher nolan
Sep 29 2023,positive,go see it for yourself as always nolan did it again
Sep 29 2023,positive,why are movies in black in 2023 i would watch barbie movie over this i mean why are there no black people in the move racism
Sep 29 2023,positive,it was an amazing movie to be honest
Sep 29 2023,positive,truly fantastic film its exactly what i expect from a cast like this formidable actors its right that the film lasts this long at least you understand the story well i really liked the suspense of the speech with einstein which they kept secret until the end
Sep 29 2023,negative,i mustve seen a different movie from everyone else because this was a boring snooze fest i about drifted off several times and every time i did nolan would throw a loud jolt to bring me back awake my friend kept nodding off as well the performances were alright and it was a cool ensemble cast but that doesnt make up for the crappy script many of these scenes were repetitious i heard too much talk about communists and communism and most everything said about them was repeated ad nauseum the most interesting character is killed off before half the movie is over they made albert einstein look like a goofball that i couldnt take seriously the bomb was the only good part and it didnt last long despite everything else being drawn out far too long when i left the movie i was just very disappointed cannot believe all the hype for whatever i just watched 
Sep 29 2023,positive,while the first act of this movie was a little all over the place everything else afterwards was so good everyone played their roles so well star studded cast great cinematography and phenomenal acting definitely one of my favorite movies of the year
Sep 29 2023,positive,the writing and acting were fantastic  it was great to get the historical aspect along with the politics involved
Sep 29 2023,positive,a balanced narrative with historical perspective good acting with a great cinema and music really liked it
Sep 28 2023,positive,really enjoyed the movie the nuclear bomb test was underwhelming but loved everything else
Sep 27 2023,positive,oppenheimer a marvelous insight into modern history    as a history buff and someone who thoughrougly enjoys learning more about modern history oppenheimer was an appealing film to go and watch oppenheimer is a historical drama and thriller directed by christopher nolan and featuring cillian murphy florence pugh robert downey jr and emily blunt the intention of the director was to tell a cautionary tale from the perspective of the american theoretical physicist dr robert oppenheimer nolan describes the film as how the personal interacts with the historic and the geopolitical released on july 20th 2023 the film brilliantly describes the minor and major details of oppenheimers life     the overall acting and performance in the film is superb however cillian murphy does an extraordinary job at portraying the character of doctor oppenheimer for example there is a scene of oppenheimer giving a speech to a crowd after the bomb had been dropped and killed a large number of the japanese he clearly communicates to the audience his characters inner doubts about having created the bomb as he speaks to the crowd with conviction about the great bombing the viewer can interpret from his expression that the way he truly feels about the bombing does not correlate with what seemed a strongminded speech i certainly believe that no one else could have filled the role of oppenheimer due to murphy being well known for his role as tommy shelby in peaky blinders we know that he is an expert at playing the role of historic or modern historic characters although there was no acting in oppenheimer that i strongly disliked i felt that they could have cast a different actor to florence pugh for the role of jean tatlock pughs acting to me felt borderline cringeworthy pugh is more suited to her more innocent roles like in little women personally i believe  that an actress like samara weaving would have been a better fit when i think back to her acting in the babysitter weaving has an uneasy and edgy quality to her acting that would perfectly suit the role of jean tatlock as jean is the character that initiates the affair between herself and oppenheimer    as we already know oppenheimer is based on true events this makes it all the more exciting to watch as we know that what unfolds in the film has taken place in real history when analysing the plot of oppenheimer the way the producers have used the combination of the narrative and sound helps to tell the story in such a frantic yet captivating way that it almost becomes a thriller for example there is a point in the film when doctor oppenheimer is giving his speech to the media in this scene the audio fades in and out and the visuals become blurry and begin to flash this use of effects in the film create a tense and chaotic atmosphere in order for the audience to experience the scene from doctor oppenheimers perspective this is clever as it keeps the audience  engaged and provokes our realisation of oppenheimers state of mind    a three hour film some have commented on its length and typically i am all for a good slow paced and lengthy film or series slower paced films have a greater build up to the climax of the narrative and results in a more profound impact on the films audience however i found that in the beginning of oppenheimer there were parts that lengthened the narrative unnecessarily and i admittedly found myself checking the time to see how long i had been in the cinema for a film critic named bob grimm articulates my feelings exactly when he says nolan has made a goodlooking wellacted movie about the father of the atomic bomb robert oppenheimerbut it feels a bit bloated at three hours     oppenheimers target audience is mostly male and leaning toward more mature or senior audiences too however personally i would recommend this film to someone who can appreciate modern history and has a deep understanding of it aside form that i would recommend it to someone who can withstand a three hour movie and has an interest in politics and explosions i definitely would not recommend the film to someone with a short attention span as the beginning of the first half of the film is slow oppenheimer is r rated meaning that individuals under the age of 17 are advised to be accompanied by a parent there are moments of coarse language sexuality and nudity however because these are very few and only brief parts of the film i would recommend that the age restriction is 16 years old at the lowest oppenheimer is a great film depicting the complicated details of oppenheimers life and the road to developing the atomic bomb i rate this film highly and believe it deserves the attention is has attracted over the past few months however would give it a rating of four out of five this is only because of the length of the narrative which for some could take away from being able to fully immerse ourselves in the film although i do not think this should be a deal breaker because once the film reaches its climax it is a true  gem this film is incredible and a great eye opener into modern history
Sep 27 2023,positive,was a great way to tell the story
Sep 27 2023,positive,really really good movie very interesting choice making use of swapping of black and white film throughout the movie dont see that done very often these days and most often it doesnt seem very well executed 3 hour runtime is a touch unjustified in my opinion with a lot of the middle portions of the film being more padding than anything that said this movie does very well at creating a very breathless feeling watching the initial test of the nuclear bomb during the film created a feeling not many movies have successfully done overall good movie interesting subject matter for the most part but trimming it down maybe 30 minutes might have been for the best
Sep 27 2023,positive,i love historical fiction and have seen this movie 6 times gets better each time i see it
Sep 27 2023,positive,best movie of the year probably christopher nolans best film
Sep 27 2023,positive,one of the best films ive ever seen doesnt hurt that cillian murphy is nice to look at as well
Sep 27 2023,positive,well done excellent acting felt content was well covered
Sep 27 2023,positive,the use of color and black and white filming helped to show the struggle he experienced battleing with his beliefs  the overall experience could have improved greatly with the removal of 40 minutes of commercials before the movie started i can understand why theaters are struggling to fill the seats in hindsight i should have rented it from a streaming service
Sep 27 2023,positive,a story id never heard including complicated characters  impressive performances
Sep 27 2023,positive,a masterfully crafted film and telling of a powerful story in history compelling from start to finish
Sep 27 2023,positive,great editing and acting
Sep 27 2023,positive,listen right off the bat i want to say oppenheimer is great its a solid movie its got a solid premise its got great visuals however there is absolutely no reason for the movie to be 3 hours long its overkill so no its not nolans best work its his most innovative work yes i would even say its his most filmmakery film yet however the script could use a couple once overs as the story does drag but disguises itself as nolan flare i see you nolan i see you    where i have the most difficulty however in writing this review lies in this one question how do you make a review on a product that is just good overall barely anything wrong just nitpicks especially when others have already done it and done it well here is what i have found the oppenheimer type has finally died down its time for me to say something    i think i wasnt pulled into the spectacle that was oppenheimer because i was already there so many reviews and video essays on the importance of oppenheimer and the message it yields yet i was sitting in the theaters thinking welcome to the apparently exclusive club that is being evidently selfaware of how the world has been operating this entire time welcome nolan to me i just thought nolan was hitting points we have already been discussing turns out that wasnt the case seemingly at all turns out the world was oblivious to the fact that humanitys worst enemy is indeed humanity less dramatically human greed not really humanity as a whole i knew this since i was about 12 when i started observing people and chain reactions in behavior for screenwriting and storytelling so yes the visuals were great but i understood the message and wasnt at all wowed or floored or perplexed i simply agreed with it as it should be    so i understand others wanting to give it a perfect score but you have to look at things realistically the no cgi was indeed harmful during some emotionally heavy moments yes i am talking about the atomic bombslightly underwhelming the script was a little too ambitious and retina characters werent needed absolutely at all nor did those characters do well surprisingly yes i am talking about florence pugh dont drink the nolan kool aid unless you want to then by all means enjoy it all    in the end oppenheimer really is a great and creative film its definitely a must watch it put a smile on my face pretty much throughout all of the film i just think its way too long for little to no reason what do i say there are just a few script factors that hold me back plus that underwhelming atomic bomb yikes from giving it a perfect score but it and nolan deserve a longoverdue oscar for oppenheimer hot take  thesis oppenheimer is just another good movie to add to the history of good movies    oppenheimer gets an 87 out of 10
Sep 27 2023,positive,very informative and great acting 
Sep 26 2023,negative,i usually enjoy historical movies and biographies but this movie was utterly boring and a bit scattered  the character development was pretty weak and even though i recognize some of the characters from a historical context you never really feel any sort of connection or empathy with any of them particularly the main character   i was pretty amazed that this movie got such reviews i couldnt wait for the movie to end
Sep 26 2023,positive,i was amazed that three hours passed so quickly this movie was very engaging and held my interest the story and acting was wonderful
Sep 26 2023,positive,the best film of the year without a doubt  oppenheimer is the most thrilling biopic film ive ever watched and probably ever will nolan transfers his energy from creating thrilling set pieces in his other movies into the dialogue scenes here which possess an oscillating sense of tension in them   pay attention to the film and it will surely reward you
Sep 26 2023,positive,great absolutely brilliant
Sep 26 2023,positive,humanity historical detail and impact reviewed realization plus
Sep 25 2023,positive,i dont like nolans films too much except for a few but this one rocks i know its not for everyone its very heavy and slow its not told in a linear way but these are things you can turn a blind eye to excellent excellent indeed
Sep 25 2023,positive,exxcellent indepth study of the complex oppenheimer
Sep 24 2023,positive,long movie but very enjoyable
Sep 24 2023,positive,wellscripted movie with solid casting beautiful cinematography its important to understand the oppenheimer story in the context of our own time
Sep 24 2023,positive,needed subtitles occasionally or at least character identifiers have seen it twice and learned even more   look forward to seeing it again
Sep 24 2023,positive,wellacted riveting
Sep 24 2023,negative,im interested in the history surrounding oppenheimer but there was too much switching going on between characters making it difficult to follow  i soon lost interest and took a nap which helped to shorten the movie  when i wokeup i felt i hadnt missed anything and the movie continued  not worth the time
Sep 24 2023,positive,one of the best films i have ever seen i can hardly articulate my feelings on it so ill just say please do yourself a favour and watch it if you havent
Sep 24 2023,negative,boring and not interesting nolan as always
Sep 24 2023,positive,there is no denying this is a terrific film robert downey jr is still up to playing his crafty roles star cast impressive very tight film considering the length i didnt want to watch because ive never liked cillian murphy as an actor too up himself but he really does a fantastic job respect     it does show what a bunch of bullies the usa are but watching that in films wont change anything    very worth watching
Sep 24 2023,positive,outrageously great movie an american classic if you have not yet seen it go now
Sep 24 2023,negative,the performances were very good but the story was everywhere the second half was unbelievably boring jumping between two viewpoints the score cinematography and sound design left something to be desired as well i admit it was not a traditional biopic but maybe if it was treated less of a art piece and more a documentary then that would have been more enjoyable
Sep 24 2023,positive,christopherb nolan is reputable for his way of synthesizing and presenting information  this movie however is a genius in character presentation of right thread trapeze portrayal of characters pretty well known to history  the liberties he has taken to weave this portrayal is spell binding  i thoroughly enjoyed the character of oppenheimer played so well by c murphy as he succeeds in bringing his madness in scholastic pursuit to a tremendous reality only to regret the tremendous cost  he struggles as he almost believes why suffrage that comes his way is rightfully his karma  hats off to this amazingly intricate screen play and beautiful weather if characters excellent movie
Sep 24 2023,positive,its such an important movie and it was shot in a very beautiful way captivating from start to finish nolan is very much at the top of his game
Sep 24 2023,positive,fascinating story and incredibly well done movie the music score was fantastic and really added to the experience it was very long but i was engrossed in it for the full time
Sep 24 2023,positive,its a nolan film and it delivered as expected  strauss was an example of a vindictive insecure prick with thin skin who should not be in a position of power  hope theres no one else like him in power today  if there is hope you read this  kanye says to esad
Sep 23 2023,positive,loved it ill have to see it a few more times
Sep 23 2023,positive,glad i spend the 3 hours watching it in a rainy day of nyc
Sep 23 2023,neutral,way too long and fall way too shortnot worthy of the material it presented
Sep 23 2023,positive,i like dramatization and actors play the presentation overall is good probably will watch this movie again on tv with english close caption to get some lines that i missed almost not boring but do not expect a lot of special effects i would recommend this movie for people who need some theater in a movie and take interest in the subject and characters one star less for not one breath movie could be a bit stronger
Sep 23 2023,positive,once again christopher nolan creates magic on the big screen
Sep 23 2023,positive,must see in imax 70mm  first 2 hours were amazing but could get confused during the last hour of the movie  score is incredible  this movie is only for some audiences not all  dont expect iron man saving japan
Sep 23 2023,positive,amazing film not in the greatest category
Sep 23 2023,positive,i liked everything to this day it is in my head it blew my mind
Sep 23 2023,positive,nolan must have complete contempt for dialog as the music and sound drowns it out 90 of the time or perhaps its selfloathing since he wrote the screenplay i need to have him standing next to me so i can read the dialog tattooed to his chest
Sep 23 2023,positive,the best movie of the year  acting directing visuals and a deep story  great
Sep 22 2023,positive,excellent movie but too long and could easily have been condensed into a shorter time
Sep 22 2023,neutral,i didnt see it because i was too young but i heard it blew up in japan okay sorry bad word choice there
Sep 22 2023,negative,the first 12 of the movie was so boring i almost fell asleep if i had not gone there with other people i probably would have walked out i love historical and truth based movies this was not my favorite
Sep 22 2023,positive,definitely worth the money and oscar material
Sep 22 2023,positive,excellent movie overall strong performances from the cast
Sep 22 2023,positive,acting and dialog were excellent
Sep 21 2023,positive,there were glitches in the movie at the bottome of the screen and also all the way through the advertising as well as the movie was so loud i complained and they turned it down just a smidge but still made you jump a mile high and was absolutely horrible to listen to just awful
Sep 21 2023,positive,great film  will watch it again with subtitle when it comes out on streaming
Sep 21 2023,positive,a deep character study on the nonfictional character of robert oppenhiemer as he plays a crucial role in one of humanities greatest disappointments  a well crafted film with real star power and an interesting plot with a story i otherwise would not be interested in as well as a character i have no allegiance with oppenhiemer somehow manages to change both these issues rapidly with strong story telling interesting characters and a grade filmography  it can be a tiring watch due to its themes and the overall way the film ties you into the storyline
Sep 21 2023,positive,what a filmexperience    one of the best films that i have seen     nolan  i was afraid how you gonna make this one but after watching this  once again you proved you are a mastermimd filmmaker     cillian murphy you expressions are phenomenal     i got a goosebumps in the trinity test omg its been so loooong experiencing this kind of film     i dont have an option i need to meet you in person and say that you are an inspiration
Sep 20 2023,neutral,this movie had a great cast and it was nice story about history but i found it so slow and so boring i kept getting distracted on my phone while i can appreciate the history of it and understand why so many loved it for that reason i just could not get into it guess im just too used to action type movies if it werent for the comfy recliner chairs i would have left way too long to sit when you are bored but i want to stick it out to the end
Sep 20 2023,positive,nothing short of exceptional cillian murphy is astounding as the father of the atomic bomb and the supporting cast is flawless i was a fan of christopher nolan before seeing this movie but this is definitely a new high water mark
Sep 20 2023,positive,very revealing about important events in our history  especially the anticommunist fears that caused harm to some loyal americans  also the merits of arms control
Sep 20 2023,positive,the technical execution is amazing the acting incredible everyones performance were outstanding however nolans expression of the genocide committed in japan was not only an injustice to his own film japan and his audience but it also shows nolan as a coward in his craft and his inability to tell a complete story the sheer amount of glossing was appalling
Sep 20 2023,positive,compelling factual story that every american should see and remember full of desperate decisions about mankinds desire to kill each other rather than to choose peace due to greed hate revenge  control
Sep 20 2023,negative,a movie which personifies oscar bait this movie has all the cliches that win oscars but likewise is as spineless and pretentious as all most of the moves which have won best picture over the last 20 years this movie is a propaganda piece which belongs in the 1950s carrying the tradition of americans believing only they have the most important lives in the whole world  truly a movie which says the soft bit loud and the loud bit soft and it will win all the accolades but will be forgotten in 5 years time since it says nothing and does not test the audience hence making everyone feel good about themselves
Sep 20 2023,positive,probably one of the overrated movies of all time the scene jumping back and forth in timelines has run its course and theres no innovation here let it go not to mention everything following the bomb seemed insignificant vastly inferior and excessively drawn out the films climax seemed completely misplaced then the core of the film the bomb building felt hallow it didnt seem to capture much more than a simple observation oppenheimer i doubt it would have done so good if not for the convenient contrast with barbie
Sep 20 2023,positive,not what i expected was expecting more time with complications of building the bomb i was not expecting what came from the movie complicated but very good
Sep 20 2023,positive,stunning excellent well acted outstanding oppenheimer was a history lesson made interesting it was thought provoking and worthy of discussion after some reviewers said it was complicated its about the atomic bomb not a simple subject most of us are not physicists so yes the topic is complicated but christopher nolan and everyone else involved made it comprehensible other reviews said it was boring it was actually fascinating unless you are someone who has the attention span of a gnat
Sep 20 2023,positive,great historical lesson
Sep 20 2023,positive,hands down best movie of the year i honestly thought i wouldnt be able to last because its so long but i didnt even feel it youre at the edge of your chair the entire time amazing cast amazing storyline music images just everything was perfect i totally recommend
Sep 19 2023,positive,while the topics were disturbing the movie covered them well  it was a great time to learn
Sep 19 2023,positive,excellent score stupid naked scenes that did nothing for the story but must have been important to the 9 year old in christopher nolan that needs to see breasts
Sep 19 2023,neutral,a torture long long long movie  gave it 4 tries and finally made it worth it
Sep 19 2023,positive,brilliant christopher nolan kills it again matt damon cillian murphy and robert downey jr are all extraordinary
Sep 19 2023,positive,very informative and well made movie
Sep 19 2023,positive,if you love movies about history especially wwii it is a must see very thought provoking on the topic of nuclear weapons and how science and technology is controlled by those in power
Sep 19 2023,positive,seeing cillian murphy is so exciting the visuals are so cool clever and breathtaking since i am still young trying to understand the movie oppenheimer is such a great movie
Sep 19 2023,positive,brilliantly made lost a point due to the absence of the japanese story and the rejoicing of the military left a bad taste but perhaps movie and cinema viewers would boycott inclusion of the true horrors of the event itself the filmography is astounding and the cast excellent mention of charles thorpes book oppenheimer the tragic intellect as excellent source material alongside others
Sep 19 2023,positive,this movie is one of the best movies in the last 5 years if not the best  i have seen it twice and i am happy that i chose to see it more than once because i picked up a number of thoughts in the story that i did not capture in the first viewing of the movie  it is so good to see a movie like this one  i just wish that more new serious movies of this nature would be available in place of so much of the garbage that has been available in the past few years  i will watch this movie at least one more time
Sep 19 2023,positive,dialogue between some actors and whispered lines were challenging for those with poor hearing
Sep 19 2023,positive,how good was oppenheimer i saw it three times in the theater  thats how good it was and i never got bored in the 9 or so hours i spent on it an absolute masterpiece that blends a little bit of physics with us history and politics somehow the movie manages to create drama and tension around historical events which we already know the outcome of i cant say enough good things about this film
Sep 19 2023,positive,this was a great movie hard to keep up with the changes from time periods  you had to concentrate which was a little difficult because of an audience member snoring so loudly
Sep 19 2023,positive,a great biopic movie the acting the visuals the sound are oscar worthy without question just a great deep dive into a man who had to do what he had to do for what was the betterment of world to only realize what he might have unleashed might destroy the world someday the emotions and struggle of that weight and pressure is something nobody in history has ever maybe had to deal with i cant wait until it comes out on streaming so i can watch it again its near the top 5 of nolan movies
Sep 18 2023,positive,i was quite reticent to see this movie because the length more of 3 hours really  but finally even i still think that we can trim some parts the movie is very good and its flow very well it felt shorter than barbie to me
Sep 18 2023,neutral,it was slow i was disappointed that it didnt focus more on los alamos and developing the bombs not much discussion among scientists about ethics most of movie was regarding the indictment
Sep 18 2023,positive,long movie that is so good it keeps you engaged i did not know the back story but now i do definitely have to see this movie
Sep 18 2023,positive,best movie since schindlers list and sound of freedom highly recommend
Sep 18 2023,negative,one of the longest boring and confusing movies ive ever seen 3 hours of my life ill never get back amazed i didnt fall asleep this movie is way way overrated 
Sep 18 2023,positive,learned a lot about this period in our history
Sep 18 2023,positive,too long and difficult to understand the scientific aspects  i was bored until the bomb was dropped then i was engaged  good acting  also the sound was too loud
Sep 18 2023,positive,i was very good until the last 30 minutes of exposition and courtroom drama plus they cut out the nde scenes in my country which i knew but only realised some were in the exposition as well holy sht
Sep 18 2023,positive,riveting story  great performances
Sep 18 2023,negative,i drove 2 hours to see this in imax and to learn upon arrival that the move had no previews and started immediately was very disappointing and frustrating this app i used to book did not make the clear i missed 11 minutes
Sep 18 2023,positive,a cinematic portrayal of the manhattan project that squeezes as much suspense out of the story as a historical nonfiction movie possibly could
Sep 18 2023,positive,great acting great story could have been accomplished with a little more editing ie shorter lenght it proved wonderful to be at a cinema where they would come to me to refill popcorn
Sep 18 2023,positive,absolutely incredible movie  the actors play and the sound are the best
Sep 18 2023,positive,everything is good about this movie
Sep 18 2023,negative,the background sound was too loud the spoken word sound was mumbled and hard to hear most of the time  also it was a long movie and very slow in plot
Sep 18 2023,positive,i liked this film production and congratulates to all people who works for it
Sep 18 2023,positive,riveting great cast
Sep 18 2023,positive,it is a very well constructed movie in showing a very complicated story  a weakness of the movie is that it lacks context in that it would have benefited by giving the years events played out and it needed an epilog
Sep 17 2023,positive,the effects to visualize oppenheimers visions and internal state score narrative that hews close to the history physics and politics oppenheimers demonization by strauss staying just a hairs width short of mccarthyism and the marvellous casting which led to very close to real portrayals of the physicists and others watch it also on a regular cinema screen for the intimacy which allows one to feel the emotions expressed by the characters cilian murphys portrayal of robert oppenheimer is excellent and i was surprised by robert downey jrs strauss  though it is also true that in that role he was playing ironmans father to quite an extent
Sep 17 2023,positive,the acting was very good
Sep 17 2023,positive,fabulous movie  and you learn so much about the history of the usa during world war ii  a very impressive and complex movie  you do not want to be distracted for a minute
Sep 17 2023,positive,excellent storytelling wonderful editing engaging characters historically interesting
Sep 17 2023,positive,a really engrossing film  captured the subject matter perfectly  all the characters were very convincing  in my all time top 10
Sep 17 2023,positive,good piece of history told here 
Sep 17 2023,positive,this film was worth every minute one of the best films i have seen in years  pacing character development cinematography script everything
Sep 17 2023,positive,several oscar contending performances   fast moving modern filmmakering at its best
Sep 17 2023,positive,informative fascinating story a bit too long
Sep 17 2023,positive,obviously a must to watch this season
Sep 17 2023,negative,honestly it was the most boring movie ive seen people were falling asleep
Sep 17 2023,positive,worth the time to watch on the big screen engaging and thought provoking an excellent movie
Sep 17 2023,positive,honestly i didnt think a moie that was 3 hours long where we know what happens could be so engaging i cant say enough about the actingall of the main characters and most of the minor ones christopher nolan is in a class by himself having written and directed this i left more than a little sad but i was so glad to have seen it
Sep 17 2023,positive,great cast interesting story
Sep 17 2023,positive,really good movie i enjoyed it a lot although have to warn its not for the weak stomached since it mentions a lot of difficult topics
Sep 17 2023,positive,amazing absolutely amazing oppenheimer is a masterpiece christopher nolan had outdone himself with this absolutely perfect film and 70mm imax is breathtaking
Sep 17 2023,positive,too much character development hard to hear and understand wish there were more scenes from the actual bomb dropping the book 1945 helps understand this movie wonderful acting
Sep 17 2023,positive,amazing score acting scriptthe made science so grippingthe timeline may be confusing at first but once you get the full picture it is perfect a must see for any nolan fan and just a fan of movies
Sep 17 2023,positive,intensely focused and accurate a must see for everyone to clear the record
Sep 16 2023,positive,amazing expirience the movie created an evironment wich made me feal amazed by the intelectual process of building a nuclear bomb but always showing that it was a massive and deadly weapon  the nude scean was a little bit out of place and was unnecessary in my opinion
Sep 16 2023,positive,watched at cubix alexanderplatz 16923 great movie
Sep 16 2023,positive,second viewing which i needed to carefully listen and enjoy the compelling performances
Sep 16 2023,negative,despite being a christopher nolan fan i was not impressed with this movie it was hard to follow and as dry as toast there was too much meaningless talking attended by a lot of dramatic music but hardly any real drama as interesting as these historical figures and their groundbreaking research should have been i felt nothing for the characters depicted who were generally boring and dull and for that reason the movie failed to inspire or convince me of the significance of the story it was trying to tell
Sep 16 2023,positive,really liked the film though at first it was hard to figure out the flow of the timelines and scenes   the sound also seemed especially loud i understand it was necessary for the overall effect but for it was a bit tough for someone with tinnitus
Sep 16 2023,positive,awesome a little slow at first
Sep 16 2023,positive,literally the best in 2023 it was interesting till the end and i enjoyed it great acting by cillian murphy and all over a great movie and definitely worth watching
Sep 16 2023,negative,this movie was so boring there was an unnecessarily sound track that built up to nothing i would not recommend it is from a very american view point
Sep 16 2023,positive,oppenheimer is an extraordinary film with a remarkable cast led by the exceptional cillian murphy this captivating historical drama delves into the manhattan project offering a gripping and thoughtprovoking narrative christopher nolans direction elevates the storytelling creating a visually stunning and emotionally charged experience a mustsee for cinema enthusiasts and history buffs alike
Sep 16 2023,positive,way too long good acting drama with heavy dialogue
Sep 16 2023,negative,slow and drawn out for someone who has already explored and studied the making of the trinity bomb makes the movie extremely uninformed on the true details of the effects and aftermath   walked out the theatre 20 mins before the movie could end literally couldnt watch anymore
Sep 16 2023,negative,the movie has no arc all events lie flat with little depth i will say that it is very professional but again the characters simply feel flat     all that glitters isnt gold    a much much older crowd might have a better time watching the film but the truth is the vast majority of us arent physicists so the film can give the illusion of quality but in reality the whole mess just feels like one big vague event with no real emotional complex     not a bad try but nothing from this is actually memorable i believe this movie gets praised simply because people dont understand whats happening but it gives the impression that something important is happening so they feel like they owe it praise out of fear it will somehow subject them to ridicule     there are far better movies out there with not as much praise simply looking and acting like you know what youre doing seems to be enough for 90 of the crowd as i said i appreciate the professionalism but very little about this has the human element that makes a movie relatable and worth watching
Sep 16 2023,positive,outstanding thought provoking movie
Sep 15 2023,positive,cant remember the last time i saw such an engaging and sweeping drama cinematography score story and direction all first rate performances excellent all around it took a subject that could potentially be very dense and complicated and made it suspenseful and thrilling i didnt look at my watch once and i predict many awards for this one certainly for murphy and downey
Sep 15 2023,positive,not only is the science in this film paradoxical but also is the experience its apparently possible to have a slow burn yet move quickly at the same time this is cinema best film of the year
Sep 15 2023,positive,i went to this movie without any expectations but i still left disappointed its a confused movie with no clear beginning or end confused about which story to follow and how   spoiler if we divide the movie into about 3 equal parts in the first hour of the movie there is a quick oppenheimer intro this part is a bit biographical but its very choppy in the form of reels videos that dont really connect i think after weve been led to believe what a genius oppenheimer was by these cutout videos we finally get to the main event which is the construction of the nuclear bomb here the events are treated with a little more emotional depth but still mediocre the dull elation after the first successful attempt oppenheimers very short and shallow ethical questioning and agonizing none of them leave a mark not even on the actors and the intended emotion is not conveyed to the viewer the last hour is a different matter here oppenheimer is presented not as the main character but only as a figure and in contrast it tells the story of mr strauss who crosses paths with him his desire to be appointed to the countrys prestigious institution and his ego battle with oppenheimer it tells this story but we dont understand how this anger this lawsuit end up being at this point spoiler    for this movie to be a meaningful movie without giving up this plot i think it should have been 67 hours long or maybe it was necessary to compromise on one of these 3 parts and make the whole movie focusing on one of them  here we seem to be watching the results of a director who is so good that nobody can say maybe you shouldnt do this having seen it in 70mm the visuals were a revelation but its as if nolan forgot about directing and editing while he was masturbating to the technical aspect of the movie somebody should have said to nolan do what you want to do with 70mm but lets not jump between time periods here lets not make unnecessary plot twists here lets stay focused on one thing here nobody did and if they did they couldnt get him to listen the result is a waste of resources and opportunities a movie that only saves itself from being mediocre due to the fact that its very interesting from the technical aspect a movie that saves the rest of its fate due to its actors but a movie with a lot of flaws in both script editing and directing  those who want to go and watch it just because its from nolan shouldnt tire themselves too much instead they can just sit down and watch a beautiful mind watch the imitation game watch the theory of everything watch other nolan movies but stay away from this one only if youre an analog lover or a technical geek this might be an enjoyable experience for you
Sep 15 2023,positive,great acting great story
Sep 15 2023,positive,very good movie but felt like they stretched it out too much and the nuclear explosion didnt meet my expectations
Sep 15 2023,positive,give emily blunt her oscar for the interrogation scene
Sep 15 2023,negative,this was boring af i swear these reviews are paid lol there was nothing but talking and talking and more talking yes well shot yes good actors and yes they did well but it was just so boooooring i left the theater early so take my review for what it is
Sep 15 2023,positive,a stunning film about important event with great actors a film that should help any audience understand how we got where we are the dangers we quietly live with and that  no matter how incredibly high the stakes  everything and everyone we know and love exist on a razors edge of annihilation at the whim of very flawed very petty  very human humans
Sep 15 2023,positive,very engaging time flew by
Sep 15 2023,positive,the movie was riveting intense disturbing revealing and long very well done cillian is an amazing actor
Sep 15 2023,positive,excellent story camera music atmosphere a must see preferably watched on a big screen
Sep 15 2023,positive,great job mister nolan and mister murphy i loved
Sep 15 2023,positive,the way our past was portrayed and remembering how war was also a political format even after hit death
Sep 14 2023,positive,it was a thriller psychologically when it was all said and done amazing ending
Sep 14 2023,positive,three stars for florence pughs titts and one star for cilian not bad
Sep 14 2023,positive,too long gratuitous nakedness unecessary
Sep 14 2023,positive,a 3 hour film about an outcome we already know mainly dialogue and no real action scenes shouldnt be a great film but it is the 3 hours flew buy the films visually stunning and i love the music score too its not a film i perhaps will rewatch but the first viewing experience was amazing it deserves the box office and the critical praise its received
Sep 14 2023,positive,i just cant understand the hype around this movie i got up from the chair and left the movie theater after seeing how disrespectful this movie is regarding the events of hiroshima and nagasaki colors music acting and everything make it look like a heroic thing they killed thousands of innocents people who have nothing to do with war an excellent movie for those who love the typical hollywood propaganda material
Sep 14 2023,positive,way too much drama over insignificant events oppenheimer never really has character development he just sort of drifts from one thing to another and even his significant change of heart about regulating nuclear suddenly comes out of nowhere
Sep 14 2023,positive,we very much enjoyed this movie fascinating to watch the history behind such a powerful and horrific weapon the acting was amazing
Sep 14 2023,positive,absolute masterpiece one of christopher nolans best nothing more to say
Sep 13 2023,positive,this movie was an amazing cinematic experience sometimes it was a little hard to keep track of what was happening when and who was an important character and what their names were but the emotional manipulation that the director was able to pull off was astounding during the most powerful scene my jaw was wide open a single tear down my face and i was having a hard time breathing absolutely gorgeous highly suggest seeing it in theatres the bass enhances the experience
Sep 13 2023,positive,masterful portrayal of a very important historical time period
Sep 13 2023,positive,one of the best christopher nolan film ever made the 70mm imax was absolutely worth the drive to california to go see it the way nolan meant it to be seen the story acting and cinematography were all top notch too
Sep 13 2023,positive,do factuallybased films garner intrigue solely over its subject or mainly based on whos telling it christopher nolans directorial skills come across as experimental magnificently scaled and artistically compelling as his growing mastery remains consistent his latest feat separates from his original works as he goes from portraying certain allegories to fully working off the facts in an embrace though of course the visionarys original taste still manifests in interpreting those facts under stellar depictions the subject of focus is cinematically introducing whilst revisiting the father of the atomic bomb j robert oppenheimer based off the 2005 biography american prometheus  titularly referring to how the mentioned god brought fire down to man then eternally punished    during world war ii lt gen leslie groves jr appointed physicist oppenheimer to work on the topsecret manhattan project purposed in building a bomb that would defeat their enemies before another strike could happen oppenheimer and a team of scientists spent years developing and designing the atomic bomb eventually coming to fruition in 1945 as they witness the worlds first nuclear explosion moreso an academic beneficiary over theoretical lengths with dangerously forewarn calculations that positioned the event as forever changing the course of history its framed under political pressure that decides oppenheimers placement but that weight is the least of his haunted conscience    normally not much wouldve been approached towards the subject alone if remain unheard despite the felt ramifications originated from the depicted periods weaponized achievement more likely if it were a documentary with an angle that would intrigue leave it to renowned storytellers who sought and envisioned the value these stories possess by relevancy reflected upon the current timely associated climate especially if it regards factbased pictures poised to remind towards preventing history repeating itself not only did nolan directed at his finest when enlarging the dialoguedriven debut following amidst his speciallyscaled spectacle of grand practicality and minimized digital interference hes written the screenplay with pressurized earnest one thing to really acknowledge regarding the taut script is that nolan took the unique approach of writing it entirely in firstperson surrounding the eponymous perspective therefore interpreting those conversational flows under adjacent to his worldbuilding knack just telling it from oppenheimers viewpoint enables us to identify the ethics in the figures cautious pursuit then shaken abstract thoughts particularly when the teachable concept beneath concerns creating a new world in a fiery flash curiously similar to his other mainstream breakthrough memento  which he largely revisited in tenet structurallywise by exaggeration  nolan cleverly used differential shading just to identify narrative shifts between opposing stances that prepped the political thriller afterthought in postclimax with recognizably stylized turns gripping tensely considering how lengthy it became and under the particular focus its told the whole story by necessary means with minimal flexibility that doesnt disrupt    so far the only directorial credit when he didnt write is insomnia as nolan tends to deliver complex communication with exceptional flow of ideas that would both fuel the awespiring grip and convoluting senses as well still finding complications in maintaining the synergic pacing as evident when further elaborating those conversational points that may be deemed as unfamiliar upon the conceptualizing buildup that runs on as threatening tediousness they classily formulate in a heightening matter for the involving imagery that stunningly serves under a delicate balance of the worldbuilding root art cannot be rushed so patience nearly delivers with proportionate results especially by justification when emphasizing the scale of it all this is typically one of nolans defining traits as he urges realistic set pieces so the films sequential events can be convincing enough to feel the gravity especially when selfrequired to replicate its main event of evaluating the bomb and capture all its explosive glory as primary immersion both nolan and his frequent collaborator cinematographer hoyte van hoytema managed to express the very gravity to the point of enveloping the audience feeling the tension with resonated anxiety followed by second collaboration with composer ludwig goransson also contributing to the weighing tension throughout by continuous unique induction via thickening score    amid the practical apparatus replicating the ideal realism with the narrative weight taken into serious consideration the film boasts an impressive cast finding their mesmerizingly ethically performative peaks with organic chemistries cillian murphy in his sixth film with nolan and finally leading define his best by genuinely delivering a sharp tourdeforce performance as oppenheimer with such exceptionality and an expressive psychological connection spiritually grasping how haunted his conscience was significantly emily blunt portrays katherine oppenheimer with fiery empowerment matt damon charismatically carries the stress of the project as leslie groves jr and finally robert downey jr enhances his caliber in a complicated as remarked supporting actor role as lewis strauss chairman of the us atomic energy commission with a grudging hold on the politics surrounding oppenheimer gravitas is key idealistic in these performances which is a typically encouraged expectancy whenever watching an intelligently deep nolanesque picture with gentle approaches bold convictions and strong dynamical pacing while regarding the looming stakes in the story you can feel nolans own defined perfection in his craft but its the excellent ensemble cast that substantially interacts in lively fulfilling the given structures narratively created platform which spirited the connective experience watching it with eased captivation  though tediously hinted if gets lost in the lengthy conversation without a firm grasp    from following and memento to the dark knight and dunkirk with tenet a bit of a convoluting stepback christopher nolans latest oppenheimer continues his estimable fine craft as he once again converted a factuallybased source material into his own recognizable angle interest initially piqued during his previous production there couldnt come a better time to visualize this story with an emphasis in its meaning and significance as its ominously linked to some explosive outlets in todays climate with a harrowing realization by prophesized or even as mentioned calculated connection we may receive a dreadful reality check over the origins and sharing oppenheimers eventual sentiment particularly his readable expression and thought process in the powerful final moment it neatly caps off whats an accumulation of a visionary artistically epic mastery as the lengthy biopic deftly strengthens its thrilling grip with outstanding imagery and mesmerizing performances as were in the second half of 2023 the awards season is inching much closer this film deserves to be a worthy contender for the best in presentation and talented showcases a
Sep 13 2023,positive,you must try this movie once in your life it kight be long but trust me it is worth it for a better experience you can read about oppenheimer life story before watching this to understand more
Sep 13 2023,positive,really enjoyed its a must see i just wish they went a tiny bit more into the effects on the surrounding residents from the test   acting script and direction were all flawless
Sep 13 2023,negative,an american movie that tries to redeem men that have countless souls on their shoulders no respect for the victims whatsoever no wonders it was banned in japan hope that america stop doing such movies
Sep 13 2023,positive,visually engaging and the score was very effective only complaint  its a bit long
Sep 13 2023,positive,a solid meh    there was clearly research done on the characters in the movie and everybody did a good job acting  im actually pretty big into history too but it just wasnt that great of a story to begin with    and for all the people talking about how cool the explosion was that was the mehest thing in the movie  i know it was a practical effect and thats probably why it looked so lame  oh cool you blew up 10000 tons of dynamite or however much it was  that doesnt mean it looks like a nuclear explosion much less an impressive one    it was after that that i gave up and walked out  i just didnt care about the people in the movie  i already knew there would be the standard denunciations of mccarthyism and i just didnt care where any of these people ended up after that
Sep 13 2023,negative,i was really looking forward to seeing this movie and learning more about oppenheimer however this was one of the most boring movies ive ever had to sit through not recommended
Sep 13 2023,positive,such a well produced and acted true story i betting on 46 academy award nominees
Sep 13 2023,positive,a triumphant yet sad movie with poor choices and betrayal mixed in
Sep 13 2023,positive,great story  greater acting
Sep 13 2023,positive,learned more about the man to include the actions against him regarding his hard work for war against other countries  he didnt deserve the ridicule
Sep 12 2023,positive,great film the three hours flew by
Sep 12 2023,positive,the best movie of 2023 just give this man an oscar  the acting the music the seriousness of the topic and the real events that presents us is phenomenal  i didnt mind the 3 hours  made my guts trembling
Sep 12 2023,positive,another nolan masterpiece
Sep 12 2023,positive,great acting skilled direction but the same damn flaw that always compromises nolans films its sterile there are moments where the audience is built up for catharsis and poof he just doesnt tip them over hes a technically brilliant director who just needs a nudge from someone  a producer editor cinematographer   to remember there needs to be something that sinks into the audience the irony is that rdj managed it in his scenes and emily blunt in the nottrial did it because they are supremely skilled actors who were able to breathe that element into those scenes murphy is brilliant but couldnt carry that for nolan because he was oppy who was emotionally crippled by his brain that gap in nolans toolkit was very noticeable i would almost say ron howard needs to pull him aside and go through apollo 13 frame by frame with nolan to show him how to move from skilled to maestro of the biopic
Sep 12 2023,positive,this movie doesnt feel like a 3h long movie the detail to history was great kept me interested the whole time
Sep 12 2023,positive,slow at first the terrific
Sep 12 2023,negative,loaded with hollywood left wing propaganda
Sep 12 2023,positive,overall great movie some nudity in a couple brief scenes story could have been told without it
Sep 12 2023,positive,a masterclass from nollan the actors are just awesome
Sep 12 2023,positive,i really liked this movie it showed how dangerous nuclear weapons could be in the wrong hands the problem i had with this movie was wondering how historically accurate it was
Sep 11 2023,positive,beginning was a bit difficult to follow jumped around a bit but omg it was fantastic
Sep 11 2023,positive,excellent performance by all of the actors  a movie you cannot fall asleep in
Sep 11 2023,positive,good movie  great character study  a bit long 3 hours
Sep 11 2023,positive,i enjoyed learning more about the atomic bomb
Sep 11 2023,positive,oppenheimer is without a doubt that great film that shows how good a director christopher nolan can be and that he not only makes confusing films that no one understands tenet but what cannot be denied is that rotten tomatoes has overrated it its cast is fantastic and cillian murphy is the best option to play oppenheimer but without a doubt for me the golden performance of the film is that of robert downey jr the bad thing is that sometimes the film becomes heavy and about 15 or 30 minutes they can be cut and the last point the biggest failure of all is how extremely cold the sex scenes that appear are and it gives the impression that they are two robots since they do not show humanity
Sep 11 2023,positive,overall the service was great strongly recommend lubbock spm location
Sep 11 2023,negative,too long too loud and way too much technical information
Sep 11 2023,negative,a pompous showing off that has no substance

Sep 11 2023,positive,it is heartening to see something so selfcritical come out of the us the story is surprisingly interesting and a timely reminder of just how horrifying atom bombs are
Sep 10 2023,positive,this movie is very good
Sep 10 2023,positive,too long at times exhausting to follow the diagog
Sep 10 2023,positive,intense score leaving you feel the weight of the characters choices
Sep 10 2023,positive,it was well filmed but there was way too much jumping around on the timeline
Sep 10 2023,positive,literally the best movie ever
Sep 10 2023,positive,great story cinematography was excellent
Sep 10 2023,positive,great film not only tells the story of the manhattan project but also shows what times were like before during and after the bomb was built nolan is a one of a kind director  story teller but fyi this movie is 3 hours be ready to have your listening skills put to the test those with add and adhd be warned
Sep 10 2023,negative,the only part of the movie that i thought was interesting was the actual making and exploding of the weapon at the end the first part of the movie was filled with a lot of boring talk by professionals in physics math etc often while holding drinks in their hands  many of these professionals were either talking snarkily to each other or behind each others backs  or telling each other just how brilliant they are there was some unnecessary nudity showingoppenheimer as an adulterer   his wife was seen as being extremely stressed fom taking care of their little baby and how they had to give him to someone else for awhile  what no nannies available   i have known professionals and physicists who would not have denigrated their peers in the way this movie shows  in my opinion a mostly boring holywood mess
Sep 10 2023,positive,award winning actors accurate information presented and 3 hours fly by
Sep 10 2023,positive,great acting and cinematography glad that i saw it in the theater
Sep 10 2023,negative,the timeline and narration did not work for me

Sep 10 2023,negative,way too long its exhausting and boring
Sep 10 2023,positive,this movie was absolutely riveting  the cast was amazing  i wondered how i could sit through a 3 hour movie  it went by in a blink
Sep 10 2023,positive,details of a story too few people know
Sep 10 2023,positive,an important movie that is also astonishingly beautiful
Sep 10 2023,positive,too many inaccuracies too drawn out nudity and vulgarity gratuitous   excellent acting and cinematography
Sep 10 2023,positive,it was one of the best movies in this year yet it must see movie for everybody
Sep 10 2023,positive,oppenheimer was great2nd time seeing but imax version i thought i was going to see wasnt possible  the 70mm projector was down  apparently after talking to another movie goer the 70mm projector was down in late july as well for oppenheimer then as well
Sep 10 2023,positive,top 5 movie in past 5 years  chris nolan does it again 
Sep 10 2023,positive,amazing sound  act and crew
Sep 10 2023,positive,diction was hard to understand  be sure to wear your hearing auds
Sep 10 2023,positive,sound system was horrible heavy quiet dialogue in the movie but theater sound system wasnt loud enough to hear the dial would probably guess i heard less than 50 of the dialogue   ill have to see it again but trust me it wont be at amc
Sep 9 2023,positive,awesome visuals and plot top notch acting
Sep 9 2023,positive,this was such a heavy plot but it was wonderfully directed the score of this film really made it for me
Sep 9 2023,positive,thoughtful points about nuclear proliferation are an intriguing part of this film oppenheimer was a complicated man which this film tried to show as well as all the moving parts in the manhattan project the nudity and sex acts between robert and jean were not necessary
Sep 9 2023,positive,nolan and murphy  seem destined to mount the oscar podium come next april murphy perfectly captures his subjects naivete idealism pragmatism and builtin contradictions while nolan artfully whisks us from one moral and ethical conflict to another in a breezy three hours there are villains near villains and near heroes but alas in a story about a man  doomed by the gods for delivering  knowledge  no real hero can emerge
Sep 9 2023,positive,fascinating cinematography
Sep 9 2023,positive,amazing movie nolan and cillian murphy deserve their oscars
Sep 9 2023,positive,the movie is very well done the topic is a very informative piece about history of the invention of the abomb that quite honestly wasnt covered in any history classes when i was in school
Sep 9 2023,positive,it was goodbut not what i expected a bit hard to follow the story line   but overall a good movie
Sep 9 2023,positive,brilliant movie  wowjust wow  1010
Sep 9 2023,positive,excellent movie a little long but really enjoyed it
Sep 9 2023,positive,brilliant picture of seeing the story of dr oppenheimer play out in a visually strong long but heartfelt story of his life through the development of the atomic bomb and how he became a political target
Sep 9 2023,negative,too slow too long and too hard to follow they jump between different periods of time and a trial and confirmation hearing but its all confusing and hard to follow
Sep 9 2023,positive,i was blown away i loved every part of this movie especially from the imax experience the volume of the bombs the ptsd scenes the debate scenes everything i had to go back a couple times to make sure i caught everything this movie also had a wild cast that constantly had me saying oh i remember them i definitely recommend this movie if you are a history buff love christopher nolan films enjoy politics or love a good story
Sep 9 2023,positive,the story here is not as much about the scientists making the bomb but the red scare period of the cold war  it was really painful to watch what was done to the brilliant oppie postwar even if you didnt know he wound up teaching grade school kids robert downey jr is definitely in the academy award zone for his turn as strauss in this film as was cilian murphy and emily blunt  for some the jumping around from the color story to the bw later period might be confusing and annoying but its worth sticking it out to watch all the brilliant cast do their thing in telling this tale i did need ear plugs for the superloud parts  no joke
Sep 9 2023,positive,this movie made me live the history of the terrible position of our country in ww2 showing what one of the most brilliant scientists faced in helping his country win it and all the perfidy he subsequently endured from self absorbed politicians afterward
Sep 8 2023,positive,the film is a worthwhile watch i highlystronglydefinitely recommend this movie
Sep 8 2023,positive,since my three children and i highly admire the movie director christopher nolan we watched oppenheimer last week because this film was highly anticipated were looking forward to watching it in theaters    despite being impressed by the climactic explosion scene i found the film underwhelming     first im not sure what the director intended to convey did he want to change peoples thoughts about the scientist was he eager to show the fanatical mccarthyism or did he want to discover the secret about the atomic bomb anything among these wasnt quite hitting the mark for me    secondly i didnt appreciate its running time it could be better if it were shorter    last but not least as a fan of florence pugh i found she was exploited improperly especially sexually    i have seen no christopher nolan films just once however this one might be the first unfortunately
Sep 8 2023,positive,absolutely loved it this goes right next to interstellar another nola masterpiece
Sep 8 2023,positive,the music is incredible
Sep 8 2023,positive,absolutely awesome performances
Sep 8 2023,positive,awesome amazing i definitely recommend people to go see it
Sep 8 2023,positive,another masterpiece of christopher nolan i have no words to explain about this masterpiece
Sep 8 2023,positive,this movie has the capacity of keeping you glued on your chair throughout the whole movie even in the most boring and historically dense parts
Sep 8 2023,positive,brilliant movie  kept you riveted the whole time and it is long
Sep 8 2023,positive,christopher nolans skillful cinematography is on full display in oppenheimer the film does a great job of exploring both the practical and emotional demands of the story of j robert oppenheimer
Sep 8 2023,positive,one of my favorite nolan movies
Sep 8 2023,positive,its a great movie dont get me wrong great actors great cinematography but oppenheimer didnt credit  160 vfx artists just to claim its a no cgi film a lot of hard work was put into this movie from dozens of artists just to pretend like vfx was never used and erase their trace in a form of credit
Sep 8 2023,positive,oppenheimer might be nolans most focused movie since dunkirk complete with his usual flourishes that both help and hurt his lavish biopic this is a film that i suspect most will enjoy more if they do a little research on oppenheimer and the manhattan project before seeing the film as important sequences in the film actually never happened this also isnt helped by a rapid passage of time thats not properly explained and a story that jumps back and forth in time that makes what should have been a straightforward film needlessly complicated     despite these issues oppenheimer delivers on every other front every performance in the film is excellent and i can definitely see cillian murphy getting a best actor nod at the oscars next year composer ludwig gorransons violin based score perfectly encapsulates every scene in the movie to the point where it was a major highlight for me returning cinematographer hoyte van hotyema lavishly shoots and frames every shot of this film turning it into a visual treat especially in larger formats
Sep 8 2023,positive,brilliant cast ran a bit too long but wow what a beautiful score i smell and oscar for ludwig the score for the trinity scene was stunning
Sep 8 2023,positive,not for the fam that is afraid of knowledge and history  acting way beyond my wildest expectation  i think this is one of those must see movies
Sep 8 2023,neutral,i was an engineer and retired military officer with extensive experience at top levels in this movies subject while living mere miles from hanford los alamos and trinity   site ive even met one of the characters have worked closely with some of their successors and have worked with scores of physicists in military weapons applied research i was thus extremely eager to see oppenheimer    alas they may as well just have shown me a 10minute printed summary because most of the dialogue was so muddled and murky that all i got was the general gist of it i had been warned by friends that they couldnt understand most of the movie but i assumed the issue was the technical subject matter not the sound quality instead it reminded me of games of thrones which i abandoned in its second season for the same reason id love to know the reasons oppys characters did what they did but i dont have the time to go read the book     nor should i have to
Sep 7 2023,positive,loved it incredibly engaging cinematic and well writtenl did not feel like a 3 hour movie
Sep 7 2023,positive,oppenheimer  boom  this film is a happy marriage one between the reality of historical facts and their intertwining within an amazingly dramatic cinematic presentation this films reported success not withstanding the juggernaut of barbie is heartening on a lot of important levels it has had to overcome some considerable obstacles a significant portion of the dialogue deals with theoretical physics its runtime is a whopping 180 minutes it has no car chases fist fights or explosions  sorry scratch that last one  its all about explosions perhaps the biggest hurdle it overcomes that warms the cockles of this old heart is that its grounded in history a 78yearold history when i first read about its development i was a doubter ive continually read that interest in historical events is on the wane more with each generation but then comes oppenheimer to prove me wrong im so very glad  on to the film many documentaries and books have covered the biographical connect the dots of oppies life however it took the consummate conviction of christopher nolan one of our preeminent directors to write direct and produce this film the facts are all there but nolan reveals the humanity commitment and luck that fleshes out one of the worlds most morally complex achievements against japan ending wwii despite the surrender of germany still the dropping of two bombs on civilian targets is hotly debated to this day  the film lives in the gray areas of this accomplishment it exposes the infinite complexity of the man it deals with the innumerable trials and tribulations of herding the greatest minds of science toward a shared horrible goal and while portraying this it ingeniously allows you to appreciate the various common and contradictory perspectives of the people in this true mission impossible  cillian murphey while familiar is not only the spitting image of the real oppenheimer but he uniquely encapsulates the gravitas of the man he accomplishes this through a soft spoken logical almost inhuman detachment of the actual events murphy allows us to see the straddle of oppies psyche between dispassionate observer and consummate leader participant its really an amazing bit of acting each of the large supporting cast is pitch perfect with a particular shoutout to robert downey jr hes the bad guy  the all too real lewis strauss but credit to nolan it seems he found a way aided by no small amount of ageappropriate makeup to rope in downeys typical exuberant tendencies into a deft projecting of the jealous ambitious vitriol of the reallife person he portrays you almost want to hiss at the screen in the end  the film is almost divided in two parts the creation and building of the bomb the first but once its dropped despite what it accomplishes the downfall of oppie begins this is the story of oppenheimer of which few people are aware his lifes arc is revealed in his going from time magazines man of the year to shunned communist sympathizer overshadowing his later life  for those students of history that parallel arc of glory to disrepute is not dissimilar to that of winston churchill both are tragically similar   ive consciously avoided using success as an adjective describing the development and use of the bomb anything snuffing out the lives of 10000 civilians defies that definition to my mind however its impossible to argue against it succeeding in ending the war and thus saving countless u s soldiers lives that after all was its ultimate intent nolan doesnt make an argument one way or the other he leaves that up to the historians and us  as a followup whether you see oppenheimer i highly recommend to you another historically based movie that never gained the credit it richly deserved the imitation game is on netflix it deals with the cracking of germanys enigma code  which also helped end wwii in another historical fashion
Sep 7 2023,positive,best work of nolan best work of cillian murphy not my usual type of movie but fascinating enough i dared not to blink for 3 hours watched it a second time today still fascinated also gary oldmans scene is so perfect loves his stareand the twitch under his left eye will try to view it for the 3rd time
Sep 7 2023,positive,some parts were a little boring some highly suspenseful very well acted
Sep 7 2023,positive,excellent scrip and artistst but needed to be edited
Sep 7 2023,positive,i typically enjoy watching longer films in the comfort of my home waiting for their online release however oppenheimer was an exception time seemed to fly by as it was filled with thrilling moments at every turn i believe it deserves an oscar for best movie and cillian murphys performance is worthy of best actor its unquestionably a 5star film
Sep 7 2023,negative,any quality acting was overshadowed by a weak script fiction blurred fact
Sep 7 2023,positive,this is truly one of my all time favourite movies and it isnt even action or superhero while i do understand that some people dont want to sit for 3 hours watching people talk with each other with a small bit about the bomb exploding the effects and the dialog still kept me up watching nolan really nailed this movie and i learned a lot of new things about it so its a win win for both i guess
Sep 7 2023,positive,this movie was very informative just goes to show what our government will do to someone  excellent movie
Sep 7 2023,positive,excellent storytelling powerful visuals really helped viewers feel the struggles oppenheimer and others had on many levels
Sep 7 2023,positive,emily blunt miscast but cillian murphy and florence pugh were outstanding  two storylines in one film  well done
Sep 7 2023,positive,best film ever in the history of biographical films the scores visuals storytelling and performances of the case are spoton and excellent
Sep 7 2023,positive,give downey and murphy an oscar immediately now and one of course nolan as well for creating this cinematic masterpiece
Sep 7 2023,positive,its not important when things happened whats important is that they happened
Sep 7 2023,positive,great piece of history it was well told and and entertaining for a 3 hour movie loved the pace it didnt felt slow and the performances were awesome specially cillian murphy and matt damon
Sep 7 2023,positive,thought this was a very interesting captivating and wellpresented movie with a lot of insightful historical views into ww ii    would recommend the movie and see it again
Sep 7 2023,positive,one of the best movies of recent years  thought provoking and timely look at the consequences of our actions in the context of scientific social political military and personal imperatives are we capable of exploiting our potential for advancement without unleashing their destructive potential i fear not especially now beware of ai  great cast direction acting and editing and needed the 3 hours
Sep 7 2023,positive,fastest 3 hrs ive ever seen for a movie
Sep 7 2023,positive,a story that really needed to be told brilliantly written brilliantly acted sobering but doesnt leave you without hope same old story of power corrupting still plays out today in the movie oppenheimer asks will no one ever tell the truth gratefully here they have
Sep 6 2023,positive,slow burn excellent direction and outstanding acting all kinds of awards were written all over for the 2023 best movie of all you must watch and watch metreon sf theater only
Sep 6 2023,positive,nolan has done it again  better even he has created a magnum opus which exposes the contradictions of a man given and revoked of great power we see the best of humanity and the worst of humanity and everything in between in this film and cillian murphy has performed one of the best actors jobs i have ever seen  he is able to tap into the soul with simply his eyes and body language with an emotional acuity few have
Sep 6 2023,positive,top notch  one of the most important films ever made
Sep 6 2023,positive,i thought this was a really good movie they should have cut out the nudity and sex scenes it was uncomfortable didnt add anything and seemed out of place  especially the scene during the questioning it was like what other than those unnecessary features i would recommend it
Sep 6 2023,positive,big story came out today on rt what everyone suspected seems to be true 
Sep 6 2023,positive,great movie  blended a lot of different ways to tell a story  way to loud which i would have thought was a theater issue if my daughter didnt say the same thing from a different theater
Sep 6 2023,positive,amazing film that i am glad i saw in the theaters
Sep 6 2023,positive,the movie was confusing at times too many characters to remember  interesting piece of h history  it certainly reflected an awareness how conflicted the physicist was in building a weapon of mass destruction  we all need to reflect on that question
Sep 6 2023,positive,wonderful acting great performances from all
Sep 6 2023,positive,i have watched this twice in theaters and it was to say the least an amazing movie one of the best ive ever seen if not the best now sometimes u can hear them due to audio mixing or just being confused because of how many characters there are its hard to remember names but other then that the cinematography was phenomenal and watching it in theaters was amazing both times when the bomb when off and it was silent then boom it hit just amazing i definitely recommend great cast aswell
Sep 6 2023,positive,very revealing movie and maintain the interest for 3 hours
Sep 6 2023,positive,top notch cast with great performances kinda long but compelling
Sep 6 2023,positive,amazing movie got to see it in imax 70mm movie remains true to the facts pre during snd post wwii oppenheimer got screwed over by the very country he was fiercely loyal to odd how they glossed over the rosenberg incident which was the end all how the soviets got the information on the bomb
Sep 6 2023,positive,the acting and script were very good but the movie jumped all over the place and was too scrambled
Sep 6 2023,positive,this movie is amazing i cant really describe it with words  the complex theme of a cold war a race for world dominion the use of classical and dramatic music the cgi the actorschills literal chills i got goosebumps several times and trust me its rare  this movie doesnt go with the usual bad vs good because the main result is messed up and rotten from the beginning  its a rush in time to see who gets the possibility to rule the world and doing so possibly destroying it  i must say the movie is very complex after the three hours i got a mild headache  and it may not be suitable for everyone but its worth a shot if you like deep emotional stuff  huge props to nolan for this piece of art
Sep 5 2023,positive,it was long but it never really felt that way  highly recommend it
Sep 5 2023,positive,one of the best movies ever must see  wow must see on imax every actor a star
Sep 5 2023,positive,nolan takes a biopic about a fairly well know public figure and turns it into an incredible edgeofyourseat thriller its his best movie yet     the ensemble was just as impressive this movie is going to revive some careers just fantastic from beginning to end
Sep 5 2023,positive,excellent and important story that is historical
Sep 5 2023,positive,its longer than the war itself still very relatable 1010
Sep 5 2023,positive,it was very good but too long  they could have cut out some of the middle
Sep 5 2023,positive,excellent movie historical fantastic special effects great actors
Sep 5 2023,positive,terrific bio of a man who was never understood or appreciated the acting is superb with cameos from big stars throughout the movie downey jr was at his best well worth the longevity of the movie however during the closing credits i would have liked to have known what happened to oppenheimer and his family in later life
Sep 5 2023,positive,i liked knowing the history  my boss the associate dean of engineering at usc back in 1975 worked on the manhattan project in chicago when he was young  the depiction of oppenheimers humanity and remorse was poignant  then i learned after 45 years of marriage that my husband had interviewed with edward teller for a sloan fellowship  also back in the 70s  the revelation of how they railroaded oppenheimer was an eye opener einsteins input regarding the presentation of awards was thought provokingwonderful movie  the writing was just great
Sep 5 2023,positive,i liked the detail and the full picture   didt like how long it was
Sep 5 2023,positive,i saw oppenhimer just to see the bomb scence
Sep 5 2023,positive,kept our attention  didnt seem like three hours liked the history aspect of the film as well cinematography and acting were excellent definitely a contender for many awards
Sep 5 2023,negative,after 3 long tedious hours of trying to figure out the storyline to this rambling drama i finally realized there was none  this movie was disjointed failed to provide context of significant historical events and a true disappointment  the impact of hiroshima and nagasaki is so important but it was lost here
Sep 5 2023,positive,oppenheimer is good in fact it is quite good i believe it is the most assured movie christopher nolan has ever made in his career it doesnt mean it is my favorite movie of his but here you feel he is in full control of every dimension of his movie at the same time narrative style acting and technical aspects technically this movie seems perfect  everything is in perfect harmony with everything  but theres a lot of information going onscreen and it is a movie that demands you to be focused the movie switches from a narrative line to another the central storyline which tells the story of oppenheimer and how his personal and professional life have led him to the creation of the atomic bom then theres lewis strauss public hearing the black and white parts and then theres oppenheimers hearing when hes a lot older than in the central narrative line its a lot and it is a movie thats not for everybody but its a great movie for me    so the movie starts giving the audience context about oppenheimers early academic life early personal life his ventures his ambitions and his ideals but unlike most biopics all these elements that are presented are later revealed to be highly relevant somehow for all means oppenheimer is not a cool good guy and nolan understands that so he makes him an highly charismatic character in order to get the audiences sympathy and then casts cillian murphy  a great actor able to deliver a very internal performance under the surface of a man almost made of steel  which shows his genius thanks to the way he writes oppenheimer and thanks to murphys presence nolan is able to tell a story about an unpleasant man and engage an audience its good writing work and its good directing work yet this is cillian murphys movie  front and center  and he excels here its a magnetic central performance that exudes charisma but relies on a nuanced approach and a very sad heart that carries the movie during its 3 hours running here murphy delivers the best performance of his career topping his work in 2005s breakfast on pluto with an acting turn that contrasts completely with the later one  the rest of the cast also deliver very strong work specially robert downey jr as lewis strauss  its refreshing to see him being back to nonmcu movies in such style as strauss downey jr seems to delve into the mind of the character and absorve all his mannerisms while simply eating the nolan dialogue its a juicy part and the actor uses every second he is on the scene to remind us how and why he was considered one of the best actors of his generation another big turn comes from emily blunt as the typical sufferingsupportive wife with a drinking problem  it is by far one of the most conventional and unchallenging performances blunt has ever delivered in recent years but hers belong some of the best scenes in the whole movie blunt could have done this part in her sleep but she elevates the material and the character and delivers a small acting gem here matt damon and josh hartnett are also quite good here and bennie safdie gets some room to shine also  technically oppenheimeir is as great as nolans previous big productions but it all feels way more polished the production design team did a great job recreating many places and situations that feel quite authentic and historically accurate the costume design is lovely and the aging makeup is also good it quite reminds me of a beautiful minds work in this department actually but the gold goes to ludwig g√∂ransson amazing score  in fact i think the score is what actually keeps this movie burning and alive which helps keeping the pace and help the audiences to be immerse in the 3 hour running the sound editing and mixing are outstanding and i still feel my room shaking during the trinity test scene great use of visual effects as you can expect from a nolan movie  but oppenheimer also tries to go further the biopic narrative it manages to offer a perspective about guilt grief and how dark ambition can be even for the man who achieves his goals its something i think nolan has never done before offering moments of introspection and morals theres a scene full of symbolism that makes a clear point about what nolan wants to say the world about war and destruction in name of politics he doesnt totally succeed for me i consider that scene to be too well crafted for me in the way it offers so many visual elements that dont chanel the message the director wants to deliver yet i understood what he meant when i came home later    so in the end oppenheimer is perfectly crafted and it features a complex and dense narrative thats completely bearable thanks to great acting and an amazing score but this is a movie with a lot to tell and it tries to be a bit darker than it actually is  it offers a vehicle for audiences to think about how evil man can be to its own kind and how political power and political ambition are a menace for our own kind so a very good movie in a very traditional way but with some technical groundbreaking elements that elevate this one one of nolans most solid films ever but cant top my favorite of his yet
Sep 5 2023,positive,70mm imax is my favorite experience in all cinema  ive tried all kinds of premium theatres this by far is my fav
Sep 5 2023,positive,little slow but great story
Sep 5 2023,negative,the characters were very surface i never got a sense of who oppenheimer was and more importantly what he cared about it felt like a shallow painting of a portrait that never appears
Sep 5 2023,positive,great acting and makeup overbearing music covering some of the dialog
Sep 5 2023,negative,an utter monstrosity of storytelling a meandering circlejerk in which the most convincing protagonist is the bomb itself in hopes that it might explode prematurely and put viewers out of their collective misery kudos to the extensive list of excellent actors however for handing in notable performances robert downey jr proves yet again that he is one of the finest in his field its a pity that these performances were wasted on such an incoherent mess and while its one thing to wreck a film in the editing suite its unconscionable to do so and still take an eyewatering three hours of screentime to do so if hiroshima nagasaki and the entire cold war were not evidence enough of the horrors of the atomic age then oppenheimer is the final proof needed that humanity never deserved such a comprehensively ugly fate
Sep 5 2023,positive,a bit long but good story  not historically accurate but enjoyable nonetheless
Sep 5 2023,positive,i like that the film didnt feel rushed
Sep 5 2023,positive,dislike nudity sex scenes 3 hours is too long otherwise good movie
Sep 5 2023,positive,it was interesting  historical way
Sep 5 2023,positive,movie was interesting and intense it was a a little long  some parts could have been eliminated to make the movie a little shorter but overall it was a good movie and worth seeing
Sep 5 2023,positive,long movie and drama
Sep 5 2023,positive,absolutely amazing all the actors should be nominated for an award and christopher nolan is my favorite director bar none
Sep 5 2023,positive,excellent movie as a phd in physics i really enjoyed this movie as it taught me so much
Sep 5 2023,positive,i was worried i would lose focus on this lengthy movie but my interest was very much held the depth of the story needed time and i learned a lot about that era it also inspired me to read more about this history
Sep 5 2023,positive,i thought it was a fair and honest representation of the oppenheimer story
Sep 5 2023,positive,i love you christopher nolan
Sep 5 2023,positive,although it was long it had a lot of information and kept our interest throughout it was interesting to learn a little history
Sep 4 2023,positive,i regularly sit in a dialysis chair for 312 hours at a stretch this was the fastest 3 hours i have experienced in my life the story was compelling even though it is known the performers were extraordinary and the production itself propelled and supported the storytelling in ways that i havent seen in a very long time
Sep 4 2023,positive,very interesting  story i did not know the story behind oppenheimer  excellent acting by robert downey jr
Sep 4 2023,positive,could have told the story in less than the 3 hour run
Sep 4 2023,negative,this movie had a lot of potential unfortunately most of its story is told in an intricate and confusing way so much so that at the end of the whole 3 hours you will struggle to remember the names of the characters in the final dialogues also most of the movie is closeups of oppenheimers face which might shine light on the actors unequivocal abilities but sure does not make the film compelling to watch i was mostly left confused and bored after the first half
Sep 4 2023,positive,loved the history in it i lived in much of that time and remember the interrogationgrillingwitch hunts of many innocent people
Sep 4 2023,positive,very long and deep concentration needed to keep up with the story line too many flashbacks but very interesting
Sep 4 2023,positive,this was phenomenal in every way it was long but it didnt feel like it it was thrilling and beautifully made
Sep 4 2023,positive,great movie  recommend it to everyone 
Sep 4 2023,positive,well done great treatment of the story excellent
Sep 4 2023,positive,all time classic really the only issue is the editing is really good but it can be a bit jumpy and hard to follow at certain points mainly because it gets sooooo wordy and dialogue heavy especially in the stretch before the bomb is about to go off when they go on the spy game subplot that couldve been cut because of how overloading it is with information similar to the whole runtime of something like all the presidents men it does get a bit complex and jumpy when they jump between the cold war h bomb and the building of the a bomb but its done well enough where i follow it but it definitely is something you need to pay attention too especially the final 30 minute political drama which is very involved but not as bad as the spy plot because its spread out more and more visual even when this does get bogged down in dialogue details it ramps it right back up with drama and tension instantly outside of that everything else is masterful rdj is incredible in this and the best thing but murphy is amazing as well the dialogue is really good also and despite it being dialogue heavy at times in ever found it boring or unnatural i do wish blunt had a bigger part because it feels like she can just disappear at times but shes good i love how a third of this is in black and white and distinguishes the h bomb plot from the main story the buildup and actual explosion is amazing and worth the 2 plus hour buildup i do wish sometimes the slower scenes popped visually more instead of just constant rack focus shots with serious dialogue but there acted super well very interesting and the rest of the shots more than make up for it this gives a honest real look at who this man was his faults his gifts his accomplishments downfall and the consequences of his actions it is a film that thrills challenges dramatizes and makes you think everyone should see this once
Sep 4 2023,positive,story sound and visual were great
Sep 4 2023,positive,not one second was i not tuned in
Sep 4 2023,positive,the performances the visceral feeling of the explosions the emotional toil of the project
Sep 4 2023,positive,the acting was incredible great movie
Sep 4 2023,positive,a great history lesson learned things i never new about oppenheimer and the development of the bomb
Sep 4 2023,positive,incredible capture of an era i lived through would that  all movies had acting of this professionalism
Sep 4 2023,negative,nolan surpassed himself again   just when i thought he couldnt get worse than tenet
Sep 4 2023,positive,it was a great mind thinking thrilling movie
Sep 4 2023,positive,great movie story is an important one in nor just american but world history
Sep 4 2023,positive,my wife likes drama i like physics except for pdes so we both go 5stars  btw pee before you sit in
Sep 4 2023,positive,this was cinemas birthday gift to me it premiered the day after my birthday
Sep 4 2023,positive,loved the details of the story and disturbed by politics trying to ruin him
Sep 4 2023,negative,its somewhat unbelievable that a movie about one of the most compelling and fascinating events in history could be as undramatic and dull as oppenheimer most of the film are facecloseups  there are very few long slow beats that allow the viewer to enter the world of this story so this means there is endless exposition add to this the trite and cliched dialogue and the result is an incomprehensible story with onedimensional characters i think it would be more interesting to read the book on which this movie is based or better yet stream the documentary the day after trinity on criterion
Sep 4 2023,positive,this is a great film  the acting the settings the intrigue the history it did not even seem like it was 3 hours long  it moved quickly
Sep 4 2023,positive,absolutely two thumbs up  not overly dramatic and very close to fact vs fiction  such an eclectic cast of both familiar and unfamiliar faces will have you in awe
Sep 4 2023,positive,the talented director and cast
Sep 4 2023,positive,a bit long and probably unnecessary nudity but a good story
Sep 4 2023,positive,great film  lots of facts   great cast
Sep 4 2023,positive,loved it very educational
Sep 4 2023,positive,a wellmade bio pic that was far too long and needed more focus  the cinematography especially the black and white sections is gorgeous  the special effects were inventive  the power broker story of lewis strauss was for me compelling  however editing was needed  the story could have been told in less than three hours and still would have been interesting  the sex and nudity were imo gratuitous and unnecessary
Sep 4 2023,positive,this movie was a masterpiece
Sep 4 2023,positive,movie was good but not what i expected  it didnt go into a lot of detail about the manhattan project bomb design
Sep 4 2023,positive,how do i review this movie  it was well shot well paced well acted and a compelling story of reality that has so many parallels to the wonderful imitation game but it also felt out of order unfocused and anti climactic      i am very open to the anticlimactic part being on me  i realized i was hoping for a movie about the manhattan project  it wasnt it was a story about oppenheimer the title probably should have been a giveaway but i thought it was just focused on oppenheimers activities and management of the project  the project is certainly prominent in the film but it was not the driver of the story     the main drivers were his infidelity and love of a woman he could not be with his at the time not uncommon flirting with communism and others notuncommon flirts with fascism when we were not so tribal and pigeon holed in america and the scientists dismay that the weapon wasnt enough for the military but they wanted bigger and worse  though a compelling argument is made that the bomb did stop major war  deaths from war are minuscule since then compared to prior     my biggest issue was simply that to me the story climax should have been the successful test of the bomb  having that occur near the end of hour 2 with an entire hour to go didnt sit well with me  another film i will watch again now that i know how it goes to see if it hits me differently      also if you are a massive florence pugh fan like me it is never wasted time to see a film with her in any capacity     the post
Sep 4 2023,neutral,the most disturbing thing about this movie is it isnt disturbing its entertaining with good actors i will conceed but it is a sanitized gutless portrayal of the building and dropping of the atom bombs complete with a few jokes so our audience doesnt get too depressed about the subject matter sorry but old oppie isnt getting my sympathy like nolan wants less than 5 minutes is spent on the description of the effects of dropping the bombs  no we couldnt possibly be shown the footage of hiroshima  much to disturbing for the audience i guess what a huge missed opportunity too bad someone like edward berger didnt get to direct this
Sep 4 2023,positive,the acting was superb as one of the special effects it made me want to look more into the real life story of these people
Sep 4 2023,positive,wonderful production cillian murphy was very good but robert downey jr was better i wish there had been more scientific nuts and bolts but not everyone has a nerdish streak
Sep 4 2023,positive,great movie that really delves into the personal and philisophical delemmas of the father of the atomic bomb  keeps you engaged throughout even though it is long  some great acting notably cillian murphy really brings oppenheimer to life
Sep 4 2023,negative,this movie was way too long and quite boring  this type of movie would have been better suited as a documentary based on the focus i am very disappointed in it
Sep 4 2023,positive,this movie was so well done it brought a story to people that while many people should know many people do not the acting was superb and even though it was a long movie it went at a steady pace i cant wait to buy it on bluray
Sep 4 2023,positive,it was too long story was interesting but some parts dragged on and on
Sep 4 2023,positive,an incredible piece of art highest level of acting from everyone with a gripping storyline paired with mesmerizing visuals     for those who didnt see at the start the movie is split between two perspectives fission and fusion the black and white switching to color was the demonstration of two separate perspectives not necessarily a time shift
Sep 4 2023,negative,common opinion and i say common because more than half of the audience was asleep as confirmed in other theaters as well    a lengthy film almost akin to a documentary which is nonetheless based on a book rather than the actual historical events or genuine statements made by oppenheimer  complex character names frequent flashbacks  if you lose focus for even a minute you risk not comprehending anything scientifically the maximum attention span is 30 minutes  to alleviate the male tedium they included 20 minutes of nudity  the trial didnt matter to anyone  were discussing 2 war crimes that could have been easily avoided yet in these films they are portrayed as lifesaving decisions i wonder what people in japan will think  after hours of anticipating the trinity explosion the bang seemed underwhelming to the extent that many in the theater remarked they failed the test we expected far more special effects  given that we were after all in a war they could have at least depicted the scene of the bombs being dropped  in conclusion cinematically and in terms of performance it was impeccable  would i watch it again no  would i recommend it to everyone no                                                           in iita popolar opinion e dico popolar perch√® pi√π di mezzo cinema dormiva cosa confermata anche in altre sale  1 film prolisso quasi un documentario che cmq si basa su un libro e non sulla storia o su vere dichiarazioni di oppenheimer   2 nomi complicati doversi flashback se ti distrai 1 minuti poi rischi di non capirci nulla  scientificamente la soglia dellattenzione massima √® di 30 minuti  4 per rimediare alla noia maschile hanno messo 20 minuti di tette   5 del processo nn fregava niente a nessuno  6 stiamo parlando di 2 crimini di guerra tranquillamente evitabili e che in questi film vengono presentati come mosse salvavita chiss√† cosa ne penseranno in giappone  7 dopo ore di attesa dellesplosione di trinity il botto √® sembrato ridicolo tanto che molti in sala hanno detto hanno fallito il test ci si aspettava molti pi√π effetti speciali   8 eravamo cmq in una guerra potevano mettere almeno la scena delle bombe sganciate   conclusione  cinematograficamente e interpretazione impeccabili    lo rivedrei  no   lo consigli a tutti no
Sep 4 2023,positive,boobies lots and lots of boobies
Sep 4 2023,positive,way too loud and unnecessary nudity
Sep 4 2023,negative,is a political documentary which does not fascinate but boring unfortunately despite the wonderful performance of the actors no empathy is created with the characters represented the manhattan project serves only as a background no insight into the moral implications nor the outcomes of the use of bomb drops the music and photography are wonderful
Sep 4 2023,positive,this film is so outstanding in every way a film can be great all aspects of filmmaking are excellent the direction casting the actors the script add up to great story telling by nolan and all involved thus far it is the best film of 2023
Sep 4 2023,positive,great acting but too long
Sep 4 2023,positive,too long too much walltowall music was bored
Sep 4 2023,positive,amazing movie  robert downey jr gave a stellar performance
Sep 4 2023,positive,great actnghaving lived through the era all very well represented
Sep 4 2023,positive,instant classic acting dialogue casting photography soundtrack all perfect
Sep 4 2023,negative,im separating the seriousness of the topic from the film boooring too long  too many characters had to squeeze in any name that was a physicist at that time flat affect by lead actor i would have left early had i not been viewing with a friendmay get an award for makeup actors like downey were hardly recognizable and definitely captured the  look of the time
Sep 4 2023,positive,this is a very moving story of robert oppenheimer the scientist who was responsible for the production of the atomic bomb the film is well acted and is a very dramatic production which illustrates the far reaching effects of this project the film has enormous impact and puts into perspective the role that politicians play in shaping our world for better and for worse i would highly recommend this film in this day and age  a time in which we should be reminded to choose our politicians wisely
Sep 4 2023,negative,boring boring boring zzzzzzz
Sep 4 2023,positive,unparalleled shock unparalleled pain
Sep 4 2023,positive,the movie was great but not the theater itself ac was out was very miserable throughout the film including my husband and others there as well a few of us complained to management but all fell on to deaf ears poor service overall amidst a great movie
Sep 4 2023,positive,too long  good movie
Sep 4 2023,positive,oppenheimer was amazing  kept our interest for the whole movie  so many stars tell this true story
Sep 4 2023,positive,so good great casting acting story  special effects i was fully engaged it did not feel like a 3 hr movie bc it was fast paced  interesting
Sep 3 2023,positive,concept is really good
Sep 3 2023,positive,great movie a little slow at the start great acting
Sep 3 2023,negative,poorly written  audience laughed a lot but its not a comedy
Sep 3 2023,positive,way too long and difficult to follow at times with all of the switching back and forth between years and all of the characters
Sep 3 2023,negative,too long and jumping back and forth in time didnt help story
Sep 3 2023,positive,deeply insightful look at a single man during a complex historical moment that changed our world forever aware of the audience viewing this movie pairs greatly with people keenly aware of the world events of our time and living on the edge of ww3 one of the most important movies of our life and cinema history
Sep 3 2023,positive,a great piece of history came to life i did not realize how they persecuted oppenheimer with a kangaroo style strategy it reminds me of what they are doing to trump it didnt feel like 3 hours it kept our attention highly recommended
Sep 3 2023,positive,great acting great story line solid look at history good discussion of scientific ethics although long it probably needed to be the sound effects were a little overwhelming and distracted me from the dialog i am glad i watched a solid documentary before going to this it filled in some biographical gaps
Sep 3 2023,neutral,longer than it needed to be
Sep 3 2023,positive,although it was very long i could not stop watching because there was much going on and i did not want to miss a word  acting was very good
Sep 3 2023,negative,too long and lacking in character development
Sep 3 2023,positive,movie was great 70mm imax theater was the best place to see it
Sep 3 2023,positive,the only flaw of this movie is that the bomb wasnt that breathtaking they should have used cgi combined with physical effects however christopher nolan proves he is the best writer director who commands respect in the movie business from shitty tenet to the goat that is oppenheimer well written dialogue this time as opposed to tenet its emotional as opposed to tenet this movie fucking rules it feels like its an indie film its classic nolan making an epic movie that feels small but big there are no words to describe how awesomely made this movie is just check it out
Sep 3 2023,positive,very good movie need to stay attention so as not to miss what is said in conversations may have to watch it again
Sep 3 2023,positive,greatest movie of the decade
Sep 3 2023,positive,we live in the end of the movie
Sep 3 2023,positive,none of your business
Sep 3 2023,positive,a damn work of art as the story develops in 3 hours the characters cillian murfy shines with his character in any aspect makes me feel emotional the direction of christopher nolan
Sep 3 2023,positive,the acting is great and oscar worthy but the movie could have created more conversation with a better script 
Sep 3 2023,positive,way more than a biopic this follows one of the greatest physicists pursuit of the atomic bomb
Sep 3 2023,positive,excellent movie  a story that definitely needed telling
Sep 3 2023,positive,this movie ticked every box that a perfect blockbuster needs depth ambience and an impeccable and constantly moving dialogue not one scene was cold or flat the perfect casting of well known and respected actors formed a formidable cast that held its own to the very end i would definitely recommend watching this in the cinema to have a full experience and to truly appreciate nolans incredible mind of true cinema
Sep 3 2023,positive,the historical value of the movie was fantastic th lead actor did an outstanding portrayal of oppenheimer as did the supporting cast however the movie ran a too long there were many scenes that could have been shortened without limiting the storyline the three sex scenes were unnecessary and were way too graphic for young audiences yes we get that oppenheimer was an amorous fellow but that could have been relayed without those graphic sex scenes overall i feel the movie was definitely worth watching but would have been much better based on my comments above
Sep 3 2023,positive,good story and acting did not seem like 3 hours
Sep 3 2023,positive,a bit too long but otherwise really enjoyed it
Sep 3 2023,positive,i felt the movie was boring regarding the drama over his communist connections
Sep 3 2023,negative,a piece of history transformed in a rutless supershow with music so loud that i had to plug my ears a couple of times continuos flashback scenes which made difficult to follow the sequence of the facts the diector created a surreal platform where imbedded the history this was not a war game where you need sounds effects and extreme scenes to get the spectator attention
Sep 3 2023,positive,the inclusion of two completely unnecessary sex scenes means that this film will never be shown in high schools which is stupid because kids need to know this story  of all the things i didnt like about that movie the fact that i wasnt able to take my 14yearold to see it and know about the story because of some gratutitous nakedness is infuriating      that said he would have been bored senseless  despite amazing acting from robert downey jr the constant cutting back and forth between the different time periods covered by the film made it really hard to follow  not recommended
Sep 3 2023,negative,terribly boring and overly drawn out film far too jump and made very little sense one minute it was 1939 then next hitler was dead very disappointed
Sep 3 2023,positive,great history film but it jumped around too much past to  present back  forth
Sep 3 2023,negative,i havent seen many poor reviews outside the scope of complaining about sound quality at the cinema etc which isnt a fair reflection of the movie  however i found this film terrible    maybe its a new way to shoot movies which went over my head but what i saw was essentially a 3 hour montage     the orchestral music was over done in every scene and no atmosphere was allowed to naturally develop through dialogue or character interaction    there was no sense of character development outside of hearing facets of oppenheimers sexual endeavours it was referenced purely for shock factor and we saw no real insight in to any intricacies of the character also robert downey jr was a villain maybe maybe not but he ended up outcast at the end of the film based on misplaced jigsaw pieces that were scattered throughout the film some scenes in black and white some in colour not sure why this was as the film had little linearity     other characters were mentioned in different scenes but due to the mish mash of over done visual spectacle i found it difficult to remember anyones name apart from the protagonist albert einstein and the president      5 minute scene after 5 minute scene had a vague reference to maybe something historically true with the aforementioned orchestral music accompanying some emotional crescendo with one of the stars of the film which in itself told no story what so ever     i honestly felt like i spent three hours scrolling through a tik tok reel     i saw this film as the result of a free cinema ticket and i still feel robbed
Sep 3 2023,positive,some of the finest performances  brilliantly written  photography and editing gorgeous  costuming exceptional
Sep 3 2023,positive,if you can see it in the theatre a larger than life experience
Sep 3 2023,positive,a brilliantly told story of a complex man and his struggles against a world that locked in on his flaws in spite of his virtues who maintained his integrity while those around him demonstrated their lack thereof    brilliantly told by a brilliant filmmaker christopher nolan could make watching paint dry captivating the use of sound is brilliant the acting phenomenal the storytelling exemplary truly a great movie the perfect encapsulation of hollywood is capable of when they get out of their own way
Sep 3 2023,positive,was just a little bit slow and confusing at the beginning like with everyone nolan film but it started to make sense and was one of the best movies in theaters lately definitely would see again and i loved how it was filmed in imax 70mm
Sep 3 2023,positive,great actingglad to learn the history around the atomic bomb
Sep 3 2023,positive,beautifully shot character depiction of a man with an impossible quest even though its a very long film it manages to capture you for the whole length making it feel shorter very emotional
Sep 3 2023,positive,loved its long you gotta be committed but breathtaking cinematography and full of meat to sink your teeth into and chew on im still sifting through the content of what all was in that deep philosophical insights and real life applications of loyalty and principals
Sep 3 2023,positive,i liked the movie for its historical story telling about the character oppenheimer how he came into his professional career but conflicting with his personal issues and moral conscience of his work but the move was too long and sometimes difficult to follow with many flash backs and flash fowards
Sep 3 2023,positive,you dont need to see this in imax i almost walked out because of how unnecessarily loud it was overall a good movie a little confusing but it comes full circle its the visuals in this movie or the 60 second bomb scene was dope but overall a good movie and a good message if you are able to understand the meaning behind the story
Sep 3 2023,positive,the beginning was difficult to watch and unnecessary visuals the rest of the movie for the most part was fascinating and so interesting really good acting it was long but if youre in a comfortable theater its fine
Sep 3 2023,positive,for a3 hour movie the time passed quickly
Sep 3 2023,positive,masterful deconstruction of the importance of the critical moment in history
Sep 3 2023,positive,mastery in multithreaded storytelling a breathtaking original soundtrack practical cinematography and a seasoned solid script  all of christopher nolans elements coupled with a stellar ensemble led by cillian murphy effectively resurrect the iconic figure of the last centurys deathprometheus in todays popular culture
Sep 3 2023,negative,too political and bounced around too much  not what i thought it would be
Sep 3 2023,positive,great cinematography and acting interesting take on a complex protagonist who has been the subject of books and even an opera although the story line was a bit confusing at first it became clearer as the film rolled on certainly oppenheimer will be a nominee if not a winner in the 2024 academy awards ceremony  my two friends and i saw the imax production while the sound didnt bother me they thought that the audio level was set too high making it sometimes difficult to understand when actors were talking over each other
Sep 3 2023,negative,just so so   friends told us it was great so we were somewhat disappointed
Sep 3 2023,positive,a fascinating story and a story of importance very well told with brilliant acting
Sep 3 2023,positive,great movie had my attention the whole time a
Sep 3 2023,positive,well maintained intensity
Sep 3 2023,positive,it was done so well  the acting was superb
Sep 3 2023,positive,the sex and nude scenes were totally unnecessary especially as shown  other than that the movie was quite intense depicting oppenheimers internal struggles dont know how over done they may have been there was some level of jumping around in first 13 of movie and little difficult to know what the timeframe was i was not aware of all the typical political garbage that happens to people who are called on to do something that ends up being judged negatively out of convenience it was well played and ignored much of the other fallout caused by the abomb but then it was all about him and dealing with it all
Sep 3 2023,positive,long but worth it very well done a list actors did a phenomenal job
Sep 3 2023,positive,a lot of good history i never knew a bit long some of the parts done for effect could have been shorter
Sep 3 2023,positive,really good movie amazing performances all around i did feel like the director was manipulating the audience quite a bit even more than is normal in the movieshis use of sound in particular seemed at times to be driving the audience to be uneasy and sometimes frightened
Sep 3 2023,negative,i dont know why theres so much hype around this movie i love historical movies this was very hard to follow you arent sure which scene is past present or post atomic bomb i feel like you should be a physicist or a lawyer to really understand it it dragged on way longer than it had to id rather sit through some pretty bad movies than to watch this again if youre going to watch it do it at home so you can at least fall asleep on the couch
Sep 3 2023,positive,the script wasnt really very good some of the cast felt hamfisted in there as their typecast or too obvious of a cameo some parts were a decent thrill but it seemed overly focused in clumsily namedropping historical figures and the third act drags quite a bit i would not watch it again even if i like the 28 days later guy a lot there just wasnt much to the film other than a bunch of competing egos and it felt like something that would only be impressive to someone highly impressionable im not sure exactly how accurate all of the film was but both barbie and oppenheimer were just kind of boring
Sep 3 2023,positive,the movie was riveting from start to finish
Sep 2 2023,positive,it was fantastic   although some of it was over my head i learned so much about him 
Sep 2 2023,negative,i know this is an unpopular opinion but the movie was scattered and self indulgent at 3 hours a lot could have been cut starting with the nudity and sex scenes which added nothing to the plot the nudity was also was just the woman actor of course
Sep 2 2023,positive,good psychological intense film with great acting
Sep 2 2023,positive,oppenheimer is one of christopher nolans greatest films the cinematography and mindblowing visuals keep the audience engaged the whole time the entire cast will blow you away with powerful performances it is a definite mustsee film for film buffs and casual moviegoers alike
Sep 2 2023,positive,one of the best film if not the best of the year
Sep 2 2023,positive,true story made me think and listen
Sep 2 2023,positive,the movie was very good but the volume in the theater was unbearable
Sep 2 2023,positive,excellent movie cast perfectly
Sep 2 2023,positive,it was a very good story i didnt like the nudity or the sex they were really not needed
Sep 2 2023,positive,i liked the cinematography audio and overall atmosphere of the movie christopher nolan can always create something aweinspiring i enjoyed the main cast as well and although the film was 3 hours i felt i was captured the whole time
Sep 2 2023,positive,absolutely explosive
Sep 2 2023,positive,this movie is just pure peak i understand how some people would not find the movie much entertaining but me personally i loved it a lot
Sep 2 2023,positive,first of all i just love movies based on true stories i really enjoyed this one
Sep 2 2023,positive,beautifully filmed dialogue hard to follow at times could have cut out more of the lingering scenery scenes i think emily blunt will win an oscar for her performance
Sep 2 2023,positive,such a brilliant movie
Sep 2 2023,positive,the movie was fantastic
Sep 2 2023,positive,christopher nolan best movie

Sep 2 2023,positive,probably the best movie i ever saw
Sep 2 2023,positive,the acting was excellent
Sep 2 2023,positive,nolans propensity for chopping up the timelines of his movies only serves to hinder oppenheimer which places the most dramatic moment of the film squarely in the middle of its running time
Sep 2 2023,positive,one of if not the best made movie ive ever seen the actingactors the music the plotall done so very well this one is winning awards thanks cillian for rocking this part

Sep 2 2023,negative,very confusing movie difficult to understand constantly switching between time periods wanted to leave early
Sep 2 2023,positive,i liked this movie much more than i anticipated and it kept my attention through the full length
Sep 2 2023,positive,great film providing important historical perspective
Sep 2 2023,negative,confusing no explanation for those of us who didnt know anything about the movie i had no idea what was happening lots of switching between times super confusing movie i left after an hour and a half 
Sep 1 2023,positive,as a teenager this film left me with overwhelming anxiety and emotions i cant express with words as of today this was by far one of my favourite experience in cinema that ive been through
Sep 1 2023,positive,very good story but seemed a little longer than it needed to be i understand they needed to explain a lot of backstory and theory which was nice but it did seem a little elongated
Sep 1 2023,positive,i loved it  its at the top of my list of all time great movies
Sep 1 2023,positive,superb a great work with an amazing cast i would recommend it to everyone
Sep 1 2023,positive,movie was long but it moved right along so before you know it the credits were rolling  movie showed his life from when he was in college learning stateside and abroad his minimal connection to communism his inner struggles to make the first atomic bomb to the terrible way he was persacured after he spoke out about continuing on with bigger and more destructive bombs see this and you will have a great understanding on what had to happen in order for oppenheimer to become famous
Sep 1 2023,negative,very disappointed movie is far too loud  actually painful not just loud but after an extended period of quiet a  sudden blasting sound that made you jump out of your seat the audio problem was not just the volume many conversations drifted in and out of hearing or were just mumbled the movie itself needed a lot of editing  it was much too long many characters were introduced with little info of who they were the shifting of time just added complexity to an already confusing story very poor direction and editing
Sep 1 2023,positive,after waiting restlessly for two years i finally watched christopher nolans epic    i dont even know where to begin im still in awe of what i have just witnessed christopher nolan has the power to suck you right into his world and grabs hold of your attention due to this i was reluctant to move from my seat and refused to blink this three hour long epic was so engaging and this feat is only possible because of only one man and he is christopher nolan    the screenplay was just too fricking amazing and i would say a huge improvement from tenets the film did surprise me in so many scenes the film has many great actors but only a few scenes in spite of that owing to the excellent screenplay all of them get their chance to shine the last 15 minutes in my opinion were brilliant and the ending was just extremely scary    coming to the performances everyone was just fantastic mainly emily blunt robert downey jr and cillian murphy emily blunt comparatively had fewer scenes but in this one scene which comes towards the ending emily managed to shine in those 5 minutes which called for some cheering in the theatres robert downey jr was just too good he was able to portray the different shades of strauss with ease due to the fact that we havent seen much of rdj  in the last 10 years except for as ironman in the mcu the audiences has forgotten what a brilliant actor he actually is cillian murphy was just extraordinarily and he was born for this role he was able to capture oppenheimers physicality as well as his mental state of mind extremely well he managed to externalise his inner struggles which was marvellous now give this man an oscar that he deserves    this film is a hard hitting drama on the surface but i found it to be something close to a horror film a horror film about the atomic bomb and how it was created there were so many scenes that scared me and i had an increased heartbeat the part that scared me the most was the fact that it was real and that this weapon of destruction still exists the destruction of the world is in our very hands    in the end all i can say is that this film deserves to be watched in the theatres and shouldnt be missed by any chance
Sep 1 2023,positive,exceptional not an action movie by any means this is an involving captivating and enthralling character study about one of the most important men to have ever lived  the dialogue was difficult to hear at times but that may just have been the cinema we were in i saw it in full 70mm imax in manchester and the experience was unforgettable the cast and performances were first rate the images and soundtrack could not have been better but you need to go into watching the film knowing this is not an action movie with a big bomb at the end cant wait to see this again at home on 4k blu ray another masterpiece from chris nolan
Sep 1 2023,negative,it was sort of interesting but mostly boring and way too long i guess just wasnt my type of movie because i dont get all the hype about it
Sep 1 2023,positive,a bit long but very good fantastic cast acting  directing
Sep 1 2023,positive,absolute masterpiece i was told that the explosion was very underwhelming but for a movie that didnt use cgi for it it was about more or less what i expected also it was my first movie in 70mm too fantastic experience
Sep 1 2023,positive,because of the historical content you need to be in the mood for such a movie in order to get all you can from it  because of the amazing cast your mood makes no difference to your enjoyment of the movie  case in point one third of way into movie my daughter leaned over and whispered to me i cant believe all the famous people in this i whispered back i know  turns out she was talking about matt damon etc and i was talking about einstein etc  
Sep 1 2023,positive,great movie  very well scripted with an amazing cast  even though it was 3 hours long it kept our attention throughout whole movie
Sep 1 2023,positive,a must see that involves a thrilling side to the historical dramatic film cillian as always plays the role to an amazing extent
Sep 1 2023,positive,riveting acting and story so well done
Sep 1 2023,negative,tedious boring overlong  what is all the praise about confusing format maybe some good story to tell but it wasnt told herenot in the long dreary 3 hours mwss ridiculous waste of time  resource
Sep 1 2023,positive,overall the movie was excellent very cool story line that i knew very little about at all acting was top notch and the visual effects were stunning per usual with a christopher nolan movie it could be a bit confusing at times but overall it was very well thought out and did not feel as long as the run time
Sep 1 2023,positive,despite the long running time i was invested in the story and characters throughout casting is spot on early reviews spoke of prolonged nudity that just isnt there
Sep 1 2023,positive,my favorite movie of the year and i believe nolans best murphy nailed the role everyone was great in it
Sep 1 2023,positive,incredible 3hour movie that keeps you riveted to the screen with this remarkable story of the manhattan project and how robert oppenheimer sought out and put together some of many of the worlds best astrophysicists and other scientistic minds were vetted and hurried into moving wfamily to a desert area to form build and live in a town in desolate northern new mexico in the desert to build the atomic bomb away from society before germany and russia plus it explains how biased americas capitalistic government were so extremely biased to any people who showed socialist and or communistic tendencies as well the disregard for jews and people of color in the late 30s and 40s and the dirty politics to achieve their goals its characters are made of very popular middleaged stars who made some spectacular performances in this movie which should get best picture of the year
Sep 1 2023,neutral,stunning  but indulgent visuals music and sfx too loud so impossible to hear much of the dialogue films climax comes with an hour still to go timeline confusingly unnecessarily jumpy not every film needs to be memento dude    great performances though especially robert downey jr but also damon branagh blunt florence pugh nathan lane rami malek
Sep 1 2023,positive,true to history complicated story creatively presented genius
Sep 1 2023,positive,awesome but too much politics for me
Sep 1 2023,positive,everything about movie theater and customer service was first class and fun

Aug 31 2023,positive,one of the best movies ever
Aug 31 2023,positive,loved the excellent acting and terrific production values but it really could have been a half hour shorter without damaging the plot thank heavens the theatre had a bar
Aug 31 2023,positive,flawless great cast and great score which helps move the movie along whilst building the tension
Aug 31 2023,positive,no real reason to film in 70mm imax
Aug 31 2023,positive,well shot great score that added to the atmosphere
Aug 31 2023,positive,outstanding  yes 3 hours pace was slow but tensionfilled and kept me fully engaged  great casting i smell several academy award nominations and dare i say predict a few wins
Aug 31 2023,positive,interesting movie spoilt for me by an over loud musical background which made the dialogue difficult to hear
Aug 31 2023,positive,a fascinating and impactful historical character study nolan and teams technical work is impeccable as always
Aug 31 2023,positive,fantastic presentation a bit too much talking
Aug 31 2023,positive,great story actors and dialogue 
Aug 31 2023,positive,so much hype for this movie but it didnt live up to the billing  shifting time lines complicated the story telling
Aug 31 2023,negative,im not sure if we all saw the same movie but i thought it stunk    i kept waiting for something more to happen but it never did      very very very boring     i wasted 3 hours of my life   watching paint dry would have been more interesting  sorry  nope
Aug 31 2023,positive,top notch entertaining film from beginning to end excellent acting cinematography sound and custom design a sure oscar contender
Aug 31 2023,negative,the pace of the story is too fast and it focused on too many issues revolving around the character the story follow mainly the details mentioned in the trial it might come across as interesting point of view however it makes the story about oppenheimer not as memorable as it should be
Aug 31 2023,positive,the cheers of death echo as men weep     oppenheimer is a great film about a man whom it seems not a lot of people really knew a story of controlling the energy that can destroy the world we are witnessed to destruction betrayal love and sadness we see men yell at each other as they try to control a power they cant comprehend     the testing of the bomb was grade a filming and in the quietness my heart beat loud knowing the destruction to come
Aug 31 2023,positive,a little long but very interesting fascinating
Aug 31 2023,positive,this movie is fantastic christopher nolan did a very good job
Aug 31 2023,positive,did not love the final act felt overly dramatic perhaps contributed by the specific casting of the role  was expecting more scientic angle and was not entirely clear on certain political context
Aug 31 2023,positive,the music and editing of this movie are perfect
Aug 31 2023,negative,bored out my mind just long and a boring story line about what a bomb being made yawn not for me
Aug 31 2023,positive,exceeded expectations i love christopher nolan movies but the hype was real
Aug 31 2023,positive,the sheer history behind the bomb and oppenheimer role in it
Aug 31 2023,positive,another amazing movie from nolan  its a kind hard to understand in the begining but with the time you get it all the necessary details and informations   a cinema movie
Aug 31 2023,positive,it was a compelling story the cast is very good especially the lead members but it was too long
Aug 31 2023,positive,oppenheimer is a magnificent movie full of complex themes and thoughtprovoking commentary it explores the impact of science humanity and morality in an incredibly thoughtprovoking way and the acting is stellar i left the cinema feeling like i had just experienced something truly brilliant and profound anyone who ponders otherwise is truly out of their depth overall i would recommend oppenheimer to anyone who wants to have a powerful movie experience that will stay with them for days after viewing it truly is a masterpiece
Aug 31 2023,positive,i liked everything about it few films can keep me riveted for 3 full hours but this one did
Aug 31 2023,positive,very well cast riveting but i only understood about 80 of the dialog next ill read american prometheus and see the movie again with subtitles
Aug 30 2023,negative,this film prominently features highly regarded male actors accompanied by a limited presence of esteemed actresses such as florence pugh and emily blunt who portray characters that align with christopher nolans tendency for charismatic yet volatile female roles    criticism of nolans portrayal of women has been persistent over time these female characters often possess an alluring and intelligent demeanor yet their narratives often end tragicallyreminiscent of the marginalized and illfated wives in the prestige inception and memento    in contrast the role of florence pugh an exceptional talent within her generation is regrettably constrained to moments of emotional distress and nudity her character jean tatloc a politically influential psychiatrist with her own compelling backstory seems underutilized similarly emily blunts portrayal of kitty oppenheimers belligerent wife primarily involves offering encouragement to her husband or displaying frustration towards her crying infant her sole redemption moment involves an engagingly acerbic exchange with one of oppenheimers adversaries    the film progressively revolves around heated discussions among white male figures within boardroom settings this focal point not only marginalizes other characters but also positions white men at the forefront of the narrative relegating other perspectives to the periphery and classifying them as mere distractions or collateral    however a glaring omission is evident in the films historical contextjapan the absence of any substantial focus on japan in a narrative that centers on oppenheimer is not only glaring but ethically concerning the films neglect of the japanese perspective renders it morally incomplete particularly considering it purportedly presents oppenheimers perspective on the trauma he experienced  moreover nolans treatment of renowned figures like einstein and the exclusion of john von neumanns involvement in the manhattan project underscores a concerning oversight in the films historical accuracy    the films tendency toward overdramatization is evident in its portrayal of oppenheimer as an unparalleled force in history capable of deciphering the intricacies of the strong force this characterization borders on the risible and its audaciousness aligns with the selfabsorption often attributed to nolan    the films final act places undue emphasis on oppenheimers security clearance and endeavors to evoke a sense of moral empathy for a man who played a central role in the deaths of thousands this focus on portraying oppenheimer as a victim seems misplaced as historical accounts suggest he grappled less with his moral responsibility and more with personal entitlement    rather than addressing the experiences of those who endured war crimes the film places undue importance on the emotions of those who contributed to such actions biographical films that prioritize the perspectives of instigators especially when told predominantly by white men prove inadequate vehicles for recounting narratives of imperial aggression and genocide these narratives inevitably sideline critical aspects of history limiting the storytelling potential  throughout the film a sense of pretension prevails reminiscent of nolans reputation the filmmaker appears to have succumbed to his own acclaim reflected in the films execution    while the films success can be attributed partly to riding on popular trends and the loyalty of nolans followers its critical shortcomings remain evident this is not the kind of film that warrants repeated viewing claims to the contrary may stem from an attempt to project intellectualism rather than a genuine appreciation of the films merit    the movie is plagued by significant flaws primarily stemming from its writing regardless of the visual and auditory elements the inadequacies of the script are undeniable dialogue rarely engages character development is virtually nonexistent and the plot proves insipid even the inclusion of alist actors cannot salvage the screenplays shortcomings hollywood tropes designed for oscarworthy performances make an appearance in the films final moments emphasizing the films inclination toward selfindulgence    regrettably the films perspective remains fixated on the experiences of a privileged white man the movie refrains from offering insights into the internal lives of the japanese or depicting the mass casualties inflicted upon them  the films neglect of the trinity tests repercussions on indigenous and mexicanamerican populations is an egregious omission that denies the audience a complete understanding of history    the films disregard for the plight of those affected by the atomic bomb fallout is starkly apparent families spanning generations still grappling with the consequences continue to seek justice from the us government    furthermore oppenheimers deliberate choice to detonate the bomb over united states citizens in new mexico neglecting the option to do so in tennessee underscores the films lack of acknowledgment regarding this racially charged decision such oversights contribute to a narrative that distorts historical realities and sustains a heroic portrayal of oppenheimer despite his morally questionable choices    in conclusion the films pretentious perspective aligns with its directors persona its success can be attributed to strategic associations and a dedicated fanbase but it fails to overcome its significant deficiencies the narratives shortcomings coupled with its historical and ethical omissions underscore the need for a more comprehensive and sensitive approach to storytelling
Aug 30 2023,positive,three of went to see oppenheimer this afternoon  all three of us agreed that it was a terrific movie in every respect it was worth every minute of the 3 hours showing time
Aug 30 2023,positive,interesting historic based story but not entertaining
Aug 30 2023,positive,load background music
Aug 30 2023,positive,i really learned a lot we will be buying the movie when it comes out in video and watch again
Aug 30 2023,positive,gigantic and intimate beautifully loud and eerily silent its an overwhelming experience which magnificently hurts you for its whole duration
Aug 30 2023,positive,only complaint is i didnt always hear what the  people were saying  background soundtrack too loud
Aug 30 2023,positive,cracking filmutterly engrossing
Aug 30 2023,positive,everything about the movie  the actors and actresses  were great
Aug 30 2023,positive,the thing that bothered me the most about the film is the fact that it consists of dialogues constructed with continuous and improbable backandforths worthy of the lightest american action movie but how is it possible for scientists politicians and various bureaucrats to really talk in that way clearly i realize that this type of interaction between characters makes a story digestible and engaging which would have been too boring otherwise especially considering the extremely long duration however the work really loses credibility because of it and ends up becoming ridiculous i also point out following the same line the excessive visual effects typical of nolan especially in the first part when the young oppenheimer sees and feels the macroscopic reality represented by luminous flows and the like
Aug 30 2023,positive,this is sobering but so good
Aug 30 2023,positive,good movie albeit a little slow in parts acting was great and story stayed pretty close to actual events worth a see on a large screen
Aug 30 2023,positive,if theres something i can truly call cinema this is it
Aug 30 2023,positive,the detailed facts and time line match up
Aug 30 2023,positive,very personal take on the struggles of the man behind the bomb during a difficult time when almost everyone could be accused of being a communist times change politics change people change awesome to see history
Aug 30 2023,positive,technically well crafted and filmed cast is shining with strong performances from robert downey jr  emily blunt matt damon and cillian murphy  stellar cast making impact to the screen cinematography is top notch  editing is a bit convoluted at the beginning and some dialogues are redundant  but past that its a good movie which may be a bit too much for some audience
Aug 30 2023,positive,fantastic movie screenplay directing and acting just great
Aug 30 2023,positive,so amazingi think nolan will win oscar
Aug 30 2023,positive,brilliant cillian murphy just fantastic as oppenheimer
Aug 30 2023,positive,the special effects and superb acting especially from murphy and robert downey jr
Aug 30 2023,positive,christoper nolan adds another masterpiece to his steadily growing filmography with masterful performances from cillian murphy florence pugh and others this storytelling of the atomic bomb will peak the interests of viewers more familiar with these events and newcomers alike
Aug 30 2023,positive,this is a must see 
Aug 30 2023,positive,i mostly liked it a lot i think it helps to have some background information going into it for example knowing something about the manhattan project is helpful especially knowing that there were leaks to russia it also helps to have some idea of the red scare the mccarthy era and how far the us went to limit free speech at that time the movie makes a lot more sense in its historical context     one thing i didnt like about the movie  i had a hard time at first following the flashbacks they were not in chronological order and i didnt know anything going into the film about what oppenheimer did after the bomb was created in my mind the introduction of strauss came too soon for me to catch its significance but maybe that helped create suspense not knowing who had betrayed oppenheimer
Aug 30 2023,negative,i thought it would be presented in a story line like pearl harbor was  this is just a documentary with no good storyline and suspenseful music blasting for 3 hours  literally the best parts of the movie are all in the trailer  watch the trailer and there is no need to go to the movie  if you want a storyline and action i recommend that you dont go to this movie  if you want to sit through 3 hours of facts presented in a documentary style than you might enjoy it  the background suspenseful music was too much for too long and i found the entire movie distasteful
Aug 30 2023,negative,i have never left a movie before but 45 minutes in i did ot was like a badly cut history channel program   i was really looking forward to the movie and was disappointed
Aug 30 2023,positive,decent flick drink a triple shot of expresso and red bull cause its long af 
Aug 30 2023,positive,if you like great stories clean and powerful music and shots this movie is for you it is not necessary you know physics but it would help you undertand the movie a little christopher nolan or cillian murphy almost never dissapoint in this movie they show how great they are i like how they managed the time the storytelling and the thought in oppenheimers mind love the way characters change in their age
Aug 30 2023,positive,a fast pace interesting story inner thoughts of moral intensity and prepare for a long movie
Aug 30 2023,positive,the last 30 minutes or so seemed to drag on a little but overall it was a great movie
Aug 30 2023,positive,too long no need for all the time spent on the inquisition okay hes a martyr for the communist enough already
Aug 30 2023,positive,well done  i didnt know the backstory on building the atomic bomb  it was interesting but longall the actors di a good job
Aug 30 2023,positive,fantasticmovie of the year
Aug 30 2023,negative,it was boring and could have been far less than 3 hours
Aug 30 2023,positive,very good movie though some of the acting was a little over done overall very good
Aug 30 2023,positive,this show really made me ponder and think learned some things i didnt know and it motivated me to go do some research enjoyed the movie
Aug 30 2023,negative,im astonished that the only movie ive ever walked out of was a c nolan joint absolute turd too fast too busy tacky and awkward with too many characters bad writing poor or no editing and obviously way too long worst movie score ever recorded  it completely drowned out the nearly whispered dialogue its clearly one of those movies people will claim to like so they can feel intellectual
Aug 30 2023,positive,terrific movie  made me want to revisit history of that time in our country  great acting
Aug 30 2023,positive,a landmark achievement in american cinema and history stunning
Aug 30 2023,positive,great writing and acting happy for all the violinists hired to provide the tension
Aug 30 2023,positive,a great movie in a superficial moment thanks nolan
Aug 30 2023,positive,excellent powerful movie loved the dialog
Aug 29 2023,positive,christopher nolan proves yet again his undeniable talent of turning a good script into a breathtaking film
Aug 29 2023,positive,learning the truth behind the oppenheimer scandal was a little long but very detailed
Aug 29 2023,positive,brilliantly acted robert downey jr almost steals the movie but cillian murphy is a revelation both haunting and haunted fantastic screenplay for a 3 hour movie thats mostly dense exchanges of dialogue it manages to be riveting
Aug 29 2023,negative,only has one star bc of cillian murphy and good cinematic the rest was horrible didnt know what was happening most of time
Aug 29 2023,positive,its okay as a biographical  it is too long much could have been cut effectively such as the nude scenes which added zero to the story the soundtrack is awful  the actors voices get muffled by the musical background which gets so loud at times it becomes foreground the actors also mumble and whisper especially the oppenheimer character who is a weirdo  the story did not make emotional sense to me  its about scientist nerds who are wrapped up in their careers so they cant see the forest for the trees theses geniuses were planning to make a bomb they knew would murder tens of thousands of people and worked on it for years and then guess what they felt bad after it was dropped   oppenheimer was definitely a security risk and later on in his career he was not given security clearance that made perfect sense to me  but hey he was accused of hanging out with commies which he did but that has become very popular these days cry me a river
Aug 29 2023,positive,the best performance that i ever seen in the cillian murphys carrer
Aug 29 2023,positive,nothing special really
Aug 29 2023,positive,great film intense and interesting was a tad documentary style for me
Aug 29 2023,positive,i loved it  the movie really captured what was going on behind the scenes  in one scene a german scientist told oppenheimer to go to goettingten and find more scientists goettingten is where my parents were born  they were teenagers at the time  they came to the united states in the 50s to get married and raise a family that really moved me  highly recommend everyone should see this movie it will definitely enlighten them to what was happening behind the scenes
Aug 29 2023,positive,go for the atom bomb stay for the sex and politics
Aug 29 2023,positive,oppenheimer  1010 theres a line in jurassic park that kept resonating with me while watching this movie its the line ian malcolm says in the movie during the lunch scene your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could they didnt stop to think if they should and thats the gist of this movie its a cautionary tale a political one by far nolans most political film a epic and tragic look at a complex human being that has changed for better or worse the course of civilization oppenheimer has changed the way war is conducted now even if that never was his intentions nuclear warfare is now as prevalent as ever and nolans last hour or so of the film is dedicated towards giving a warning to all about the dangers of making the next big bomb each hour feels like a different movie the first hour feels like a traditional biopic the second feels like a tense drama and the last hour is a surprisingly thrilling political drama its excellently directed acted produced written and conceptualized for the screen if youre not a fan of talkie type movies then avoid this movie because you will not appreciate it but if youre a cinephile you will love this this is a master who has honed his craft and delivered a masterpiece and that atom bomb testing scene if you watch this in imax and by all means you have to its the only way to watch this then brace yourselves because its outstanding
Aug 29 2023,positive,mind blowing the directing the editing the sound the performance
Aug 29 2023,positive,excellent story wellstructured for familiarity with public record with a surprise or two as the story progresses very well written and acted
Aug 29 2023,positive,i was interested in the background story during an era i lived in the script was good and the acting excellent i was upset with the part involving politics  all in all worth the ticket
Aug 29 2023,positive,a impressive movie that is a cultural phenomenon
Aug 29 2023,positive,very good i loved it
Aug 29 2023,positive,yesterday i saw oppenheimer for the 4th time  thats something ive only done with a handful of films twice in imax and twice in regular 35mm print regular cinema screening as ever with chris nolan he treats his audience with the utmost respect under the assumption that they can keep up and are intellectual enough to understand what is going on on screen of which there is an awful lot to take in reactions to the film have been largely positive but there are people logan paul for instance who have said they walked out or found it boring simply because of the fact that the film consists largely of men in rooms talking to each other in meetings and board rooms i think this perfectly highlights certain peoples overprioritisation of form over substance yes the film is largely dialogue but its about as rich in substance and significance as it gets the screenplay is one of the best i have ever seen  it takes something pretty special to make an over 3 hour film feel like 2 hours thats almost entirely devoid of action and instead filled with dialogue    the next thing i want to talk about is cillian murphy as oppenheimer  wow wow wow a career defining performance for the ages mark kermode said if cillian murphy doesnt get nominated for the best actor oscar for this performance i will eat my hat off the film lives or dies on his performance and is largely from his perspective  the script was actually written in the first person and also unusually written on red paper which i think is befitting for a film dealing with such harrowing subject matter what i loved also is the use of imax cameras which instead of being used to show truck flips ww2 dogfights and hospitals being blown up like in his previous films it is being used to focus on something much more intimate and complex  the human face cillians performance is so brilliantly nuanced and varied that this film has to be seen on imax to be fully realised  expect to see hoyte van hoytema getting an oscar nomination and possibly a win in feb next year depending on what else comes out between now and then     there are plenty of other things about this film i could talk about ad infinitum like the brilliant score ive been listening to almost non stop since it came out and the beautiful imagery that used next to no special effects  it was nearly all done in camera the ensemble cast gave amazing performances too particularly robert downey jnr emily blunt and jason clarke my only gripe was the sound editing  it was occasionally a little too loud  particularly in imax making it slightly difficult to make out at times what they were saying i feel almost as stunned as i was when id seen the dark knight 15 years ago because this is what chris nolan does  you dont just watch his films in the cinema and go home and thats it  they leave the cinema with you they have tremendous staying power and oppenheimer is the best film hes made since the dark knight in my humble opinion     the actual substance of the film the meat the nitty gritty is what im most interested in sinking my teeth into and indeed i suspect i will for quite some time we live in an ever changed world as a result of the manhattan project and oppenheimers work on it the genie is out of the bottle as mankind will forever be able to unleash the power of the atom and destroy itself  there is no going back from this the man is fascinating in that he was a walking talking paradox  he invented the atomic bomb with the intention of saving the world from further bloodshed during ww2 at the risk of destroying it as he famously said quoting the hindu scripture the bhagvad gita now i am become death destroyer of worlds    one final thing i want to talk about before i sign off on what initially was intended as a facebook post and has now become something of a university dissertation thank you if youre still reading this is chris nolan himself if you love cinema and no i dont mean netflix amazon prime and streaming services chris nolan is one of the few shining beacons of hope cinema has left cinema lovers out there need to get behind him and pay to see his movies as he intended  on the big screen and its great to see it taking as much money at the box office as it has he really is so so precious as are a handful of other directors like tarantino bongjoon ho dennis villeneuve and paramount to the survival of cinema where everyone seems to be streaming everything rather than going to blockbuster to rent a dvd or vhs in my day i had the good honour of meeting chris in 2017 outside the imax screen in londons science museum and one of the things that struck me was how present he was  he was totally focussed on me and what i was saying which is rare for people of such high profile i think this is perhaps the ultimate advert for staying present staying true and living in the now because thats all there is if you are focussed on process over outcome a future goal in the ether which detracts you from the present moment you will invariably be successful if chris increasingly spectacular resume of films isnt testament to that then i do not know what is
Aug 29 2023,positive,cinematography was great movie was a little hard to follow at times
Aug 29 2023,positive,a very good movie but could easily have done without the sex scenes
Aug 29 2023,positive,as a history buff i enjoyed seeing everything i read about put on the big screen but i wouldnt recommend it to the average person who might find it a bit too long and bit boring at times
Aug 29 2023,positive,loved imax screen but hated sound i used ear plugs way too loud
Aug 29 2023,positive,i loved that the movie contained historical references to a controversial subject and helped me gain an understanding of the mindset during the occurrences as well as revealing details of the backside of the event
Aug 29 2023,positive,this 70mm viewing as my second watching of oppenheimer was phenomenal the film started out shaky as first but the color and quality was magnificent contributing to the rustic and historical portion of the film this second viewing also was better because i could pay closer attention to details of the supporting characters and how oppenheimers slight interactions with him were not so slight in the grand scheme of his security hearing and strauss cabinet hearing overall a great film would recommend multiple viewings
Aug 29 2023,positive,semplicemente sublime un capolavoro tirato fuori dal pi√π incredibile dei cappelli da parte di christopher nolan e un film che ti cambia che ti fa pensare dal punto di vista di chi lo guarda √® emozionante le 3 ore passano tranquillamente grazie anche al modo di coinvolgere lo spettatore durante tutta la pellicola essendo un film sulla storia cera il rischio di trasformarlo in film lungo e noioso al contrario il regista √® riuscito a portarci in un piacevole viaggio sia dal punto di vista del fisico oppenheimer sia dal punto di vista di lewis strauss qualit√† effetti speciali fotografia e regia al top per non parlare del cast cillian murphy spettacolare da oscar da non sottovalutare anche la prestazione di robert downey jr di matt damon e di emily blunt noi abbiamo effettuato la visione di oppenheimer in imax e non cera assolutamente modo migliore di goderci questa pellicola stiamo parlando di cinema allo stato puro con tutto il comparto tecnico spinto al massimo qualit√† dellaudio e dellimmagine sublime con delle trovate cinematografiche che rimarranno indubbiamente nella storia del cinema secondo noi a mani basse uno dei migliori film degli ultimi anni ovviamente superconsigliato    simply sublime a masterpiece pulled from the most incredible of hats by christopher nolan its a film that changes you that makes you think from the viewers point of view its exciting the 3 hours pass easily thanks to the way of involving the viewer throughout the film being a film about history there was a risk of turning it into a long and boring film on the contrary the director managed to take us on a pleasant journey both from the point of view of the physicist oppenheimer and from the point of view of lewis strauss top notch quality special effects photography and direction not to mention the cast cillian murphy spectacular oscarworthy also not to be underestimated are the performances of robert downey jr matt damon and emily blunt we have made oppenheimers vision in imax and there was absolutely no better way to enjoy this film we are talking about pure cinema with all the technical sector pushed to the maximum sublime audio and image quality with cinematic gimmicks that will undoubtedly remain in the history of cinema in our opinion hands down one of the best films of recent years obviously super recommended
Aug 29 2023,positive,a little hard to connect the peoples roles not having read anything about him
Aug 29 2023,positive,one of the best movies ive seen given the subject matter and the great acting definitely oscarworthy
Aug 29 2023,positive,too much courtroom drama and not enough about the bomb and its consequences i was bored
Aug 29 2023,positive,interesting movie brought up many vague memories
Aug 29 2023,positive,so much history acting and scenery was superb a bit on the lengthy side though
Aug 29 2023,positive,a visual feast for the eyes that retells the story of the father of the atomic bomb with the utilisation of now perfected story devices that were just beginning to sprout in nolans other movies like momento whilst the films more surrealist elements may be lost on some it definitely helps to make this movie feel more inspired then it otherwise would be and helps to give us insight into the thought processes of the characters minds using the premise of show dont tell to its fullest extent     while some performances leave a bit to be desired others are fantastic and the cinematography and direction is on point even if the pacing does slightly falter towards the films climax right before the big punch of revaluation at the end     all in all if you want to see a movie for its visual flair or are a nolan fan then youre going to love this and even if youre not youll probably find something to appreciate in it
Aug 29 2023,positive,most unique theater experience ever one of the most unique films ever period nothing like it
Aug 29 2023,negative,i really wanted to like this movie but it tried to do too much and had no throughline also the women characters only two though played by actresses who did all they could with bad roles were portrayed as uniformly unhinged i would not recommend this movie save your money and your three plus hours
Aug 29 2023,positive,outstanding film all around 
Aug 29 2023,positive,im not usually a fan of nolans editing stylebut it worked very well here  the 3 hours flew by
Aug 29 2023,positive,a showcase of nolan operating at the highest echelons of auteurism lacked pure entertainmentvalue by virtue of the subject matter but a magnificent feat of thoughprovoking filmmaking nonetheless
Aug 29 2023,positive,very powerful movie the acting was brilliant
Aug 29 2023,positive,mind intriguing and moral bending with an excellent cast to support it all there should be general knowledge about the man the people he worked with and also the trails and the politics revolving around it otherwise it can be a little hard and confusing to follow at times it has interesting characters who are very well acted creatively structured storyline pleasing set design really great score and sound design that gets you immersed into tense and chilling moments the movies just unnecessarily long lots of scenes that drag on a little too much without offering enough which also makes the movie lose its momentum over and over again it works as a biography a bit better than it works as a movie
Aug 29 2023,negative,this movie has absolutely no action what so ever  its a 3 hour debate  not my cup of tea but to me this movie was beyond boring
Aug 29 2023,negative,a bomb from one of my favorite directors i would have walked out if there was more keg room
Aug 29 2023,positive,a very complicated and important story told in an understandable way  great acting
Aug 29 2023,positive,oppenheimer is nolans best film the directing is great and the writing grabs your attention so many actors in this movie and its insane how many share the screen together in such short amount of time    cillian murphy plays his role so well and the way he portrays the character is different and yet interesting its emotional especially with how he sees things and how he acts with his eyes    robert downey jr is the one who really stood out to me the most in the movie his acting is the best ever of his career and he stole every scene in was in dont be surprised if he gets nominated for an oscar and maybe even wins it    the color and black and white works real well on how the story is told even with the use of the practical effects that nolan always uses the testing scene of the h bomb with the silence is one of the best in film and captures so much emotion without a word    only problem i had with the movie was the run time you can take off about 2030 mins of the movie and it is still just as effective if not better     once we see the test happen with the h bomb and know what its being used for and how the movie could have ended there and i would be fine with it i dont think we needed another 45mins on the security hearings    i see oppenheimer being nominated for lots of awards especially for lots of oscars about 1214 nominations it will def sweep the technical categories nolan might finally win his oscar    is the movie worth the hype yes it is if you like biopic films and enjoy history go see this movie if you dont want to sit through 3 hrs then just wait but its a movie that should be seen    the movie did remind me of amadeus 1984 quite a bit because in amadeus its suppose to be mozarts movie but antonio salieri is the main focus in oppenheimer strauss is the main focus more than oppenheimer    the movie will keep you thinking a few hours after it is over oppenheimer is and will be a movie that will be talked about quite a bit in film history even 100 years from now for its directing acting writing and biopic
Aug 29 2023,positive,a very human film that does an excellent job of visually and auditorally getting you in the mind of cillian murphys oppenheimer it was tense uncomfortable and full of rough moral moments loved it beautiful
Aug 29 2023,positive,documentaries are what i like and this was close to a documentary hollywood style
Aug 29 2023,positive,this is a masterpiece
Aug 29 2023,positive,great cast amazing story and so well done  a definite must see
Aug 29 2023,positive,i was really surprised how much i enjoyed the movie   it was entertaining and before i knew it the show was over and i wanted to know more  i will definitely see it again because i am sure i was not able to catch everything told  a definite future movie for my library a wonderful work of history
Aug 29 2023,positive,i liked the acting and the soundtrack the story was informative even if some of the material was fiction
Aug 29 2023,negative,did not like the loud background music that came on suddenly  the dialog was difficult to follow  the movie seemed to jump around  very disappointing  i did think that robert downey jrs performance was very good
Aug 29 2023,positive,a tour de force and a cautionary tale about hubris
Aug 29 2023,positive,the background music in the movie  was waaaay too loud theatre temperature was too cold
Aug 29 2023,negative,just awful it dragged on a guy three rows back fell asleep half way through it i kept wondering when it would get interesting but it never did just the old blacklist tripe very old and the einstein connection was weak and just not developed the whole film lacked heart and his moral crisis was muddy and pedantic a long three hours that would have been better told in 90 minutes not much action considering you had world war two as a backdrop but you never see any of that such a missed opportunity i am truly surprised but the score i talked to the other 15 people in the theater and all were bored
Aug 29 2023,negative,such an overrated bore  the storyline jumped all over the place making no sense  it was around 15 hours too long  i am certain this dud will win the oscar tho
Aug 29 2023,positive,loved the movie  but it was too long
Aug 29 2023,positive,i was so impressed with the research that gave the movie such great historical details
Aug 29 2023,positive,the movie was very timely in its treatment of possible nuclear warfare  i felt the actors did a marvelous job and truly looked the part of the original players they were portraying
Aug 29 2023,positive,excellent movie  great acting compelling story  brings up the lesser known part of oppenheimers life when he was accused of being a communist  3 hours went by quickly  highly recommend for both history buffs and those that arent
Aug 29 2023,positive,powerful beautifully acted murphy and downey jr especially provide award worthy performances and yet due to the almost forensic direction i felt slightly detached from proceedings in its post nuclear detonation political aftermath second act its never the less an important movie which is absolutely worth watching asks important philosophical questions but doesnt ram any answers down the viewers throat and deserves the critical love that it will doubtless receive due to it frankly being far superior to the vast majority of big budget movies being made today im looking at you barbie
Aug 29 2023,positive,anyone of a certain age needs to be aware that much of the dialogue borders on inaudible the director does not do sound retakes for stylistic reasons  also something to do with 70mm cameras being noisy an inaudible movie also lacks style i guess subtitles would have been an insult but they would have made the experience much more comfortable also wonder whether there was a need for a narrator or some such so we were clearer on things eg was that heisenberg as he flashes across the screen what was the timeframe for bohr getting to the us what are these committees doing who was strauss  felt as though you were expected to go with the flow rather than really track the detail but i may not be the best judge as explained  but good to see a proper movie as a change from all the juvenile fantasy stuff
Aug 29 2023,positive,good movie but complicated a little hard to follow with so many characters and lots of jumping around too long
Aug 29 2023,positive,great movie very powerful  it brought you into the drama of ww 2 and some of the huge decisions that had to be made
Aug 28 2023,positive,christopher nolans direction turned what could have been a dry and unimaginable production into an inspired film that was visually interesting and insightful into the life of one of americas most complicated historical figures i loved the juxtaposition of the different parts of oppenheimers life but how they all were connected  cillian murphy gave a stellar performance of the title character showing his slightly different shades in subtle ways the whole cast was terrific especially matt damon and robert downey jr who made what could have been a 2dimensional villain into a mess of contradicting feelings  tom conti gave a delightful portrayal of einstein who shared thematic words that summed up the film nicely  as well as gary oldmans trumans humorous but honest take on the president that dropped the bomb  five stars
Aug 28 2023,positive,didnt feel like a three hour historical docudrama
Aug 28 2023,positive,it  was way too long if you are not in tune with history it may be hard to follow best supporting actor robert downey jr best screen adaptation best costumes for oscar nods possibly  getting nominated cillian murphy for best actor and emily blunt for best actress
Aug 28 2023,positive,beautifully done mentally visually and experientially
Aug 28 2023,positive,i always wondered what the controversy story was about him
Aug 28 2023,positive,an otherwise flawless and riveting movie ruined by meaningless nudity there are 3 nude scenes in oppenheimer and only 1 of them serves any purpose other than cheap vulgarity it felt like watching a baker put ice cream scoops of cow manure on the most beautiful wedding cake youve ever seen    besides the above i loved it and it would easily be one of my favorite christopher nolan films
Aug 28 2023,negative,white men talking talking talking a dose of gratuitous sex i didnt like one character in the movie the actors were good but the movie was boring
Aug 28 2023,positive,a masterpiece  oppenheimer should be a shoein for best picture
Aug 28 2023,positive,it was a great movie a bit long i did fall asleep somewhere in the beginning towards the middle it did get boring and i was struggling to stay awake but it ended well good story and a very big piece of our history
Aug 28 2023,positive,great acting  great filming and editing    little slow at times
Aug 28 2023,positive,slow start but interesting history and plot twist
Aug 28 2023,positive,i think the movie was marketed more as the workings of the manhattan project but ended up being more about the political aftermath i saw a lot of people walk out in the 2nd hour the younger generation was expecting something else they needed to understand the politics at the time in order for it to make more sense  im rating it a 4 because i actually liked it as im a scientist and know the politics of it all i love long movies
Aug 28 2023,positive,although the movie was long  the story deserved the time  great acting and story
Aug 28 2023,positive,great movie flipping back and forth between interview and events was had to track
Aug 28 2023,positive,too long too much court drama should have cut sex scenes to be pg13
Aug 28 2023,positive,i enjoyed the movie  the acting was superb  the content was informative and interesting
Aug 28 2023,positive,enjoyed the entire movie the only scene which was hard to understand is when robert is being drilled by the farce committee and he is sitting there naked why and then having sex with his first wife at the same time  just plain weird
Aug 28 2023,positive,accurate and insightful history of dr oppenhiemer and how the movement used and abused him through corrupt politicians
Aug 28 2023,negative,i did not get to see the movie because the theater was closed due to a shooting and stabbing at bay street   do not go to amc bay street
Aug 28 2023,negative,very disappointing movie waste of a great opportunity to focus on scientific progress and sacrifice instead of some political hearings
Aug 28 2023,positive,i had a lot of trouble getting in to the movie  i was sort of lost from the beginning but the movie did pick up  it was interesting but i really didnt get caught up in it  a lot of it was boring
Aug 28 2023,positive,it was a good movie but very long and the sound was too loud my god nothing like blowing your eardrums to smitherians
Aug 28 2023,positive,powerful movie  superb cast  beautifully told
Aug 28 2023,positive,loved it kept your attention thru the entire 3 hrs
Aug 28 2023,negative,too long story not clear characters hard to identify dates and even years not understandable
Aug 28 2023,positive,excellent movie  academy award winning
Aug 28 2023,positive,visually stunning with exceptional performances by both the leading actors and the lesser characters
Aug 28 2023,positive,there was no intermission
Aug 28 2023,negative,movie was good the seats were terrible will not go to this theater again no leg room for people to get by i would like to get replacement tickets for myself and wife for another show
Aug 28 2023,positive,it was kind of boring at times it was hard to understand the actors with the music playing all the time sometimes i wasnt sure what year they were in it was an interesting story because i didnt know much about oppenheimer
Aug 28 2023,positive,movie was incredible a must see in 70mm imax format
Aug 28 2023,positive,i like the movie a lot it didnt feel like 3 hours went by
Aug 28 2023,positive,the movie was awesome and really told an incredible story of the making on of the atom bomb to end wwii  fascinating story on how sad a person can be railroaded
Aug 28 2023,positive,there should have been the means and ways to condense this story down to 25 hours alas even though it was too long at 3 hours it was great  it was enlightening to see the story about the production of the a bomb and the character of the times as the usa committed to this effort  also so glad to have a perspective shown of the efforts of the communist movement in those times  both communisim and socialism are horrible lies  and capitalism at its extreme is very deceptive  pray we find our country once again based upon the constitutional basis of equity and fairness across all human rights
Aug 28 2023,positive,a movie full of history it is abouth power and war this topic never goes wrong in creating a scenary  the distribution of the great names of actors makes the move more interesting go see it you will love it
Aug 28 2023,positive,loved the history disliked the sex and nudity because it did not do anything for the plot and could be eliminated without hurting the experience sexual content was ill placed without reason especially the scene at the table conducting oppenheimer renewal security clearance his sexual mind fantasy in this scene was a silly and confusing fantasy during a serious section of the plot lastly the 3 hour movie to show history was about 50 too long
Aug 28 2023,positive,cillian murphy is babygirl
Aug 28 2023,positive,movie good but definitely too long at least an hour could have been caught without disturbing content
Aug 28 2023,positive,interesting story and great performances if you can stay focused for 3 hours
Aug 28 2023,positive,amazing movie great photography is a movie that must be watched in a theater to fully experience all the director wants to transmit every actor is on point the dialog is great  thanks for a great movie experience
Aug 28 2023,positive,fantastic movie deserves awards presents the historical events while being interesting shows our humanity special effects are amazing
Aug 28 2023,positive,good story allstar cast and very interesting
Aug 28 2023,positive,i enjoyed the movie  i felt that it was more of a history lesson than entertainmentbut i am glad i went  the movie removed the veil of mystery regarding what happened during that period and to oppenheimer himself  it also gives us a glimpse into how scientists work together and at what levels
Aug 28 2023,positive,some of the dialogue was hard to hearunderstand but overall it was a great experience we were very impressed with robert downeys portrayal my wife and i were a little disappointed by the gratuitous nudity but it was better than many other current movies
Aug 28 2023,negative,wackamolee 1st off the ppl in the theater wouldnt stop talking throughout the beginning of the movie so i was lost from the start the only highlight was the star power associated to the film but other than that i was struggling to keep my eyes open i levy abt 1hr  20min in bc i was trying to give it a chance
Aug 28 2023,positive,it was good and interesting but i do think it was too long the acting was good though
Aug 28 2023,positive,a movie demonstrate life of a man who invented something changed human history a bit too much storytelling nice graphic for imax theater
Aug 28 2023,positive,one of the best moview of 2023
Aug 28 2023,positive,i loved the acting and cinematography but i was expecting more from this over rating movie i missed more action and we all waited for the big bang at the end it sounded like an audio book to me but still a great film non doubt about it
Aug 28 2023,positive,very very good platform
Aug 28 2023,positive,fascinating and terrifying  great cast superbly told story
Aug 28 2023,positive,great cast  movie was accurate and well done
Aug 28 2023,positive,the movie is phenomanel this sight shows the actors vs reality and what was factual and a few scenes that are conjecture    its 3 hours long and it seemed like minutes not hours i knew the bare bones about oppenheimer but this movie explores the exploration reality i hope it sweeps the oscars because it certainly deserves to win all the major categories
Aug 28 2023,negative,could not get into the movie  drugged out to long
Aug 28 2023,positive,great movie   a bit long but kept my interest the whole time
Aug 28 2023,positive,the beginning was weird and felt long but cool the last half pulled it all together and my wife and i loved it
Aug 28 2023,positive,great cast and excellent acting
Aug 28 2023,positive,very dramatic sometimes a bit overwhelming seemed that it could have been edited down a bit but overall excellent film
Aug 28 2023,positive,the last sentence if the movie
Aug 28 2023,positive,hreat movie very cool
Aug 28 2023,positive,it was an excellent movie from the beginning
Aug 28 2023,positive,very powerful storytelling great cast and acting should win some awards so engaging did not feel like a 3hr film  great cinematography
Aug 28 2023,positive,oppenheimer is a great movie that tells the complicated story about a complicated man who heroically grapples with extremely complicated issues  the cast is amazing  the 3 hours is flew by
Aug 28 2023,positive,at first i was lost until movie got into what happened  for a long movie i didnt mind sitting for 3 hours thought it was good
Aug 28 2023,positive,very well thought out story and movie  i had hoped it would focus a little on the technology development rather than the politics but i guess thats a different movie  this one did an outstanding job of detailing the struggles oppenheimer had during the post war years  something i didnt know much about  i choose a 70mm film imax venue hoping to see the best representation of the movie  i wouldnt necessarily recommend choosing this over a digital theater after viewing many scratches and defects in the film  see in in digital format
Aug 28 2023,positive,it was well paced  i was intrigued by the events and the real power of having your own voice
Aug 28 2023,positive,a very well done movie but you really have to pay attention to keep up
Aug 28 2023,positive,oppenheimer holds your interest from start to finish since the movie is based on oppenheimers biography it provides insight into the process and development of the atom bomb and also the aftermath after the bomb was deployed overall oppenheimer is an excellent firm with an excellent cast
Aug 28 2023,positive,i like the intensity of the characters
Aug 28 2023,positive,fantastically pleasing
Aug 28 2023,positive,too much nudity  was over the top  not necessary for the scene
Aug 28 2023,positive,it was a awesome movie just too long to sit on the theater
Aug 28 2023,positive,loved the movie oppenheimer it hit so many different levels for me and i would like to see it again
Aug 28 2023,positive,i thought it was a great movie star studded cast great plot line the way the story was laid out was done really well my boyfriend and i loved it
Aug 28 2023,negative,great actors good visuals and sound now the bad hard to follow all the flashbacks and dialogue we went on 4 tickets to imax not enough action if we had paid full admission wed been even more disappointed the sex scenes were few but awkward to watch in mixed company 3 hours that could have been spent better
Aug 28 2023,positive,one of the best movies in the past many years  no special effects no nonsense just pure great cinematography
Aug 28 2023,positive,thoroughly enjoyed the movie  historical and disturbing at the same time  did not like the soundtrack at all
Aug 28 2023,negative,awful might as well be called the mccarthy hearings as that seemed to be the most focus
Aug 28 2023,positive,the volume level at the theatre  too loud
Aug 28 2023,positive,the noise level was a bit heavy when seated in c3 and 4 otherwise seating was fine an important factor given that the movie was 3 hours duration   the movie was is very thought provoking the cinematographys inclusion of explosions used to convey different meanings connected to the story line the presentation of historical information tied to los alamos the manhattan project the in her workings of americas physicists community of the 1930s  1940s 1950s and the ties to world war ii europe is relevant as background  to todays geopolitics    susan parker
Aug 28 2023,neutral,exactly how the government work
Aug 28 2023,positive,theater was hot last hour of movie
Aug 28 2023,positive,terrific story great intheater experience dynamic wellpaced approach
Aug 28 2023,positive,with such a large cast of characters i thought the screenplay did a poor job of delineating characters which led to confusion for me
Aug 28 2023,positive,best movie i have ever seen 60 years young besides musicals yes i know two totally different categories
Aug 28 2023,positive,it is intense and the special effects and sound were amazing  acting spot on my dislike is it is very long a full 3hrs that doesnt include the previews
Aug 28 2023,positive,excellence movie  would strongly recommend
Aug 28 2023,neutral,too long and drawn out good movie idea though
Aug 28 2023,positive,this is a complex look at a complicated man but oppenheimer unequivocally establishes that this is a story worth telling
Aug 28 2023,positive,i think it is quite a good and interesting film
Aug 28 2023,positive,excellent acting and production
Aug 28 2023,positive,y √Æs a grate movienice and god to see
Aug 28 2023,positive,the storytelling acting makeup costumes were all masterful special effects and sound were mediocre
Aug 28 2023,positive,amazing story and a must see
Aug 28 2023,positive,it was interesting it actually caught my attention and i didnt fall asleep
Aug 28 2023,positive,one of the best movies ive ever seen
Aug 28 2023,positive,excellent movie even though it was a three hour movie it didnt seem so long
Aug 28 2023,positive,best movie ive seen in a long time kept me interested once it got going educational and great acting i recommend it to everyone 3 hours was perfect
Aug 28 2023,positive,so fresh absolute must see this movie
Aug 28 2023,positive,its a very beautiful and interesting film
Aug 28 2023,positive,according to the description it seems interesting
Aug 28 2023,positive,everything about christopher nolans latest movie is massive the level of shock and awe is breathtaking but it can also be taxing
Aug 28 2023,positive,liked movie historical basis  theater too cold 
Aug 28 2023,positive,liked everything about it 
Aug 28 2023,positive,my only criticism is how weirdly the communist lover character is depicted i have to think that a lot of footage was cut out  footage that would have explained why she is so important to the main character that he has an all out breakdown upon learning of her demise  all that is depicted to the audience is what appears to be not much more than a sexual affair so the lack of character development is noticeable i feel bad for the actress who spends most her screen time with breasts bared and is relegated to being a sidestory to explain oppenheimers accusation of being a russian spy in an otherwise brilliant film this shortcoming was kind of hard to ignore it was a major flaw for me  but if we take that away i would def say the film was great great casting the excellent performances almost eclipsed the abomb scenes which were fantastic starts out a little slow but pays off if you stick it out
Aug 28 2023,positive,great movie love the angle they presented the story
Aug 28 2023,positive,serious movie great acting of all characters well made story
Aug 28 2023,positive,seeing it in imax 70mm was truly worth it
Aug 28 2023,positive,it was a good movie in my opinion
Aug 28 2023,positive,great movie great all star cast
Aug 28 2023,positive,where tenet failed to rescue postpandemic cinema oppenheimer along with the very different eyewateringly successful barbie may well have succeeded christopher nolan has made a threehour film partly in black and white historical biopic that is mostly men in rooms talking that grapples with huge moral ethical and historical issues and turned it into one of the megahits of blockbuster season in the process hes rebooted the biopic genre one of cinemas most creatively moribund genres an achievement its hard to imagine any other filmmakers taking on     two often quoted issues with nolans work  a perceived emotional coldness and poorly served female characters   are worth touching on here emotionally this is devastating daringly empathetic towards such a divisive and complex central character the women are better written than in some nolan films the emotional cost to them of a driven hero complex man spelled out in ways that may be questionable but certainly asks for thoughtfulness     performances are remarkable downey junior layered cillian murphy magnetic and extraordinary the whole cast is playing in the big leagues here technically its a masterclass editing sound design cinematography and much else working in concert the almost omnipresent score is sensational the pivotal test explosion scene is staged unforgettably     all in all a remarkable extraordinary propulsive and utterly gripping film that will demand reward repeated viewings if its my favourite nolan im not sure  but i suspect not but its more than likely that history will judge it his best and most important achievement
Aug 28 2023,positive,the movie was an excellent biographical thriller film with a suprise twist at the end while not a documentary the film is considered to be surprisingly historically accurate in the portrayal of the main character
Aug 28 2023,positive,well acted very intriguing story
Aug 28 2023,positive,i loved this movie utilized facts and brought history to life
Aug 28 2023,negative,i dont think they needed the sex scenes on the movie seemed unnecessary and it was very boring i know ts based on history but it was hard to follow i almost fell asleep 
Aug 28 2023,positive,amazing film i thought it was everything and more you could want from a nolan directed biopic about the father of the atomic bomb oscar worthy acting throughout great cast great writing great director glad to see nolan still has it after the past few projects i think people who had more knowledge of the manhattan project and the history of those involved probably got more from the initial viewing than those without although i feel as if the film did enough to explain to not frustrate or confuse the less knowledgeable viewer such as myself i did find myself googling all the names and reading for the next few days though which i hope translatesd to others as well because this is a history that must be remembered in order to avoid the same mistakes i feel the film dragged a bit towards the end but i also understand and agree the length was necessary to tell the full and complete story highly recommend and i will definitely watch again
Aug 28 2023,positive,this movie is amazing the acting is extraordinary of course and the story is so insightful into history it is so interesting to learn about this story having not known much about it before seeing this movie the movie doesnt seem like it is three hours it goes by quick yet fit so much story into it the scenes look fantastic as well whether in color or black and white it has so much to offer so many scenes in this movie leave the audience wowed overall it is just a truly good movie
Aug 28 2023,positive,brilliant oscarworthy
Aug 28 2023,positive,absolute masterpiece by nolan  what a powerful film
Aug 28 2023,positive,very good movie  very informative and educational  love it 
Aug 28 2023,positive,my husband i enjoyed the history behind the movie the actors and actresses were good but they had too much swearing and the nudity pornography was not what we expected or wanted to watch  i am handicap so i would have been in people site trying to get out  other folks in the same movie made comments like i am doing now we did watch the trailer didnt see or hear anything like we saw tonight
Aug 28 2023,positive,steady and dramatic acting well done

Aug 28 2023,positive,this is an epic time commitment wear comfy clothes its emotional stunningly beautiful loud heart wrenching its an art film i loved it
Aug 28 2023,positive,3 hour long biopic that surprisingly maintains its pacing well throughout the entire run complimented with an incredible soundtrack this movie gives the haunting perspective of the most important man who ever lived be aware that this movie is dialogue heavy and is recommended to try your best to listen and understand what is being said some theaters have their audio fine tuned more than others so before choosing an imax 70mm showing of the film which you must see the movie in if you can make sure its a theater that people say is finely tuned good experiences ive had in terms of audio were at both regal irvine spectrum best and the regal edwards ontario palace second best i personally did not have a good experience understanding the audio at citywalk but maybe the audio there got tuned better later regardless go out and watch the movie
Aug 28 2023,positive,loved it a story that needed to be told
Aug 28 2023,positive,movie was good but i felt it was over stretched could have been shortened by 30 minutes this is definitely not the best from christopher nolans filmography i liked the visuals on imax screen and everyone in the movie have done a commendable job
Aug 28 2023,positive,pretty good history i wish they would have talked more about the traitorspy klaus fuchs and how he betrayed the technology to the soviets
Aug 28 2023,positive,this is a brilliant epic thriller written and directed by christopher nolan the same master creator who gave us inception dunkirk batman begins trilogy and memento to name a few this film boasts of an allstar cast headed by the brilliant cillian murphy as j robert oppenheimer emily blunt matt damon and robert downey jr  the supporting cast josh hartnett casey affleck rami malek kenneth branagh and florence pugh is as formidable as the lead both cillian murphy and robert downey jr should get an oscar best actor and best supporting actor nominations respectively for their superb performance  i think this is the best film so far for 2023
Aug 28 2023,positive,excellent development of characters events and emotions what a thought provoking movie
Aug 28 2023,positive,second time watching cant wait to buy
Aug 28 2023,negative,its disjointed  he uses similar sound design that he has used with previous movies  which i thought shouldnt have been used or was used too much  terrible character developmenti dont care about any of the characters or what happens to them  a friend says that he cant write women but personally i think he cant write relationships of any type friendshipsloveetc  there were a lot of people walking out of the movie to a quantity that ive never seen before  wish i could get those 3 hours back

Aug 28 2023,negative,what a mess the story was hard to follow and to know who was who what they did and why the sound track was unbearable overbearing and frankly insulting to the audience who should be able to tell whats going on without music to manipulate feelings the use of color and black and white was also inexplicable and distracting agreed its an important story but what a sloppy telling

Aug 28 2023,positive,was a little dry at first but thats because they lead you through the story from the onset as you continue to watch you get to see why it must be done and why oppenheimer understands what his idea means for the world many good actors and suspenseful government truths would love to see it again from the very beginning because i was held up in consessions

Aug 27 2023,positive,a fascinating story that is superbly woven through the movie with twists and turns and surprises an important part of our history in numerous ways  the music was incredible to the story i learned so much acting was excellent especially cillian murphy as oppenheimer through the joy tragedy and torment yes its long but honestly it didnt feel like 3 hours thought provoking to say the least

Aug 27 2023,positive,the movie was excellent very indepth of what happened i thought the acting was excellent
Aug 27 2023,positive,a historically accurate yet emotional retelling of the genesis of the manhattan project  brings the full history of the oppenheimer story to life without seeming like a documentary  too many great performances from an ensemble cast to mention them all
Aug 27 2023,positive,incredible movie that did well in exploring the complexity of dr j robert oppenheimers scientific discovery of the atomic bomb intertwined with the political interests nuances of war tragedy of hiroshima and nagasaki mccarthyism and oppenheimers humanity definitely worth the watch in theaters    great performances by all the actors florence pugh is a talented actress but her character was so poorly written    some subpar directing choices poor character development for secondary characters should have showed hiroshima  nagasaki to drive home visually the loss of life and the cost of war one dimensional female characters far removed from their historical counterparts jagged pacing    12 a star removed for the incredibly disrespectful historically inaccurate and gratuitous scene with the sacred indian text the bhagavadgita that in reality inspired j robert oppenheimer in a philosophical setting a foolish decision that one would think christopher nolan would be above  12 a star removed for objectifying scenes that contribute nothing to the movies plot have no grounding in history and are more of the same vulgarity that hollywood normalizes
Aug 27 2023,positive,excellent movie quite fascinating in the making of the bomb the intensity of the brilliant minds involved the dirty behind the scenes political intrigue

Aug 27 2023,positive,fantastic movie by christopher nolan really liked the story and the depth would love to watch this again i definitely recommend this movie
Aug 27 2023,neutral,im not sorry to have seen the film oppenheimer but i found it too long much too noisy and the tightly edited conversations were somewhat hard to understand or follow at some point i want to read american prometheus the book on which the film is based in order to discover what was left out of or written into the biography to turn it  into an onscreen thriller
Aug 27 2023,negative,the spundtrack was bloody awful music overpowering dialog is an idiotic move the story line was disjointed i understand the use of flashbacks  but this was merely confusing sorting out which characters were actually important was difficult     on the plus side the facts presented seemed reasonably consistent with what i know tobe real
Aug 27 2023,negative,a little long for a movie basically about his security clearance   neat story wouldnt recommend spending money at the movies to see it just wait till its on netflix

Aug 27 2023,positive,oppenheimer was the bomb  i give oppenheimer an a for the atomic style impact it will have on the selfinflicted human extinction just around the corner at least well go out with a bang
Aug 27 2023,positive,it was as riveting and exciting as any action movie even though we knew what was going to happen cillian murphy matt damon and robert foeney jr were amazing
Aug 27 2023,positive,loved the sound effects more than anything it was interesting to view the inside of a physicists mind  you truly have to be quite fascinating to create something like that overall it was a great movie
Aug 27 2023,positive,ive seen this movie 4 times
Aug 27 2023,positive,ive seen it three times and each time it gets better this is not a movie that you enjoy its a movie that will change your perspective on war and humanity

Aug 27 2023,positive,great acting and very well told story enjoyed it despite the length the time flew by
Aug 27 2023,positive,epic storytelling about the life of one of the most important men of the 20th century it compares with lawrence of arabia  schindlers list nolan is a master of cinematic techinique to tell his story his use of sound and subjective point of view is dazzling during the trinity test sequence you get caught in the suspence of whether the test will work that you forget your hisyory  every performance is a gem especially murphy emily blunt robert downey jr  damon  it is the best movie ive seen in years

Aug 27 2023,negative,i couldve spent these 3 hours staring at a wall and that wouldve been more productive
Aug 27 2023,positive,excellent storyline based on historygreat actors
Aug 27 2023,positive,the history the acting the settings
Aug 27 2023,positive,absorbing story excellent cast graphic depictions of sexual liaisons get a thumbs down
Aug 27 2023,positive,great movie  good balance on the struggle between the science its use and ethics  morality  sex scenes were unnecessary and gratuitous  some special effects were timeconsuming  unnecessary for a movie dealing with such powerful forces of human nature  still i would watch it again
Aug 27 2023,positive,the story and plot was well displayed and told
Aug 27 2023,negative,poor acoustics i had to work to follow it too long i dont think i will get that 3 hours back
Aug 27 2023,positive,its hard to put into words how perfect this movie is cillian murphy grips you from the first frame until that  last haunting shot the score cinematography costumes and supporting cast are all equally flawless
Aug 27 2023,positive,great movie but too long at 3hrs
Aug 27 2023,negative,way too long and too much unnecessary material included
Aug 27 2023,positive,definitely has a couple of slow moments but overall it was really good
Aug 27 2023,positive,excellent acting  revealing  maybe too much detail
Aug 27 2023,positive,great movie great story and incredible cast
Aug 27 2023,positive,so many characters involved in os career i need cliff notes to understand who all of them were
Aug 27 2023,positive,an hour too long too many characters to really keep track of and then added background music intensifying for increased dramatic suspense takes away from actual dialogue worth one watch but wont ever watch again
Aug 27 2023,positive,it was off the charts good i thought that when i watched it i would see ways to tighten up the run time but it needs every minute sooooooo good my anticipation was satisfied
Aug 27 2023,positive,interesting and informative history buffs will probably love this movie it was well acted
Aug 27 2023,positive,very intense movie and quick paced
Aug 27 2023,positive,it was a fantastic movie with great scenes and acting  i applaud the film producers for making this movie and telling us what really happened behind the scenes that nobody knew about  it was information that should have been shared years ago and let the people know just what the government was doing and how they destroyed people   very enjoyable movie even though it was three hours long  it kept me riveted to the movie and interested in the story and what was going to happen next  i loved this movie
Aug 27 2023,negative,the highlight of the movie is the brief appearance of florence pughs fantastic breasts  other than that is a long drawn out drama with time jumps and crappy video effect overlays that culminate in a anticlimactic ending i just hope that florence pugh was paid very well because without her this movie was barely toilet worthy
Aug 27 2023,positive,not that great  good acting and direction
Aug 27 2023,positive,fascinating take on history but beware of our government they were as corrupt then as they are now
Aug 27 2023,negative,boring informative some steamy scenes really great cinematography but mostly terribly boring
Aug 27 2023,positive,veey interesting history
Aug 27 2023,positive,amazing story amazing acting emotion music visuals pacing made me want to read a book had me scared had me thrilled gave chills of music amazing lines that can speak for anyone a meaning we need more like this cinema industry needs to make more movies lile this stop the marvel stop the heroes the scifi give the down to earth back
Aug 27 2023,positive,very good movie but 1520 minutes could have been cut
Aug 27 2023,positive,the acting is superb cillians performance was spot on however the way it played out limping towards the ending was disappointing
Aug 27 2023,positive,christopher nolan really knows how to direct and shoot a damn good movie
Aug 27 2023,positive,i enjoyed the story and the acting i disliked some of the dialogue wasnt clear the way the actors were speaking i couldnt understand what they said other than that i liked it very much
Aug 27 2023,positive,very well done  makes you want to vote out career politicians
Aug 27 2023,positive,it was really really wonderful  robert downey jr was unbelievable great story based upon real life   100 recommend
Aug 27 2023,positive,historical facts  conspiracy to take down oppenheimer
Aug 27 2023,positive,this is the best movie of the last 25 years
Aug 27 2023,positive,i think the movie was great  it was the first movie to force me to watch it two times in theatres one time in a local cinema and one time in imax  to be honest if you are intrested in science and scientists with interests in politics this movie is perfect for you but its not for general audience  the only con about the movie for me is that the general audience cant really understand this movie
Aug 27 2023,positive,went in only for cillian murphy left with a giant crush on josh hartnett amazing film would recommend as it gets you thinking and pondering at the end
Aug 27 2023,positive,nolans direction the stellar cast powerful acting mindbending visuals and complex story make for a phenomenal film about a critical figure and series of events that not only defined american history but world history
Aug 27 2023,positive,excellently written captivating and revealing not being a political or history buff i really enjoyed it and want to learn more
Aug 27 2023,positive,the story is compelling even when you already know how it will turn out  laying out the narrative from different time periods added to the understanding of the overall story  acting and casting were spot on  aspects of the story were so sad brought touring to mind in terms of how such a major contributor to a countrys success can be so poorly treated by that same country  a very good movie
Aug 27 2023,positive,crucial historical events shown through brilliant creative vision awesome
Aug 27 2023,positive,well done well filmed amazingly acted just a tad too long for our taste and likely could have shaved down on the oppenheimerstrauss stuff in the third act
Aug 27 2023,positive,good movie wasnt a fan of the editing
Aug 27 2023,positive,masterpiece from start to finish
Aug 27 2023,positive,although its veeeeryy long it sure is great lots of information and studies in it i went back home and immediately google the things i didnt getunderstand in the movie lol love the cast another great movies from christopher nolan
Aug 27 2023,negative,cmon i went to the movies for literally the first time in years because im a history buff and was excited by what sounded like an exciting original film not a remake sequel or super hero schlock im a christopher nolan and it had a great cast   butthe movie was bad boring too long trying way to hard to build drama with a blaring sound track to a crescendo of a couple washington hearings   ok he was a communist who maybeprobably didnt outright give secrets to the enemy but that was ambiguous     also the tendentious bs about him not technically be a card carrying member of the communist party and maybe it be better to give the ussr our nuclear secrets because their our ally lol not our nazi enemy the big bazinga spoiler alert that jfk voted against confirmation of the bad guy i guess was supposed to be the cherry on top but fell flat  sorry  not a good movie for real history buffs looking for a nuanced look at a true story or a riveting movie btw  a big group of young people walked out of the theater i saw it at
Aug 27 2023,positive,plays like a chain reaction bouncing between past and present actions and consequences this is a blistering piece of filmmaking thats only flaws are small shortcomings from its gargantuan ambition    elevated by cillian murphys exacting performance nolans biopic on the father of the atomic bomb is majestic and morally complex    the cinematography is magnificent no worries when you have hoyte van hoytema capturing the awesome power of a bomb while also showcasing the vulnerability and flaws of the humans that created it    ludwig g√∂ransson soundtrack is surreal it will make you on your toes    for me it will always be robert downey jr and cillian murphy performances that carried this movie everybody else was just ok    its not nolans best movie it will always be inception for me but its up there with the top a great cinematic experience that you dont want to miss especially in imax
Aug 27 2023,neutral,thumbs up for the technical aspects a very good soundtrack and good visuals and for the actings  nevertheless for me there was many downsides in watching this movie    the nolanesque use of flashbackflashfoward in this film is overused and adds nothing to the story i found it rather confusing and messed up and usually i enjoy convoluted stories    i think many aspects are treated in a rather superficial way you never really get insight on the motives of why the main character does what he do the psychological consequences lies inexplorated zero scientificaltechnical explanation was this a science movie i had to find a 10 min youtube video to have more insights on the functioning bomb and understand the importance of the implosion tests    characters that you see 30 secs or that do not appear for like 1 hour and returns out of nowhere with crucial story developement    the entire third act was to me useless and not interesting so much that i wanted to leave    this may be all subjective but i really expected a whole different movie at the end of the movie i left the cinema bored and annoyed
Aug 27 2023,positive,a powerful and dense presentation about the life of the father of the atomic bomb which covers every important aspect of his his work giving you a very raw image of who he truly was among other things through cillian murphys outstanding performance
Aug 27 2023,positive,it was an incredible atmosphere i felt how oppenheimer made some decisions in his life the movie gave me that cillian certainly gave an oscarworthy performance
Aug 27 2023,positive,though i found the movie to be somewhat heavy and definitely too long i cant deny that it is a great piece of cinema from the acting to the amazing score everything was curated carefully and it shows
Aug 27 2023,positive,amazing movie if you love history and drama
Aug 27 2023,positive,confused direction and screenplay mar the overlong film  tighter screenplay resulting in shorter running time than 3hrs would have resulted at least 10 of the audience i was with walked out but the performance were fine especially robert downey jr who looks certain to be an oscar nominee for best supporting actor if not the winner ditto emily bunt in an underwritten role but dont blame her shes great
Aug 27 2023,positive,best biopic since finchers the social network nolan is one of the best directors of alltime and he really dropped a phenomenal historical drama with oscar worthy performances from cillian murphy rdj  emily blunt
Aug 27 2023,positive,imax is the only way to watch this amazing film
Aug 27 2023,positive,from the beginning til the end it was a great movie with amazing storytelling i saw it in the imax 70mm which only magnified the brilliance but i know for sure even in a normal theater i would of enjoyed it just as much because of the story the character casting was spot on and i really dont have enough good things to say about the movie it didnt even feel like a 3 hour movie best movie ive seen in years  
Aug 27 2023,negative,the acting is great but it was hard to understand the dialogue
Aug 27 2023,positive,i enjoy watching the movie
Aug 27 2023,positive,truly one of the best movies i have ever watched in my entire life
Aug 27 2023,positive,a film with incredible visuals bombastic sound deeply interesting character moments by a star studded cast a few phenomenal sequences all while accompanied by a powerful score    however its story beats are not as interesting as it couldve been with dialogue that rushes and a lot of telling instead of showing in the third act the movie shines in moments of introspection and trauma with the titular character but the plots focus takes away from what could be a stellar and more interesting film    theres a masterpiece movie in here somewhere but it did not hit the notes story wise to leave a more profound impact that being said it is a well crafted film that moves you in certain moments just wish we got more of that and a deeper look into the philosophical side of this haunting moment of history
Aug 27 2023,positive,brilliant production excellent acting full of facts great sets and special effects
Aug 27 2023,positive,i liked the acting but the movie was far too long
Aug 27 2023,positive,heavy movie but good
Aug 27 2023,positive,basically a good movie could have been shortened by about 3040 minutes  the second part after the test at los alamos was far better than the firsts  not sure it was worth the hype
Aug 27 2023,positive,a little too much time spent on trail and a little too long
Aug 27 2023,positive,thought it was amazing in certain parts great story great actinga little longer than optimal in a few scenes and a bit confusing at times
Aug 27 2023,positive,easy to follow very personal
Aug 27 2023,positive,great movie it was entertains and educational it could have been a little shorter though
Aug 27 2023,positive,interesting story movie was a little lomh
Aug 27 2023,neutral,beautifully filmed movie  strong performances wellcast pacingsound mixing all wrong scenes too truncated edited for expository value  like a 3 hour film trailer  after 45 minutes im waiting for the story to settle in and it never does  yeesh  material is fascinating and deserves to be treated as such not forcefed to the audience
Aug 27 2023,positive,fascinating historical movie with great visuals
Aug 27 2023,positive,great acting and directing  compelling story  we are going to purchase it for our library when it becomes available  one of the great stories of our lifetime
Aug 26 2023,positive,the film is not perfectly true to history but appears perfectly tuned to the spirit of the times both good and bad  having done physics for over half a century i cannot subscribe to the images artistically put in oppys head as a student but the linkage of math and music rings true  the nonlinear telling of the story is rarely confusing and nicely chosen and there are lots of physics community easter eggs to be spotted
Aug 26 2023,positive,great acting and cinematography
Aug 26 2023,positive,the captivating masterpiece oppenheimer deserves every star this film is a genuine masterpiece that takes its viewers on an intellectually stimulating emotionally gripping and visually mesmerising journey through the life of one of historys most enigmatic figures
Aug 26 2023,positive,enlightening history
Aug 26 2023,positive,visually stunning  superb acting and great storytelling  kudos to cillan murphy and robert downey jr and the entire cast the best christopher nolan movie yet i see oscars  oscars and more oscars
Aug 26 2023,positive,great cast well done story
Aug 26 2023,positive,too much time spent watching opps dreams  too many flash bcks  the film is about one hour too long
Aug 26 2023,positive,wow superb acting visually stunning  with wonderful sound mixing
Aug 26 2023,positive,amazing academy award for best picture best actor
Aug 26 2023,positive,a riveting film building a man who has changed the world as we knew it  his story of academics and original thoughts builds the beginning followed by his leadership challenges bring the bomb to the world  man has never been in the position of being able to destroy all life on earth or the planet itself
Aug 26 2023,positive,outstanding  very exciting and true to history
Aug 26 2023,positive,confusing at first but i caught up and feel like i have a better understanding of oppenheimer and the decision to drop the bomb still waiting for the book but apparently it he movie follows the book pretty closely which is refreshing the nudity  was needed in my opinion to portray lust vs love and exposure of oneself for all to see only complaint is that i felt they glossed over the effort at the trinity site a bit
Aug 26 2023,positive,excellent movie story was easy to follow did not seem like three hours
Aug 26 2023,positive,didnt really love up to the hype and couldnt been cut some but overall worth seeing
Aug 26 2023,positive,its a powerful movie i dont usually like nonlinear timelines but this worked really well for history that we probably think we know i learned a lot and it was very suspenseful
Aug 26 2023,positive,while not perfect this is an extraordinary movie about an extraordinary chapter in american history the acting is amazing especially cillian murphy and robert downey jr forget about the lengthits not important whats important is the story
Aug 26 2023,positive,amazing film start to finish academy nominations are well deserved saw in imax and didnt want to miss anything   highly recommend
Aug 26 2023,positive,very interesting 
Aug 26 2023,positive,ive seen oppenheimer three times but today on imax for the first time it felt completely new this needs to play exclusively on imax for at or until dune part two arrives  whenever
Aug 26 2023,positive,it was a great movie
Aug 26 2023,positive,tad difficult to follow at times with flashback and explosions  however the main story of the film was really interesting  would recommend  for anyone interested  in this area of history
Aug 26 2023,positive,good movie but it couldve been shorter
Aug 26 2023,positive,great acting and fabulous editing  therell be tons of oscar noms for this one
Aug 26 2023,positive,a necessity for every thinking adult who needs to understand our history
Aug 26 2023,negative,bad acting cheap makeup to make actors age interesting story
Aug 26 2023,positive,i really liked this movie it has amazing visuals and music i failed to understand some of the dialogue in the first half of the movie once i caught up i really enjoyed it it doesnt feel like a 3hour movie
Aug 26 2023,positive,this movie is a masterpiecei like movies who are inspired from realitydeserve an oscar for shore
Aug 26 2023,positive,i thought i had walked into the wrong theater and was watching a trailer for this movie at first the editing and pacing on the first hour or so is inexplicable to me breakneck introduction of characters rapid scenes many of which simply unnecessary its just a mess there are some truly standout visual scenes and some historical insights that make it worth watching but i genuinely considered walking out within that first hour it was exhausting and not enjoyable beyond the lead  cillian murphy absolutely saves this movie and costars florence pugh blunt and downey jr deliver really solid performances that somehow leave a mark in this shattered film   barely any character is sufficiently developed to form any real attachment no relationship is fleshed out enough to matter the focus of the film on this specific bureaucratic event was in my opinion a mistake overall it is absolutely not worthy of the ratings on this page of that i have no doubt
Aug 26 2023,positive,well written left movie much wiser about that era
Aug 26 2023,positive,acting was superb struggled to catch the dialogue especially with the varied accents  would love to see subtitles then you would fill those front row seats
Aug 26 2023,positive,its amazing and beautiful movie
Aug 26 2023,positive,best film see this is very beautifull  
Aug 26 2023,positive,the movie was a bit hard to follow jumping from past to present in the movie music was captivating keep us captivated
Aug 26 2023,positive,i fully recommend was awesome
Aug 26 2023,positive,good and interesting
Aug 26 2023,positive,movie was long sex scenes were unnecessary for the story being told the story line bounced around a lot and at times it was confusing which timeline was represented on the screen     acting was good sound effects were good at times surprising    this would have better watched at home to allow for breaks and ffreverse
Aug 26 2023,positive,i liked this movie must see
Aug 26 2023,positive,beautiful its verry funny
Aug 26 2023,positive,this film is an absolute gem the visuals are breathtaking and the story is deeply moving i was completely captivated from start to finish i cant recommend it enough 
Aug 26 2023,positive,a cool history movie with action and everything take me all the attention
Aug 26 2023,positive,very interesting 
Aug 26 2023,positive,you must see this movie one of the most interesting 
Aug 26 2023,positive,super tare recomand
Aug 26 2023,positive,it was great for someone who loves history id say yes its worth watching
Aug 26 2023,positive,it is a very good and very captivating film i recommend
Aug 26 2023,positive,if you live anywhere near san francisco or los angeles see it in the only two real actual imax screens on the west coast amc metreon in sf or universal city amc in los angeles these imax shots look breathtaking on a 100 x 80 ft screen with extraordinary sound love the film itself it might be the first christopher nolan film that i understood at least 95 of the story on the first viewing also its the first christopher nolan film where i could actually hear over 90 of the dialogue go figure
Aug 26 2023,negative,to sum it up oppenheimer is just tryhardy for the normal viewer it fails to communicate a point through the fog of surface level philosophical debates that are trying their best to seem deep it strips away all aestheticism leaving an hour of a well done biography and two hours of panache that you will undoubtably hear repeated as a masterpiece by various filmbros and the 96th academy awards
Aug 26 2023,negative,would have been 3 hours of my life i could never get back but we left early so we saved a few minutes of my life the last 2 hours dragged on and on and on and on and on oh you get the picture im sure
Aug 26 2023,positive,oppenheimer is a wonderful movie that has the most grammys a cast has ever seencillian murphy is a wonderful leading actor and has a wonderful crew starring robert downey jremily blunt and even more overall its the greatest made movie ive seen in cinema imax with oppenheimer is quite literally seat rattling so its definitely keeps you awake a 3 hour runtime makes up for great pacing and wonderful writing overall if you have not seen this movie i suggest you watch it immediately before it is out of theatres because in imax this movie is at its max
Aug 26 2023,positive,a work of art right when you believe the movie gets a little too long they pull you in came in the movie theatre bored and came out amazed a must see
Aug 26 2023,positive,the first 12 of the movie was really confusing last half with matt damon was much better robert disneys makeup eas really good
Aug 26 2023,positive,easily the best film of the year
Aug 26 2023,negative,very boring the trailer looked different we thought it was going to have some action we left before it was over not the theaters fault was disappointed and wasted money didnt need to spend but needed to get my mind on something else than my divorce
Aug 26 2023,negative,bad movie im surprised this was done by christopher nolan his movies are usually incredible it seems like people want to say its a great movie because they may want to seem sophisticated or because the historic event was meaningful to the world but this was not done well awesome cast though but that cant be the determining factor for a good movie every scene was 5 minutes too long with no added value there were various cheap thrills with loud noises for no reason overall it was slow and never built up i highly recommend not watching this movie 
Aug 26 2023,positive,oppenheimer is an excellent movie from cast actorss performance cinematography and direction point of viewhoweverthe  story  is flawed on  certain aspects investigation and senate committee proceedings have unnecessarily been shown too longaftereffects of atomic bombs on innocent common public of japanese cities of hiroshima  nagasaki have not been shown to the  extent neededin fact this should have been the  climax of the film rather than trinity testmoreover it missed famous historical words of albert einstein after usa had dropped the atomic bombs 
Aug 26 2023,positive,dialogue was unclear because music was too loud
Aug 26 2023,positive,fast paced thrilling story telling
Aug 26 2023,positive,first hour and 15 minutes could have been deleted  last part was good
Aug 26 2023,positive,great movie it will definitely go to the oscars
Aug 26 2023,positive,great historical movie based on real life
Aug 26 2023,positive,very humbling experience he understood the ramifications of the eork he did
Aug 26 2023,positive,amazing movie with awesome acting
Aug 26 2023,positive,acting awesome by evertyone
Aug 26 2023,positive,a wonderful film with great direction to keep my interest for 3 hours the crosscutting from blackandwhite to color past to present was terrific the actors could not have been better the only problem was the music  it was atrocious loud bombastic sometimes obscuring the dialog and mostly unnecessary even though i lived through much of the period depicted in the film and been to los alamos i learned a lot from the film
Aug 26 2023,positive,excellent portrayals and unsentimental probing look into the career of the father of the bomb   murphy id brilliant as oppenheimer robert downey jr is amazing as admiral strauss his nemesis everyone is great plus small triumphs like tom conti as einstein matt damon as gen groves    its great in 70mm imax but the story is intimate enough to be equally compelling in 70 mm without imax in fact if you only see it once youll understand the dialogue better in the non imax format ive seen it twice in each format metreon 70mm imax and kabuki 70 mm sans imax    that said seeing a movie like this on a three story screen with rip roaring sound is immersive this film is well written acted and edited to be an a film no matter how you watch it    run dont walk see it on a screen with an audience
Aug 26 2023,positive,the nudity was unnecessary and gratuitous especially the scene in the room when oppenheimer was being questioned many scenes made it look like oppenheimer was mentally disturbed more facts and less hollywood would have been better
Aug 26 2023,positive, un film definitivo colossale e inimmaginabile per me √® tranquillamente considerabile film dellanno e forse anche degli ultimi anni christopher nolan √® riuscito a trasformare una storia vera che coinvolge tutta lumanit√† in un qualcosa di mai visto prima oppenheimer √® pi√π di un semplice colossal come definito da molti riesce a far capire che quello che viene mostrato nella pellicola va a coinvolgere tutta lessenza del nostro pianeta poich√© non narra solamente la storia di j robert oppenheimer ma va a ridefinire tutti i canoni dellumanit√† facendoci aprire gli occhi su una tematica che spesso e volentieri consideriamo distante ma che √® in realt√† √® molto pi√π atroce e vicina di quanto pensiamo il film comunque parla di oppenheimer noto fisico considerato il padre della bomba atomica e lo fa splendidamente √® fuori da ogni logica il tocco di nolan nel riuscire a trasformare una storia vera in un thriller epocale letteralmente pura arte sullo schermo √® quasi impossibile fare paragoni su altre pellicole dellautore in quanto oppenheimer va ad affrontare tematiche diverse ma senza dubbio √® lopera pi√π completa che il famoso regista abbia mai prodotto e diretto gli attori sono fantastici e ovviamente non potava essere altrimenti quando vengono tirati in ballo nomi del calibro di cillian murphy florence pugh rami malek matt damon e robert downey jr ovvio il ruolo da protagonista di murphy rende la sua performance veramente incredibile e credo debba essere considerata in vista dei prossimi oscar questo ovviamente non va a sminuire le performance degli altri attori poich√© siamo su livelli molto buoni la colonna sonora √® perfetta veramente coinvolgente e talvolta incredibile si sentono tantissimo delle melodie che trasudano maestosit√† da tutte le note ovviamente questo √® un film che va obbligatoriamente visto al cinema e sul miglior schermo possibile personalmente lho visto in imax e senza ombra di dubbio √® stata la miglior esperienza cinematografica che abbia mai fatto un qualcosa di indescrivibile che va provato il posto che inizia a tremare lo schermo sfruttato alla massima qualit√† e un audio spaziale hanno reso lesperienza indimenticabile avevo gi√† assistito a film in sala imax ma devo dire che qui siamo su livelli enormi di differenza e perfezione oppenheimer √® un film che punta alla perfezione e ci riesce perch√© effettivamente questo √® un film perfetto che azzecca tutti gli aspetti cinematografici con anche qualche tocco di nolan che va ad arricchire la visione della pellicola veramente un film mostruoso che supera di gran lunga gli ultimi del regista e ci√≤ prima della visione per me era veramente impensabile creare un qualcosa di cos√¨ bello e contemporaneamente affine alla realt√† sembrava unimpresa ma √® stato veramente un gran viaggio le tre ore non si sono fatte sentire e ci sono delle trovate verso il finale veramente iconiche che resteranno stampate nella mente delle persone veramente ed enormemente consigliato un qualcosa di mai visto prima grazie nolan cinema allo stato puro a definitive colossal and unimaginable film for me it is quietly considered film of the year and perhaps even of recent years christopher nolan has managed to turn a true story that involves all of humanity into something never seen before oppenheimer is more than just a colossal as defined by many he manages to make it clear that what is shown in the film involves the whole essence of our planet as it does not only tell the story of j robert oppenheimer but goes to redefine all the canons of humanity by making us open our eyes to a theme that we often and willingly consider distant but which is in reality much more atrocious and closer than we think the film however is about oppenheimer a wellknown physicist considered the father of the atomic bomb and does so beautifully its out of all logic nolans touch in being able to turn a true story into an epochal thriller literally pure art on screen it is almost impossible to make comparisons on other films by the author as oppenheimer goes to deal with different themes but without a doubt it is the most complete work that the famous director has ever produced and directed the actors are great and of course it couldnt be otherwise when the likes of cillian murphy florence pugh rami malek matt damon and robert downey jr are brought up obviously murphys starring role makes his performance really incredible and i think it should be considered in view of the upcoming oscars this obviously does not detract from the performances of the other actors as we are on very good levels the soundtrack is perfect truly engaging and sometimes incredible you can hear a lot of melodies that exude majesty from all the notes obviously this is a film that must be seen at the cinema and on the best possible screen i personally saw it in imax and without a shadow of a doubt it was the best cinematic experience i have ever had something indescribable that must be tried the place that starts to shake the screen tapped to the highest quality and a spatial audio made the experience unforgettable i had already seen movies in the imax room but i must say that here we are on huge levels of difference and perfection oppenheimer is a film that aims for perfection and succeeds because actually this is a perfect film that gets all cinematic aspects right with even a few touches of nolan that enriches the vision of the film truly a monstrous film that far surpasses the last of the director and this before viewing was really unthinkable for me creating something so beautiful and at the same time akin to reality seemed like a feat but it was really a great journey the three hours were not heard and there are some truly iconic ending finds that will remain imprinted in peoples minds really and enormously recommended something never seen before thank you nolan pure cinema
Aug 26 2023,positive,i would give this movie one hundred stars brilliant and human  the script is tight and the acting is superb  this is an old style classic
Aug 25 2023,neutral,there are some good scenes and dialogues but nolan is always so pedantic that the movie lose his strenght it doesnt  help that the music is omnipresent its exhausting and it turns into noise this film would be much better if it was 2 hours long
Aug 25 2023,positive,i think the acting was terrific and it was an important story  however three hours was a bit too much  also although the first half was supplying background to the actual dropping of the bomb i believe the second half oppenheimers fall from grace was more interesting and engaging
Aug 25 2023,positive,i read the book before i saw the movie  usually the movie does not do the book justice but in this case i wa mesmerized by the dialog ans special effects  it was phenomenal
Aug 25 2023,positive,i liked it because its an important historical movie to see the only thing that i wish werent in it were the sexually explicit scenes young people need to see this movie for the historical value but i cant take them because of the sex scenes
Aug 25 2023,positive,this director never disappoints is my favourite since batman begins  he can grab me for 3 hours in cinema watching a movie about oppenheimer dont get me wrong i love movies but it is a dialogue movie and still i enjoyed every second of it because nolan is a genius writer and director he knows how to tell a story and the editing in this movie is amazing the sound the image and in imax is just stunning go see it the movie is a masterpiece best director of the 21 century
Aug 25 2023,positive,historic  revealed political strategies not for the good  scientists are not all black and white have feelings  scarey to think of our future
Aug 25 2023,positive,one of the best movies i have ever seen all 3 hours are more then worth it
Aug 25 2023,positive,historically accurate terrific performances by so many actors a must see
Aug 25 2023,positive,great story development fantastic music even though it was 3h long it went by fast overall excellent movie
Aug 25 2023,positive,another masterpiece from christopher nolan
Aug 25 2023,positive,could have trimmed about 30 mins
Aug 25 2023,positive,impeccabile a movie worth seeing in the big screen a must see
Aug 25 2023,positive,while oppenheimer wasnt necessarily a bad movie i did find that its editing made it incredibly difficult to follow for the first 2225 hours of the movie almost every scene was almost completely disconnected from the previous scene it felt more like a 2 hour trailer than a coherent movie     oppenheimer would have been amazing as a 2 part movie where each part could have been given the time needed to go into the details necessary to not only appreciate the man but also tell a coherent story    overall if you want to go to the movies to escape and dont feel like watching barbie oppenheimer is a good choice however i dont think its worth going out of your way just to watch it in theaters
Aug 25 2023,positive,long and boring storyline  hard to follow with it jumping back and forth in 8 second scenes
Aug 25 2023,positive,great and interesting movie
Aug 25 2023,positive,i absolutely loved the acting the cinematography the actors and the storyline
Aug 25 2023,positive,all around one of the best movies of the year  probably will win multiple academy awards
Aug 25 2023,positive,oh myif you havent seen oppenheimer in 70mm imax do it it will blow your mind no pun intended lol everything was superb from the writing to the acting to the cinematography to the sound  the whole artistry of it all the story is timeless because as uncle ben says with great power comes great responsibility the evolution of science will always give mankind the choice to rise above or to destroy itself this moment and this man and his team of geniuses dreamed the impossible possibleand destruction followed beautifully told but so tragic  it will win allllll the awards i literally forgot i was watching some of the actors because they played their characters so well it was insanely good and lives up to seeing it on the biggest screen you can see it on it gets all the stars 
Aug 25 2023,positive,great acting wonderful sound and cinema a bit long
Aug 25 2023,positive,solid and dense historicalpolitical film rigorous and introspective biopic based on the paradoxical story of the father of the atomic bomb who in an attempt to save the future of mankind collaborates in the invention of an instrument capable of destroying it forever realizing that she had failed just as he had completed the greatest project   based on the detailed biography of kai bird and martin j sherwin american prometheus the triumph and tragedy  pulitzer prize in 2006 nolan breaks all linearity of action and weaves together three horizontal timelines science power redemption and two vertical blocks divided by the bomb as the revelation of a new world order and focuses on the complex elusive and ambiguous figure of the protagonist brilliant scholar willing to do anything for science but also a soul torn by moral dilemmas ambitious but also vain and selfish who never denied what he did and the reasons why he did it but also a torn and restless man faced with his responsibility and left alone in the face of the chaos of history and the conflict of men   fascinating and refined on a formal and narrative level the film reflects clearly precisely and lucidly on the ambiguous relationship between science ethics and power and the manipulation of information the elegant and wellfinished style as usual goes well here even more than previously with the complexity and humanist scope of the subject matter   the detailed and layered density of the matter narrated by the film guarantees the viewers emotional adherence he is magnetically overwhelmed by immersive images and dialogues many by suspended and at times lyrical or dreamlike atmospheres tense music and rhythm in addition to the direction and the actors scenography photography editing and soundtrack are also of excellent quality   not everything is perfect see some imbalances but it is an effective and very successful film in nolans career robert oppenheimer played by a convincing cillian murphy but also the rest of the cast  including emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh  is very functional becomes increasingly black and white consumed by remorse and in search of redemption now i have become death the destroyer of worlds and closing my eyes yes and urgently questions us about our present physicists have known sin and from this awareness they will never be able to free themselves    the screenplay very interested in the intimate analysis of the characters emphasizes the inevitability of the historical fact the invention of the first atomic bomb as part of the manhattan project in order to end the second world war without however deny that it has forever changed the balance of the world and even the moral reputation of the united states after the success of the trinity test president harry s truman orders the use of the atomic bomb forcing japan to surrender   in the first part the film looks like a visual symphony decisive in this sense the use of special effects especially analogue and the use of 70mm imax film especially in the image of the process of disarticulation of matter into pure electromagnetic radiation and particles of light    in the second one instead it becomes more gloomy and tormented just like the soul and conscience of the protagonist when he pronounces himself against further nuclear research in particular on the hydrogen bomb proposed by teller and is accused of acquaintances with the american communist party and it is where lewis strauss played by robert downey jr president of the atomic energy commission of the united states involved in the investigation into his relations with oppenheimer and alleged manipulation of information for mere personal ends also appears   oppenheimer long celebrated as the inventor of the atomic bomb passes to being crushed and marginalizedabandoned by power by the family by relationships with the rest of the scientific community the period before and after the explosion of the two atomic bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki thus converge in a single moment that of awareness of the weight of ones responsibilities the circle closes or remains open the initial gaze that went beyond matter now goes beyond time and still seems to observe the unimaginable still presenting us in a disturbing way especially today the invitation to perennial reflection about what happened and the nuclear deterrent you have potentially and dangerously synonymous with mere destruction and general death   as also stated by paul schrader nolans latest rich and powerful work is the most interesting important and urgent film for the 21st century absolutely not to be missed and especially to be seen at the cinema   a curiosity oppenheimer as a film set during the second world war is the one to have grossed the most in the history of cinema    score in tenths 875
Aug 25 2023,positive,a movie made that must be seen in 70mm format as envisioned by christopher nolan himself  though much of the movie is tight and intimate experiencing this movie on the bigest screen is a metaphor for our times itself  the physical expanses of new mexico vistas moreso in the 1930s and 40s are brought to life in 70mm  white sands remains as vast to the eye to this day  figuratively in the embryonic embrace of an expanding theory  prediction of a physics proving  coming to light even now unleashed in unfolding story of the nuclear age
Aug 25 2023,positive, what do you want from theory alonezero would be nice    oppenheimer is a cinematic experience woven by the skilled hands of christopher nolan rooted in profound theoretical explorations it delivers a narrative thats simultaneously surreal and thoughtprovoking the performances of cillian murphy and jack lowden are nothing short of oscarworthy injecting life and depth into their characters that lingers long after the credits roll    ludwig goranssons score is more than just music its an immersive experience that seeps into your bones sending shivers down your spine the sound design equally robust adds an almost tactile layer to the viewing experience enhancing the films emotional resonance    despite its substantial threehour runtime oppenheimer never drags nolans expert pacing combined with the movies spacious visual layout ensures that every minute feels purposeful making the journey through this cinematic voyage a smooth and engaging one    the script carries shades of jfks intrigue and the social networks sharpness resulting in a unique blend that propels the story forward with a magnetic force the fusion of historical backdrop and fictional narrative creates a spellbinding tapestry that captivates and challenges in equal measure    in sum oppenheimer stands as not only one of the best films of the year but a defining work of the 21st century nolans directorial finesse murphy and downings performances goranssons auditory magic and the engaging script all contribute to a cinematic experience that resonates deeply this film isnt just about theory its about the convergence of art storytelling and human understanding    
Aug 25 2023,positive,loved the acting cinematography and historical representations  didnt love the jumping around with flashbacks but understand they had to do that with a 3hr movie loved the bedford playhouse for its size
Aug 25 2023,positive,powerful technically great allaround very wellmade with an excellent cast especially cillian murphy robert downey jr emily blunt and matt damon and in instant need of a rewatch as expected from nolan but what wasnt so expected is that it moves at breakneck speed for three hours as if it were an actioner yet the action is the dialogues the backandforth plot the science and the philosophical and ethical conundrums had it had a stronger emotional core it wouldve been truly great
Aug 25 2023,positive,good morning  very awesome
Aug 25 2023,positive,recomand din inima  
Aug 25 2023,positive,amazing movie and cool
Aug 25 2023,positive,awsome the best and safe
Aug 25 2023,negative,my god three hours of torture flashbacks flashforwards flashforwards inside flashbacks slow and sluggish     they should have just done a lets beat the germans with this bomb movie and skipped all the other stuff     fine if youre suuuuuper into history its not fine if you want to be entertained with a linear storyline that makes sense
Aug 25 2023,positive,amazing movie recomanded
Aug 25 2023,positive,it is the best movie ever seen
Aug 25 2023,positive,very interesting storyfull of mister and great graphics
Aug 25 2023,positive,next level cinematography and storytelling
Aug 25 2023,positive,great movie the only reason i didnt give it a full 5 stars is because it felt like it was 30 minutes too long
Aug 25 2023,positive,intelligent acting and well made script good and tense accurate in the way oppenheimer was harshly treated after he had made the bomb it held no punches as to his lot in life as someone with communist friends and the like in the cold war era good show
Aug 25 2023,positive,great photography as in all nolan movies top performance of all actorslittle bit  confusing narrative lot of over drama on some moments along with loud sound  effects the story can be trimmed to hour less music background already seen in  interstellar but now without memorable effectfinally as other nolan movies you  can learn and understand better with every new watchlooking forward for it
Aug 25 2023,positive,incredibile movie and astonishing performance by cillian murphy the duration of 3 hours just felt like 30 minutes
Aug 25 2023,positive,it plays very much to a 21st century audience with superfluous sex unnecessary starbursts and big bangs it is too long to hold ones attention yet too short to tell the story effectively i am so pleased that we recently watched the 80s bbc production with sam waterston as a much more believable oppenheimer this series depicted the complexity of the world situation and the dilemmas facing scientists very convincingly watch it on iplayer
Aug 25 2023,positive,i am waiting for the release of the movie for few months an unbelievable experience
Aug 25 2023,positive,another gem from christopher nolan the dialogue was very good the actors phenomenal the visuals astounding the meaning of certain scenes and of the entire movie as a whole hit real hard and the music score contributes a lot the story may seem boring to some ppl but for me it was not only about a tormented man who wanted to be judged for his actions but a clear warning against the so called chain reaction that would destroy the world wich would be the use of nucelear weapons in todays age
Aug 25 2023,positive,fantastic movie worth watching in imax
Aug 25 2023,positive,gripping story but all the interspersed razzledazzle pyrotechnics were annoying and distracting
Aug 25 2023,positive,simply amazing movie  well done all around including great cast  i expect many oscars won
Aug 25 2023,positive,not really awesome but better than meh worth seeing  i rely on the wikipedia assessment of moderate historical accuracy for a hollywood film  the early part of the movie was weak and confusing but the narrative gained strength as it continued  the r rating is deserved but unfortunate  literally a couple minutes of nudity and simulated sex that were not needed to tell the story makes the movie unaccessible in theater to mature teenagers who should have the opportunity to see it  does a good job of making clear how many people at least academics supported leftistcommunist party views in the 1930s yet some of them were essential to the manhattan project  also does a good job of showing how views on nuclear weapons were never simple for the people giving it serious thought
Aug 25 2023,positive,great movie a little loud but every actor is in point 
Aug 25 2023,positive,the best movies make you think long after it has ended i am still thinking about it
Aug 25 2023,positive,wonderful way to watch movie the sound of film rolling is nostalgic
Aug 25 2023,positive,storytelling at its finest  well paced stunning cinematography wonderfully acted by everyone involved one of the best movies of the last decade
Aug 25 2023,positive,an absolutely compelling brilliantly acted movie i liked it so much that i sat through it a second time consequently thats six hours and it was completely worth it it is a must see for every human on our planet chilling and thought provoking   ps robert downey jr deserves an academy award for best supporting actor
Aug 25 2023,positive,acting story costuming cinematography
Aug 25 2023,positive,there was so much to digest in this movie  a good working knowledge of world war ii history would help to understand it more  i thought the actors were terrific and i grew to understand oppenheimer to some degree  i would need to watch this again to understand more of the content
Aug 25 2023,positive,one of the best biopics i have ever seen learned a lot of the man behind the atomic bomb he was troubled but brilliant entering a time in history when he has needed most
Aug 25 2023,positive,absolutely phenomenal film christopher nolan has done it again cillian murphy is one of my all time favorite actors so to finally see him lead a huge blockbuster film was a joy and he didnt disappoint emily blunt was wonderful as was rdj josh harnett florence pugh and matt damon i expect a lot of award nominations this wonderful cast not to mention the surprise appearances 1010
Aug 24 2023,positive,good movie  very informative if interested in the subject
Aug 24 2023,positive,an absolute historical and scientific masterpiece  one of the best biopics ever made  a nolan genius absolute must watch 
Aug 24 2023,positive,brilliant film highly recommend
Aug 24 2023,positive,great movie  made me think  i enjoyed it very much
Aug 24 2023,positive,superbly acted riveting story telling the 3 hours flew by leaves you with lots to think about after the credits roll we hope robert downey jr receives a muchdeserved oscar
Aug 24 2023,positive,amazing it was unexpected its not as slow as someone said maybe challenging because its full of details but very interesting it truly deserves to be seen
Aug 24 2023,positive,omg  best picture of the year you probably have to be of a certain age to find this film interesting but if you read the book what a fantastic portrayal of important historical events definitely well deserved academy nods are coming for several categories
Aug 24 2023,positive,with the amount of hype oppenheimer had up to its release i believe christopher nolan exceeded the expectations of many the cinematography was beautifully done and it had similarities that reminded me a lot of the techniques and imagery terrence malick uses in his films the cast was brilliant and it wouldnt surprise me if both cillian murphy and robert downey jr get nominated for an oscar for their performances in this film
Aug 24 2023,negative,in the beginning good film thats building up but after a while it gets real boring same dialogues over and over again loud noise for no reason
Aug 24 2023,positive,its visually stunning and the explosions are phenomenal  i dont even need to talk about the performances cause just in the trailer they were amazing  the only problems are that its a bit too long not like an hour longer but more like it could have been 10 minutes shorter  and some actors are wasted like david dastmalchian or rami malek
Aug 24 2023,positive,just left the greek premiere of oppenheimer here in chania crete greece a long film  that drags at times  but definitely a film worth seeing for anyone who cares about the future of world civilization the ellinis theatre was packed  and 90 of the audience were teens and twentysomethings the crowd burst into applause at the conclusion i would love to hear if those who saw the film in american theatres saw so many young people in attendance at any rate i would say that it bodes well for the future of greece that its young people take such an intense interest in a serious and significant film like this a mustsee
Aug 24 2023,positive,absolute masterpiece and a must watch it tells the incredible but horrible life of oppenheimer the visuals are stunning just what you expect from nolan the audio is impeccable to pair with it the tension the music creates is thrilling and the explosions are so grand that you can almost feel them when you are in a theatre    amazing storytelling and one of the best movies in the recent years by far
Aug 24 2023,positive,overall i liked the movie   i think it could have been trimmed by about a half hour
Aug 24 2023,positive,just a little long very interesting but also depressing that we have this horrible weapons and how noticing has change in politics except probably its worse
Aug 24 2023,positive,very good a bit long tho
Aug 24 2023,positive,masterpiece loved the whole thing
Aug 24 2023,negative,not a very well told story too much unecessary noise and lights too long
Aug 24 2023,negative,a long movie about a conflicted man  good acting and special effects  however the story line was weak  a lotta talking drama with no action no humor to break it  should have just been a 1 hour documentary
Aug 24 2023,positive,out of this world i was so anticipating this movie and bought my tickets over a month early in order to get good seats at amc lincoln square in 70mm imax to get the full experience an imax setting really allows the film to just engulf you entirely  i found the time hopping a bit confusing at first but like any nolan film the larger picture became more clear every moment  i was blown away by the cast and everyone was fantastic cillian murphy was on the screen for 90 of the film and was just outstanding  the length didnt bother me and when the credits rolled at the end i found myself letting out a gasp of air because the movie did not skip a beat in my opinion  absolutely incredible and a movie that was made for the big screen
Aug 24 2023,positive,a tour de force  best biopic ive ever seen  not a dull moment
Aug 24 2023,positive,it was my third time watching it and i still enjoy it and gain new insights from watching it nolan did a terrific job with this one and cillian murphy killed it in his portrayal of oppenheimer
Aug 24 2023,positive,a modern classic never thought id be this entertained by guys talking in rooms
Aug 24 2023,positive,this is a complex look at a complicated man but oppenheimer unequivocally establishes that this is a story worth telling  and that nolan was the perfect filmmaker to do it
Aug 24 2023,positive,amazing movie i have to see it again
Aug 24 2023,positive,i had difficulty hearing the dialogue  it makes it very difficult to follow the storyline and keep up with whos who with a large cast of characters  i will most definitely use the closed caption feature when i watch it from home in the future
Aug 24 2023,positive,excellent biopic easy to follow across multiple timelines great cinematography about a series of events of which the importance can never be understated thought provoking a masterpiece
Aug 24 2023,positive,awesome movie so informative
Aug 24 2023,positive,i like it a lot i would watch continuously
Aug 24 2023,positive,did a nice job of portraying complex relationships over time
Aug 24 2023,positive,i love this movie and i recomand to see
Aug 24 2023,positive,brilliant extremely glad i got to watch this in theaters this movie is a prime example of every aspect of movie making at peak levels from the directions the writing acting to even the background sets everything was on point excited to see whats next for nolan and cillian murphy
Aug 24 2023,positive,the first 2 hours were dragging the last 1 12 hours telling what happened to him were interedting
Aug 24 2023,positive,learned some interesting things though three hours the story was so interesting the time went by quickly
Aug 24 2023,positive,wonderful slice of very important history
Aug 24 2023,positive,it was more interesting and made more sense in the last hour when it explained things  first 2 hours dragged at times and sometimes were hard to follow  if this movie is based on facts more than movie fiction it has interesting on what was done to oppenheimer
Aug 24 2023,negative,came in expecting to like this movie given the subject matter  instead half the movies content was superficial to the storys significance and there were plenty of questionable directing choices from a well know director  the actors did their best but the first 90 minutes of the movie was largely unnecessary
Aug 24 2023,positive,lemme tell ya whats good g  nolan and his team put together an ingenious invention themselves when they managed to encapsulate the worldly oppenheimer the man and his story in a 3hour casing honest to the book the story is represented as triumphant and tragic this conflict is brilliantly shown through cillian murphys performance as he endures nolans depiction of this already complicated psyche we see the psychological shockwaves take their toll on the bombs creator when the news of success comes in from hiroshima we are shown how a communist past was able to overshadow this monumental service he did for his country the story revolves mostly around the hearing on oppenheimers security clearance it is intense and gives us insight into how politics from within and outside media shaped his interrogation in suit and ties if you are interested in how power politics can wield greater strength than an intellectual who has arguably ended all wars you will enjoy learning from this kind of ingenuity also this is for people thrilled about character and political chess moves and who see the fireworks as a plus
Aug 24 2023,positive,loved iti knew much about oppenheimer before seeing the movie and i credit christopher nolan for his accuracy in the script and acting out a true story about an incredibly complicated great scientistthe 3 hours went by quickly
Aug 24 2023,positive,awesome acting compelling character
Aug 24 2023,positive,blown away by excellent performances and a brilliant story nolans finest and is projected to another level by cillian murphys performance
Aug 24 2023,positive,loud so beware but good movie
Aug 24 2023,positive,based on true story interesting history makes one think about the moral aspects of the bomb and the political arena thats always going on
Aug 23 2023,negative,was way too long said total time was 3hrs i had to leave 3hrs in and there was 20 min left wtf i feel like i was lied to and my money stolen
Aug 23 2023,positive,well made movie a little long but riveting
Aug 23 2023,negative,im impressed by other onestar reviewers that say they fell asleep how could you achieve such a feat i knew after the first 45 minutes that this movie was a waste of time but my daughter seemed to be enjoying it so walking out was out of the question i tried to go to sleep but alas the sound was ear piercingly loud for 90 of the time
Aug 23 2023,positive,very powerful and telling of the struggles to justify the manhattan project
Aug 23 2023,positive,oppenheimer is an amazing movie it isnt a movie about the atomic bomb it isnt a movie about the war its a movie about the life of oppenheimer how he saw the world and it doesnt have a right or wrong side thats why you need to watch it multiple times to see every single point of view oppenheimer has his flaws when he tries to interfere too much with politics by using his fame and how he is so self centered how the government tries to take oppenheimer down to stop him from having his opinion nuclear weapons etc how scientists see that they have to be careful when they openly say something that the government doesnt agree with it has these little details that just makes the movie complete truly a masterpiece i have already watched it twice once in imax and once in normal cinema and i will definitely be going a third time
Aug 23 2023,neutral,also as someone else stated here with regards to the film itself why the nude scenes not needed they added nothing essential to the plot and especially the drawn out conversations when they were both nude why  there were an awful lot of buzzed shots where focus is not not sharp im surprised they kept the ac on the shoot  and the musica friend whos a film composer described it as sonic wallpaper and i have to agree should have let john williams or almost anybody else score it
Aug 23 2023,positive,the movie tells us such a moving and explosive story  it is sad to see him pilloried by the anticommunism senator from wisconsin  after all the sacrifices and achievements that oppenheimer  gave to the us and the world  he and the atomic bomb gave us the freedom and great country we are today    his sacrifice and public humiliation that was put upon him remind me of plato and the prophet jesus
Aug 23 2023,positive,honestly just a few minutes in and i realized i made a mistake in seeing this film in a theater very dull no climax whatsoever  even when the bomb finally went offboring  not to mention the very odd multiple nude scenes that left me baffled as to why im seeing breasts again i really was contemplating leaving the last 30 minutes or i was completely uninterested in how this film ended as i said the film was building towards nothing
Aug 23 2023,positive,excellent story line amazing cinematography great acting
Aug 23 2023,positive,i loved the movie  a bit long but kept my attention the whole time  good ending
Aug 23 2023,positive,nolan doesnt miss as usual 
Aug 23 2023,positive,great movie however like most biopics i just dont see myself rewatching it any time soon so while objectively it might be a 55 personally its probably 4755
Aug 23 2023,positive,it wasnt a bad movie but it was a bit long and most of the movie was boring
Aug 23 2023,negative,i saw oppenheimer last night and at 3 hours it was 2 hours too long boring self indulgent absurdly drawn out with little or no dramatic tension all about boys womens only roles to show their tits or get the washing in the two female characters were actually scientistsin their own right plus many women worked on the project but youd be forgiven for thinking women only existed to support or pine over men 20 000 closeups of cillian murphys cheekbones to ensure the oscar committee noted he starved for the role overacting left right and centre kenneth branaghs absurd somewhere in europe accent and tom conti as a hilarious  unintentionally albert einstein honestly it was terrible and i think all the rave reviews are a case of emperors new clothes not wanting to criticise such an  important film itll win all the oscars
Aug 23 2023,positive,best movie of the year
Aug 23 2023,positive,who knew racing to beat the nazis in developing an atomic weapon would only be half the battle for oppenhiemer a great achievement by chris nolan
Aug 23 2023,negative,this movie while historically accurate is just boring too long and the background music is way to loud
Aug 23 2023,negative,this was extremelly boring
Aug 23 2023,positive,oppenheimer captivates audiences with its exquisite cinematography that paints a vivid visual tapestry the elite acting performances enhance the narratives depth making characters come alive with authenticity the movies highlight an epic nuclear bomb scene is a masterclass in tension and visual storytelling leaving an indelible impact a compelling convergence of cinematic elements that ensures oppenheimer is an unforgettable experience
Aug 23 2023,positive,explaining the history about the bomb and all the people involved in its creation
Aug 23 2023,positive,oppenheimer is a great movie about the development of the first atom bomb a very important part of history that was fantastically explored in this movie cillian murphy was amazing as oppenheimer and robert downey jr was incredible at playing the complex controversial lewis strauss with a fantastic performance  oppenheimer is not just about the bomb it is also about one mans lifelong journey as he struggles with his marital instability his communism his overwhelming thoughts of danger that could arise from the bomb and his rivalry with lewis strauss  even though the movie is 3 hours long it does not feel that way each scene has impact to the plot and character arcs of the story  the ending is perfect encapsulating every thought that oppenheimer had and bringing it into a powerful and conclusive scene  the cinematography was great the choices that the filmmakers made really impacted the experience of the movie such as the scene where oppenheimer and his team do the final bomb test which is completely silent and perfectly dramatized
Aug 23 2023,positive,interesting and wellmade movie too many details and too long
Aug 23 2023,negative,long too long with lots of understandable speeches for an uneducated audience  happily i had watched the documentary the bomb previous to going to the movie  that documentary is way better than this overinflated movie in giving valued information about the making of the bomb and the controversies around it  furthermore the indecent sex scenes are completely useless and just proving once more the recipe sex sells why on earth  very disappointed after all the hype and talks
Aug 23 2023,positive,it was 3 hours and kept your attention the whole time
Aug 23 2023,positive,this movie is phenomenal a great perspective of how they used quantum physics to make a atomic bomb to have the japanese surrender in wwll which lead up to the first atomic bomb that was used on hiroshima and nagasaki christopher played and dominated this role as robert oppenheimer and how robert got accused of being a communist and a agent of the soviet union for saying his beliefs after the bombings 1010 film its crazy how christopher wrote and directed this master piece of a film while playing as robert oppenheimer at the same time what a legend he is
Aug 23 2023,positive,its not bad but its ok just dont really care for his ideologies
Aug 23 2023,positive,found the movie very interesting  learned a lot about what happened during that time period  could have done without the graphic sex scenes and nudity  otherwise a very good movie
Aug 23 2023,positive,good movie but there is complete well almost nudity in a couple of scenes that was surprising as it was completely unnecessary to the plot
Aug 23 2023,positive,on a cinematography standpoint it was amazing however the dialogue went really fast and the plots kept jumping back and forth not very watcherfriendly
Aug 23 2023,positive,liked the background music and the intelligence of the dialogue and plethora of personal stories
Aug 23 2023,positive,the best movie of the year 
Aug 23 2023,positive,glorious a film that really tries to give its subjects depth and detail i guess sometimes art is an explosion
Aug 23 2023,positive,little bit too long but very good movie
Aug 23 2023,positive,dialogue was often unclear lots of flashy artsy effort constant flashbackflashforward seems an attempt to make it moviestyle rather than simply telling the story came across to me as gimmicky  and a distraction from the very interesting story that many will find hard to follow    i have seen unusually high scores for the film but i believe these are based on the history and the story rather than the quality of the film itself
Aug 23 2023,positive,amazing story  great acting  felt half the 3hr play
Aug 23 2023,positive,from a historical standpoint its a great movie the cinematography is awesome but i dont need to see this guy having sex i thought the sex scenes were unnecessary this is also a bad casting for matt damon to be in this movie the saving grace is robert downey junior who plays a great role probably gonna be nominated
Aug 23 2023,positive,this movie gives you an excellent overview of oppenheimers life becoming a leader in the scientific world and his experience with the development of the atomic bomb
Aug 23 2023,positive,i think that ir movie has a exelent script photography work sound and the exelent acta of cilian murphy and robert downey junioralso each parte of the movie is importante and ir is a exelent work of chiristopher nolan
Aug 23 2023,positive,as a biopic and period film its fine but im not quite sure where the drama and suspense are i found it entertaining but i weirdly wanted to know more about the details of the science of the bomb i felt like the soundtrack was almost endlessly hyping something exciting about to happen but the film just kind of meandered through the title characters life without really coming to a point
Aug 23 2023,positive,well acted but it seemed that the storyline became so convoluted that the director said its 3 12 hrs long we gotta get it down to 3 hrs just start cutting stuff this combined with dialogue spoken so softly that much of it could not be discerned just the opposite of the typical movie experience where your ears bleed made us scratch our heads and wonder what just happened
Aug 23 2023,positive,loved it the casting was great loved the story line felt bad for oppenheimer
Aug 22 2023,positive,didnt develop the other physicist characters very well you didnt know their contributions very well i feel misrepresented president truman as well
Aug 22 2023,negative,held my interest for all 3 hours but overall underwhelming not good not bad
Aug 22 2023,positive,disliked the volume in the theater  so loud that my husband had to make some earplugs and hold them i his ears the volume prevented him from hearing the dialog properly theater personnel need to be more aware if the sound volume
Aug 22 2023,positive,the film was somewhat i expected with a twist i realized i knew little about oppenheimers early life his family and what happened after completing the gadget project the acting was phenomenal cillian murphy seemed to really have oppenheimers character down pat robert downey jr to me stole the whole last part of the film as lewis strauss i was astounded at how little politicians have changed they were just as slimy back then as they are today  downeys performance was really an eyeopener and proof that he could act outside of iron man  marvel i have only a tiny criticism the sound in the theater was not balanced because i often had difficulty understanding the dialogue the sound to me was too loud and i had trouble hearing every word being spoken i want to see this film again
Aug 22 2023,positive,outstanding film entertaining and a deep examination of the implications of the development of nuclear weapons but more that that a great piece of art met and far exceeded my expectation saw it in 70mm film format which was fun but it is sure to be just as good in a regular digital theater see it on the biggest screen you can find if this doesnt win the oscar for best picture hollywood is in big trouble
Aug 22 2023,positive,interesting story sound track was somewhat distractingly loud at times thought the girlfriend sex scenes were gratuitous and didnt add to the plot careful editing could have saved at least 20 minutes and gotten to the heart of the film sooner
Aug 22 2023,negative,too much closed door talking it was more like a political debate things like the blast wave hitting people and the houses during the test was completely cut out i was bored
Aug 22 2023,positive,great acting screenwriting and special effects
Aug 22 2023,positive,i think it could have been shorter  it started to drag in the middle
Aug 22 2023,positive,must see movie honestly it was a masterpiece the music story writing and cinematography was just incredible and flawless imo my only complaint was that the explosion sounds were a bit too loud in my cinema but not sure if its from the cinema itself granted it was at amc cinema or from the film itself but other than that i really enjoyed the movie and will definitely give it another watch when it releases digitally
Aug 22 2023,positive,wow this is why you go to the movies
Aug 22 2023,positive,loved the actors truthfulness and acting  great story
Aug 22 2023,positive,it concentrated on the man and his tribulations and not so much on the gadget
Aug 22 2023,negative,i found this film profoundly boring i have never fallen asleep at the cinema before in all my 42 years let alone in under an hour the timelines were confusing the large courtroom  dramaesque portions were deeply dull the explosion scenes were hugely disappointing some of the main characters appeared like a comedy sketch imitation einstein and the endless men in suits entering stage left to argue with other men in suits in a room before storming off stage right were just dull the score was frankly bizarre too appearing random and almost comical in its pacing and at times completely out of sync with what was happening on screen i would not have accepted a free dvd of this film upon exit from the cinema nor a free ticket to another viewing be warned all ye who read these words
Aug 22 2023,positive,absolutely masterpiece
Aug 22 2023,positive,incredible drama  i will be getting the dvd
Aug 22 2023,positive,very long and slow in the beginning  great ending
Aug 22 2023,positive,great story well told  the special effects and the noise level were a bit over that top
Aug 22 2023,positive,wow what a movie to start this movie takes its time to set the tone for the rest of the movie early on you get introduced to almost too many characters but they all play a significant and pivotal role in the story there is a bit of a slow start in the beginning but dont go into this expecting a fast and furious this is art in motion for me the star hands down was emily blunt who played the role of oppenheimers wife she deserves a oscar for supporting role overall this movie stayed as close to historical accuracy without impending on the momentum of the story
Aug 22 2023,positive,excellent in every regard
Aug 22 2023,positive,this was an intense well acted directed and produced movie the storyline was great and really conveyed the magnitude of what was developed at los alamos for anyone who lived through cold war this is a must see
Aug 22 2023,negative,boringtoo long and no movie soundtrack and worth the price of the ticket
Aug 22 2023,negative,this was terrible i dont know what the hell you people are talking about   this was 25 hours of people talking just to hear themselves talk  and im not some mindless action shoot em up car chase fan  i like thinking movies but this was pointless   the most boring sht i have ever seen  and i love cilian murphey from peaky blinders but this was a waste of his talents
Aug 22 2023,positive,its an ok movie the visuals are cool and the characters are well cast its a pretty long run time to justify the content covered though the use of dramatic music is way overdone overall its worth a watch just for the though provoking nature of it
Aug 22 2023,positive,christopher nolan did not disappoint with his incredible screenwriting and direction the movie is intense and has incredible scenes that will make you shiver the actors performance was excellent especially cillian must watch
Aug 22 2023,positive,fantastic storytelling and acting
Aug 22 2023,positive,a phenomenal work by christopher nolan a huge work on combining the team of professionals envisioning the life of robert oppenheimer and pushing visualaudio effects on audiences through the technology of imax
Aug 22 2023,positive,excellent story told in a way that worked most of the time really long but covered the whole story images of bomb stick with you since he is so sick about feeling responsible for h  nag surprised there werent any quick flashbacks
Aug 22 2023,positive,if you have any interest at all in history specifically world war ii this is a must see  its absolutely riveting  normally i could never sit thru a 3 hour movie but the movie was so intense that you didnt even notice the time
Aug 22 2023,positive,it was literally a masterpiece took my breath away  but it is so long so if you dont like longer movies then i dont suggest it
Aug 22 2023,positive,this made me rethink how i view the world brilliant performance and would highly recommend
Aug 22 2023,neutral,the acting was excellent  i didnt even recognize rdj at first and hes one of my favorite actors  but the movie as a whole just seemed like it was more of christopher nolans homage to himself than a thoughtprovoking piece on oppenheimer or the morality of the development of nuclear weapons  the film is sort of complicated jumping around on two different timelines oppenheimers and the commerce nominee played by rdj  but in the end the story nolan tells doesnt support the giant infrastructure of this movie  it certainly doesnt support the 3 hour length  and why would anyone need to see it in imax  for one explosion  i also thought the character development seemed weak for such a long movie  i still dont feel like i know the main characters much less the supporting ones  bottom line oppenheimer failed to hold my attention ie i was bored
Aug 22 2023,positive,exactly what cinema is for a work of art
Aug 22 2023,negative,too many characters to keep track of too many things going on amidst the numerous flashbacks and timelines bottom line i wouldnt rewatch it 
Aug 22 2023,positive,a film worthy of its runtime
Aug 22 2023,positive,nolan captures what it means to embark on a scientific endeavour that is both revolutionary and catastrophic this movie is intentional to every minute detail and the emotions of fear wonder guilt and despair create a medley in what is truly a cinematic masterpiece the soundtrack alone is enough to give the audience chills every time it is played
Aug 22 2023,positive,some of the best acting and cinematography in any movie cillian murphy was perfect for the role
Aug 22 2023,positive,absolute must watch already watched it 3times in theater
Aug 22 2023,positive,the movie was beautiful the casting was phenomenal the movie tells us the audience what its about its great how they balance everything well  to oppenheimers personal issue to the actual bomb project the movie was very well made the movie is a must see
Aug 22 2023,positive,one of the greatest films of the last 50 years but also one of the most historical cinematic histories ever made  it is dense with characters maybe too dense but all important  there is a huge amount of history packed into it  ive seen it 8 times already and get more out of it each time i see it
Aug 22 2023,positive,a perfect film  casting script photography art direction music wardrobe and of course direction  c nolan is a genius
Aug 22 2023,positive,powerful performances and an unbelievable score i could have used a few less flashbacks and fantasy sequences especially if it would give emily blunt more screen time shes incredible
Aug 22 2023,positive,a must see visually thematically thought provoking important    a absolute masterclass in film making from the adaption of one of the most if not most significant and important events in human history and translating it seamlessly and in a engaging way to the viewers    christopher nolans masterpiece
Aug 22 2023,positive,if there could be a director in hollywood today capable of creating an epic as great as what oppenheimer means that is without a doubt christopher nolan a director as extraordinary as he is determined in what he does it is not surprising that he has achieved such greatness with one of the best films of 2023 and surely the best film of his filmography    a biopic that is intelligently built by a sharp thoughtful captivating and highly tense script as we enter the heart of a film that is rightly considered the best political game written in recent times nolan hides behind a forceful thriller a film that plays deceit as a virtuoso politician who tries to position his name above all around him behind the creation of the atomic bomb is a bold story that knows how to set the pace and the times before two great characters who play to position his name as the great hero of the show    for this the director has the best cillian murphy of his career who delivers what for me is the demonstration of an actor who has touched the olympus and who is definitively established as the extraordinary actor that he is julius robert oppenheimers performance is forceful sincere authentic and indelible positioning the actor as the great candidate to receive all possible recognition in awards season not only does he deserve it robert downey jr leaves as a precedent that he is a tremendous actor and that he can do everything in the cinema and you will not be able to question it as well as a cast that no matter how small his presence is no one is out of place like a florence pugh who frankly is amazing and that we only enjoyed a small part of this epic    ludwig g√∂ransson has simply created the perfect chords to accompany nolans mind with a soundtrack that does not disappoint at all and in which you allow yourself to feel the emotions with which he bathes each possible scene the same can be said of hoyte van hoytema with his dreamlike photography and the size of the challenge he must deal with from color to black and white    what nolan has achieved is to recall the ancient epics of yesteryear that can be summed up in a film made by adults for adults but made with all the breadth and majesty of those films made for children and adolescents a film so thought out and dedicated with which the director demonstrates all his experience to what he is really passionate about which is cinema    oppenheimer is an imperfect film that has its moments where you might like it less and some decisions that dont finish completely that alone means that we are in the presence of an extraordinary film that is positioned to date as that auteur film supposed to be a great blockbuster but that never releases the personal blood of its own author
Aug 22 2023,positive,excellent movie gripping story amazing sound design
Aug 22 2023,positive,good story intense scenes  didnt like how it bounced back and forth from the past to the modern day overall it was good but a little loud
Aug 22 2023,positive,great movie about actual history in our country which we always like  the acting was excellent
Aug 22 2023,positive,should be the academy award picture winner
Aug 22 2023,negative,i didnt understand oppenheimer the man or the scientist at all at the end of this 3 hour marathon  it developed his human flaws but gave me no sense of whether he was the scientific driving force of the manhattan project or a uniquely qualified administratorleader of the project or both  many historical inaccuracies and 50 stars on the flags when there were only 48 states underscores that this brit cant tell an american story accurately way overrated im going to read the book
Aug 22 2023,positive,the subject matter  main character the human condition
Aug 22 2023,positive,really liked seeing a movie about us world history and how things occurred
Aug 22 2023,negative,very overrated most people either left the movie or fell a sleep an hour before movie finished movie tried to look cool and epic way to hard about 15 hours of the movie could be cut out with the movie still working actually had the 15 hours of the movie been cut out we would ended up with an amazing movie
Aug 22 2023,positive,great dialogue and actinga bit too long after the test bomb guess off jumps back and forth in time without some time frame help so a bit confusing
Aug 22 2023,positive,absolutely loved it when the end credits started i just said wow
Aug 22 2023,positive,well done people stress that it is long but it is well done and does not feel long great acting
Aug 22 2023,positive,amazing movie  very informative and great actors
Aug 22 2023,positive,excellent acting  interesting story  however they packed in too much action movie thunder throughout  a historical biopic shouldnt be ear shattering
Aug 21 2023,positive,great actors well done
Aug 21 2023,positive,excellent acting was great and so was the story great history
Aug 21 2023,positive,oppenheimers statement made to president truman about having blood on his hands
Aug 21 2023,positive,amazing story with an amazing cast really brings the importance of the history and story of oppenheimer
Aug 21 2023,positive,it was very good acting but hard to hear actors at times
Aug 21 2023,negative,the constant jumping of timezones created way too much chaos in the film nothing really ever happened i love legal films i love scientific films so i went here with great expectations incredibly dissapointed albert was cool though
Aug 21 2023,positive,good movie felt like 2 hours and especially liked the end
Aug 21 2023,positive,watched in london on the films second weekend of release  wholly immersive experience  probably my favourite film of christopher nolans  a deeply intelligent and complex work  cillian murphy is outstanding
Aug 21 2023,negative,first this movie was way too long  there were a number of scenes that didnt do much to advance the plot or increase my understanding of oppenheimer other than showing me he could be an arrogant narcissistic person or a timid mouse  for example the whole scene with him giving his child away to be raised and then later regaining them without so much as an explanation  needed for the film  i saw too many contradictions in emily blounts character and to be frank with cillian murphys portrayal  so oppenheimer is condescending to mousy depending on the day and the group didnt bond with either  robert downey jr whether you like his character or not was absolutely awesome and the lesser characters josh hartnett do an incredible job  except for florence pugh who seemingly was cast with just one goal in mind  i got suckered into imax because the effects were supposed to be fantastic they are overhypedcool but not to the point where imax was necessary  my family who are christopher nolan fans loved this film because he cast his normal group of actors but for me the film took on a tough task and fell short
Aug 21 2023,positive,theres a jfk mention
Aug 21 2023,positive,i loved it great performances
Aug 21 2023,positive,awesome the history and drama behind one of the most cientific and philosophical dilemma of the world is well documented in this movie a must watch for sure
Aug 21 2023,neutral,the actors were really good its just that the story just dragged on too much for me
Aug 21 2023,positive,oppenheimer is a very powerful story with great writing acting great production design great editingpacing and great sound design the scene showing the first bomb going off will blow you away get it   go see it
Aug 21 2023,positive,amazing storyline and scripts visual effects and sounds are a new experience on the history of cinema deeply disturbing and unsettling making the magnitude of the historic event palpable nolan truly showed an unappreciated potential for horror transmission will buy professional headphones and watch again and again and again
Aug 21 2023,positive,worth 3 hours complex story told well and completely acting was excellent robert downey jr in particular deserves many awards
Aug 21 2023,positive,it was so cool honestly didnt expect it to be that juicy at the end i was so mad for oppi but it was so amazing to take a step back in time like that
Aug 21 2023,negative,what we thought was going to be a film about experimentation science and innovation leading up to one of the most historic events in world history sadly digressed into a witch hunt focused more on communism in america than anything else this movie was so long and boring that i fell asleep twice
Aug 21 2023,positive,a very soder account of americas development of the atomic bomb more political than scientific but with a stellar cast it tells a riveting and moving story of the choices of man
Aug 21 2023,positive,a cinematic finesse ignites an outstanding biopic  nolans nonlinear oscillation of oppenheimers story soaks ones mind and soul in itself it fuses and motions through multiple faucets of oppenheimers life whilst ensuring our wisdom of science and politics on point along with ones capable cerebral ability is required to enhance it deeply his compelling written story traverses into several themes and is ushered by nolans direction to a threehour long work of mastery the moment you begin to assimilate this master work you anticipate a flamedsteamy atomic explosion performed practically will blow your nerves off the repercussions of this mass destruction are perceived with the dazed mind that one hurdles in the echoes of cries and pain the breathtaking cinematography  a reverberating background score is an achievement closest to the molecules and sightseeing to world of oppenheimers biopic it gushes on the screen like a realization of magnificence of cinema and science the monochrome segment dilutes with conviction of a great craft and revolves to set an intriguing conclusion the impeccable cillian murphy brings the character to life and so does every other cast suits up to fit considerably well the trinity test is a place to set up oppenheimers regretful invention the aftermath of success of triumph puts oppenheimer on a trail that tries to subdue him and heres comes a time when one must stand firm for oneself oppenheimer has been left to live in remorse and guilt of his own creation that horrifies him like a death and so does he says now i am become death the destroyer of worlds
Aug 21 2023,positive,am i missing something
Aug 21 2023,positive,interesting movie enjoyed catching up on the history of the event
Aug 21 2023,positive,the erratic jumping back and forth from the security meeting was a missed opportunity to simply follow the timeline and the introduction of people and events oppenheimers visions where distracting and annoying physics and technology was dumbed down too much especially tellers proposal of a h bomb introducing some original footage of the test in los alamos and bombs on japan would have added more gravity to the movie topic is great actors are great  clear miss by christopher nolan
Aug 21 2023,positive,typical christopher nolan film music gets loud at points kind of long entertaining though
Aug 21 2023,neutral,this movie was interesting but doesnt deserve all the hype  definitely not worth seeing in imax  christopher nolan bragged about not using any vfx in the film that was a mistake  the atomic bomb explosion looked like a tiny gas fire  it wasnt impressive at all and took away from the feeling of extreme danger that you were supposed to feel at that moment  you see it and instead of thinking wow they are going to regret creating such a huge weapon youre left thinking that it doesnt look that bad and wont cause that much damage  some times directors need to get out of their own way  this was one of those times
Aug 21 2023,positive,great blend of science and morality
Aug 21 2023,negative,oppenheimer was way too long  they could have cut the movie in half and it would have been excellent  the story is interesting without hollywood messing it up  too many distracting hollywood stars too  matt damon was distracting they could have cast any actor in that role  freddy mercury rami malek  made an appearance and was completely ineffective and distracting  3 hours was painful to sit through
Aug 21 2023,positive,definitely one of the best movies i had seen in my hole life great insight on the whole life of robert the hole cast is unbelievable but surely cilian and robert downey jr stands out with no doubt a movie ill recommend and ill watch it several times more
Aug 21 2023,positive,this movie was very entertaining and informative i would highly recommend it to anyone who loves the history of our country the acting was superb
Aug 21 2023,positive,nolan has missed the mark heavily with his last 2 efforts dunkirk  tenet but oh my days has he come back with a bang oppenheimer is the perfect mix of excellent storytelling and magnificent performances from an all star cast a movie that captivated from minute 1 to minute 180 a must see
Aug 21 2023,negative,too long dialogue difficult to hear i love christopher nolan movies but this is not recommended 
Aug 21 2023,positive,it was a back in history movie worth seeing i learned something i didnt know regarding the creation of this weapon of destruction definitely would recommend others seeing this movie
Aug 21 2023,neutral,they could have cut thirty minutes of this one and been fine  seemed gratuitous  well shot and acted though
Aug 21 2023,positive,leave it to nolan to write and direct an interesting 3hour epic about j robert oppenheimer this movie was engaging and exciting with a stellar cast and a captivating performance from cillian murphy
Aug 21 2023,positive,great movie interesting look into the personality and life of such a genius a person whose work profoundly influenced america and the world for good or for bad is the question this movies poses
Aug 21 2023,positive,a brilliant movie one that is on a difficult and terrible subject the cinematography was breathtaking and the sound design was amazing
Aug 21 2023,positive,amazing excellent delivery great cinematography must see
Aug 21 2023,positive,soundtrack was good last scene was good as well
Aug 21 2023,positive,brilliantly done incredible acting by cillian murphy and everyone else must see
Aug 21 2023,positive,the movie gave me a much better understanding of what encompassed the making of the bomb  both intellectually and spiritually  it didnt seem like it was 3 hours  definitely kept your attention
Aug 21 2023,positive,it was a powerful movie covering a moment in our history that changed the world forever it was factual and graphic filled with real emotion it conveyed the fragile state of the human condition and it showed how each person has their weaknesses and strengths and how everyone must battle to do the right thing despite all the pressures to do and say the politically correct thing
Aug 21 2023,positive,great movie long and lots of detail but i loved every second
Aug 21 2023,positive,part political drama part biopic part scifi extravaganza in the classic nolan style    definitely a film worth experiencing intheaters specifically for both casual and hardcore audiences alike as with any nolan film make sure you are watching in the best format that money can afford since this project was prepared with imax cameras
Aug 21 2023,positive,oppenheimer is an extremely powerful movie the acting was exceptional and the development and direction of the story was impeccable this movie creates many emotions as you travel through it its a story that will be with me forever
Aug 21 2023,negative,there were many things that made the movie not as good as i expected poor writing nonimmersive acting from most characters  nonstop eardeafening sounds among others  however what made this the worst movie ive ever seen in cinema is the editing which made the entire film feel like a three hour social media summary    it was as if they refused to leave out a single scene a singe line that was shot and just threw it all together with zero room to breathe one fastpaced dialogue with loud dramatic sounds after another nonstop all the time for at least the first hour    it made it impossible for me to care about a single character   linear nonlinear doesnt matter i loved memento citizen kane etc   oppenheimer was just poor storytelling speedy cuts and loud sounds    im convinced the only reason it gained the extraordinarily high ratings it currently holds is due to hype and nolan idolization and in a short while people will look back at this movie and not understand how in the world it could have been so wellrecieved    i genuinely wanted to like this movie but it was appaling
Aug 21 2023,positive,great story beautiful cinematography we loved it
Aug 21 2023,positive,the movie seemed fast paced in the beginning but i definitely started to enjoy it once the plot became more focused along with the soundtrack acting and complex storyline oppenheimer was a great watch
Aug 21 2023,positive,i really wanted to see it but i was nervous about getting my expectations let down i figured its history but its not just history its a great movie recommend imax its just a different experience
Aug 21 2023,positive,third hour was repetitive and could have been compressed a 5star 2 hour 15 minute movie is lurking inside this one
Aug 21 2023,positive,fantastic movie nolan did an amazing job murphys acting was superb and even with the duration of the film it didnt feel boring   many scenes in this movie gave me actual chills and left me in an specific emotional state after the movie im so glad i got to watch it on theatre   it deserves many awards imo
Aug 21 2023,positive,it was amazing and intense it was very well written and performed the cast was amazing
Aug 21 2023,negative,this movie is great if you love sniffing your own farts
Aug 21 2023,positive,a glowing biopic with excellent acting score and direction we are yet again blown out of our seats by nolan who has solidified himself as one of the greatest directors of our time
Aug 21 2023,positive,it was a bit long but it was so great that long duration does not make it less beautiful  sound editing is amazing as always it should be noted that though nolan changed some parts of the story and kind of glorified oppenheimer this is not a concern though because oppenheimer was a historical figure worth the attention but forgotten or maybe forced to be forgotten and nolan brought him his fame again we are lucky that directors like nolan still try to give the audience the best cinematic experiences they could
Aug 21 2023,positive,normally i find movies with morally grey characters to be a miss for me however with the case of oppenheimer from oppenheimer id say that he worked out very well because lets be honest if any of us were in his shoes then yeah at that point we would all be saying that life is complicated     granted oppenheimer was to blame for some of his more personal problems but otherwise he was just simply him     as for the rest of the film i like that it included bits and pieces of humor to make up for the more dark serious moments i especially love seeing albert einstein get his time to shine i usually only see him in cartoons     do i highly recommend this biopic absolutely mainly because it features a morally grey character from history so yeah please give it a watch when you get the chance
Aug 21 2023,positive,good acting story line
Aug 21 2023,positive,oppenheimer was more than i expected and how the atomic bomb of hiroshima was developed
Aug 21 2023,positive,i really liked this film   it had so many other films inside it  felt like the insider jfk etc with the editing music pace and flashbacks but thats not a complaint  i felt the weight the entire time i watched it and that affected me when bomb went off cillians eyes are something else  love historical period pieces and this one maybe the most important thing thats ever happened in history of the world so they drew me in  loved loved the soundtrack  gorranson who also did the mandalorian is the next hans zimmer   im going on and on but i love nolan so much and he delivered bravo  oscars for all
Aug 21 2023,positive,great movie  great telling of the story and the man and the conflict  captivating from start to finish  hardly noticed it was 3 hours
Aug 21 2023,positive,long but worth it
Aug 21 2023,positive,everything about this film was well done beautifully written and amazingly well acted the pa big was near perfect and nolan delivers suspense even when you know the outcome of the scene
Aug 21 2023,positive,fabulous storyline and the acting was phenomenal
Aug 21 2023,neutral,too long too much filler too many unnecessary scenes
Aug 21 2023,positive,fantastic movie  even though it was 3 hours long i never felt like the movie was dragging on  on the contrary it held my interest from beginning to end
Aug 21 2023,positive,the movie was excellent  very captivating interesting and held my attention during the entire movie great acting highly recommended seeing this movie
Aug 21 2023,positive,finally a good hollywood movie about time i loved this film
Aug 21 2023,positive,well done story of a bomb and what followed
Aug 21 2023,negative,important biography of worlds first atomic bomb development and use against a foreign adversary production company errs on overuse of high volume to highlight significant segments at the expense of normal human sound volume thus the characters dialogue suffers loss of viewers understanding of screen transitions
Aug 21 2023,positive,very interesting historical movie  the nudity in the movie was not necessary and will keep younger viewers from seeing it
Aug 21 2023,positive,absolute masterpiece got a bit confused by the timeline at first then everything turned out to be linked with each other in the end not even a bit of useless scenes the foreshadowings made the story very thought provoking another fantastic work by nolan
Aug 21 2023,positive,3hour length but great plot and acting
Aug 21 2023,positive,i loved how the complexity of oppenheimers brain was portrayed both as a young man and also when he became stressed  i loved the portrayal of government corruption and betrayal going back decades i live in nm and had no idea los alamos was totally built for the purpose of creating a bomb i thought it had already been a city and chosen for its protected environmental situation i feel this movie could have been beautifully completed in 2 to maybe 25 hours
Aug 21 2023,positive,such an interesting movie all the way through even though not understanding the physics side of the topic the movie found a way to keep it interesting and engaging
Aug 21 2023,positive,very crucial history to our country in very trying times without too much of a political lilt it was well done
Aug 21 2023,positive,excellent historical outlook on what most americans did not know or were not alerted to in wwii  superior cast with some surprise performances  spellbinding though scientifically tough to get
Aug 21 2023,positive,great to see any movie on film but amazing to see a great movie on film
Aug 21 2023,positive,dreary confusingly presents a complex subject as a simple personal misunderstanding awful sound production as usual from this vastly overrated director
Aug 21 2023,positive,this si an amazing movie with a lot of detalles about the life of j robert oppenhaimer with a awesome repart  i will totaly see it again
Aug 21 2023,positive,it was slow at times but the story was interesting  good actors in the movie
Aug 21 2023,positive,absolutely phenomenal im picking cillian murphy for the oscar his performance is just beyond words
Aug 20 2023,positive,oppenheimer was terrific  the story was so well told the actors great and the visuals outstanding  weve now seen it twice and the second viewing was even better than the first
Aug 20 2023,positive,excellent movie  nominations are coming for best actor supporting actor sound and direction maybe screenplay as well  very well done didnt get too bogged down in much of the politics of the day
Aug 20 2023,positive,excellent accounting of the historic timeline bombing of japan and fallout should have been better emphasized than  openheimers specific interrogation at the end of the movie too muchstar studded cast was very impressive and use of black and white cinematography casting excellent costumes and makeup excellent  acting excellent across the board
Aug 20 2023,positive,all were on point excellent
Aug 20 2023,positive,the first 112 hrs was very very chaotic then it seemed to level out and not be as disjointed
Aug 20 2023,positive,film making at its finest the cinematography and acting was the best ive seen in a long time 
Aug 20 2023,positive,despite topnotch acting the movie was way too long courtroom scenes should have been condensed the soundtrack was intrusive at times emily blunt and matt damon were both excellent and gary oldman as the president
Aug 20 2023,positive,seeing it intheatres with imax was well worth it
Aug 20 2023,positive,fantastic energy throughout the movie  cant wait to learn more
Aug 20 2023,positive,great movie and kept us engaged a little technical in the beginning but still enjoyed it very much
Aug 20 2023,neutral,was good but about 15hr too long
Aug 20 2023,positive,allow three hours for an important film dealing with how in our lifetime man has managed to devise the ultimate weapon  the dialogue which on the whole is excellent is however constantly being intruded upon by loud irrelevant music  films that do this are often a sign of profound insecurity on the part of the executive producers who must have felt it needed more punch  it didnt  sometimes it intruded in vital areas of detail in the dialogue but despite this major flaw this film is very worthwhile  those who find the sex scenes also intrusive should bone up on their hindu mythology especially shiva  that might help you understand
Aug 20 2023,positive,best movie in history
Aug 20 2023,neutral,the movie was too long the trial was boring i nearly fell asleep
Aug 20 2023,positive,will made movie  both my husband and i would watch this movie again  engrossing
Aug 20 2023,positive,the acting was superior and story line was so interesting
Aug 20 2023,negative,i had low expectations coming off tenet and thinking back to his last historical story dunkirk sadly it didnt meet them i thought this would at least be a good telling of historical drama but as in tenet nolan seems to have lost the ability to actually tell a meaningful story and cares more about his latest ideas for cinematic tricks the movie does conclude powerfully in literally the last 10 seconds but i cant forgive it for wasting 30 minutes of my life before that i thought the movie was 3 star entertainment an imdb 67 until somewhere around that 2 hour 30 mark when i actually checked my watch  something i havent done in any movie whatsoever  in who knows how long why was this 3 hours long why was this offered in imax not only wasting 3045 minutes more than necessary but more of my money as well and why does one of the most powerful directors of my time need to rely on inserting 10 seconds of doom to create an impression at the end of his movie instead of actually building a story with a meaningful plot to the movie not to history
Aug 20 2023,positive,interesting and thought provoking but very long and a little confusing
Aug 20 2023,positive,good script actors action history lesson
Aug 20 2023,negative,this movie is riddled unnecessarily with porn from beginning to end it was also longer than it needed to be
Aug 20 2023,positive,i loved the movie but i disliked the nudity the scenes with sex were completely unnecessary yet very typical of hollywood to incorporate them otherwise i have no complaints and felt this was an incredibly moving film
Aug 20 2023,positive,long and hard to navigate even to the wellinformed the nonlinear narrative style that nolan is known for doesnt exactly help
Aug 20 2023,positive,must see great movie brings all the intricacies and complications of how the world changed because of the bomb and the people who caused it the ramifications and complications changed the world into a more complicated one the movie stays with you
Aug 20 2023,positive,this movie was the bomb i mean it the storytelling cinematography and soundtrack were all phenomenal i dont want to spoil anything just go watch it yourself this movie is christopher nolans best work yet
Aug 20 2023,positive,when military decisions collide with scientific discoveries and politics ambitions  not a minute of the 3 hours is unnecessary to understand this underlying part of ww ii history
Aug 20 2023,negative,overated long and boring a 2 hour film would be much entertainment
Aug 20 2023,positive,it explained a lot of the background to the nuclear program i was not aware of
Aug 20 2023,positive,i wanted it 5x in a month  and its the best movie ive ever watched great storytelling detailed characters building and perfect casting this is a movie that shows respect and trust to its audience 
Aug 20 2023,positive,with so much hype i was afraid oppenheimer might not live up to it but it met and possibly exceeded my lofty expectations superb storytelling and dazzling visuals and sound three hours flew by i never checked my watch once and i swear my eyes never left the screen at the risk of sounding cliche you really should see and hear this in a theater it is truly epic movie making at its finest
Aug 20 2023,positive,i was never a fan of biopic mostly because from their purpose they have an inconsistent pace between main events of the person and some short scenes or characters that are mostly like a wink to the audience but doesnt do much in terms of developing the story this movie succeeds mainly because of the pitch perfect direction of nolan by playing with the timeline reorganizing the main events in a nonchronological way and giving us some amazing visuals nolan created a masterpiece    oppenheimer gives some complex question surrounding one of the deadliest attack in history especially about the guilt behind this a lot of characters shine here which its not surprising since the movie is stuffed with big actors    its still a 3hours movie and sometimes you do feel the weight of the runtime there is also a shift of focus in the middle that make the movie looks like two different ones stick together in a coherent way but as a viewer you need to readapt yourself to the second part
Aug 20 2023,positive,i loved it  well acted compelling  christopher nolan the director was the perfect person to do this film as was cillian murphy as oppenheimer  great casting
Aug 20 2023,positive,absolutely one of the best movies ever
Aug 20 2023,positive,an amazing movie with equally amazing cast loved the story and the way it was written and performed
Aug 20 2023,positive,best film 2023 so far    end of august
Aug 20 2023,positive,compelling story wellacted made me think about humans rapidly advancing intelligence without the wisdom needed to temper it
Aug 20 2023,positive,a very uneven film absolutely great in parts subtle complex thoughprovoking but very longwinded and disjointed in others easily the first half of this overly long movie was not engaging  the latter half of the movie came together beautifully all the many issues the war the manipulations and machinations of the strauss character the moral conflict within the protagonist oppenheimer his relationships with women with himself the anticommunist era all aligned to make a compelling drama in the end
Aug 20 2023,positive,my brain is on   so much truth in such little space   like a fission reaction   gentleness and fear are not the same  yet they exist as two poles   one north the other south  in the middle  is truth  those who are gentle see the most truth  they dont discover  they dont create  they dont formulate  they observe  in their stillness they see more  the more they see the larger the truth  its like meeting god  you feel tiny  you feel insignificant  you feel like a vessel   you feel that you are simply a spout  what comes out is not of you   what comes out is from supreme truth  it speaks for itself  but then something happens  the more truth that comes out  the more people who dont fully understand it  start calling it something wrong  they start labeling it warping it contorting it and fumbling it  theyre not inherently violent   theyre simply not gentle so they dont see it  the more they dont see it  the more its missused missguided missunderstood  the gentleness has become fear   and if gentleness is the heaven of truth  then fear must be the hell  this movie is about showing a mans gentle nature and how this posture provided him the unique advantage to see truly powerful objective truth every scientist he recruited shared that gentleness its not a mystery why the most brilliant are the most fragile why every nerd is extremely quiet and awkward this is not the problem its the sacrifice they make to be gentle enough to see the most beautiful truths in life they are the warriors on the far north pole of the spectrum they are light bringers zeus didnt chain prometheus to the stone the first time prometheus stole fire from the titans and gave it to humans zeus quickly took the fire back and told prometheus dont do it again but prometheus was in love with humans and his over enthusiasm to be as benevolent as he could disobeyed zeus and gave the fire a second and last time to humans zeus chained him to the rock because what he did was give a truth to humans so powerful zeus knew they would not be gentle enough to use it gently   if my future is truly blessed im going to be a father someday i imagine a gentleness i have yet to experience will suddenly birth itself in me the way my child will be birthed into this world what the mother gives away from herself and into the world the world birth back into the parents a gentleness so strong it sees so much powerful truth and that comes to them in the form of something godlike in the form of a child something called ultimate love people say we created the child but i doubt we feel that way we feel more like a vessel a gateway a passage by which a piece of god in this child is walking thru they are a new bright fire being given to humanity weve never felt so gentle and our child is the most perfect gentle  as time goes on and the ungentle winds of the world blow across the landscapes of our children lives they too will become less than perfect gentle they will now have their own choices to make to maintain their gentle nature or to become less gentile and possibly at the very worst afraid for in their fear we feel the most afraid ourselves we fight for our children to revert back to a more gentle space but in some cases our children have not yet found their strength and in some cases they teach us more strength and more gentleness weve ever seen   i bring up children because we must face the reality that some of our children will not choose to live the path we hope they will choose and this tragedy makes us face a choice  to act in a way of fear fighting them and strongarming them into our preplanned decisions  no doubt our motivations are pure we only want them to revert back to the path we see as the most gentle after all shouldnt we know best for them perhaps or we could act in a way that we be gentle and by gentle we try to see their truth we try to let them teach us something without them knowing it  we be peaceful in our peace their truth will have space and room to blossom and grow its our forcefulness our lack of gentleness in handling our children that has created a fearful world   remember whatever you choose your children will learn from when our children start to act from fear that is when we should be aggressive not against them but with them however we show them  theres nothing worth being afraid for theres nothing powerful enough to force you to be afraid longer than you want to be we must teach them to conquer their fear so they can forever have a life that is gentle a parents job is single  defend against fear teach gentleness if we do our children will always find the truth and humanity will be a gentle place  my brain is on   my heart is so full 
Aug 20 2023,positive,simply a cinematic masterpiece everything i look for in a movie gathers in this one the director the cast everything perfection
Aug 20 2023,positive,the story was an eyeopening look at a very important turning point in not only our history but the worlds it was brilliantlyacted with an amazing cast of many recognizable actors and the script was terrific although complicated for most of us with iqs of less than 130 to understand i did not give it 5 stars because i felt 3 hours was too long and they could have cut about 25 mins out i actually silently cheered at the end when they mentioned jfk as someone who helped oust the villain although not my typical thriller some of it was very exciting
Aug 20 2023,positive,so great to understand important history so well portrayed by great actors and set up for us with great writing nd directing    dont be scared off by 3 hours it didnt feel that long  it is a dont miss movie
Aug 20 2023,positive,too long great cast not enough action to reel viewers back into the movie
Aug 20 2023,negative,overrated and it was very boring
Aug 20 2023,positive,the visuals costumes and acting were superb  historical correctness was right on point  i know the movie was 3 hours long but i was so riveted that it passed like a regular 2hour show in a flash bang and a boom  i particularly enjoyed the back and forth in time it helped to see the connection with the aftermath in his life and what led up to the development of the bomb
Aug 20 2023,positive,long interesting story  ill have to watch again to get all the details
Aug 20 2023,positive,enjoyed the filmperformances  visuals were the best part pacewise it was ok for a 3hr drama
Aug 20 2023,positive,all expectations from the movie were justified and the fact that the movie has no graphics once again makes us believe that nolan made a masterpiece the story of the father of the atomic bomb was filled with personal context so that the movie did not look bland and they succeeded  verdict dont go to barbie go to oppenheimer
Aug 20 2023,positive,loved it  cant wait to watch it again
Aug 20 2023,positive,must see the last movie i wanted to see ha but my son invited me and would have picked any movie other than this one but wow i loved loved loved we can all relate to the dilemmas presented in this film  sharing our core gut fears with internal knowledge of what can happen if handled wrong often makes the cryer look crazy i loved einsteins connection especially at the end the references from his past and present and how he could see the future was brilliantly done  many struggle with seeing an outcome or consequence so much more vividly than others when knowing all of the facts  his emotion was spot on his moral dilemma was so well written and presented robert downy jr was crazy good in his role also it was the longest movie i have ever seen and yet a not noticeable while watching this is truly eyeopening on how good vs evil can have blurred lines in reallife situations that can ultimately affect us all
Aug 20 2023,positive,the acting was superb and the story captured your attention
Aug 20 2023,positive,first half of the move is quite good in fact the movie should have wrapped up 15 min after the first new mexico test     the whole einstein bit seemed a bit overdone and nobody would have missed it     the second half of the move is torturous to watch you are bombarded by characters you barely know who are playing pivotal roles the switching between bw scenes and the current arc of the story is just irritating     my biggest criticism of the movie is a simple one it is far far too long it goes out with a whimper and doesnt justify the bonkers storytelling
Aug 20 2023,positive,best movie of 2023 year
Aug 20 2023,positive,the performances the script the sound everything is amazing several oscars will go to this movie
Aug 20 2023,positive,another nolan masterpiece an unconventional style biopic of course nolan style  the score cinematography acting and plot executed flawlessly i loved it from start to finish
Aug 20 2023,positive,one of the best films ive seen in a long time anyone who is interested in a great cinematic film with a great historical background and has a basic knowledge of physics or interest in physics will absolutely love this film it is so well acted and everything about it is top notch i couldnt recommend it enough
Aug 20 2023,positive,incredible movie but some scenes in my opinion could different and the politics in the end were boring a bit i can understand that oppenheimers life didnt end at the bomb but still it was a bit boring i suggest this movie to anyone above the age of 1516 that think there arent good movies left
Aug 20 2023,positive,awesome a must see cicilian murphy is brilliant really good acting
Aug 20 2023,positive,a very difficult movie to rate in terms of production acting and overall design the movie is stellar zero arguments there after all its a christopher nolan movie and it shows with every shot give cillian murphy an oscar too    that being said there are several major flaws for me personally firstly the movie chronically lacks a sense of structure you can pick a random scene from the movie and you wouldnt be able to tell if it takes place at the beginning end or the middle this has nothing to do with the different timelines being shown simultaneously as other movies have used this approach while maintaining a sense of beginningmiddleend in their story    secondly there are serious pacing issues especially in the last 40 minutes which couldve easily been condensed into 15 or 20 minutes its not a boring movie  by no stretch of the imagination but the 3 hour runtime feels bloated     last but certainly not least  it failed to elicit the emotional response in me that nolan probably wanted for the vast majority of the movie i felt quite indifferent and apathic  all while the movie was doing its best to be as dramatic almost melodramatic and serious as possible as a result it felt a bit pretentious and like the film is taking itself too seriously i got the impression that somebody shouldve tapped nolan on the shoulders as he was writing the script and told him its not that deep bro    nevertheless the character study of oppenheimer is incredibly well done by the end youll feel like you intimately know him and id argue that his deconstruction throughout the movie is one of the best  if not the best  ever put to film    the film also challenges your own morals and makes you question those of its characters which was greatly appreciated    nevertheless i feel like the focus shouldve been more on the moral  philosophical debate surrounding the atomic bomb its farreaching consequences on society as well as the overall impact on oppenheimers psyche but as it stands nolan  my man  you cant give me 45 minutes of court hearings and paranoid americans witch hunting for soviet spies and expect me to take the movie as dramatically as you want me to
Aug 20 2023,positive,great movie little chaotic form of showing the story but it is a great movie
Aug 20 2023,positive,i enjoyed that the movie showed the character of oppenheimer as well as that of strauss and teller  it is a history of quantum mechanics with characters playing einstein bohr heisman fermi and teller
Aug 20 2023,positive,prometheus a titan who defied zeus by stealing fire from the gods and giving it to humanity  symbolizes human advancement as punishment zeus bound him to a rock where an eagle would eat his liver daily only for it to regenerate each night    just as prometheus brought fire and knowledge to humans the character of victor in mary shelley masterpiece frankenstein  brings life to a creature and plays with knowledge that transcends humanitys usual boundaries     based on the 2005 biography american prometheus by kai bird and martin j sherwin christopher nolans movie also traces a parallel to the ancient myth by chronicling the career of american theoretical physicist j robert oppenheimer and his role as leader of the manhattan project the same that brought the atomic bomb to life and culminated in the destruction of hiroshima and nagasaki killing between 129000 and 226000 people most of whom innocent civilians men women and children     whether you think dropping  the abomb was a necessary evil or you believe the act was unwarranted as germany had already surrendered  and it was just a matter of time before japan did the same nobody can deny that both the creation and use of a weapon capable of causing mass extinction opened pandoras box     war is always ugly and the end of a war that brought together capitalists and communists to rid the world of absolute evil was justly celebrated by whoever was against facism but it must have been a bittersweat moment as the price of victory was incredibly high     and nolans movie covers this terrible historic events with absolute  mastery exceptionally well crafted technically perfect and visually stunning  oppenheimer is one of the best movies of my lifetime as soon as the credits rolled and i left the room  i cried and i cried more and then cried again i drove home crying i cried for roberts pain for his conscience i cried for the world he created the one we live in     a true masterpiece oppenheimer was flawlessly adapted masterfully directed edited and acted audio is my passion and the audio track is so fantastic that it tells a story on its own it comes loud as hell when you least expect and it goes entirely silent when you do with contrasting layers and inspiring sound textures that play with your perception unparalleled     in some moments the movie works very much like a psychological thriller whats really terrifying is not the bomb itself theres nothing surprising about a bomb that went off over 70 years ago but everything that surrounds its creation and deployment all those gears moving  vendetas anticommunism witch hunt a nation that have never really achieved the virtue it believes it has     and murphy leads a superb cast robert downey jr is a monster and emily blunt the true queen of england florence pugh benny safdie matt damon gary oldman kenneth branagh   every single cast member is perfect  everyone
Aug 20 2023,positive,human emotions nuclear supremacy and pain in celebrating it a success on dead just a masterpiece
Aug 20 2023,negative,the worst movie ive ever had the torture of sitting through i created this account just to warn others i kept waiting for something interesting to happen  still waiting
Aug 20 2023,positive,it moved fast at times if you dont know the history cillian murphy was well cast and several others contributed there were too many cut aways to different events to keep the flow of what could have been good character development the intensity was there appropriately
Aug 20 2023,positive,the obligatory nudity distracted from the overall quality and thus the rating of the movie
Aug 20 2023,positive,top storyline character development and cinematography just loved it movie kept a good fast pace never got boring
Aug 20 2023,positive,the music and overall story  most movies end before getting the whole story
Aug 20 2023,positive,its ok but ive seen it all before  not too dissimilar to the other films this fellow makes bleak and a bit melodramatic
Aug 20 2023,positive,it was a fantastic movie that offered lots of insight to something i knew little about i walked out having respect for someone based ive never heard of just based on a movie i would watch it again
Aug 20 2023,positive,the movie did a great job portraying the politics of the time and the development of the atomic bomb  i have lived in nm and toured the areas where this took place  i believe the characters were well cast  i do not know how accurate the dramatization was but the movie was intriguing and makes one think about the world we continue to live in and the precariousness of humanity
Aug 20 2023,positive,im so happy to alive at the same time as cillian murphy
Aug 20 2023,positive,slow start but it picked up and kept your interest we enjoyed it and would definitely recommend it
Aug 20 2023,negative,i like historical side if it i was extremely confused was definitely really scandalous thing that where not good and unexpected
Aug 20 2023,negative,three hours of nonsense hardly a single scene lasted longer than 20 seconds zero character development not sure why this film is so heralded everyone fawning over the mystique of christopher nolans filmmaking while every scene depicts men jockeying to be the loudestmost correct in the room trash film not worth the money
Aug 20 2023,positive,it is a modern masterpiece artistically fantastic and very interesting biopic
Aug 20 2023,positive,i was hoping for more on the designing and fabrication of the two bombs and why the pt fat boy required a spherical shaped charge versus the simpler u gun design  it spent too much time on the drama of the sloppy security and political bs leading to his humiliation
Aug 20 2023,positive,difficult to follow with so many characters and flashbacks
Aug 20 2023,positive,well acted well shot characters believable in their portrayals a bit preachy and revisionist on historical events however
Aug 20 2023,positive,cast and acting great not a fan of the story
Aug 20 2023,positive,watched oppenheimer in both formats and 70mm is hands down the very best to experience this amazing movie the picture and sound is second to none highly recommended
Aug 20 2023,positive,good story line solid acting felt it could have been told in less time could have cut 30 minutes
Aug 20 2023,negative,felt i was being held hostage the last 90 minutes  they tried to make a court thriller out of the post war era and it just felt flat
Aug 20 2023,positive,glad i saw it in the theater  the thx surround really made me feel the loud claps and nuclear explosions  highly recommend  seeing it in the theater
Aug 20 2023,positive,extraordinary film  brilliant script and editing masterfully performed and poignantly highlights the perils of nuclear proliferation           outstanding film  exquisitely penned masterfully performed and poignantly highlights the perils of nuclear proliferation
Aug 20 2023,positive,nolan keeps you engrossed from the opening scene fantastic script and many brilliant performances
Aug 20 2023,positive,we never were aware of this part of our countries history enlightening  terrifying at the same time
Aug 20 2023,positive,the sound effects were so loud and totally unnecessary  enjoyed the historical story  the political background was especially interesting  3 hours was a little long
Aug 20 2023,positive,saw this at the icon theatre in mtn view the sound was painfully loud and it partially ruined the experience too loud even with kleenex stuffed in my ears and hands over ears the movie is not for everybody and it would be important to do some reading about this period in history before seeing the movie
Aug 20 2023,positive,christopher nolan has done it again oppenheimer is going to clean up the awards at the academy awards for best visual effects best director best cinematography best screenplay best actor for cillian murphy best supporting actor for robert downey jr best actress for emily blunt best supporting actress florence pugh and best musical score oppenheimer is a blast with a huge amount of emotion depth and if anyone hasnt seen it yet i would strongly encourage you to
Aug 20 2023,positive,the whole story was intresting
Aug 20 2023,positive,incredible movie worth going to see again  the second time you find and see so much  more of the details within the movie  frightening intriguing masterful screenplay and marvelous acting  indeed absolute must see especially if you are a history fan
Aug 20 2023,positive,this was a superb and balanced presentation
Aug 20 2023,positive,if you have an interest in important events in history you will really enjoy this movie  it clearly informs not only of the development of the bombs but also the unfair attacks after the war on the heroes who developed it
Aug 20 2023,positive,great movie and great performances by everyone involved 1010
Aug 20 2023,positive,this movie will sweep the oscars  dont miss it
Aug 20 2023,positive,absolutely fantastic movie did not feel like 3 hours
Aug 20 2023,positive,completely riveting imax 70mm did not disappoint
Aug 20 2023,positive,its a good movie but too long  the first 2 hours of this movie are pretty good but the last hour is a snooze fest
Aug 20 2023,positive,i loved the movie the only reason im not giving it 5 stars is because of the graphic sex scenes  they werent needed to tell the story  and they make it where the film is not family friendly  just like when he had his affair on his first wife the activity could have been alluded to rather than seen
Aug 20 2023,positive,a bit slow but good
Aug 20 2023,positive,the constant music was annoying and the sex scene was unnecessary i will see it again when i can turn on the close captioning so that i can read the dialog
Aug 20 2023,positive,started slow but really was good
Aug 20 2023,positive,it is so true to life  exactly what is going on now with our politics
Aug 20 2023,neutral,oppenheimer sucked   i think only because christopher nolan directed it that people are giving it such high scores    it was a sometimes incoherent often mindnumbingly boring slog that felt like it went on for days  and nolan continues his record of not being able to write for women even though the supremely talented emily blunt in florence pugh brought everything they had to their crappily written roles   half the time youre thinking oh look another alister cameo in a tiny role of a person i dont care about and have no idea why the hell theyre in the story   it was a mess too long and boring the only interesting part of it was the trinity test  the actors were great the script and distracting especially all the unnecessary timeline jumps some of which were inexplicably in black and white were awful
Aug 20 2023,positive,inteligent movie the actor is very good i recommend this movie the best in this moment
Aug 20 2023,positive,glad i seen it it was really good dont think i like to watch it agian
Aug 20 2023,positive,a lot of history i was not aware of
Aug 20 2023,positive,the acting in this movie especially that of cillian murphy and robert downey jr was superb  i didnt really enjoy the first hour of the movie which was confusing and literally hard to understand the words of the actors  but once it got about halfway through i got totally into the story and really enjoyed the second half not a favorite of mine but i would recommend it
Aug 19 2023,positive,i only wish that the theaters didnt sit people so close to the screen so you can view the ratio properly if you buy tickets to the imax show get seats as far back as possible and to the center as far as possible to get the best view
Aug 19 2023,negative,maybe i was spoiled by fat man and little boy  which was good   this film was like that but crossed with jfk  far too long and monotonous   it was ok right up until the bomb went off and then it just prattled on about oppenheimers security clearance and desire to influence arms control policy  obliquely there wasnt much of him actually doing this   however maybe i just missed it because with 40min to go i found myself walking out because i was soo bored by this point  imo save your money and watch the former film instead    imagine watching charlie and the chocolate factory but most of the film is about background checks and politics of willy and the oompa loompas    also the bomb visuals were very very poor
Aug 19 2023,positive,amazing motion picture
Aug 19 2023,positive,loved it a couple of scenes didnt add much to the story prevented me from giving 5 full stars
Aug 19 2023,positive,one of the few movies ive seen in the past several months that i would give a five i thought the script was great the acting was great and the story made me want to learn more about that era
Aug 19 2023,positive,probably the best nolan movie so far and thats saying a lot
Aug 19 2023,positive,it was good slow start
Aug 19 2023,positive,excellent movie   so well made and the acting is top notch  would see it again
Aug 19 2023,positive,story was great acting was great true story add that up you get 5 stars  nothing to dislike except how oppenheimer was treated in real life i would see it again and i dont say that about  very many movies
Aug 19 2023,positive,the best movie of the centuryoppenheimer is a captivating and thoughtprovoking cinematic masterpiece that delves deep into the life and mind of j robert oppenheimer the brilliant physicist and key figure behind the development of the atomic bomb the film brilliantly explores the moral complexities and ethical dilemmas that arose during the manhattan project showcasing oppenheimers internal struggle and the weight of his decisions with stellar performances meticulous attention to historical accuracy and evocative storytelling oppenheimer offers a compelling narrative that invites viewers to reflect on the profound impact of scientific advancements on humanitys trajectory this movie is a mustwatch for history enthusiasts and those interested in the intersection of science ethics and human nature
Aug 19 2023,negative,i found it boring very onedimensional like sitting in a very long meeting too much blah blah the special effects at the beginning felt meaningless and inappropriate was his brain whizzing was he perplexed by the quantum world he was imagining or was he tripping too long lacking in colour no narrative arc disappointing
Aug 19 2023,positive,it was excellent well cast and a good portrayal of that era and one of the greatest minds to come along in our history oppenheimer
Aug 19 2023,positive,cilian murphy was phenomenal
Aug 19 2023,positive,a remarkable film best picture worthy
Aug 19 2023,positive,it could have done without the sex scenes and would have been better if it only eluded to it instead of actually showing it lots of good information just wish it was more suitable for younger ages so all ages could enjoy a piece of history
Aug 19 2023,positive,masterpiece never has three hour just flown away like that 
Aug 19 2023,positive,the movie was ok but underwhelming it tries very hard to look smart and deep but it just is not good acting and cinematography however it didnt rise to the hype for me it was a bit boring and all over the place too less focus on the manhatan project and a very sudden and dissapointing resolution to that the trial received more screentime but amounted to less because it didnt really say much
Aug 19 2023,positive,liked the character development impressive cast good storybeginning was too fast and jumped too much to get grounded
Aug 19 2023,positive,great biopic with incredible performances by an allstar cast the visuals and sound are also more of a reason to see this film on the big screen
Aug 19 2023,negative,don t beleive the hype terrible movie way to long no action only talking
Aug 19 2023,positive,on the rare occasions hollywood delivers its usually a nolan flick shot on 70mm its on 11 miles of film with 11 miles more of beauty and an epic melodramatic and flat out horrifying soundtrack that surpasses anything hans zimmer could possibly do i love the cast and murphys stare into oblivion as the sweeping machine sounds go faster and faster and faster paints an epic i believe we did it
Aug 19 2023,positive,academy award consideration
Aug 19 2023,positive,this is not a feel good movie it takes some time to digest the acting is terrific as important as the visual effects are the sound is equally as powerful my only complaint is there are several times when the dialogue is inaudible go see this movie it is very thought provoking it makes you wonder how you would deal with such responsibilities of country verses people
Aug 19 2023,positive,oppenheimer is full with fire burning conversations an oscar worthy performance from cillian murphy and a jaw dropping atomic bomb sequence yet another great film by nolan could have been like 15 minutes shorter though
Aug 19 2023,positive,oppenheimer was a really well thought out film that explored the build up to the bomb his connection to einstein the aftermath of the completion of the bomb and the aftermath of the bombing including the betrayal that occurred the acting was amazing but who would expect anything else with the cast   for me it was an emotional film in quite a few parts seeing his struggles and the effects of the bomb was very intense  not to mention the lead up to the bomb gave me anxiety something that powerful being created actually instilled a fear in me while watching it nolan did a tremendous job   i know some people didnt like the length of the film but i thought it was great and didnt notice the time  it allowed the intensity to be there surrounding the bomb along with the character development loved it
Aug 19 2023,positive,we saw it in a rpx theater which added to the experience with sound to compliment the outstanding editing in this film  this was an important story with layers worthy of discussion  fabulous direction and great actors  it was just too long
Aug 19 2023,positive,oppenheimer is one of the best if not the best movies ive ever watched it doesnt have a lot of action  shooting fights etc and it focuses more on the building process and life of oppenheimer it has good dialoges incredible scenes and i felt like i was oppenheimer or in oppenheimers perspective the whole time i was so excited and nervous the whole time and the movie did a really good job portraying oppenheimers life movie is a 10010 must watch
Aug 19 2023,positive,one word review for this film would be  masterpiece 
Aug 19 2023,positive,since its not a movie with much not any really action i think it could have been shorter  its very talky  important information in there  but it dragged a bit at times
Aug 19 2023,positive,the movie is a little slow in the beginning but it builds up very well and ends well in a typical nolan way
Aug 19 2023,positive,superb film outstanding acting directing and editing the movie treated multifarious social political and personal complexities over a panorama of time with creativity and sensitivity chronicling the story in an amazingly engaging film kuddos to all
Aug 19 2023,negative,the bomb of man according to man now hero man in 70mm by the americans
Aug 19 2023,positive,masterpiece nolan delivers another masterpiece
Aug 19 2023,negative,the acting was very good but the directing and editing was sorely lacking  the movie was disjointed and difficult to follow  it was unnecessarily long   could easily have been a 2 hour movie instead of a 3 hour move  parts of it really dragged  would not recommend spending 3 hours to watch it
Aug 19 2023,positive,it was a good movie it is a great way for people to learn about the history very interesting
Aug 19 2023,neutral,the movie was disjointed and confusing  there was too much video artistry very distracting
Aug 19 2023,positive,awesome movie first half rocks a bit tense in second half where it gets political maybe this event started the downfall of the dominant party leading in their demise in the 80s i hope you 50 on that side realize you are in support of the evil empire even jfk knew those morons were losers
Aug 19 2023,positive,very interesting movie and i liked the black and white film relating back in time and color for current day  held your interest for the entire three hours
Aug 19 2023,neutral,it is not a bad movie but it wasnt what i was expecting very disappointed since i was hoping for great dialogue fleshedout characters and greater emphasis on the human drama and oppenheimers inner workings we do get glimpses of it and they are great but the constant jumping for periods and scenes prevents us from fully focusing on those aspects of the film it was well made and cillian murphys acting was great however it was more flashy than substance and it reminds me of another disappointing character study joker it didnt justify the run time since it didnt give enough time to develop characters such as strauss why is this important well at the end of the film we get to see major developments in oppenheimers life involving some of these characters but many get only a few scenes that last beyond a minute this prevents us from getting the emotional payoff that was intended
Aug 19 2023,positive,loved the acting but the sound mixing ruined it for me i couldnt hear a lot of the dialog
Aug 19 2023,positive,decent film with an ok depiction of the trinity test    unfortunately the characterisation is very shallow and the runtime is too long    rdjs performance is phenomenal but the character is never fleshed out murphys acting is also good    the film doesnt put any effort into explaining the long winded boring political drama playing out  it focuses too much on the politics and then tries to fit in other narratives    ok for a one time watch on a big screen but skippable otherwise
Aug 19 2023,positive,just another masterpiece to be added in history timeline
Aug 19 2023,positive,loved seeing the frame get taller in 15perf imax
Aug 19 2023,positive,perfection theory will only take you so far and christopher nolan went above and beyond that statement by proving that perfection existed
Aug 19 2023,positive,just in the beginning on the movie i was hooked its really a great movie id say its one of my new favorites the movie is just a masterpiece
Aug 19 2023,positive,the movie had exceeded my expectations for a biography as a 3hour long biography it has illustrate the life and personality of oppenheimer yet i didnt find it boring at all    i would recommend this movie to everyone who are interested in history and have some basic understanding of physics
Aug 19 2023,positive,this movie is like surgery  it hurts but its necessary
Aug 19 2023,positive,this was a fantastic movie and probably one of the best movies i have ever seen in a theater i strongly encourage if you havent yet to go watch this i just watched this for the second time yesterday down at a real imax theater and it was a mind blowing experience
Aug 19 2023,positive,superb story performance and soundtrack
Aug 19 2023,positive,excellent drama good history having visited los almos a story that needed telling
Aug 19 2023,positive,it was a good but challenging expirience to watch this film because its fast they are talking fast oppenheimer is allways stressed and there are many time jumps but the audivisual ecpirience was insane the allegory of physics in this film is also impressive i recommend to have a good knowlege about this timeperiod before watching this film otherwhise you wont be able to follow the whole story
Aug 19 2023,positive,an ultimate mastepiece by the master craftsman himself    one of the most anticipated movies of 2023 and it didnt disappoint i would like to say that the person must be fully prepared and switched on if he wants to understand the movie exceptional movie and great acting by each and every cast especially cillian murphy and rdjr one thing which i have noticed about casual movie goers that they were wondering what is happening you are non attentive and then you are lost    oppenheimer is  with no doubt going to be one of the best movies in the history amazing cinematography exceptional acting and terrifying soundtracks    cillian murphy gave the performance of his life overall the movie  has everything  summary an ultimate masterpiece
Aug 19 2023,negative,the whole movie shows only the worst part of a man with no humanity for the audiences it is severely painful to watch a man screwing up things which makes me wonder is nolan depressed these days since the movie itself is a depression and distressful experience
Aug 19 2023,positive,loved cillian murphy great story and fantastic acting
Aug 19 2023,positive,outstanding i cant remember the last time i saw a film that felt so sumptuous and driven by equal parts character development plot and unpretentious nuance it felt like reading a novel onscreen full of detail and with a 3hour run time that moved swiftly in and out of time and moral ambiguity not sure what other oscar fodder will enter the arena but cillian and rdj delivered stellar performances cillian is such a thoughtful chameleon of an actor its wonderful to see a creative work that really highlights his authenticity and vulnerability
Aug 19 2023,positive,phenomenal cast phenomenal performances phenomenal cinematography wow
Aug 19 2023,positive,i left exhausted but worth the ride
Aug 19 2023,positive,the most intelligent story about genius and great achievement that i have seen the last thrid of the story takes an exciting turn
Aug 19 2023,positive,great acting and must see film
Aug 19 2023,positive,the fast pacing of it all along with the perfect score helps you spend 3 hours watching one of the most horrific stories in the last centuries excellent score and cinematography must watch
Aug 19 2023,positive,oscar type film nolan one of the greatest directors out there must watch
Aug 19 2023,positive,i saw oppenheimer in 70mm imax and it was completely worth it  chillian murphy really brought oppenheimer to life and matt damon and robert downy jr did a phenomenal job with gen groves and admiral strauss  the acting from the most minor characters to the headliners was excellent    christopher nolan has been firmly cemented as one of the industrys top directors for years now and he did not disappoint  all facets of the movie worked together to paint a picture of the manhattan project from its inception to the trinity test at the climax of the film  covering oppenheimers life from his pro communist private life before being recruited for the manhattan project to his public fame after the end of wwii    the use of full color film interspersed by black and white scenes to differentiate between the time jumps was well done and not jarring at all  it was a brilliant way to avoid using on screen labels to tell the audience when and where they were throughout the film    overall i cant recommend this movie more highly  its well done in all respects
Aug 19 2023,positive,slow to get started but a lot of great 30s and 40s costumes and the hollywood antiwar sentiment is not too strong
Aug 19 2023,positive,good true story they did the same thing to oppenheimer that they are doing to trump today funny how things never change and our government is as corrupt today as it was back in the 40s
Aug 19 2023,negative,we got lost with all the timeline jumping characters came in and out popped up again in the last hour and youre supposed to remember who they are
Aug 19 2023,positive,fascinating film that tells a little known but important story  the sex didnt need to be included and that will limit who can see this  its a shame because nolan did another great work  saw it in the theater
Aug 19 2023,positive,interesting and well done but really long  better than most but not nolans best
Aug 19 2023,neutral,too long they could have cut an hour off and still made the same impact
Aug 19 2023,positive,i found it kind of laughable that some folks thought the film had too much sexnudity  i thought the film stressed the communist issue too much  granted its a bio and the communist issue made oppenheimers  life a tragedy but having just read lawrence and oppenheimer by nuel pharr davis  i was hoping for more on the technical aspects of developing the bomb
Aug 19 2023,positive,amazing cast  cillian murphy and robert downey jr put in oscar worthy performances  3 hours flew by
Aug 19 2023,positive,i liked it but it was hard to follow in the beginning also the music didnt need to be sooooo loud  same benefit if a tad lower  acting was great
Aug 19 2023,positive,one of the best movies ive seen some people complain that its too long and lazy among other things and that they were expecting action but thats what a political movie is all about
Aug 19 2023,positive,the storytelling was very well done with complimenting cinematography
Aug 19 2023,positive,the cast for this movie was really good i kept staring at robert downey jr just in disbelief the pace of a movie was also good and that i didnt feel like it dragged on i really enjoyed it overall
Aug 19 2023,positive,one of christopher nolans greatest masterpieces
Aug 19 2023,positive,stupid gratuitous sex scenes made it r  were they really needed  come on folks
Aug 18 2023,positive,it was a thought provoking movie  i am a babyboomer and am surprised that there was not much taught about this whole incident while i was going through school  it reveals that our country is great because of the individual acheivements of honest naive people  it also reveals that our government officials have been corrupt throughout our history  however in the past there have been honest people who help to expose the truth  today not so much
Aug 18 2023,positive,first third of the movie confusing and difficult to follow  once at los alamos much linear plot last third like a courtroom drama the music interferes with dialogue frequently
Aug 18 2023,positive,phenomenal powerful political pulls no punches
Aug 18 2023,positive,masterfully done oppenheimer has oscar written aaall over it  theres nothing you can do about it
Aug 18 2023,negative,way too complicated to follow the story line it didnt need to be 3 hours long
Aug 18 2023,neutral,maaaaaad amounts of talking sometimes in colour and sometimes in black and white a lot of loud noises throughout
Aug 18 2023,positive,too long dialog was hard to hear most of the time the casting was less than perfect matt  damon was supposed to play the part of an old fat man  didnt work the girlfriend and the wife looked so much alike i got lost as to who was who
Aug 18 2023,positive,three hours went fast everyone played their parts to perfection the visuals were great totally enjoyed it
Aug 18 2023,positive,well done kept my attention for the entire 3 hours
Aug 18 2023,positive,nolan has a way with creating tension in subtle and notsosubtle ways alike very well directed and acted couldve been about 30 minutes shorter with less emphasis on the communist hunt but overall a very solid film
Aug 18 2023,positive,its amazing but weird at the same time just watch it youll enjoy it
Aug 18 2023,negative,worst movie i have ever seen boring and drug out so painstakingly long highly dont recommend to everyone im not sure ill ever visit a movie theater after having to sit through this 3 hour anticlimactic movie
Aug 18 2023,positive,great movie especially if youre a history buff
Aug 18 2023,positive,hated the public sex scenes and that it was too long 3 hours otherwise it was great film
Aug 18 2023,positive,a bit too long but definitely interesting 
Aug 18 2023,positive,great movie  matt damon bad casting lol just completely drew me out of the world everyone else kills the job matt gets better but the first few scenes felt like a joke matt damon with mustache disguse  3 hours was a long time could of used an intermission or wait for at home
Aug 18 2023,positive,this movie is everything it has breath taking visuals it puts you on the edge of your seat and it has a wonderful score every performance in the movie was magnificent my favourite being robert downey jr the one flaw is the length of the movie it drags a bit at the end over amazing 455
Aug 18 2023,positive,this was a great drama and very informational on his work and life  the time flew by so although it was a longer movie it didnt feel like it   really enjoyed it
Aug 18 2023,positive,this movie unquestionably deserves the title of movie of the year it was nothing short of fantastic all it needed was cillian murphy christopher nolan world war 2 and the atomic bomb and it could easily claime the title of the best movie of the year the scale of epicness in this film was truly unmatched while some critics voiced concerns about the portrayal of oppenheimer citing its extended runtime and the background knowledge and despite a relative not many of explosive action i personally found immense enjoyment in every aspect of this movie being a history nerd along with my friend we loved it in every second of it and this is 100 the second best film that christopher nolan has made
Aug 18 2023,positive,if youre a history buff this is the movie for you but if youre a nolan buff this doesnt really compare to some of his other works a bit slow paced and bland but does a good job retelling the history behind the titular figure visual effects were stunning and the main score was beautiful but the audiodialogue was hard to follow at several points
Aug 18 2023,positive,this movie is 3 hours and it kept me hooked the entire time with amazing visuals and a breathtaking score oppenheimer does not disappoint  cillian murphy was amazing in the main role and robert downey jr was a standout my only problem for me was in the middle when the movie felt quite slow but it is only small problem with this otherwise amazing film
Aug 18 2023,positive,oppenheimer should win best picture at the oscars this year if not its a shame one of the best films christopher nolan has ever directed the script is astonishingly good as well
Aug 18 2023,positive,seat eventually got uncomfortable these werent the new lazy boy like recliners
Aug 18 2023,neutral,excellent acting and such an interesting story but too long a movie and the music was often too loud during dialog so it was hard to understand    all that back and forth in time was way overdone so it was sometimes difficult to follow
Aug 18 2023,positive,loved it best dialog ever actually held my attention the entire movie both cillian murphy and robert downey jr  should be up for oscars
Aug 18 2023,positive,had i been able to think through the ridiculouslyloud cinemark theater i could probably give a more rational review      cillian murphy is 5star in his role    but  i feel as though that 90min deposition of him which comprises the entire second half of a very long movie3hours after approx 1hr of advertising followed by 30min of previews is part of my life i will never get back  maybe i missed a good portion during the time i dozed off    ive been to los alamos and enjoyed rehashing some american history    the concession stands should sell earplugs
Aug 18 2023,positive,best movie ive seen in years   from the background of brilliant physicists and theorists discussions through debates and decisions history of the man and the political and military aspects very enlightening movie time flew by
Aug 18 2023,neutral,it is so sad that directors think they have to put sex into every movie  there was no reason to add the pornographic sex scenes  other than that the first half was very slow and delved into his emotional issues  the second half was more about the history of the atomic bomb which was very interesting  as a secondary teacher i would have liked to been able to show this film to my classes but could never with these unnecessary sex scenes  every friend i have talked to has had the same opinion  is this where our culture has come
Aug 18 2023,negative,this is the most boring movie i have ever attended apart from barbie  after persisting for an hour i lay down on the cinema seats and went to sleep but was rudely and traumatically woken up every so often by an atom bomb going off i think most people only went to see it because cillian murphy was in it but he hardly showed any emotion at all and i didnt find him to be charismatic in the least this was part of the problem that i didnt like or admire any of the characters in the whole movie  there were just too many uninteresting suited men smoking and being bitchy with each other  even worse than barbie
Aug 18 2023,positive,second time through since it is such a dense film with many characters and time frames jumbled about      one huge problem the sound track  all the sound effects from explosions to cars going by always swamp the dialog  its hard to get all the words  the balance between the two is terrible  the theater rumbles with nuclear fission but you cant even get a line of dialog out  really
Aug 18 2023,positive,one of the best movies i have ever seen
Aug 18 2023,positive,emily blunt should receive an oscar  so many talented actors in this movie
Aug 18 2023,positive,oppenheimer is an intelligent movie about an important topic thats never less than powerfully acted and incredibly entertaining
Aug 18 2023,positive,wonderful beyond imagination
Aug 18 2023,positive,sophisticated witty and interesting
Aug 18 2023,positive,i quite enjoyed this film clocking in at 3 hours its a looooong movie and at times it feels it i wasnt crazy about all the back and forth scenes between his timeline and can get a bit confusing but its one of nolans better films     this has a stellar whos who of a cast with many surprising cameos and alist actors in smaller roles but cillian murphy emily blunt bob downey and matt damon all put in stellar performances    i dont think its an oscar caliber film but the fact that there werent a whole lot of decent films in 2023 itll probably rack em up during awards season    final grade b 
Aug 18 2023,negative,absolutely the worst film ive ever tortured myself to sit through we felt we were on a plane with screaming babies the entire time me and my wife we saw it in 70mm imax in providence and it was beyond unbearably loud over 90db vocals and we were in 2nd to the last row in the center throughout the entire movie id say at least 75 of the scenes are completely out of focus and looked absolutely awful i honestly dont think ive watched a movie that looked this bad on any screen in the last 20 years since when i would use rabbit ears on a tube tv     as for the content of the film the entire first half is random cut scenes of people talking in rooms and that is pretty much about what 85 of the movie actually is a bunch of wasted time in rooms  people like my wife who arent american originally knew nothing about the people she was watching and who was who and frankly it took me the entire movie to get it myself the cinematic scenes that apparently arent cgi were kinda cool but not much better than what many youtubers put up that i watch regularly on my 4k oled screen which looks 10000x better than any and all scenes in this imax movie every single video ive watched this week on youtube looked 100x better at least than this movie and these people use tiny cams and record in 1080p or 4k and upload to compressed youtube also their content is 1000x more watchable than this mundane dreary screaming about nothing boring awful movie there should have been an hour and a half cut from it and an actually cool bomb explosion that didnt have a 9 minute delay from the cloud itself there was maybe 34 okay scenes in the entire movie to me all new movies are just absolutely awful i guess   overall this movie is the biggest waste of time ive ever had for such a monetary investment we drove over an hour to this theater thinking this would be a cool experience and were leaving bored out of our minds with tinnitus ringing in our ears and actually shocked at how bad this movie was and how truly awful it looked ive actually never seen a movie that looked even 14 as bad at any theater in my life and this is supposed to be imax i saw venom in fake imax 3d in varna bulgaria years back and even that looked 3x better than this absolute garbage pile of a movie     when i found out the same director made man of steel it made sense that also is one of the most memorably boring movies ive ever tortured myself with     i now know to never trust the critics as this was absolutely abysmal on a 10 scale i give the contents of the film a 110 and the cinematics a 0710 and the focus a 000000000000000110    i truly cant think of any movie that was this bad ever     and the experience at the theater abysmal absolutely do not torture your worst enemy with this atrocity
Aug 18 2023,positive,could not hear the dialog clearly a bit too much drama with sound effects and volume
Aug 18 2023,positive,with an all star cast practical effects and storytelling makes oppenheimer a must see for movie goers
Aug 18 2023,positive,it was a good movie and for being as long as it is i still feel like they sped over a lot of what was goin on at the time
Aug 18 2023,positive,this type of film has never really been for me but man it had a lot sure not everything made perfect sense to me but i was glad to learn more about the manhattan project and they did it perfectly
Aug 18 2023,positive,great movie based on true life story of oppenheimer  acting was excellent
Aug 18 2023,positive,wow it has a few minutes since a finished this movie and i am stil trying to digest every emocion pain melancholy and rage that this movie bring to me its with no doubt the best movie of the year and i say more oppenheimer is the movie of the decade nolan delivered the best work of his carrer the script is memorazing painful wonderful and tragic     cillian murphy is incredible emily blunt is a strong trusting in her decisions and at the same time wek for the family and brutal with all the situation around her very strong acting florence pug shines but not too much    robert downey jr delivered the best action of his carrer it has so much to say about this movie but overall is this oppenheimer is just not the best movie of the year but he is of the decade
Aug 18 2023,positive,good movie but had a bit too much nudity in my opinion the cast done a great job and the script was well written
Aug 18 2023,negative,good acting but movie was way too long and plot moved along slowly and hard to follow at times  would not recommend to others
Aug 18 2023,positive,oppie was a singularly brilliant man the movie glossed over many of his achievmentsterrible directing guidence on the hearing which was  historically dismissed anyway    the reason for 3 stars was the terrible worthless soundtrack it mucked up the dialog people near us asked what  all evening  apparently the director thought the story couldnt hold its own so he added irrelevant sounds it didnt rise to the level of music for what purpose    cilian murphy r downey clark blunt and the rest of the accomplished cast of actors shined   danofbend
Aug 18 2023,positive,i think this film is a masterpiece it captures perfectly the moral and ethical quandaries of designing and building these terrifying weapons cillian murphy robert downey jr emily blunt and several others deliver oscar worthy performances seeing it in imax improves the experience
Aug 18 2023,positive,the movie was very well done  it portrayed the characters and the story very accurately and well  interesting and fast movinb
Aug 18 2023,positive,very thoughtprovoking and detailed every second of the film was done very well kept my attention throughout the movie
Aug 18 2023,negative,a political film like every film nowadays playing out republicans as caricatures little to do with the making of atomic bomb
Aug 18 2023,positive,brilliant acting and directing fantastic sound design that was enhanced by being played on great theatre sound system  there was a problem with the 70mm screen sadly that showed spotted lines in the middle upper fifth of the screen  however the storytelling was first rate
Aug 18 2023,positive,i liked the story line  the characters were terrific
Aug 18 2023,positive,loved the actor but to much talking for an entire 3 hours the reality of a nuclear war is present from the 1 st hour
Aug 18 2023,positive,personal preference on this rating great acting focused story kept my attention     appreciated and understood the need for flashbacks but for me there were too many and they were nested at that      there were nudesex scenes that i think were meant to show depth or lack thereof of emotion to me they were extraneous the story would have had the same impact on me without them    the music seemed overdone and overburdensome i think it was intended to build suspense and anxiety and to underscore the raw significance and turmoil of ethics vs morality vs fear vs despair etc but many times i could not hear the words for all the loudness  for me i would have preferred a quieter score of dread with lots of discord and stretched tones    due to so many flashbacks and instances of inner turmoil the movie while covering all the key points and not belaboring them seemed choppy      i would have given the movie a 4 or maybe even a 5 if it had taken a form closer to a documentary  the serious nature of the topic and what was happening to people followed by graphic examples of the effects of radiation poisoning and the unsettled nature of it all was enough drama to get the point across  many times over
Aug 18 2023,positive,amazing story personal life and sacrifice and   persecution and eternal implications are incredible interesting and sad life and entrails of destruction     i knew parts of the story but this makes me want to research more    if this doesnt make all the awards something is seriously wrong
Aug 18 2023,positive,in my opinion the movie captured the essence of the oppenheimer situation and the political intrigue behind it all as well as the duplicitous nature of the human political animal  the science elements  ie quantum mechanics were an interesting adaptation for the nonscientific literate mind  if a viewer wishes a historical context for experiencing the film may i recommend that a viewer readscan  and    in a word outstanding
Aug 18 2023,positive,only complaint was how loud it was in theaters but i dont do well with loud noises otherwise it was one of the best movies ive ever seen
Aug 17 2023,positive,oppenheimer is a masterpiece it feels like all of christopher nolans work beginning with memento has laid down the path to this film it is a movie directed by an auteur who has experimented with narrative form and visual metaphor to the point that he has become a profound and relevant storyteller
Aug 17 2023,positive,rarely does a movie live up to the hype but this one does christopher nolan is an amazing film maker and cillian murphy delivers a captivating performance
Aug 17 2023,positive,a  l o n g movie but historically accurate from what i have read and very interesting an emotionally draining production that left me with disgust more than normal for people in position of political power who abuse it a socially story what a huge impact
Aug 17 2023,positive,did you know that during the trinity test christopher nolan actually set a bomb off it was not cgi it was a real bomb anyways great movie
Aug 17 2023,positive,oppenheimer was a great movie history made interesting outstanding acting directing and story
Aug 17 2023,positive,historically accurate with wide coverage and  great acting
Aug 17 2023,negative,could have been a great movie it jus dragged on and on
Aug 17 2023,positive,factual great acting
Aug 17 2023,positive,the start of the movie jumps around a lot i prefer movies that take a story on a straight line acting was good so didnt seem like 3 hours
Aug 17 2023,positive,have to agree its one of the most important films in recent history
Aug 17 2023,positive,captivated from start to finish  so well told in this epic movie  couldnt fault it
Aug 17 2023,positive,amazing believable acting
Aug 17 2023,positive,more like a documentary of oppenheimers life but in an entertaining way
Aug 17 2023,negative,yep the most boring and most inaccurate movie in the history
Aug 17 2023,positive,on august 6 1945 a strange object fell from a height of 10000 meters onto the territory of hiroshima a city in japan a flash illuminated the sky followed by a gigantic mushroomshaped smoke rising on the horizon meanwhile raindrops began to fall  a dark rain within a matter of hours 70000 people were killed oppenheimer directed by the acclaimed christopher nolan is a film that aims to tell the story of the deadliest and most dangerous weapon ever created in the history of humanity or at least thats what i thought it turns out it goes beyond that the movie presents a dilemma a conflict of ideas as we are dealing with a weapon of mass destruction    the explosion scene crafted practically without cgi is ingenious and the sound direction amplifies a scene that is already stunning in its own right     i believe the film might become a bit tedious in the final minutes for some people even though i remained focused and entertained throughout this 3hour imax experience
Aug 17 2023,positive,overall the film is good but less than expected from the story and the director i dont see any reason to narrate the events in a quick way or to present them without a commitment to the timeline leaving the viewer unfollowed to merge enjoy as wanted    imagine this story being told by scorsese for example imagined  this is what i mean
Aug 17 2023,negative,the special effects are sort of worth it but they interrupt the story at the weirdest times tons of great actors very little indepth character development very confusing explication of plot if you want to see oppy having fullon incredibly gratuitous sex sitting in a chair during his official interrogation to take away his top security clearance then youll love this movie the top ratings here on inexplicable
Aug 17 2023,positive,i enjoyed it interesting and the time passed quickly
Aug 17 2023,positive,amazing movie and experience
Aug 17 2023,positive,the best movie ive ever seen and very realistic and relevant
Aug 17 2023,positive,a masterpiece for those who understand the historical context of the film even with its threehour runtime it has a quick pace introducing characters and themes making it a little dense at times the script and storytelling are brilliant and engaging nolans ability to turn a biopic into a deeply emotional cinematic experience shows why he is one of the best there were moments when my heart was pounding and i even had goosebumps the cast is one of the most ambitious aspects of the project even secondary characters were played by recognized actors everyone delivers excellent performances and i can already see robert downey jr winning an oscar for supporting actor visual and sound effects are captivating and immersive even more so when you know the film does not have a single cgi shot on top of all ludwig g√∂ranssons soundtrack shows why he can be at the same level as zimmer if he didnt already convince you with tenet overall an extraordinary experience in which you can feel how passionate were the people involved in the making of the film every aspect of it shines and blends remarkably to result in an emotional journey and i am sure it will have a lot of rewatch value as is usual with nolan
Aug 17 2023,positive,i watched this movie and it was very wonderful and i recommend watching it to everyone  it was a really nice experience
Aug 17 2023,positive,wonderful time enjoying watching it

Aug 17 2023,negative,worst movie ive seen in a long time the only good thing i can say about it is that it finally did end 
Aug 17 2023,positive,very good  would have liked a little more info on each scientist in the movie as i was not familiar with all by name
Aug 17 2023,positive,it was a great biopic i learned a lot about the struggles and challenges the scientists faced while developing the atomic bomb and it did a great job of showing oppenheimers personal quarrels with creating and dropping such a powerful weapon it did feel a little too long at times but overall i enjoyed it
Aug 17 2023,positive,one of the greatest movies of 2023 masterpiece work of nolan
Aug 17 2023,positive,oppenheimer is the best historical movie ive seen with great actor great performance solid scriptwriter and explain the whole thing with easy understanding    i love see movie with incredible smart people makes me entertained    last thing the nuke bomb was real and christopher nolan did amazing work
Aug 17 2023,positive,brilliant storytelling editing cinematography and acting a very detailed patchwork i wonder if it had to be that long though
Aug 17 2023,positive,never have i felt too short sitting down for 3 hours watching a movie
Aug 17 2023,positive,a fun and beautiful movie that takes you to another place
Aug 17 2023,positive,acting was great the story line was so good and informative
Aug 17 2023,negative,movie felt like a 3 hour preview save it for home viewing  i purchased a 70mm viewing ticket but was neither 70mm nor imax
Aug 17 2023,positive,i recommend you to watch an interesting and wonderful movie
Aug 17 2023,positive,great acting by cillian murphy the story is quite simple but told in a breathtaking manner visuals and sound desing   astonishing
Aug 17 2023,positive,waaauuuu very very goood film really
Aug 17 2023,positive,i found this three hour film devouring from making the decision to make the worlds worst weapon to change the course of history to all the politics and the battle it took place beautiful and just one of the best films i have ever seen
Aug 17 2023,negative,the storyline for this movie was great two hours wouldve been a perfect length with equal time being devoted to the development of the bomb along with the psychological impact on those involved in creating it while also touching on oppenheimers security clearance and his ties to the communist party however three hours long with 2 12 hours dedicated to oppenheimers security clearance was ridiculous which explains why the theater was 98 empty shouldve listened to the wife and seen sound of freedom
Aug 17 2023,positive,a remarkable achievement a compelling narrative with brilliant cinematography and a superlative ensemble cast   the nudity was gratuitous and added nothing to the understanding of the characters  their relationships
Aug 17 2023,positive,acting awesome  well told story
Aug 17 2023,positive,fabulous story excellent acting brilliant direction and story presentation  fantastic
Aug 17 2023,positive,it was good but three hours felt very long some of it was very loud and almost hurt your ears
Aug 17 2023,negative,terrible movie way too long  no substance
Aug 17 2023,positive,contents actores cinematography everything
Aug 17 2023,positive,simply a wonderful film every tension perfectly built every moment of silence perfectly allocated  very good performances and about the chronology of the film in my opinion it added a lot i will see it again
Aug 17 2023,positive,amazing motion picture great performances
Aug 17 2023,positive,wonderful description of a complex man and the relationship scientists have with government
Aug 17 2023,positive,amazing film very glad i saw at the cinema
Aug 17 2023,positive,oppenheimer is one of the greatest cinematic achievements in a generation perfectly casted brilliantly acted and directed with titular characterlevel genius the devices used to tell the story the way it was told was sharp and unique it was like if oliver stone and ron howard had the same fever dream and put it on film its a film almost as powerful as the bomb itself i was blown away
Aug 17 2023,negative,a destroyer of ears and a complete bore to the mind my wife and i almost fell asleep 3 times
Aug 17 2023,positive,hands down the best biopic of all time this movie is so interesting and worth 10 watches in theaters
Aug 17 2023,positive,interesting insight into the life of a brilliant scientist struggling with the ethical aspects of scientific discoveries
Aug 17 2023,negative,gosh what a giant deception i wonder why nolan the director didnt make it a 5 hour epic so he could have even shown how often oppenheimer ate cereal during his childhood and how often he crapped his diapers when he was a baby crap is pretty much the only word that properly describes this film i wont even call it a movie as nolan must have been a teacher in his former life and it was rather an endless endless endless history lesson i could have just as well watched the history channel in fact i have seen movies and documentaries about oppie and the bomb before but none was so lame and idiotic with this one surely including the worst directing job of them all how else do you explain that a flashback in black and white which is often used to show the oldest parts of the story here shows mostly the most recent events what a moronic idea and why use any bw at all the whole idea of making oppenheimer the victim of this history is also quite absurd as they all knew what they were building and why invite so many famous actors who only appear for 2030 seconds only to improve the title credits the directors notorious jumps between timelines gets soon extremely annoying and after only 50 minutes i started checking the time again and again hoping for this bullshit to end i rather watch barbie again even 10 times  than 1 single minute of oppencrapper again 210 points and that 2 only for the good makeup artist
Aug 17 2023,positive,excellent character study each person was multi faceted also had elements of a mystery with a villain that hid his evil internet very well acting was top notch and filming absolutely exquisite will be one of my top 10 movies
Aug 17 2023,neutral,a long and drawn out movie with oppenheimer chain smoking the whole 3 hours i appreciate the history and there were some intersting moments but it just seemed so flat and long
Aug 17 2023,positive,the first half felt boringbut after one particular scene it gets extremely goodand the ending will leave you with alot to think about
Aug 17 2023,positive,oscar worthy for sure
Aug 16 2023,positive,excellent movie especially because of the princeton einstein appearances  i learned a lot
Aug 16 2023,negative,what a colossal disaster      unable to decide what facet of oppenheimers life to use as a dramatic fulcrum to keep us engaged for 3 hours nolan jams as many bits and pieces of relevant and irrelevant material as he can hoping we will hang in there to finally get it     but sadly there is nothing to get  as the army general in charge of the manhattan project matt damon sums up this absolute train wreck in his very first scene telling oppenheimer to his face that he is a womanizer arrogant a diletante and more      in other words not a very likeable character despite his acknowledged brilliancewhich we never actually get to see but constantly hear about in case we forget     the dialogue is so pedestrian so telegraphed to be sure we do get it that fatigue sets in almost immediately      the all star cast tries its best to keep this dreadful film alive but cant and the star himself is left to carry the film using facial expressions to convey every emotion that the film lacks     when we see him being hounded by mccarthyites he literally just sits there looking pained or speaking so quietly even his drunken wife tells him to grow a spine      oppenheimers fatal flaw is that it takes itself so seriously its hard not to believe all the hype that it really is    even the much anticipated explosion scene is a dud compared to the pyrotechnics of similar blockbuster films      to make up for such a stunning lack of visceral emotion we are talked to death about the radioactivity and numbers of people who died ad nauseum    the agony of oppenheimer and others who felt they had unleashed doomsday and wanted to put it back in the bottle comes across as antiseptic hand wringing     nothing really actually changes in oppenheimer we all know what happens before the movie starts and instead of showing us as film should how characters do change nobody really does     we are left with very little more than we began  the whole three hours was like a low budget documentary a pastiche not a drama or even a movie     what happened to all these people do we care  i kept thinking if only nolan had seen apocalypse now dr strangelove or even argo maybe he would have realized you cant  create tension drama passion horror unless you show it      and thats why as a film oppenheimer is such a total failure        lurching from one decade to another with no real connective plot even the actual a bomb explosion is underwhelming    oppenheimer eventually becomes so incoherent its as if nolan forgot what movie he was making
Aug 16 2023,positive,hubby and i are both retired federal employees and lived in new mexico he was an engineer and had to go to los alamos often he even met mr teller  we found the movie to be somewhat accurate but was entirely too long we do recommend folks go to see it if just to learn a bit of history
Aug 16 2023,positive,oppenheimer its a great film cillian murphy did a great job as the protagonist in this production i was thrilled to see that even with oppeheimer making the bomb he was still accused by his country christopher nolan almost made a masterpiece for me it was the third best movie i saw this year in the theathers
Aug 16 2023,negative,harkins theaters is full of lies and fraud
Aug 16 2023,positive,loved it all  storyline actors acting script effects settingobviously filmed segments on location  thanks for recognizing  honoring new mexico 
Aug 16 2023,positive,oppenheimer stands as a pivotal and significant biopic the pinnacle of the genre to date the film navigates the complex life of its titular character with gravitas offering a timely exploration of historical relevance while the second act displays nolans prowess theres a sense that he could have pushed further unfortunately the scientific mystique and tension that permeated earlier segments dissipate in the final act leaving a slight feeling of detachment cillian murphys exceptional portrayal leaves audiences in awe adding a layer of brilliance to the film
Aug 16 2023,positive,it has been two weeks since the movie and it still lingers in the front of my mind the cinematography was outstanding the audio and compositions were soul touching and the story was compelling ive never once before felt such a strong need to share with others the beauty of a film before oppenheimer
Aug 16 2023,positive,good but not as great as i expected way too long trying to tell too many stories imo however amazed at robert downey jr wasnt certain it was him best performance in the movie 
Aug 16 2023,positive,now i am become deaf the destroyer of ears
Aug 16 2023,positive,when it comes to nolan for me is a legend  his movies are masterpieces
Aug 16 2023,positive,one of the best movies ive seen it did explain parts of ww2 history i would recommend watching it again
Aug 16 2023,negative,music  sound drowned out the diallog unable to make sense of the sequence a lot of the symbolism totally incomprehensible
Aug 16 2023,positive,obsoletely fantastic
Aug 16 2023,neutral,mumble mumble mumble underwhelming  great outfits music and sound effect per usual  this was not inception or interstellar
Aug 16 2023,positive,i would have liked to see a less political story like line 70mm imax should be the future of cinema seeing the movie in that format will entice me to make the hour drive to see more films in that format in that venue
Aug 16 2023,negative,walked out an hour before ended and was angry at myself for not walking out soonereven agreeing to it in the first place smh one of the worst movies ive ever seen and ive seen almost all of them i honestly dont know what all the hype was about maybe because there are so many well known celebrities in it absolutely loved cillian murphy in peaky blinders matt damon in talented mr ripleygood will hunting robert downey jr in chaplin in sherlock holmes and rami malek in bohemian rhapsodymr robot i think the producers just thought putting these big names in the movie would make it a hit but there was no story the story is what drives the movie for me the most and this movie was like being literally in a board meeting the entire time no emotion no real conflict the worst ugh i get mad just thinking about how i wasted my time and money when i have so little free time to indulge in theatre trips they say live without regrets well i have regret for watching it  anyway i hardly ever do reviews but this was the worst 
Aug 16 2023,positive,loved the historical information the movie followed and the acting was really great
Aug 16 2023,positive,very good acting and compelling just way too long
Aug 16 2023,positive,brilliant yes awesome casting superb acting the best special effects nolanelectric script and directing topnotch of course this nextlevel movie is a mustsee on the big screen only highest recommendation
Aug 16 2023,neutral,it was way too long i do not understand the need for 3 hour movies and now theres no intermission it would have been a good 2 hour movie if they left out the communist story and romantic side there needed to be more focus on the main story of the atomic bomb which is what it was marketed as they could have focused more on the debate on dropping the bomb i was in hiroshima once and went to the museum where i discovered how american propaganda made the victims appear as collateral damage that it was like an experiment to see the impact this would have  instead of the communist story a more powerful duel story or end would be to focus on japanese side in build up to the dropping of the bomb show normal people going about their daily business before it was dropped   i think with lot of nolan movies i never get a connection with the characters very stanley kubrick very stylish but cold
Aug 16 2023,positive,this is cinema absolutely fantastic film although long it is definitely worth seeing and kept me engaged throughout performances extraordinary and gorgeous cinematography definitely still thinking about it and cant wait to go again one of nolans best
Aug 16 2023,negative,not a clear story telling
Aug 16 2023,positive,nolan you continue to prove to me that you are not the greatest director of the generation    dont get me wrong there are fantastic moments and scenes but thats all they were moments    the fast pacing and outofchronologicalorder does the opposite of building tension and anxiety instead it just makes the film a 3 hour montage of facts and feel disingenuous     this should not really have been a feature film but instead a 5 hour mini series
Aug 16 2023,positive,brilliant movie  exceptional casting  absolutely engaging for the full three hours
Aug 16 2023,positive,the subject matter was fascinating performances were stellar all around especially scillian murphy and robert downey jr i can see many acadamy award nominations coming for this film it deserves them
Aug 16 2023,positive,great moviegot a little lost with whos who in the last 30 min
Aug 16 2023,positive,its the kind of movie that you need to see one time in your life but it wasnt that much good as i thought still a good movie but mehhh you watch it one time and its enough clearly not a must see
Aug 16 2023,positive,very good movie  however it is three hours long and most people in the audience seemed to be a bit restless toward the end  the beginning was a little hard to follow but all in all a very good movie  my husband  and brother went with me and we are all looking up robert oppenheimer
Aug 16 2023,positive,brilliant filmmaking i am reading the book and the film told a complex story so ably
Aug 16 2023,positive,great story about one of the most consequential decisions of all time
Aug 16 2023,positive,the acting dramatic and visual effects was excellent  see it in an imax theater
Aug 16 2023,positive,a movie experience you truly wouldnt have gotten unless sitting in front of the big screen absolutely stunning and the whole cast gave oscar winning acting glad the movie stick to its title being truly about oppenheimer before during and after the manhattan project
Aug 16 2023,positive,saw this twice much better than barbie the acting is phenomenal this is one of chris nolans best movies and cillian murphy deserves an award
Aug 16 2023,positive,it was very interesting to see what went on behind the scenes when building the atomic bomb  its a bit slow at times and a bit too long but definitely worth seeing
Aug 16 2023,positive,important movie and one of the best have seen in a long time
Aug 16 2023,positive,superb film directing impressive acting for title character strauss  pash innovative music
Aug 16 2023,positive,truly an imax experience for the ages deafening audio whenever it mattered and outstanding visuals
Aug 16 2023,positive,excellent acting and storytelling compelling all the way through  makes me want to learn more
Aug 16 2023,negative,the history and acting was good but all the dramatic visual and sound affects stunk really bought down the story
Aug 16 2023,positive,tremendous film film making at its best loved the color bw mix the critics are writing clickbate it moves fast and intense so worth a second watch
Aug 16 2023,positive,a bit slow and confusing at the first 12 but very good for the second 12 enjoyed it
Aug 16 2023,positive,not what i was expecting it to be after following the hype and the advertising campaign the movie is very slow paced and dialogue heavy which is fine but i feel like they sold it as more of an action heavy film im surprised at how underwhelming the atomic bomb visuals end up being and was expecting to see more of the aftermath and use of these bombs considering the subject matter but the film is more focused on personal and character drama which again i like that kind of stuff but its not what i was sold
Aug 16 2023,positive,the historical accuracy seemed accurate
Aug 16 2023,positive,great film  now we need a movie about the life of richard feynman starting with his time with the manhattan project  there is a movie about his early love life but there is so much more to tell of this bongoplaying genius he is in the movie a couple times playing his bongo drums and sitting in his car at the bomb test he felt the windshield would protect his eyes he was the only human that day to see the bomb detonate without wearing goggles if you dont know him look him up you wont be disappointed
Aug 16 2023,positive,one of the best historical look into the rise climax and fall of the father of the atomic bomb as well as not just suggesting but saying we gave the power to destroy ourselves
Aug 15 2023,positive,overlong  got better as it went along absolutely overbearing music score  difficult to hear much of the dialogue performances were quite good     overall refreshing release among the usual summer popcorn fare
Aug 15 2023,positive,the movie is long and i dont know how it could have been edited to be shorter  there is a lot of technical information at the beginning that makes it a bit overwhelming but the last hour moves and makes it worth the time investment
Aug 15 2023,negative,it was too long and jump around too much
Aug 15 2023,positive,excellent movie going to see it again
Aug 15 2023,positive,i enjoyed the movie i dont think it would be interesting  to young people very good cast
Aug 15 2023,positive,the story is fascinating and the acting top notch  especially cillian murphy emily blunt and robert downey jr     three hours went fast and the moral dilemma oppenheimer experienced really resonated    definitely worth seeing
Aug 15 2023,positive,excellent well written well acted and very informative on an important period of history
Aug 15 2023,positive,i felt it gave me an important history lesson while keeping my interest in the story  it showed a part of our history that i didnt know and would not have looked up to learn on my own
Aug 15 2023,negative,the trailer is very misleading and would have you thinking the movie was about building the atomic bomb yes this was a part of the movie but there was far more to it the first hour was slow and boring while laying the foundation to oppenheimers political views and past the final hour was spent on lewis strauss personal vendetta towards oppenheimer similar to the beginning of the movie it was intriguing but slow and boring all in all it was not what i was hoping for the plot regarding the abomb was interesting the rest felt like it should have been another movie lastly the way the movie bounced from various times places and plotlines was complicated leaving me bored and exhausted if i had seen it on netflix i would have stopped watching and found another movie
Aug 15 2023,positive,too long  poor editing
Aug 15 2023,positive,the best movie ive ever seen
Aug 15 2023,negative,i found it very difficult to understand the dialog and therefore missed much of the story  disappointed  not sure if it was sound system in theater since reviews were so good
Aug 15 2023,positive,too long and too boring  too technical
Aug 15 2023,positive,outstanding tour de force from nolan murphy oppenheimers has to be seen to be believed
Aug 15 2023,positive,the beginning is slow with a lot of physics talk and trying to keep scientists names straight but it ends strong researched the story and it said movie is pretty accurate i like that
Aug 15 2023,positive,an amazing movie  absolutely fantastic cinematography acting music selection 1010 movie
Aug 15 2023,positive,fascinating look at a crucial series of events that brought the end of the world within reach which is where we still are excellent writing and acting
Aug 15 2023,negative,awful too loud the score is dreadful just endless pulsing oppenheimer was a quiet and subtle man his story was about a moral dilemma this movie is selfimportant to quote the script emily blunt is very good robert downey is interesting  cillian murphy is good
Aug 15 2023,positive,well written story line great actingactors and music
Aug 15 2023,positive,its so good that it should expose hollywood for its crimes against fairness in forcing diversity time pieces get a pass on the ridiculousness that is wokeness
Aug 15 2023,negative,didnt like the film at all boring too much closeup the explosion was like meh i cant hear a thing therere too many plots and dialogue about everything and anything thrown at me that i lose interest one quarter into the film i love christopher nolan so i am giving him two stars just for being a great director but zero star for the film for zero entertainment value
Aug 15 2023,positive,with his latest entry christopher nolan proves once again that hes one of the best directors of our generation oppenheimer is a tome at three hours but it doesnt feel like it whatsoever scenes jump frantically practically blinking on the screen for 20 or 30 seconds before abruptly moving on to another matter entirely this framework seems perhaps at first to be an introduction to oppenheimers train of thought pingponging back and forth due to his genius as the film progresses two things become clear one that the entirety of the film is sustained by this scene jumping anxiety and two there are multiple timelines involved when each timeline is happening isnt immediately clear but becomes much clearer as the film progresses its through the combination of these storytelling devices that nolan springs his trap as viewers are enrapt by what is essentially a threehour talkfest but its through the excellent dialogue and the acting prowess of alisters giving some career best performances that nolan communicates these dense scienceheavy and at least on paper frankly boring ideas regarding the creation of the atomic bomb impressive cinematography aside its the acting by greats like cillian murphy matt damon emily blunt and robert downey jr that makes the whole thing truly land with damon and downey jr giving performances that will easily be oscarnominated damon plays leslie groves the united states army corps of engineers officer who not only regulated clearances for the manhattan project but also oversaw the construction of the pentagon in washington damons take on the man is somewhere on the frenemy spectrum for oppenheimer both an obstacle to the doctors acceptance in the project and an unlikely ally behind the scenes downey jr plays lewis strauss an american businessman banker and member of the atomic energy commission strauss ends up being an intriguing character because his motivations unfold as the film does overall its a challenging film both in content and in pacing but by the films conclusion those who have been attending will understand how all the pieces fit together
Aug 15 2023,positive,overall bad experience theater is overrated with a small screen that is not worth the title imax and the seats were old film had visible scratches throughout the whole movie and the sound was unnecessarily too loud overpowering the dialogues the film did not belong in imax  nothing special about it the story was good and insightful but not nolans best film
Aug 15 2023,positive,most people know about oppenheimers achievements but little about the man  this biography gave insight into the man behind the science and humanized him  his relationships his politics his family have been all but unknown quantities until this film  my only complaint is the overuse of closeups  i really liked this film as a completion of a portrait of an icon of ww2 and the cold war  he is every bit a brilliant man warts and all
Aug 15 2023,positive,an absolutely brilliant movie very well crafted for the people passionate about cinema and history i was transported to the wwii era i am not giving full 5 stars just because at some point at the end the story gets messed up and a little bit boring but that gets fixed quickly
Aug 15 2023,negative,i was surprised by how underwhelming this movie was    i didnt learn anything about the science underlying the bomb    i didnt learn anything about the political landscape    i didnt feel any emotional attachment to the characters     its a lot of detailed interpersonal titfortat grievances but in a way that didnt tell me anything more broadly about that time in history or even life more generally     there are so many ways this movie could have been good and it just wasnt
Aug 15 2023,positive,absolutely amazing christopher nolans movies are masters pieces of visual effects
Aug 15 2023,positive,perfect   amazing   breathtaking
Aug 15 2023,positive,great movie didnt feel like the sex scenes were necessary  even after reading what the director had to say about them but overall a good experience in the theater
Aug 15 2023,neutral,it was really long and technical
Aug 15 2023,positive,a masterpiece every actor that was in this film gave it a pusha nudge a smile a tap at the exactly right moment robert downey jr had better be getting an oscar for thus level of acting he was magnificent the entire film eas breathtaking and i was just overwhelmed by its artistic style and grandeur  go see it it was just an unbelievable film  plus it had emily blunt in it shes an angel disguised as an actress
Aug 15 2023,positive,outstanding movie acting direction and cinematography were superb should get oscar recognition
Aug 15 2023,positive,i was blown away by this movie  as someone who already knew a lot of his story i was again hit with awe as i saw his life unravel before my eyes but this time not in text but in video  i got in a bit nervous seeing as it is a 3 hour long movie but it seriously felt as if it was only an hour and a half
Aug 15 2023,negative,too long  bad choice for lead actor   poor editing
Aug 15 2023,neutral,soundtrack way too loud in imax dialogue is hard to make out clearly
Aug 15 2023,positive,great movie but not worth the hype at least for me since i dont like biographies
Aug 15 2023,positive,outstanding movie and acting of all actors they could have done it a little bit shorter even so you never get bored
Aug 15 2023,positive,it was played too loud in the theatre
Aug 15 2023,positive,best movie of 2023  i drove 5 hours to see oppenheimer in a 70mm imax theater i was not disappointed
Aug 15 2023,positive,i like any movie that makes me want to look up more information when i get home in this case i wanted to know how the war department narrowed the target cities to hiroshima and nagasaki we know why kyoto was excluded i saw the movie with 3 other people and we all agreed we would have much preferred a straight timeline to the confusing flashbacks and flash forwards also the nudity added nothing to the story except an r rating which was not essential to the plot line those were the only reasons i shorted the movie one star
Aug 15 2023,positive,amazing cast  amazing soundtracks and directing  well done christopher nolan
Aug 15 2023,positive,great movie a little long
Aug 15 2023,positive,best movie of the year must watch
Aug 15 2023,positive,easily a candidate for film of the year fantastic acting from everyone especially cillian murphy must watch
Aug 15 2023,negative,it was too long and so many short scenes of grandiose conversations but it didnt feel cohesive to me  the constant music backtrack was distracting too and made it hard for me to hear the dialog sometimes
Aug 15 2023,positive,i dont watch a lot of movies i normally think they arent as thought provoking as books this movie was great though i personally dont like the narrative style it chose similar to the book it it goes back and forth between two points in time which although i get a new narrative style but it feels confusing at times it didnt have that problem because the book was so long and the points in each point in time were sometimes hundreds of pages long but oppenheimer was long too long movies are different than long books long books you look silly carrying around that big book long movies your foot falls asleep and your eyes get tired it takes away from the experience not really enhances it youll remember getting antsy at the 2 hour mark googling how long is oppenheimer not how much the story captivated you the end really took me though they couldve put anything on screen after oppenheimer said he thought they did in seconds i was thinking of what it meant for the human race to know something and when if we ever could know everything moments before had me thinking about how the age of science this movie described really came to be i thought of the novel frankenstein book is quite different they hit on the same themes but book is more about the scientific revolution and where the limit is on it and the fear of creating a godless creature good movie not perfect but nothing is best movie i have ever seen but a grain of salt is needed because of the beginning sentence just because i dont like many movies doesnt mean i have a better taste
Aug 15 2023,positive,this movie was one of the best movies i have ever seen i had chills when i left the theater this is christopher nolans best work yet its hard to think a 3 hour movie can manage to keep me hooked on all aspects but this did and the ending was absolutely perfect and terrifying i rarely go to theaters in imax but i decided to on this and it sent chills down my spine its an absolutely must see for a movie goer just wow
Aug 15 2023,positive,very well done depth of characters and story reall compelling
Aug 15 2023,positive,fascinating unlike his other blockbusters the biopic cant rely on the fantastical mind blowing elements of nolans timebending ideas and mystery  and yet surprisingly it works all the same while it leans into his typical forte of multiple story angles and stunning audiovisual escapism the dive into oppenheimers and his fellow scientists and project members mind is harrowing and leaves audiences humbled by the moral questions left behind brilliantly portrayed roles and well mapped out storytelling add a lot to make the three hour long running time a theater visit to remember one of the most intriguing movies ive seen for a long time
Aug 15 2023,positive,oppenheimer is undoubtedly the best movie of 2023 christopher nolan puts any doubt to rest that he wouldnt be capable of capturing a story of this magnitude cillian murphy gives an iconic performance that intensifies each moment rolling along this breakneck biopic of j robert oppenheimer    full review 
Aug 15 2023,positive,could possible be the best movie of the decade this movie is extremely powerful and moving in multiple ways
Aug 15 2023,positive,absolutely loved it great cinematography and all around story telling
Aug 15 2023,positive,my top 3 nolan movie of all time for sure one of the movies that i would watch every week for the rest of mt life the photography is amazing the soundtrack the cast the storyboard it is three hours of a wonderful work of art
Aug 15 2023,positive,imax 70mm experience was good even though i was on right hand side of 4th row
Aug 15 2023,positive,i liked how it told the story in a historically correct manner
Aug 15 2023,negative,confusing storytelling audio was largely unintelligible
Aug 15 2023,positive,well executed storyline filled with contrasts between the celebration and terror of scientific advancement a director with the power to unlock the key of world destruction but the inability to create a stable isotope of a family life for his kids and wife and the theme that its not always about you i found it beautiful and scary at the same time and left me very interested to learn more about the various scientists the actual testing during the project and the long term effects on los alamos the acting was downright nuclear with its powerful cast and i walked in feeling worried id be looking at my watch but the entire time i was locked in due to their acting the cinematography and the overall effect excellent way to spend 3 hours only downfall was the unnecessary 25 minutes of previews that insulted the movies worth beforehand
Aug 15 2023,positive,brilliant historical account of the development of the atomic bomb and its importance in ending ww2 this was intricately interwoven with the life experiences personal life love and challenges of oppenheimer himself fantastic some say 3h was too long i was riveted to the screen for the entire time
Aug 15 2023,positive,the nudity seemed unnecessary but otherwise it was a great movie
Aug 15 2023,positive,beautifully scripted and filmed with huge performances
Aug 15 2023,positive,the most powerful and sobering movie ive seen in decades nolan usually doesnt know when to end a movie but the 3 hours were riveting kudos to jennifer lame editor and randy torres and the sound design team  see it but dont go alone bring someone you care about
Aug 15 2023,positive,this is one of the best movies i have seen in awhile see it in imax if u can the sound effects and images are amazing this is one of the few movies that has real substance educational value and addresses critical issues while still maintaining a middle ground and not offending half the nation  all at the same time it was entertaining and thrilling saw it twice already 
Aug 15 2023,positive,a great introspective of politics vs science learned a lot about oppenheimer the man  i am glad they did not dwell on the bomb itself
Aug 15 2023,positive,great acting editing  really felt the emotions of the moments  maybe a bit long but dramatic enjoyable powerful
Aug 14 2023,positive,must see do your homework first to learn the politics characters etc  the bombshell is just a small part of the movie
Aug 14 2023,positive,lots of information very intense  its worth seeing twice
Aug 14 2023,positive,cillian murphy brings the kenergy and does more than kenough
Aug 14 2023,positive,the movie was incredible at drawing out the characters and highlighting the impact that oppenheimer left on the world
Aug 14 2023,positive,interesting story of the man behind a historical event it was a bit confusing with the focus shifting to his nemesis in the govt and personal life couldve trimmed at least 30 min off and still been complete
Aug 14 2023,positive,it was good it was interesting and it was too long
Aug 14 2023,negative,too long and too confusing
Aug 14 2023,positive,oscar nominations all over the place for this one robert downey jr shines
Aug 14 2023,positive,oppenheimer is the greatest film i have ever seen this movie has exceeded my expectations and no movie i will watch in the future will live up to my expectations this is the first film that is truly life changing and just beautiful all around there was never a dull moment never a single frame where i was even remotely uninterested in many of our lifetimes will there never be a movie quite like this
Aug 14 2023,positive,this movie was mindblowingly amazing i cant believe so many people are saying that it is a boring or dumb movie i almost burst into tears so many times throughout the actors did absolutely amazing in their roles id watch this movie over and over again if i could simply to relive every moment 1010 couldnt have been more perfect if you think this movie sucks you have horrible taste in movies and your opinion is irrelevant
Aug 14 2023,positive,well paced great cast if not a little bit dark
Aug 14 2023,positive,no explanation needed
Aug 14 2023,positive,an excellent movie  great history promblem though the sound track was muffled at times  could not discern all the people as the soundtrack made it hard to hear some conversations i thought it was just me but have since been told by others that they also had the same problem  i will have to read the book to fill in the information  would have preferred not to have nudity  it was not necessary distaseful
Aug 14 2023,positive,never a dull moment gets you to thinking about this time period
Aug 14 2023,negative,not a nolan movie as i was expecting the movie is too long and the narrative much short but hard to understand the timeline
Aug 14 2023,negative,disappointing the repeated nude scenes between oppenheimer and his lover were tossed in like required punctuation some as fantasies in public pretty much interrupted what should have been a taut story that already had points of interest far above common nude and sex scenes of course conservatives were the enemy communists and socialists the heroes go figure the fantasy sequences became redundant and ridiculous a sham tactic of having very low sounds quiet moments kept being smashed into by ridiculously loud music and sound effects to intentionally startle the audience all it did was make me want a refund 15 stars only for some of the supporting cast
Aug 14 2023,positive,oppenheimer is a incredible film that talks about the world war ii and the construction of atomic bomb the sound track is nice the characters are very good and the plot is interesting
Aug 14 2023,positive,part of the problem with this movie was the bad audio in the theater where i saw it in imax it was surprisingly difficult to understand dialogue not usually a problem for me i think because the music and other sounds just overwhelmed it  otherwise i was disappointed in the movie although it wasnt bad the last third went very slowly seemed unnecessary and too long  framing the whole thing as oppenheimers story rather than the story of the atom bomb was part of the problem it was hard to care much about whether hed get his security clearance or not when there are so many bigger issues to care about
Aug 14 2023,positive,this movie was so inspirational telling the story of an american hero that prior to this film had a story that was unknown to the american citizen  cillian murphy is a tour de force
Aug 14 2023,positive,enjoyed the history of the subject i enjoyed watching but the nudity was just gratuitous the movie would have been just as good with or without it
Aug 14 2023,positive,gave true account of the events in his life
Aug 14 2023,positive,definitely one of the best films ive ever seen and definitely a great cinema experience cinematography was beautiful the sound design was on point throughout the whole film cillian murphy deserves an oscar for hes portrayal as oppenheimer you can tell that he really prepared himself for this role and lets not forget robert downey jrs performance as strauss loved every moment he was on the screen and in all honesty the casting for this film was so on point every cast member fit so well into their characters really loved what christopher nolan was able to do with this film and i really look forward to hes next project
Aug 14 2023,positive,for such a long movie it kept my attention  the actors were masterful
Aug 14 2023,positive,the story was so interesting my brother and i factchecked much of it after and it really seemed very try to reality it was such a slice of history to learn the acting from everyone was also outstanding i didnt even realize it was robert downey jr until after the fact     i actually was apprehensive about sitting through a 3hour movieso long but it needed 3 hours to tell the whole story i have recommended this movie to many of my friends  its well worth seeing and very good on the big screen
Aug 14 2023,positive,was a bit fast paced for me to follow the time jumps and the multiple plot lines but it was visually stunning and the soundoh the sound i think robert downey jr has an oscar nomination for sure
Aug 14 2023,positive,chilled to the bone the film demands a substantial investment of the viewers time but proves to be worth every second as it leaves us grappling with the the circumstances surrounding the creation of the atomic bomb and prompts us to consider the future of the weapon in the most dire way the emotional weight of the film is embodied by the mental turmoil cillian murphy depicts in oppenheimer so well
Aug 14 2023,positive,despite a slow first act and many gross historical innacuracies oppenheimer is a startstudded movie that will let you questioning why humanity can be so brilliant and so stupid at the same time all encompassed in a visually spectacular feast brilliant sound and a lingering sense of hope dread and frenzy
Aug 14 2023,negative,really wanted to like it but felt its storyline was choppy and hard to follow  the timeline of events is not clear so itd be better if you already knew the historical background of the making of the abomb  the special effects were okay but seemed a bit gratuitous very slowmoving movie  thought the acting was much better than the production
Aug 14 2023,positive,historical records   how the story was told
Aug 14 2023,positive,great scenario seeing that  what is  happing  with the  trump trials trying to ruin is credibilty
Aug 14 2023,positive,we liked it  we would have liked it better only if it had been shorter  shorter by as much as 30 to 60 minutes
Aug 14 2023,positive,if you like nolan you will like this if you do not you will not great performances stunning design and so so so very long the movie never lets you into the inner life of its characters but that seems very intentional hard to not watch and wish the movie went in a dozen other directions examining what manhattan project did to those who participated in it still a stunning technical achievement
Aug 14 2023,negative,many reasons why oppenheimer disappoints despite all its marketing  ridiculous volume level  too long  indecipherable physics and science  no history of war or why dropping of bomb on japan was deemed necessary  way too much about mccarthyism and panic about communism  no real scenes or aftermath of the bomb dropping  too many characters to keep up with often confused with accents  gratuitous breasts and sex scenes no explanation for final medal that oppenheimer received  acting of course was tremendous
Aug 14 2023,positive,the movie itself was really good however i had purchased my tickets about a week in advance when my father and i arrived at imax we were informed that the 70mm showing wouldnt be shown i think due to projector issues bummer but it happens and we drove almost an hour to see it specifically for that reason then the movie started and the audio was offsync by about a half second they attempted to fix it during the movie which only worked for about 5 minutes before it lost its sync which made it hard to follow who was talking during important scenes at times like i had stated the movie was great which is why im giving 5 stars  the theater unfortunately dropped the ball
Aug 14 2023,positive,i like that it was more about the man then bomb
Aug 14 2023,positive,so many wonderful performances  incredibly interesting and thought provoking  if you cant take long movies you might want to wait and watch at home
Aug 14 2023,positive,the story line and acting was amazing cillian murphy was well suited to the role of oppenheimer and robert downey jr was brilliant as strauss the cast was well appointed but i felt a little bogged down in their dialogues as they mumbled through at times and in others were lost to the overly enthusiastic sound management overall i found this to be an enjoyable film that validates the question of moral responsibilities often overlooked by those whose job it is to safeguard the freedoms and liberties that are frequently taken for granted
Aug 14 2023,positive,i enjoyed this more than i did tenet i still dont rank it with inception the buildup to the trinity test was done well the acting was good but not as mesmerizing as it was hyped to be the music was overly dramatic at times i actually think this new composer doesnt make melodies as strong as zimmer or williams i would like to watch this again because there were so many characters and so many names that i wasnt always quite sure who they were talking about and i hated how florence pugh was used here absolutely hated it jean tatlock was actually a very educated woman with strong political beliefs and nolan thought she was only worth portraying as a piece of meat on our screens it was totally disrespectful to the actress and the character she was portraying
Aug 14 2023,positive,it is long and intense  be prepared for a learning experience  i learned quite a bit  there is a nude scene showing the womans breasts and a sex scene but it is a small part of the movie
Aug 14 2023,positive,very long and lots of dialogue with many characters which at times was hard to follow the plot the north hills movie theater in raleigh was not a good experience long line at concessions dirty bathrooms and poor customer service
Aug 14 2023,positive,easily the best movie of the year i am happy the film not depicting the images of the nuclear bombs in hiroshima and nagasaki that would have changed the narrative and the objective of this those who try to criticize this movie for not depicting the images of real attacks should see this movie some idiots say the film glorifies the bombs in japan absolute nonsense   this is a biopic about the scientist it captures everything from the point of view of dr oppenheimer this is brilliant film making i really hope this film get what it deserves in terms of praise and accolades hollywood needs movies like this    fantastic movie 55
Aug 14 2023,positive,christopher nolans newest film is jarring and memorable an ode to creation and consequence
Aug 14 2023,positive,its great movie and i wish we see more sessions
Aug 14 2023,positive,it was a great movie but not what i expected
Aug 14 2023,negative,had to fight sleep the relentless score permanently at crescendo to the sacrifice of any nuance was the only thing that kept me from slumber which i resent a nap wouldve been lovely
Aug 14 2023,positive,a very nice movie and i enjoyed watching it i will tell the friends about it
Aug 14 2023,positive,a great movie his story is very beautiful   ill tell my friends about him too
Aug 14 2023,positive,this is amazing the film
Aug 14 2023,positive,the movie was not as good as i expected the main character did not seem to have a lot of chemistry with either love interest and the nudity really wasnt necessary the movie didnt show enough about the actual nuclear aftermath so it was not as impactful as it could have been  the music and sound effects were annoying too loud and not timed well with scenes just an ok film the dialogue was also a bit boring to be honest i would rather watch a documentary with true survivor and  witness accounts actually
Aug 14 2023,positive,good cinematography but slow and overrated
Aug 14 2023,positive,did you know oppenheimer first producc launch in japan
Aug 14 2023,positive,the dialogs are just the best the way nolan shows the two different povs makes the spectator indulge in the movie
Aug 14 2023,positive,very nice very beautiful this movie
Aug 14 2023,positive,the film harks back to an age of white middleaged men jostling for power and fame but this is an essential story very well told by nolan for a 3 hour film it never feels too long and the build up to the new mexico test explosion is thrilling murphy is brilliant as robert oppenheimer in his strongest cinematic performance since the wind that shakes the barley nolan captures oppenheimers brilliance flaws and moral quandary well the atom bomb is presented as one of the highest points of human mastery of our universe from the perspective of human advancement one leaves the cinema wondering if progress is even worth it a very good film
Aug 14 2023,positive,its was one of the beat movie this year its way better than barbie cost was better the acting was better the writing was better than barbie i dont understand why people compare them i think its an unfair for movie like barbie
Aug 14 2023,positive,oscar worthy performance by cillian murphy and a fascinating look into the life and mind of a complicated historical figure it was definitely long at three hours felt a bit like two movies condensed into one and found the sound muddy during some of the dialogue
Aug 14 2023,positive,oppenheimer is a brilliant film two strands of the movie depict the story from oppenheimers view and the other from his betrayer strauss the acting directing and score are marvelous
Aug 14 2023,positive,its good but is it great cool learning history and internal struggles def see poetic symbolism but that nolan and was done well imax
Aug 14 2023,positive,excellent casting acting and story
Aug 14 2023,positive,it was ok  way too long
Aug 14 2023,positive,oscarworthy performances and directing no problem watching and hearing the imax film on a standard screen could have been condensed some
Aug 14 2023,positive,fascinating glimpse into one of the most consequential chapters in history great filmaking acting and effects i only wish that the audience understood some of subtleties that were presented i did appreciate that oppenheimers real motivations and actions were left to the audience to decide and many pieces of the story point to a conclusion that is quite different from the narrative overall a really thoughtprovoking movie especially in the era of ai
Aug 14 2023,positive,i think my tickets never appeared in the app i signed out and sign back in several times even deleted and reinstalled the fandango app at least you sent me an email  the movie was incredible i dont know if cillian murphy will win an academy award but robert downey jr will
Aug 14 2023,positive,great movie it is unbelievable that a biographical film can reach such a high level maybe its because its not just a biographical film but a historical film bearing witness to its time
Aug 14 2023,positive,good  movie  good  acting  however  too much dialog  an hour  could have been  eliminated  
Aug 14 2023,positive,too long had trouble understanding what was being said sometimes due to bad sound system confusing at times but mainly the length of the film was my main complaint
Aug 14 2023,positive,would have been a 4 but the audio was so poor that i missed about 15 of the dialogue also there were too   many flashbacks  wasnt entirely aware of the governments shabby treatment of him  the 3 hours went by quickly enough
Aug 14 2023,positive,excellent story and acting
Aug 14 2023,positive,a great movie we were a military family leaving in el paso back in 1998 when we took our sons to that site at the time they only opened for oneday out of the year because of the radiation that was still there i thought they would have put pictures at the end of the movie from the actual site and scientists but all in all i enjoyed the movie
Aug 14 2023,positive,awesome production well directed well acted informative and exciting
Aug 14 2023,positive,excellent film didnt look at my watch once brilliantly acted and directed
Aug 14 2023,positive,awesome movie incredible director and casts
Aug 14 2023,positive,a truly epic film the first two thirds of the movie culminating in the trinity tests is brilliant the depictions of the generations best minds was wonderfully cast i thought safdie as edward teller was in particular a great contribution the removal of sound from the trinity tests was a genius way to display the tests i mean how else are you going to capture to noise and fury a ww2 movie that isnt really about the proceedings of war is novel    i do not think it is a perfect movie or even necessarily the best of the year the scenes with pugh are gratuitous in particular the bizarre scene in the interrogation room with pugh mounting a naked unreal murphy is so out of place it stands out while the script for the most part is brilliant nolan does occasionally revert to cheesy clich√© break a leg try not to blow up the world the issue of will japan surrender if we test the bomb and show them its destructive power is breezed over without meaningful discussion the decision to not show the bombs actually drop in japan is a glaring omission there is even a scene where murphy is viewing images on a projector of the destruction but the movie never shows the horror of what murphy is looking at the last third of the movie which revolves around the senate confirmation vote for strauss while brilliantly acted by downing jr and malek is the weakest part of the film in terms of contributing to themes or plot and the film probably would have been better wrapping up the character study of oppenheimer in a different way     overall a great movie that i will watch again to fully digest
Aug 14 2023,positive,it was a great movie nudity was awkward feel like they didnt need to add that anyways it was really good was a bit lengthy
Aug 14 2023,negative,cheap shocking sound and visual effects too much constant background noise and music unnecessary sex scenes often hard to hear and to follow conversations unclear who is who overly simplified traumatic youth bad writing annoying cinematography too much camera movement to create real life affect whitewashing if american communists worst movie i saw in ten years
Aug 14 2023,positive,really good movie  its long but it kept me interested right to the end
Aug 14 2023,positive,the movie is smartly assembled intense vivid and inspires a cathartic deep thought what a way to tell such an intense story all the cast was astonishing
Aug 14 2023,positive,its a masterpiece like no other the score the motion the intensity mind blowing
Aug 14 2023,positive,difficult to keep the characters straight  closed captioning would help especially due to the amount of dialogue
Aug 14 2023,positive,had a bit of a problem with recognizing too many actors and losing the suspension of disbelief that saidrobert downeyjr is stupendous the nonlinear story telling is occasionally hard to follow the cinematography was stupendous and the topic is very important 
Aug 14 2023,positive,excellent acting and finished product 
Aug 14 2023,neutral,nolan writing about female characters is depressing
Aug 14 2023,positive,oppenheimer was excellent  a good historical drama  learned a lot of things i didnt know from history books

Aug 14 2023,positive,i thought it was a great movie  the actors were amazing
Aug 14 2023,positive,this movie is really magnificent a new masterpiece from nolan     dramatic construction was really good dialogues were great i enjoyed it    overall this movie is splendid i recommend it but it doesnt deserve to watch it in imax genuinely except the nuclear bomb test scene that was pretty great in imax regardless it doesnt deserve watching it in imax
Aug 14 2023,positive,was really hard to follow along
Aug 14 2023,positive,stunning visuals and a beatifull soundtrack alongside an incredible tension builder
Aug 14 2023,positive,oppenheimer is nothing short of historic with such engaging conversations nolan captures intensity through multiple stories that culminate in a personal yet epic conclusion consequences  burdens come with such power and you feel every second of it in this countdown    the editing of this film is perfection and the true shining component a phenomenal score emphasized by the sound design blunt downey and murphy should all be nominated its top tier on a technical level narratively performance wise and everywhere else this is nolan at the peak of his abilities
Aug 14 2023,positive,it was an informative period piece with lots of excitement
Aug 13 2023,positive,good coverage bhagvad gita reference during sex scene very offensive to hindus film maker not sensitive to hindu audience feedback

Aug 13 2023,positive,the special effects were breathtaking
Aug 13 2023,positive,didnt need the sex and nudity
Aug 13 2023,positive,excellent cast and documentary
Aug 13 2023,positive,the father of the atomic bomb oppenheimers insightful vision of molecular physics was evolutionarily an outstanding docudrama based on los alamos and the manhattan project illustrating the postwar tribunal of oppenheimer and the detailed events of his involvement leading up to during and afterwards final recognition brought restoration for honorable service to the united states and the world well worth seeing
Aug 13 2023,negative,too long  dont know how accurate movie was  too technical for average viewer
Aug 13 2023,positive,great acting but the movie was way too long
Aug 13 2023,positive,masterpiece everything about this film is first rate writing acting directing cillian murphy should win an oscar but emily blunt stole the scenes she was in
Aug 13 2023,positive,the movie was too long  too dragged out the actors were great especially robert downey jr and the actor who played oppenheimer
Aug 13 2023,positive,its amazing its what cinema should be dramatic and thought provoking with heavy subject matter best movie of the year no question about it cillian murphy deserves the oscar for his amazing performance everything from the actors to directing to music was perfect
Aug 13 2023,positive,everything about the movie was spectacular
Aug 13 2023,positive,horrifyingly beautiful
Aug 13 2023,positive,the acting and the directing were subperb this movie is worth seeing the three hours flys by quickly

Aug 13 2023,negative,too long and very slow boring left half hour into film
Aug 13 2023,positive,loved the history theater was freezing
Aug 13 2023,negative,i waited to see this until the crowd died down and mainly i thought it would be boring   well i shouldve stuck to my gut instinct because it was horrible   i couldnt believe how slow it was and that it was all politics about communism beliefs and garbage about math  i couldnt understandfollow half the dialog i fell asleep multiple times before walking out just 2 hours in  looked it up and found the dont even detonate a bomb on screen  so glad i left  i dont understand what people see in it l but i think they just follow the pack and said they liked it when they really didnt id rather watch any dc movie than this any day and thats saying a lot
Aug 13 2023,positive,very good and very intense
Aug 13 2023,positive,one of the best movies ive seen intense great cinematography the actors are great three hours sounded like a lot to ask but it was worth every minute
Aug 13 2023,negative,lly is for the attention of people who were really interested in the history of oppenheimer the movie was boring from start to finish despite the good ratings people fell asleep an hour into the movie the way it was portrayed showed mostly everything just from one perspective and it could quite literally have been a biography of his life from his perspective i dont believe how anyone could have found this movie good even if it wasnt 3 hours long the way it was portrayed was just three hours of straight talking people sitting in a room talking dont waste money
Aug 13 2023,positive,started out good but 40 minutes into the movie the imax machine broke down and the showing was cancelled  ended up watching on of the other movies
Aug 13 2023,positive,i liked it but it was long and the ending left you hanging
Aug 13 2023,negative,extremely long and very slow  felt like a lot of scenes were unnecessary and didnt really add to the story none of the characters felt fully developed and the ending felt very rushed could have told the same story in 2 hours
Aug 13 2023,positive,good movie a bit complicated to follow if you are not familiar with oppenheimers life
Aug 13 2023,positive,overall a good movie however it dragged too long

Aug 13 2023,positive,oppenheimer is really a masterpiece from the screenplay through the superb interpretation of the exquisite casting the marvelous cinematography combined to the genius soundtrack of ludwig g√∂ransson this is the ultimate nolan envision of the conflicted lifetime of j robert as well as ours has become too in the nuclear age
Aug 13 2023,negative,loud boring lard to followleft half way through

Aug 13 2023,positive,intense and interesting
Aug 13 2023,positive,the story line was incredible and very informative  my only complaint is portions of the film were entirely too loud  amazing acting  wont give details because i dont want to ruin it for anyone
Aug 13 2023,positive,oppenheimer is nolans magnum oppus i know i am late to the party but this movie is simply incredible i am blown away    starting off with the production design and sound if both of these do not get nominated at the oscars then we might have a problem just like barbie oppenheimer has a fantastic production design that just is filled to the brim with detail and care and this is the loudest film i have ever seen when i got done another theater that was playing it was rumbling then when the quiet moments came it made everything even more empactful    the score this is by far the best score of the year it made every scene better and the movie kinda just embraced it it could be lighthearted yet grim at times but in a new and fresh way i will be listening to this creative and loud score on repeat    bomb scene i think i might have just witnessed one of the greatest scenes in the history of cinema all the lead up and tension i felt to get to this scene was insane i was on the edge of my seat and when it happend everything was just quiet almost like the world had stopped then when the sound came through i was simply speechless the practical effects were mind blowing and you need to see them on the big screen    performances first of all if cillian murphy and robert downey jr dont get nominated for best actor and best supporting actor then i will be furious because like the rest of this movie incredible cillian murphy became oppenheimer just the look on his face in all of his scenes is truly sensational he gave it his all and has gave my favorite preformance of the year i loved seeing robert downey jr in something besides the mcu where he really gets to shine ans show off his acting chopps more he is menacing yet very gentle and i am glad they casted him in the movie but i also have to mention florence peugh and emily blunt because they were very good too and stole every scene they were in last but not least matt damon he was great as always everyone involved in this movie truly gave it their all and felt needed    the end simply all the build up to find out what albert einstein was going to say was just amazing it was haunting but true about how they will give you a medal and pat you on the back but what he did is unforgivable no matter how much they say it is that was powerful stuff    final thoughts oppenheimer is one of the best films of our time christopher nolan is truly an incredible filmmaker and this movie proves that everyone that helped and is involved in this movie gave it their all oppenheimer will make you think and leave you scared about the world we live in i believe that this movie is important and movie everyone should check it out at least once in their life
Aug 13 2023,positive,3 hour movie about a theoretical physicist that held attention from start to finish
Aug 13 2023,positive,was a great movie three hours that went very fast
Aug 13 2023,positive,the intensity of the movie  edge of your seat suspense   the ending was unexpected i rate it 3 stars
Aug 13 2023,positive,i knew the history of oppenheimer and saw early documentaries on him technically the producers kept to the facts but and its a big but they put endless sex scenes that were disgusting it seemed like producers are more interested in pushing bullshit crap in their movies then they are history it might as well have been a netflix special where they have to fill the script with gay and lesbian sick crap it did go all out with dizzying graphics that left you crosseyed it was a waste of money to me
Aug 13 2023,positive,way too long wait too boring
Aug 13 2023,positive,the casting was incredible the writing brilliant and amazingly accurate historicallyspeaking excellent pacing it did not feel like a 3 hour movie at all and the message is one that could not be more timely as we creep toward creating sentient ai just superb storytelling
Aug 13 2023,positive,it was an entertaining antimilitary antinationalistic film which required some knowledge of science and history with excellent acting
Aug 13 2023,negative,after hearing all the hoopla about this movie and being a fan of true stories and history i thought i would be in for a treat for me the movie was way too long and although well acted it put too much emphasis on oppenheimers sex life in my opinion however it was interesting rather chilling and sad to see how it was decided which japanese cities would be chosen to have the bomb dropped on them one city was eliminated from the hit list because one of the men making the decision had a pleasant personal history with the city so that particular city held happy memories and meant something to him too bad the other cities didnt it did remind me that when people get to know other people who are different from them on a personal basis they often see the humanity in them that they did not consider before  one take away was plain to see and that is war is truly hell
Aug 13 2023,positive,loved the movie it all ties back into itself and the cinematography is beautiful also the sound track is one of the best ive ever hear
Aug 13 2023,negative,should have been a 15 to 2 hour movie convoluted storytelling and i didnt care about any of the characters if i was not with a group i would have considered walking out
Aug 13 2023,positive,this was cinematography excellence but some parts dragged
Aug 13 2023,negative,really we are supposed to cry with kitty his wife at the end because his 1954 review by aec resulted in the removal of his security clearance by the way he cheated on her with several women and she knew of it and she was a communist oppenheimer was a communist came out as fact after the fall of the ussr in the early 90s and his brother was a communist and his best friend chevalier was a leading communist he hired scientist fuchs who was a russian spy to be in the manhatten project and through harry gold brother to ethel rosenberg and julius risenberg they sold all the atomic bomb secrets from oppenheimers discovery along with sonar and other secrets to the rusdians russians got nuclear capabilities as a result in 1949 and we rightfully executed the rosenbergs verified to be communist russian agents through ussr documents obtained in 1990 china became communist in 1948 we were fighting communism in the korean war and people like oppenheimer rosenbergs hiss fuchs green glass compromised the us and cost us lives traitors communism has killed 100000000 in the last 100 years
Aug 13 2023,positive,this movie was awesome very eventful and dramatic scenes nolan really got the art down of reimagining the drama that was happening within this history and putting it to a well written out movie of the events that happened and the paranoia and that happened all through this time period you dove into the mind of each person and felt what they felt cillian murphy was mesmerizing the power of acting without saying any  words he drove this film all the way through if you love history this is the one see in theaters
Aug 13 2023,positive,too long easily couldve shortened it to minimum 2 hours interesting but didnt hold either of our attention
Aug 13 2023,positive,nolans best work stunning brilliant filmmaking
Aug 13 2023,positive,firstly anyone whos not seen this biopic have a basic grasp on international politics nuclear weapons and scientic aspects    otherwise most of the movie will go over your head saying that if you do like myself you will enjoy this movie flawless acting from all cast members the movie is abit cramped as it is a 3 hour film about robert whole life   while watching the biopic you realise that oppemheimer may well be one of the most important humans in history   nolan captures all that is important within his life and brilliantly truly one of his best    imax isnt necessary either no matter how much they try and sell it
Aug 13 2023,positive,nolans best an incredible and clever film about robert oppenheimer that is less about bombs and more about personal experiences and trauma nolan continues to show how intelligently he can portray historical events in his films in 2017s dunkirk and 2023s oppenheimer
Aug 13 2023,positive,excellent work by christopher nolan
Aug 13 2023,positive,historically accurate and filled with oodles of information that are unknown even to history buffs   all actors gave phenomenal performances
Aug 13 2023,positive,masterful screenplay from a brilliant cast
Aug 13 2023,negative,3 hours of poor oppenheimer looking lost and 10 minutes of non technical bomb stuff and to quote alex jones  a bunch of commie crap
Aug 13 2023,positive,nolans masterful direction and the actors performances create an emotionally powerful cinematic experience the film also invites reflection on the responsibility of scientists regarding the use of their discoveries and the impact of science on society
Aug 13 2023,negative,a pretty film that told a simple story but had the possibility to tell a much more complex one
Aug 13 2023,negative,boring 3 hours of people talking lengthy nudity  sex unnecessary
Aug 13 2023,negative,way too pornographic  too bad because it could be a good historical informative movie  the explicit porn scenes were not needed for the storyfilm
Aug 13 2023,positive,very well directed superb acting
Aug 13 2023,positive,well told story of the hypocritical misuse of a brilliant man and how he was aggressively recruited and then so cruelly discarded when no longer useful really well acted  great cast  showed the very real and very frightening aspects of nuclear weapons and how we irreversibly entered into the nuclear war age
Aug 13 2023,positive,this is a beautiful movie i am a huge fan of christopher nolans work and this movie does not disappoint with fantastic performances from cillian murphy robert downey jr and emily blunt this movie will have you on the grip of your seat with excitement the first and second act of this movie is great but the third act is amazing the look and score of this movie is beautiful no matter the size of the role everyone brings something to the table go check this one out    till next time good journey
Aug 13 2023,neutral,i think it was necessary to bring to the forefront the antiwar and seminuclear stance positions and opinions of each of the scientists military personnel and politicians it is very disappointing that the conclusion of the film ultimately becomes a question of patriotism or lack thereof
Aug 13 2023,positive,fantastic movie would see again
Aug 13 2023,positive,enjoyed the action sometimes hard to follow with the time line changes
Aug 13 2023,negative,horribly slow and boring movie im not sure why every actor and actress in hollywood would need to be filmed in imax talking the whole movie its like everyone wanted to get paid on this one one little test bomb scene everything else is dialogue about making it or feeling bad about making it
Aug 13 2023,positive,great story told in a fastpaced way
Aug 13 2023,positive,absolutely incredible highly recommend   acting was perfect cinematography was excellent dont have a bad thing to say

Aug 13 2023,positive,wow its a beautiful movie worth watching
Aug 13 2023,positive,the first 30 minutes was difficult and we began to think were not going to stay through it then when the general matt damon enters the movie it begins to wind its way through the complicated process  the movie is deep thought provoking and engaging   we want to see it again and put ourselves in the context of the times cillian murphy is exceptional what a maze of controversy and deception
Aug 13 2023,positive,great experience watching this in 70mm imax film we drove over 300 miles for this and it was definitely worth it i hope they expand this format on theater offerings in the future

Aug 13 2023,positive,this movie had a great plot twist it was funny to watch with friends
Aug 13 2023,positive,the oppenheimer film delivers a riveting cinematic experience underpinned by strong central performances it brilliantly captures the complex and subtle nuances of oppenheimers character delving deep into the ethical conundrums of his time while it poses more questions than it answers it encourages viewers to ponder the profound moral implications long after the credits roll
Aug 13 2023,positive,exceptional must see and i like how they showed the human side of everyone and not the stoic hollywood version great film great director  cast 5 stars easy
Aug 13 2023,positive,superb one of the best cinema experiences ive had on ages over 3 hours but never once was it anything less than fully engrossing
Aug 13 2023,positive,exceptional acting and cinematography makes this an incredible worthy watch  i think christopher nolans script could have been tighten up in post production a little bit as there may have been a 3 hour story in there but it felt like it wasnt the film i saw
Aug 13 2023,positive,christopher nolans newest film is jarring and memorable an ode to creation and consequence
Aug 13 2023,positive,visually and musically fantastic i want to see it again
Aug 13 2023,positive,what a great movie the acting was superb the use of black and white film vs color was very intriguing  the creation of los alamos was incredibly realistic  loved the movie

Aug 13 2023,positive,very engaging story well told photography and sound are exceptional portrays a difficult theme with succulently stiched scenes depicting feelings power mandacity
Aug 13 2023,positive,beautiful movie on the life of one of the most influential men in human history
Aug 13 2023,positive,one of the best movie ever
Aug 13 2023,positive,my stents worked for the manhattan project so it was wonderful to learn more about it
Aug 13 2023,positive,i did not like the way president harry truman was portrayed as a war monger
Aug 13 2023,positive,completely visceral absolute perfection christopher nolan learnt from dunkirk a fantastic film and produced one of if not the greatest retellings of history ever put to screen calling this art would understate its absolute beauty beyond his typical masterful cerebral thrill rides are his tales of history and they may stand alone on the peaks of cinema above the works of spielberg kubrick scorsese hitchcock and welles
Aug 13 2023,positive,this movie is a great representation of the e events leading upto and after the creation and dropping of the atom bombs which is by far the most horrific things ever done by us humans  entire drama around it is beautifully captured in this immaculately written directed and acted upon movie even the actors in relatively smaller roles are great actors in their own right and could have played the lead role but even in their own roles they have delivered perfectly  i thoroughly enjoyed the movie and am not surprised at the global success this movie is getting
Aug 13 2023,positive,this movie is one of the best i have seen in the cinema in a long time it was so good that i have created an account just to review it in hopes it convinced others who are debating watching it like i was to just go and see the movie     the acting was perfect in every single scene the shots were immaculate some people have complained about the length of the movie but i only wanted more     please if there is anything you do this year go and watch this in the cinema
Aug 13 2023,positive,truthfully honest shining a light on america politics and gives a picture of why america is in the state that it is in
Aug 13 2023,positive,excellent history on the atomic bomb
Aug 13 2023,positive,being a 71 yo boomer and an avid movie enthusiast this is probably the most  enthralling mesmerizing representation of an era that i and my brothers were likely born of my father was military and his job was classified so we never knew the details of events that shaped our lives   excellent cast beautifully filmed and directed oscar worthy in every respect  i have been drawn to see it again and again 3 hrs feels like a single moment in time
Aug 13 2023,positive,great sound experience
Aug 13 2023,negative,oversimplified a movie that focuses more on affecting your senses rather than giving you time and quiet to reflect on the relative pros and cons of each characters perspective    very little focus on the science  rapid jumps and editing that never allow for a moment of thought or consideration  any lapse in visual movement or dialogue is necessarily interrupted by cacophony     a huge disappointment
Aug 13 2023,positive,honestly best movie that has come out in a long time
Aug 13 2023,positive,this movie was important to see
Aug 13 2023,positive,very intense and great history didnt seem like 3 hours because it was so packed with great actors and lots of action
Aug 13 2023,positive,great movie a must see
Aug 13 2023,positive,big fan of the film sick audio design and a divine performance by cillian murphy
Aug 13 2023,negative,boring and too long walked out for the first time dont fool yourself thinking youre smart because you can sit 3h through this movie save the money and read the wikipage instead
Aug 13 2023,positive,what a wonder representation to look back into history and see what decisions were made that made history
Aug 13 2023,positive,in my opinion its nolans greatest film thus far and my personal favorite movie in general its a very impactful visceral experience that makes you feel strong emotions of awe concern and wonder you think and feel about humanity throughout the film and its difficult to stop thinking about these feelings after you leave the theater the actors and story remind you what it means to be human with peoples everyday emotions and feelings like calm hope love glamour lust sadness empathy jealousy chaos and hatred yet you also feel the immense fragility of humanity due to our potential for barbarism conspiracy and selfdestruction at the level of the atomic bomb while also feeling awe for our ingenuity intelligence and glamour in our scientific and artistic pursuits in life these contradictory feelings of the nature of human life are interwoven with each other and it makes you ponder how complex beautiful serious grandiose important and precious our lives are the film is made all the more potent once you realize all of this developing and using atomic bomb and for the most part happened and this is who we are and you are viewing to some extent reality when you watch the bomb explode and observe the human circumstances arround it cillian murphy does a great job as dr oppenheimer as do the others i highly recommend seeing it in imax to get a bigger screen and a louder soundsystem to fully enjoy what i believe is a once in a lifetime achievement in cinematography acting soundtrack and sound editing
Aug 13 2023,positive,i just didnt like that theres a lot of dialogue long interviews in some scenes
Aug 13 2023,positive,i liked the acting and the visual effects for oppenheimers mind
Aug 13 2023,negative,movie was way to long damn near fell asleep and yet at the same time shit felt like it was moving in 3x speed hella famous actors and i didnt give a shit about a single one of their characters except for oppenheimer and robert downey jr dont even remember dudes name thats how forgettable this shit was only even remotely exciting part was bomb explosion and the trial at the end and even that felt like it was fucking pointless as the movie ends and has no fucking consequences on the characters overall most overrated overhyped movie of the year only reason its score is so high is cause hella famous actors and people dont know how to get christopher nolans dick out they mouth
Aug 13 2023,negative,too much dialogue and not enough action it was very difficult to follow the plot
Aug 13 2023,negative,too long too boring and it focused almost completely on mccarthyism  i thought it was going to be an action movie but it totally sucked
Aug 13 2023,positive,this movie was engrossing in a way that the unexpected creeps up on you as if it is unattainable the science included in this movie is not only quintessential but a standard for movies of this caliber i could not recommend oppenheimer more
Aug 13 2023,positive,great behind the scenes details  what 1940s america did not know and what games the politicians have always played
Aug 13 2023,positive,very well acted and well told also very long and the final third of the movie is the most emotionally involving as someone who is pretty much the anthithesis of a physicist i wish some of the science had been explained better
Aug 13 2023,positive,the good bad unknown side of science is shown politics  war are shown in the movie must see
Aug 13 2023,positive,such a fantstic and interesting story  great acting particularly by robert downey jr stirring music and incredible editing  tonight we saw it for the second time  there is so much to absorb
Aug 13 2023,positive,my tears have fallen when death is born
Aug 13 2023,positive,excellent directing and story line kept your interest in a long movie the impeccable acting from alister actors made you lean into every dialogue every heated exchange and every cynical yet humorous interaction
Aug 13 2023,positive,this is nolans masterwork
Aug 13 2023,negative,havent walked out in a movie in a long timetonight broke that streak  was bored from the get go and left early cuz i wanted to stab myself in the eyes with a pen
Aug 13 2023,positive,incredible  riveting for 3 hours
Aug 13 2023,positive,great job on the recreation of the homes offices desert scenes clothing etc  the story was a bit hard to follow but i had heard that before i saw the movie  so i particularly paid attention to details    a big oops that i caught was the night before the big test it was raining heavily  then he sai its letting up its a gi for 559  then the next scene showed the men putting mats on the dry dessert  everywhere was totally dry
Aug 13 2023,negative,knowing my 11 and 16 year old grandchildren were wanting to see the movie i was appalled at the graphic and unnecessary sex scenes in oppenheimer the fact that oppenheimer was a womanizer who betrayed his wife and children in pursuit of his own selfish agenda could have been relayed without the multiple closeup detailed sex scenes they were completely inappropriate for minors i was outraged this story has merit and there is certainly a place in history to tell it but this was not it the development of this historic daunting weapon and the moral conflict it presents to humanity were lost in the amoral lifestyle infecting the true story  two thumb down do not take minors to see this movie
Aug 13 2023,positive,one of the best films ive seen in years nolan sets up the story so well you are intrigued and entertained the entire film
Aug 13 2023,positive,i dont have words to describe how wonderful is this masterpiece very recomended to everyone that knows what cinema is
Aug 13 2023,positive,i love the movie a rare movie without nonstop action but what makes it great is the actors play    amc simply destroyed enjoying  the movie  with the dolby experience which simply generates unbearable noise but does not improve sound quality  the special effects overwhelm dialogs so these are hard to follow the sound level is painful
Aug 13 2023,positive,best movie of the year 
Aug 13 2023,positive,typical government screw over of an american patriot exposed as it really happened
Aug 13 2023,positive,acting character development  cinematography
Aug 13 2023,positive,excellent film loved lead character the most did a great job the conflict for oppenheimer near the end for building something that could stop the war vs killing thousands of innocent people and destroying lands  was intense having read bill oreillys book the day the world went nuclear and killing the rising sun it really helped clarify so much of wwii that my dad fought in the imax theatre in az mills the music was so loud i couldnt always hear the words spoken great filmsends a message and also presents wwii to young people  thanks so much
Aug 13 2023,positive,explosive  a very well put together historical docudrama a great cast and acting cinematography special effects soundtrack and costumes all first rate if you like science and physics you will enjoy this movie even more it went a little overboard on the sex scenes however staying true to history i guess mr oppenheimer was oppenhorny i would have liked to see a few more explosions maybe an hbomb test which would have fit into the historical timelines if youre seeing this on the big screen plan for a full three hours so i dont recommend any super big gulps enjoy
Aug 13 2023,positive,excellent definitely an award winner
Aug 13 2023,positive,great story and well acted
Aug 13 2023,positive,possibly the best movie i ever saw if you can pay close attention to it for 3 solid hours i highly recommend it
Aug 13 2023,positive,telling the story through the lens of oppenheimers later life political challenges was unexpected but added a level of intensity that made the story come alive
Aug 13 2023,negative,the sound effect presentation was so overpowering it was painful
Aug 13 2023,positive,great visuals and cinematography from nolan as usual acting is great directing was good here again i wish nolan of whom im a huge fan would use a cowriter or editor jonathan the storyline isnt clear at times and some of the impact of the story i think gets lost due to overlytheatrical effects thundering footstomps blinding white lights etc used to portray oppenheimers traumatized state its a not very subtle cilians acting was good enough to stand on its own without the effects being so dramatic the movie could also have lost about 20 minutes without losing the story if it were more compact    but im being overly critical because i like nolan so much also the digital imax theater that i saw it in was very loud even normal dialog scenes were like listening to tv alongside someone very hard of hearing  very loud and the screen wasnt that big even though it was the imax format anyway its a great story and film and several oscar nods for suire nolans overindulgence in dramatics works when hes doing action films like tenet but here its sometimes a bit much
Aug 13 2023,positive,best movie ever opened up my eye to what humans can really do if they just wonder great job cristopher nolan
Aug 13 2023,positive,first the movie was 45 minutes too long while i was watching quantum mechanics i started to wi see what i was watching i thought cinematography beautiful  acting terrific the use of music to move it along brilliant i am annoyed that this is 3rd chris nolan movie that i have gone to and cant hear half of the dialog i find that extremely annoying especially since it is pivotal to the story i also thought the congressional hearing about strauss was too much the film felt self important and didnt give a crap if the audience enjoyed it so again i was annoyed with chris nolan grandiose attitude about himself i think the movie would have been a bigger success if they cut out 45 minutes of unnecessary stuff that became confusing and bogged down the story
Aug 13 2023,positive,its not often that a movie lasting just over three hours will not see you consulting your watch to see how much longer you must remain seated popcorn notwithstanding oppenheimer is such a movie the complex mesmerizing and touching story of the father of the atomic bomb is welldeserving of the positive reviews it had received along with barbie but thats for another day the storyline is hypnotic and the viewer is transported dynamically in time to the middle of ww2 the postwar nuclear threat and the mccarthy era persecution that left an indelible scar in american history     the acting is outstanding with irish actor cillian murphy delivering a performance that felt more like a documentary than a flick his sincere personification of the lead character is flawless and the same is true of emily blount kitty and robert downey jr lewis strauss the interaction of all these historical figures thanks to this awesome cast is simply amazing and committed    i dont know how many academy award nominations oppenheimer will receive much less how many it will actually win but its contribution to the film industry will be certainly an atomic blast
Aug 13 2023,positive,awesome acting by cillian  good screen play and cinematography
Aug 13 2023,positive,i would have given this movie 45 stars if the volume turned down or removal of the damn music soundtrack in the first hour of the movie you couldnt hear the dialog over the soundtrack i know this is classic chris nolan must have deep and overly loud engaging music at all times in the movie but come on it was a really good movie if most of the soundtrack was removed
Aug 13 2023,positive,go see it in 70mm 100 worth it
Aug 13 2023,positive,great telling of an event that has changed so many lives very well done 
Aug 12 2023,positive,based on a true story  great details and realistic i didnt remember all those details from history class
Aug 12 2023,positive,this movie is easily the best movie ive seen this year so far nolan never fails to amaze me with how well he makes a film we are able to see the americans view on oppenheimer with them praising him for what he has contributed to help end the war with the creation of the nuclear bomb trinity but then we also see oppenheimers point of view where he is conflicted with his creation that is the nuclear bomb not to mention cillians performance was absolutely incredible as well as the rest of this star studded cast this is easily one of my favorite films of all time there is much more to see in this film but this is just one of the topics that is included in this well made biopic of the father of the atomic bomb j robert oppenheimer         eric bautista
Aug 12 2023,positive,very well done film  but didnt need three hours to tell the story
Aug 12 2023,positive,really good nolan brings out the turmoil oppenheimer must have felt great visuals and a really good soundtrack

Aug 12 2023,positive,christopher nolan youve done it again you legendary son of a bitch this was my most anticipated of the year and holy crap it did not disappoint me at all this film was one of christopher nolans biggest movie in my opinion everything from the grand story to the grand cast the amazing sounds to the amazing visuals the incredible cinematography to the insane visuals this movie is just phenomenal it ticks all the boxes it is incredible how christopher nolan makes these films practically it really is just a well deserved break from the cgi heavy films the cast again is phenomenal matt damon florence pugh emily blunt gary oldman but in particular robert downey jr giving an oscar worthy performance and of course cillian murphy also gives his best ever performance i could go on for hours but i want you all to experience this on the biggest screen possible this isnt just another movie it is an experience

Aug 12 2023,positive,great movie with a great cast
Aug 12 2023,negative,ultimately tedious and depressing three hours of the banality of evil and celebrity cameos almost no historical or cultural context  tunnel vision  but in addition the main characters internal life never became coherent emotionally or intellectually the few women and children were for the most part nightmarish and two dimensional at least three other new films ive seen this year were more thoughtprovoking and more beautiful
Aug 12 2023,positive,wow the cast was amazing full of surprises  did a fantastic job loved the line maybe they were talking about something more important than you
Aug 12 2023,positive,complex history was well defined personal views were highlighted
Aug 12 2023,positive,an average biopic that lacks character development and has a needlessly confusing story with an all star cast and nice special effects i do not understand the hype and thought it was very overrated
Aug 12 2023,positive,very good movie sometimes hard to follow thought some of the sex scenes were unnecessary especially the one in the hearing room it made no sense

Aug 12 2023,positive,it was a fascinating mesmerizing story and the acting was superb
Aug 12 2023,positive,it was slow in the beginning of the movie then it got good at the end
Aug 12 2023,neutral,i love me some nolan  i think the build up to seeing the bomb explosion was really smart but i think rdjs story arch were as forced as the sex scenes to make the movie titillating  an oscar grab
Aug 12 2023,positive,the movie was informative well acted and relative  it moved quickly unaware it was almost 3 hours long
Aug 12 2023,positive,this was a long movie but the cinematography was great ans everything seemed to serve the story well

Aug 12 2023,positive,really good movie a little long but very done and interesting
Aug 12 2023,positive,the movie was exceptional but unfortunately not for everyone to watch a level of intellectual capability is needed to really appreciate and most importantly understand it
Aug 12 2023,positive,oscar worthy performance by robert downey jr and cillian murphy
Aug 12 2023,positive,a must see on imax great movie
Aug 12 2023,positive,christopher nolans oppenheimer is a cinematic masterpiece that takes storytelling to new heights with his signature visionary style nolan weaves a captivating narrative that immerses the audience in the world of j robert oppenheimer and the creation of the atomic bomb the films stunning visuals coupled with its intricate plot and powerful performances create an unforgettable viewing experience nolans ability to delve into the complexities of science morality and human nature is truly commendable oppenheimer is not just a movie its a thoughtprovoking journey that lingers in your mind long after the credits roll a mustsee for anyone who appreciates the art of filmmaking
Aug 12 2023,positive,this is the most astounding breathtaking transfixing movie ive ever seen one must see and hear this in a theater with others the acting writing cinematography mesmerized my wife and mewe didnt speak during the movie or afterwards for 15 minutes or so it was the quickest three hours i have spent in a long time
Aug 12 2023,negative,another movie where hollywood lets its writers go rogue story has little to nothing to do with the bomb the first hour is about infidelity its such a disservice to the real history of whats important its insane if you want to hear hans zimmer style music why they do cut scenes of black holes every 5 minutes go for it but im telling you the movie is fucking horrible and not worth 3 seconds much less 3 hours of your time get your money back
Aug 12 2023,positive,one of the best movies ive ever seen 
Aug 12 2023,positive,this movie was incredibly powerful with spectacular performances i was a little confused at some points but not enough to dislike the movie highly recommend
Aug 12 2023,negative,oppenheimer had its moments  i mean at least 30 minutes of this film is engaging profound beautiful fascinating heartbreaking and meaningful its a shame the other 150 minutes felt like watching paint dry
Aug 12 2023,positive,oppenheimer was a very powerful movie  it contained absolutely first rate acting and explored issues of nuclear war moral responsibility scientific ethics and the challenges of being a conscientious objector  it was long at three hours but the story line demanded it
Aug 12 2023,positive,too many editorial license screens where for the sake of a screen play story the directorproduceretc  went in a sensational direction  the inaccurate screen about president truman was a gag fest  overall an entertaining movie  overly long though
Aug 12 2023,negative,we left before the movie ended as we were hopelessly lost on what was going on the sound track was so badwe could not hear the dialog over the music and often missed what was being said even without the loud musicwhat the heck
Aug 12 2023,negative,i wanted to like this movie but it was long an boring it jumped around and was hard to follow i was more about how oppenheimer was used and then accused of being a communist and very little about the development of the a bomb if you really want to see an awesome movie about the subject rent the movie fat man and little boy that was a great movie i would pass on this one
Aug 12 2023,positive,absolutely great movie from start to finish
Aug 12 2023,positive,movie was greatunfortunately i couldnt figure out how to use my 500 credit from fandango
Aug 12 2023,positive,it was an interesting look at this part of history
Aug 12 2023,positive,liked story on background of oppenheimers role developing the atomic bomb   surprised at how many scientists were involved    disliked how oppy was betrayed by a confidante and how usa review bord ignored his accomplishments
Aug 12 2023,positive,the movie was very informative about the hbomb and oppenheimers role in producing it  the acting was excellent
Aug 12 2023,positive,incredible practical effects amazing acting and a riveting truetolife story should not be missed
Aug 12 2023,positive,interesting history imperfect manhad a conscience about the use of nuclear fission for a bomb
Aug 12 2023,positive,an amazing movie that tells a story what you can almost always expect from an nolan movie the movie does what i wants to do tell the story of j robert oppenheimer and almost    could not be better
Aug 12 2023,positive,imax recommended by nolan truly spoiled this movie it was unbelievably loud  if you see this movie go for a conventional showing also arrive 30 minutes late as the trailers were truly disturbing and outrageous otherwise a very nice movie some aspects a little counterfactual and it would have been nice if some of the scientists were labeled ill watch it again on my tv
Aug 12 2023,negative,this is an overlong snooze fest the saving grace are brilliant performances from robert downey jr  emily blunt and florence pugh cillian murphy is a onedimensional oppenheimer and doesnt create interest the direction is fine but there are stodgy scenes that drag on forever a cure for insomnia with brilliant actors
Aug 12 2023,positive,finally saw it in imax 70mm well made film performance from the cast was superb  pacing steady
Aug 12 2023,positive,we loved the way the entire story is told thru the aec hearing
Aug 12 2023,negative,great acting  the background musicnoise made hearing dialog difficult  it was hard to identify different characters except einstein of course  but the unseen bongo player had to be feynman  it would have been helpful if they had flashed a name up on the screen the first time each character appeared  the story line moved back and forth which made it confusing at times  now not a criticism of the movie but the theater had the sound volume up way too high
Aug 12 2023,positive,oppenheimer is the monumental work that cinema needed christopher nolan has made the least nolan of his films but nothing could be further from the truth it is one of his best the grandeur of every scene takes your breath away where the anxiety generated by its visuals is one of the best experiences ive had in a movie theater this year cillian murphy is the actor of 2023 but robert downey jr has a clean path to win supporting actor while i think i need another viewing to appreciate it even more this film is going to stick in our minds for years to come
Aug 12 2023,neutral,hard to follow what period of time
Aug 12 2023,positive,i just know what to say the movie was great love it 
Aug 12 2023,negative,the parallel editing and disjointed scenes manipulating present time with past and future really annoyed me i hate this film its so long i dont feel anything for the main character music from beginning until the end  cillian murphy was my favorite and thats it 1 start only for him i hate this movie pretentious nolan was too show hes smarter then anyone but actually he doesnt know what hes doing
Aug 12 2023,negative,great cinemetography yet overdone overpriced and overly political went for an enhanced history experience left paying 40 for christopher nolans political opinion
Aug 12 2023,positive,another epic movie from nolan whilst the concept of time is less highlighted in this movie it is still present the impact of men on the world the decisions made in a mans lifespan short compared to their impact in the longrun the impact on the psychic as well what a man wants to leave as a footprint versus what the society decides what will be the memory  the image of murphy close to the bomb trying to listen to the music behind the math and the silence during the explosionepic  the performance of actors are scandalousmurphy is at its best in line with the performance on peaky blinders and even better   the complexity of the movie are in the detailsone of nolans best work
Aug 12 2023,positive,this movie has surpassed every expectation i had going into that theatre from the beautifully executed performances and visuals the historic accuracy is what truly stuck out to me as did the main parallel between strauss and oppie this film is a must watch whether its on tv or theaters the whole world should take notice and be exposed to the strong meaningful messages that come out this phenomenal film this is truly a once in a lifetime film that christopher nolan has blessed us with and a film that sends u off with a question thatll be talked about as long as men can talk  truly outstanding and i believe this film will go down as one of the greats and for sure christopher nolans best
Aug 12 2023,positive,the acting was quite good but the pacing was on par with someone with severe adhd  the director chose to pack as much dialogue as possible but with an emphasis on neurotic editing  there were constant scene changes dramatic sound effects and parallel timelines that left me with vertigo  im not sure if they wanted the extra hour for historical accuracy or because half of hollywood wanted a cameo  if you do see it wait for streaming so you can take a bathroom break 3 hours long and you may wanna rewind some scenes because at some point you will lose your place and your mind and will not know what the hell is going on
Aug 12 2023,negative,i expected more from nolan didnt care for the soft core porn scenes
Aug 12 2023,negative,too boring for as long as it is  plus i read a book about oppenheimer that would have been much better as a movie then the script they choose  but to each his own
Aug 12 2023,positive,it added a lot of understanding to what was happening in postwar and mid century american politics
Aug 12 2023,negative,way longer than it should of been the movie was honestly boring the characters were unlikable the bomb felt like a subplot if nolan had wanted to make this film r why not show the actual bombing of hiroshima it would of made the movie far more entertaining after the test bomb went off it was another hour or more of sitting around talking everyone said the bomb scene was cool but it was really just some fire nothing really special i like nolan movies but as i say i the theater i found myself pleading for it to be over
Aug 12 2023,positive,really well made historical dramas can go either way but this film stuck mainly to what could be verified as to what actually happened easy prediction for oscar nominations in several categories including all the main ones best film director actor actress etc
Aug 12 2023,positive,this is a terrific film  i hope that christopher nolan wins an oscar for best film and robert downey jr finally wins an oscar for his acting  it is an important film that should be seen by everyone who cares about the threat posed by nuclear weapons  i read the book american prometheus  which the movie is based on  and this is a faithful adaptation of the book
Aug 12 2023,negative,3 hours of endless taking about war and bomb  bla bla and more bla loud annoying background music
Aug 12 2023,positive,very possibly nolans best work it didnt quite justify being 3 hours long but it was worth it great performances all around
Aug 12 2023,positive,i knew the science of los alamos but i didnt know the personal story or politics involved  very insightful view on the very human side of the manhattan project
Aug 12 2023,positive,great acting and such an interesting piece of history
Aug 12 2023,positive,really good movieeee
Aug 12 2023,positive,the movie was very good but wish it was a bit shorter
Aug 12 2023,positive,in many ways oppenheimer really does feel like this is christopher nolan at his best certainly the most grounded thought provoking character piece nolan has produced in years
Aug 12 2023,positive,it is a long 3 hour movie and life of oppenheimer is done in a disjointed method with playbacks of his past in top of the present the making of atomic bomb  is mainly on a superficial level without much of the emphasis of team effort originally portrayed better in fat man little boy by paul newman in 1989 last hour is the more interesting part but people would not be interested in oppenheimers story that much robert downey and cilian murphy give excellent performance emily blount role is superfluous and not well done
Aug 12 2023,positive,great movie the story was told perfectly   the acting was outstanding  excellent cast historical sets and wardrobes made the story come to life
Aug 12 2023,positive,background soundsmusic drowned out the dialog
Aug 12 2023,positive,brilliant acting fascinating subject immense historical significance   whats not to like  seriously this movie is incredible  its long yes but i think i checked my watch only once the first time i saw it  its complex and interesting and so emotionally compelling in its conclusion  highly recommend
Aug 12 2023,positive,the movie was incredibly load and distracting at times the story lines draggggggedddd real plot was about the last 45 minutes which took too long to flesh out wasted effort so many talented actors
Aug 12 2023,negative,i was expecting an incredible story line  28 mins into the movie i knew i was in trouble   the movie felt like a 61 not a 91
Aug 12 2023,positive,great movie i havent seen a good movie in a while despite being three hours long the movie capture my attention all the time great acting from every character
Aug 12 2023,positive,excellent movie could not have been done better
Aug 12 2023,positive,once in a lifetime kind of film a must watch
Aug 12 2023,positive,i liked it but it was too long of a movie i like seeing all the celebrities
Aug 12 2023,neutral,inception like even though its historical cryptic and jumpy and not in the suspected chaotic end of the world  in the why shoot in the order or include this explosion scene was limp skimmed over the japan explosions  mostly skimmed over the physics aside from name dropping a few elements  processes     will watch again in 10yrs when i forget  get a notification its leaving the app
Aug 12 2023,positive,would have been 5 stars but didnt carw for the gratuitous nudity
Aug 12 2023,positive,movie was great great plot told a good story incredible visuals  the sound volume in the theater was deafening and hard to get over  broadway  68th nyc
Aug 12 2023,positive,i dont really say this but i want to watch it againand again
Aug 12 2023,positive,i expect oppenheimer to sweep the academy awards    best picture  best director  best actor   best supporting actor  best supporting actress  and a host of technical awards      simply brilliant
Aug 12 2023,positive,very solid movie and outstanding acting i believe downey and murphy deserve nominations people are mad about there not being enough boom the movie is called oppenheimer not bomb
Aug 12 2023,positive,very powerful film  excellent
Aug 12 2023,positive,very powerful movie a must see in the theatre for the full experience one of the best leading performances i have seen
Aug 12 2023,positive,oppenheimer was everything you would expect a nolan biopic to be an incredibly welllaidout story an even more incredible cast fantastic cinematography and more     that final half star not being ticked by me is because of the intangibles that truly make a movie worth sitting down and watching the experience while watching the film and the moments after you walk away and sit with them for a bit privately     this is not to say that i did not walk away feeling and thinking a multitude of things especially on a topic as large as the dropping of the first atomic bombs and the implications that have had for our species but through my reflections it did at times make me nostalgic for other films that nolan has put together such as inception tenet or even memento     i think it is worth the 3hour run time and if you are a fan of nolans work and overall history and film in general just be prepared to not necessarily feel the same it factor you felt when leaving the theatre after inception either way i recommend going to the theatre you wont regret it
Aug 12 2023,positive,phenomenal story telling acting and keeping audience engaged for 3 hours
Aug 12 2023,positive,i went in knowing what i know by studying history i left vary upset and really seeing the world in a different light not only is the movie moving but also shown as a backroom deal and how that part of government works that part is great that part is needed to be seen the light of day     the cast is great too the outfits are awesome the sets are well put together
Aug 12 2023,positive,excellent movie im going back
Aug 12 2023,positive,glad we saw oppenheimer in 70mm the cast gave incredible performances and the movies pacing was good
Aug 11 2023,positive,whats all the hype tried too hard used weird special sound effects and black and white to try and make it something special it was ok not something i would go see again but worth the ticket price
Aug 11 2023,positive,i read the book  so i was not in a real hurry to see what nolan had done with it i know he is a great director but his films are never my cup of tea so to say    but with this one christopher nolan did a amazing job he did a difficult thing he brought a complicated book to life on screen it is pretty true to the novel american prometheus a tough thing to do i would think because of nolans care to the book it is long but well worth the time     great cast and moves along well i walk away very please  one of the better films of the year without a doubt i believe we will see christopher nolan at the oscars this year
Aug 11 2023,positive,a little too long  could have told the story a little more quickly
Aug 11 2023,positive,very good  its almost 3 hours but well worth it
Aug 11 2023,positive,jumped around a lot in true christopher nolan style telling multiple stories at once that inevitably come together in the end mountains of dialogue and really disappointing fx it really is mostly talking for 3 hours  and the dialogue was pretty muffled    i may watch it again but i was restless by the end and long done with it  2 hours would have made it more enjoyable it was building up to a clever ending but i just wanted it to finish  was too jaded by then to enjoy it
Aug 11 2023,positive,too long and the sex scenes seam unnecissary and out of place emily blunts performance in perticular was outstanding the visual effects are amazing for some reason there are a lot of close ups of cillian murphys face
Aug 11 2023,neutral,80 of the movie is in a meeting room courtroom or testimony  there is one quick explosion    take note that this is a very adult movie with a lot of serious highbrow conversation  i think its an average movie very much overhyped  really doesnt need to be seen on the bigscreen since its just a lot of meeting rooms
Aug 11 2023,positive,astounding a bit long artistic treatment
Aug 11 2023,positive,historical great acting and fantastic cinematography
Aug 11 2023,positive,good historical account well made movie overall 
Aug 11 2023,positive,the movie was phenomenal dont wait to see it on the small screen  its a must see on the big screen robert downey junior and cillian murphy should be shoeins for oscars the only 3hour movie ive ever watched that never once seemed slow  felt like 2 hours long
Aug 11 2023,positive,solid biography with a good cast dialog a bit muffled at times and at times the sound effects were quite loud i found the plot a bit muddlednot knowing who the characters were or their roles and the time jumps between present and past did not help with that probably not necessary to see in an imax theater politically it underplayed the fact japan was willing to surrender with the same terms before we dropped the bomb as they did after the bomb so truman and all those who advised him to drop the bombs on civilian targets are war criminals in my opinion
Aug 11 2023,positive,it was a real and very interesting story  oppenheimer was caught up in the science and proving what could be done but the lasting moral effects haunted him for the rest of his life  our government was not nice to him    the movie has caused me to learn more on the situation  im reading a wonderful book titled 109 east palace by jennet conant
Aug 11 2023,negative,wonderful piece of story in the history actors are good nothing more
Aug 11 2023,positive,a good critical review of his mind while developing the abomb
Aug 11 2023,positive,visuals  audio were outstanding from the imax 70mm theatre loved the wonder of this historical look into the race to get the atomic bomb before the germans and hitler its shameful how oppenheimer was treated after the bomb proved to be successful just think of how history would have changed if the nazis had developed the bomb 1st
Aug 11 2023,positive,if i didnt know what cinema is now i know christopher nolan is a genius
Aug 11 2023,positive,mind blowing fantastic
Aug 11 2023,negative,too long not enough boom
Aug 11 2023,positive,the film was brilliant dialogue was great and the actors deliver fantastic performances by the end of the film you feel astound and will have you think of the chain reactions past present and future
Aug 11 2023,negative,i went to this movie expecting to see a historical account of the development of the atomic bomb but i learned nothing that was substantive or meaningful  unless they knew the story beforehand most people would probably not get much out of the movie the dialog was very difficult to hear and follow shifting timelines served only to blur the realities of history acting was great but the visuals were awful a teenager with a smart phone camera and a few firecrackers could have done a better job of portraying the awesome power of the test explosion     i watched the movie on a thursday night and the audience was sparse about 25 but the the best way of summarizing my opinion of the movie is to note that that 20 percent of the audience left before the end
Aug 11 2023,positive,i found it very difficult to hear many of the conversations  i dont know if it was the audio quality of the film or the acoustics in the theater  personally i have never really cared for films nor books for that matter that constantly are flashing back and then current etc
Aug 11 2023,positive,genuinely enjoyed oppenheimer initially i thought the barbenheimer hype was just a marketing ploy but certainly oppenheimer is as good a film i have seen in years interesting and dramatic plot with a great cast and with enough politicalhistorical sub plots to keep you engaged for what doesnt really feel like 3hrs
Aug 11 2023,positive,i saw a few negative reviews so wanted to share my opinion i think this is nolans best work and one of the best films i have seen in years nolan clearly borrowed heavily from the character development and audiovisual storytelling gained working on dark knight dunkirk inception and interstellar however i think oppenheimer stands apart what negative reviews seem to be missing is this is a difficult story to tell is there an equally captivating movie about such a complicated story nolan brilliantly weaves physics politics love loss triumph fear and regret into a colossal tragedy that somehow returns to a simple message the performances by murphy blunt damon and downey jr are superb and gary oldman as an un remorseful truman is haunting ill admit my first thought after watching was thats too much for american audiences to handle but ive been happy to mostly be proven wrong oppenheimer is a gut wrenching tear jerking masterpiece with an audiovisual experience that is rivaled by 2001 and few others unlike 2001 instead of classical music there is a unique score which adds to the emotion of the film and downright disturbing ending hopefully many more people watch and rethink the world around us and our place within it
Aug 11 2023,positive,brilliant im not a big christopher nolan fan i like the batman films but find a lot of his movies to be style and technique over substance and usually with poor sound not this time an excellent movie
Aug 11 2023,positive,mainly the acting of cilian murphy and the story line woven with historical facts some may not like too much of government hearing sessions
Aug 11 2023,positive,incredible story told perfectly
Aug 11 2023,negative,extremely boring except 5 minutes when they test the bombi left 20 min b4 ending
Aug 11 2023,positive,in a world engulfing in wars again a stark reminder of the dangers of nuclear weapons i left the hall with the feeling of the worst for humanity while the whole movie was about an astounding human achievement
Aug 11 2023,positive,amazing movie you need to watch it one of nolans best work also the acting is a 1010 i hope cillian murphy gets an oscar for this he definitly desevers it in conclusion and as homelander would say the movie is perfect
Aug 11 2023,positive,really good cast and scenery but confusing and boring
Aug 11 2023,positive,a very engrossing story however i did find some parts quite slow also the movie is close to 3 hours so make sure you dont drink too much beforehand
Aug 11 2023,positive,i felt i saw the inside of a brilliant mind
Aug 11 2023,positive,excellent film will be seeing it again super engaging and treats the audience as adults top notch filmmaking
Aug 11 2023,positive,very interesting movie we enjoyed it  i just think that it couldve been done in closer to 2 hours  it was very long
Aug 11 2023,positive,such a great movie on my seat the whole time
Aug 11 2023,positive,very long time jumped back and forth we were confused much of the time in part because the music was so loud and the dialogue was muffled  much of the movie is focused on oppenheimers personality development and behavior and is sad and depressing we wished we could have learned much more about the development of the project really didnt care about his personal life to be honest and as with much of what people say about others it might not even be entirely accurate  the best part was the actual test of the first bomb at los alamos  we wish we had seen it at home so we could have had intermissions really did not need to be in imax as we were told
Aug 11 2023,positive,gravity and gravitas     nolans latest masterpiece captures gravity in its many forms yet it is the gravitas of cillian murphy and the stellar cast that keep this movie engaging throughout through the closeup lens we see the weight of the terrible task undertaken the heaviness of dire choices the soundscape too has a density allowing nolan to deftly use silence to devastating effect i was unaware of the story behind oppenheimer and the atomic bomb so i wont spoil the surprise for those who are unaware     i marvelled at the visuals that conveyed both the complex scientific concepts as well as the emotions swirling around the oddly charismatic and deep oppenheimer the use of humour sprinkled in just enough scenes helped keep relieve the tension as my mind raced at the enormity of this endeavour     gravity the weight of consequence experience it for yourself

Aug 11 2023,positive,what a masterpiece its absolutely an interesting movie i love it
Aug 11 2023,positive,the best broadaudience film ive seen in het past decade recommended to read into oppenheimer before attending     it requires 100 of your attention for 3 hours and like most nolan films it gets you to think think about moral dilemmas personal relations and historical injustice thats been done and it does so beautifully absolute must see for anyone interested in history science and morality the film probably fares less on homescreens rather than cinemas due to the immersive sound effects
Aug 11 2023,positive,the movie is  well done from a historical and scientific perspective acting was amazing and the film pacing and scenes were just good
Aug 11 2023,positive,movie is very nice and is easy to understand everything was clear picture quality is good also
Aug 11 2023,positive,sweet time romcom with strong languagescute and predictable
Aug 11 2023,positive,a studious examination of history shown via a reverent lens of hollywood spectacle oppenheimer is a chilling biopic that could be christopher nolans best picture yet
Aug 11 2023,positive,i am in love with picture quality very clear and the message being pass on to the watchers and the way it is authored
Aug 11 2023,positive,its a great movie ill definitely encourage one to go and see it
Aug 11 2023,positive,it was a good movie one of those that makes you think
Aug 11 2023,positive,very awesome  very impressive 
Aug 11 2023,positive,i cant put into words how well executed acted and brilliant this movie was the different perspectives of how all the events went down was just perfect you see inside the mind of a man with unexplainable genius and how he approaches situations the sound and music in the film attaches you to the scene and keeps you interested this is an unique film that doesnt need action it keeps you intellectually engaged and the 3 hours go in a flash but the real question were all asking is can you hear the music
Aug 11 2023,positive,amazing story  incredible cast  moved slow up until about the last hour  this could have been done equally as well in less than 3 hours
Aug 11 2023,positive,masterpiece by christopher nolan didnt even realize the movie was three hours long great cinematography powerful visuals and amazing storytelling a must see
Aug 11 2023,positive,phenomenal christopher nolan once again does not disappoint cillian murphys performance was sublime and evoked such strong emotions that i felt to my core knowing the history and having a passion for this particular piece of history definitely made me connect more as a viewer and left me speechless
Aug 11 2023,positive,a truly heartbreaking film that takes you through the many hardships that can exist when power and politics come into play worth every second
Aug 11 2023,negative,its not really a movie but more like a 2 hour trailerrecap of some very long tv series that well never see complete with aggressively intrusive walltowall music followed by a 45 min finale episode where the themes of hubris and mutually assured destruction are repeated to a conclusion murphy and downey are great but theyre the only actors allowed to carry a scene or develop a full character plus some silly inaccuracies that feel insensitive if not inadvisable overall its less insightful about the subject matter than the tv show manhattan
Aug 11 2023,positive,very accurate and in depth
Aug 11 2023,positive,intense riveting and brilliant to watch for three hours  a must see movie
Aug 11 2023,positive,dont miss this movie
Aug 11 2023,positive,great movie lots of stars
Aug 11 2023,positive,its good very well done from a production point of view definitely more artsy than dramatic its very much a typical nolan movie in its good and bad parts it could and should have been shorter though i found it very strenuous to watch from 830pm to 1130pm minor spoiler also i think the atomic bomb exploding should have been closer towards the end as it feels like such an emotional climax that you get frustrated the movie isnt remotely over after it overall id recommend it and even watch again
Aug 11 2023,positive,the story about oppenheimer was so much more than i expected as i havent read the book yet the way the movie intertwined past and future drawing to and away from the manhattan project and trinity test as the central event reminded me of dunkirk the actors in this film continuously surprised as i hadnt predetermine most of the cast the imax picture was stunning the message at the end given by oppenheimer should be a reminder to all that there are still over 1000 intercontinental ballistic missiles ready for deployment in the united states and other countries
Aug 11 2023,positive,just when i thought i had a mental grasp of what it must have felt like to be part of the manhattan project christopher nolan fills in the gaps with an emotion i didnt know i could have without being there pretty sure the only award this movie doesnt deserve is best animated feature
Aug 11 2023,positive,absolutely brilliant movie well made thought provoking and emotionally heart wrenching loved every minute of it and for godsakes please give cillian the oscar  what a striking resemblance to oppie and such a brilliant performance to boot
Aug 11 2023,positive,i have yet to read the  book but a great movie about a complex man who was i think oblivious or nave about his space and time how can you be the head of the manhattan project and not understand that association with communism was detrimental
Aug 11 2023,negative,probably a good story but the movie was to hard to follow almost needed a program to figure out what was going on bounced back and forth so much i felt like a ping pong ball just tell the story dont try to be artistic
Aug 11 2023,positive,they should just give cillian murphy all the awards now what a phenomenal actor the whole cast is epic but he really carries this movie and i could watch even more than 3 hours of him doing it great watch
Aug 11 2023,positive,loved it and learned a lot
Aug 11 2023,positive,i thought the movies was outstanding great visual  historical presentation if i had one quibble it would be only that sometimes it was difficult to understand the conversations but overall it was an incredibly enjoyable movie
Aug 11 2023,positive,the movie was hard to follow at times and a little long
Aug 11 2023,positive,i couldnt pay attention to the first hour of the movie because of how inawe i was at the image i was seeing i can never see a movie in any other format again
Aug 11 2023,positive,amazingly well done from a historical and scientific perspective acting was amazing and the film pacing and scenes were just gripping
Aug 11 2023,positive,it helps to review old oppenheimer netflix  tubi documentaries before watching this great historical movie good acting too
Aug 11 2023,positive,what a movie what a screen awful seats
Aug 11 2023,positive,movie was too convoluted background sound too continual and annoying story line was lost much of the time
Aug 11 2023,positive,this was a rush of fear mix with what if today what are we building now
Aug 11 2023,positive,loved this movie history facts the actors
Aug 11 2023,positive,good movie too bad its a bit long but its worth it
Aug 11 2023,positive,great actinggreat storygreat movie  particularly in imax 70mm
Aug 11 2023,positive,excellent performances by all
Aug 11 2023,positive,this movie omfg is amazing
Aug 11 2023,positive,nolans symphony to oppenheimer set against the backdrop of a war and creation of the atom bomb a devastating global reset probably the most significant in history a complex subject a complex man a complex time beautifully acted and directed  a challenging smart movie for anyone who likes to engage their brain  probably not the whole truth its still hollywood after all but certainly inspired me to uncover more about the man
Aug 11 2023,positive,absolutely incredible spectacle this is christopher nolan at his best
Aug 11 2023,positive,amazing movie perhaps a bit to extense is like watching 2 movies glued together 1 of the creation of the atomic bomb and another parte 2 of the politic consequences of that achivement but still an amazing movie with a solid theme that isnt so usual in cinema nowadays when watching it i felt that i was watching another mini series like chernobyl recomend it 100 both
Aug 11 2023,positive,this movie was fantastic from beginning to end the acting by collins murphy and robert downey jr was oscar worthy
Aug 11 2023,positive,i thought the use of music and light as effect  was rather perfect for creating emotional
Aug 11 2023,positive,great movie didnt need to be 3 hours long
Aug 10 2023,negative,the movie was soo slow ugh  dont do itthe movie should  have been over an hour before it was ugh  so many supporting characters that really didnt need to be in the movie
Aug 10 2023,negative,i am convinced this industry is rigged and fake now that movie was sooooooooooooo boring there is no way the praise or ticket sales are legit my full theater was so bored and all collectively wondered what the hell is so good about this pretentious snooze fest really really really boring
Aug 10 2023,positive,i liked the back and forth with current vs past   the human aspect of this decision and where we are today
Aug 10 2023,positive,a cinematic masterpiece  i have become death the destroyer of worlds
Aug 10 2023,positive,the sheer criticality that christopher nolan applies to this wonderful masterpiece of cinema the masterful performance by cillian murphy has surely cemented his place among active lead men in american cinema the love tension between murphy and florence pugh adds critically to the story and allegations of how much of a womanizer oppenheimer was a beautiful story must watch
Aug 10 2023,positive,the movie was riveting from the opening to the very end cilian murphy and robert downey jr were fabulous  the whole ensemble was well cast
Aug 10 2023,positive,great movie would like to see it again to pick up anything i might have missed
Aug 10 2023,negative,someone shoot me please dooze fest
Aug 10 2023,positive,absolutely brilliant movie best film seen in ages cillian murphy was mesmorising and the supporting cast all fantastic
Aug 10 2023,positive,incredible  the three hours go by in a flash the actors gave oscar winning performances hollywood needs to evaluate the greatness of this movie and make more quality films
Aug 10 2023,positive,the film was magnificent if not a wee bit long i didnt have to pee until about 23500 and still managed to hold it until after the movie was finished which felt like an accomplishment in and of itself i really appreciated the number of random dudes popping up throughout the film perhaps none more than dr venture himself james urbaniak
Aug 10 2023,positive,very hard to understand with german accents 1st 40 min are slow acting great good for history buffs
Aug 10 2023,negative,i think the movie was way too long didnt really happen much in the first hour and a half or so overall boring i had watch a documentary about the construction of the american nuclear bomb which was better
Aug 10 2023,positive,one of the best movies ive seen in awhile great acting and story telling did not feel like three hours at all
Aug 10 2023,negative,too longconfusing time jumps inaudible audio at times some parts make sense and others just dont
Aug 10 2023,positive,very well done and extremely well acted an oscar frontrunner no doubt 
Aug 10 2023,positive,good and very loud
Aug 10 2023,positive,very intense captivating  movie not just topic matter  special visual effects but the quality of the acting the soundmusic component  the way it was filmed many well known actors in film but they completely disappeared into character the background music told a story of its own  complimented the scenes so much  well that i felt like i was watching a high paced action movie also lending to this action movieesque quality was how the movie was filmed short facedpaced but impactful scenes and seamlessly  effectively moving between different time periods  i was glued to my seat the whole time to my surprise despite this being a historical piece about a well known topic which i expected to detract from my enjoyment i was surprised  sad when the movie ended because i couldnt believe 3 hrs had gone by  i was so drawn in by the characters music  filming of this outstanding movie
Aug 10 2023,positive,loved the editing in this film they knew how to incorporate sound and vision where it compliments each other and the actors in this film also shined extremely i took my two sisters then we another time with my friend and even the second time i lived it where i would even go again
Aug 10 2023,positive,the best film i have watched in the last 56 years and one of the best if not the best nolan film
Aug 10 2023,positive,i love the movie has loud explode and more history i didnt know and also my favorite part is nuke was drop was fire and flame and was loud i love it  and the guy made oppenheimer i hope you win oscar and and dunk barbie movie in trash and also bad movie and give me heart attack i dont like it scary and i want oppenheimer win oscar trophy best movie base on true story thank you oppenheimer
Aug 10 2023,positive,this was absolutely one of the greatest movies ive ever seen its been a week since ive seen it and it still has me blown away
Aug 10 2023,positive,this film is a masterclass in directing captivating story and characters told in a creative manner just starts to drag at the end
Aug 10 2023,negative,really didnt like it because it seemed so disjointed acting was good but that was about all i can say for it it was drawn out over 3 hours they could have done it in half that time my advice dont bother a waste of money as far as im concerned
Aug 10 2023,positive,while it doesnt have the action scenes youd think are required to see on the largest screens the wonderful cinematography here makes seeing this in a 1431 imax gt theatre worth trying for whether its imax 70mm or imax gt laser youll enjoy the immersive world of 1940s los alamos and other locations beautifully captured by hoyte and nolan the life of oppenheimer is freshly presented and the entire cast is on form i could easily see oscar nominations for blunt downey and the brilliant cillian murphy another home run for nolan and his team an even bigger win for the magic of film for those lucky enough to see this in imax 70mm 70mm or 35mm
Aug 10 2023,positive,so great to see a none super hero movie that has me leaving the theaters wishing i could see it all over again for the first time christopher nolan is a generational talent and hits hard with another banger also great to see rdj in his bag for this movie and seeing him prove that he can do more then be tony stark
Aug 10 2023,positive,nearly flawless excellent performances  story important history and a thrilling drama from start to finish
Aug 10 2023,positive,one word   masterpiece
Aug 10 2023,positive,impressive raw invites us to reflect on the capacity for selfdestruction that human beings have
Aug 10 2023,positive,it was a great movie  i thought it would be too long but i enjoyed every minute
Aug 10 2023,positive,im a history lover but didnt know much about the manhattan project this movie is a crash course about how the atomic bomb came about and j robert oppenheimers role in it cillian murphy kills it in the lead role i also loved robert downy jrs parthe reminded me that he is a terrific actor dont go if youre thinking it will be lots of bomb explosion shotsits about a mans remarkable life and the awful things governments can do to the countrys heroes if theyre imperfect which they always are the movie made me interested to learn more so ive since listened to the book it was based on really good stuff
Aug 10 2023,positive,the movies was intriguing and kept my attention throughout the whole running time the characters were great and so were the actors the one issue i had was sometimes i couldnt hear the characters all that well and the polictical drama can drag for about to long for me it was an easy 48 out of 5 it was near perfect for me love christopher nolan
Aug 10 2023,positive,i absolutely loved all the acting and cast how the movie was made and the story very very well done however the extremely loud music often overpowering and interfering with the actors voices was most annoying and terrible the music takes badly over something really good its a truly sad music match
Aug 10 2023,positive,outstanding   5 stars  this film is not a superficial cgi bang bang car chase superhero waste of 2 hours of your life   this is a story of one of the greatest minds of the last 500 years and the reason the usa defeated japan  and oppenheimers lifelong nightmare as the destroyer of worlds  the movie helps us understand how humanity can destroy itself in seconds or not  oppenheimers paradox believing in 2 opposites at the same time creating the atom bomb and not wanting to use it affects every person living today    the director chris nolans who should get the directors academy award use of black and white film to explain the timeline was perfect  the sets and customs nailed it  the writing was superb all main actors and supporting cast gave extraordinary performances a rarity in cinema today    cillian murphy as oppy deserves best actor and robert downey jr the best supporting actor   oppenheimer is excellent entertainment with a message we have a choice
Aug 10 2023,positive,this movie played like a history book with so much intensity and action three hours seemed like 30 minutes i cant rave enough about how wonderful this movie is definitely a must see
Aug 10 2023,negative,i was super excited for this one but honestly it fell short cut scenes cut scenes and more cut scenes einstein was a meme and i was almost laughing when they would just cut to him all of a sudden sex scenes were unnecessary to the plot the rdj trial was interesting if you like law and order but it just felt unimportant to the greater themes honestly wasted my money seeing this
Aug 10 2023,positive,superb story gripping amazing film music was very good found the nudity unnecessary and a bit disappointing but otherwise the film was excellent
Aug 10 2023,positive,thoughtful insightful and well worth the 3 hour length true to history
Aug 10 2023,positive,great acting excellent filmography and sound
Aug 10 2023,positive,no other movie ever gave me goosebumps like this movie did absolutely amazing
Aug 10 2023,positive,surprisingly for a 3 hour movie it went by pretty quickly  it wasnt a thriller or shoot em up but it held my interest for the whole movie
Aug 10 2023,positive,its a very good movie
Aug 10 2023,negative,its inception with court hearings if you havent heaed about nuclear bombs by now i cant help you overrated its christopher nolan sucking his own dck nothing original or anything to talk about at the water cooler robert downey jr without makeup is the only saving grace this movie has if you have something else to do for 3 hours like sleeping cooking or stubbing your toe id do the latter
Aug 10 2023,positive,outstanding acting and amazing directing  presented in a thrilling engaging way  despite the 3 hours 
Aug 10 2023,positive,its fantastic with great pleasure to watch  i advise people to see it  its great movie
Aug 10 2023,positive,an interesting movie full of interesting and exciting events i recommend watching it
Aug 10 2023,positive,it is very beautiful i advise you to watch it
Aug 10 2023,positive,strong performances engrossing story well told best film of 2023 so far
Aug 10 2023,positive,that was a masterpiece no movies ive watched today can compare to that classic
Aug 10 2023,positive,didnt need to be 3 hours cillian amazing  sex scenes not necessary they were put there for people who arent intelligent enough to sit through a physics and politics movie  it was interesting but didnt meet the hype
Aug 10 2023,positive,this is another masterpiece from nolan what a movie the soundtrack is amazing the acting is amazing and the look of the movie is amazing overall hard to find words to describe this movie one actor that pushes this movie to greatness is trond fausa aurv√•g who plays kistiakowsky
Aug 10 2023,positive,very age appropriate very beautiful
Aug 10 2023,positive,undoubtedly the best movie of the year
Aug 10 2023,positive,one of the most powerfully acted films ive seen in a long time another nolan master class
Aug 10 2023,positive,i had a fantastic time watching it probably one of the best movies i have ever seen only downside i experienced was the fact that it was a bit loud but its mainly cause i am highly sensitive to noise still adored it though
Aug 10 2023,positive,an acting masterclass by murphy and downey jnr especially a film full of depth suspense and grit a must watch
Aug 10 2023,negative,not nolans best work due to its more grounded background mismatch between high dramatension and a more mundane biography
Aug 10 2023,positive,holy moly what a movie we were super extra and waited to see it in the 70 mmm imax and so worth the wait bravo christopher nolan his films are a constant reminder of excellent filmmaking and acting nolan and his entire team have made something extraordinary if the question is can a movie about a historical event be thrilling and suspenseful oppenheimer makes the answer a resounding yes my husband is currently reading the biography on which this film is based and he mentioned pretty much everything is exactly like the book this film elevated my thinking especially regarding the science of politics and the politics of science just so good and please give cillian murphy all the awards next season my goodness highly recommend this film bravo 
Aug 10 2023,positive,intense operatic and charged energy all the way through did not feel the 3 hour run time but the film does creak a bit in its third act exceptional performances abound with emily blunt and robert downey jr giving brilliant and at times unrecognizable portrayals every side character surrounds oppenheimer who while the very definite focus of the film is more the vessel with which it seems every other person aims to propel their motivations the film serves an admirable task serving as a science personal war and political courtroom drama all at once it surely must be nolans most dialogue heavy film but it amps every scene with a beautiful score gripping set pieces and nolans iconic eye for photography and editing perhaps the biggest critique in a move like this is the somewhat less than convincing turn in the third act involving a key supporting character which doesnt fully payoff undoubtedly this is a cost of having to weave and spotlight so many different characters and threads together
Aug 10 2023,positive,incredible acting on the parts of murphy and downey beautifully shot scenes very intense and interesting
Aug 10 2023,positive,ive seen this twice  it was mesmerizing especially if you see this in imax 70mm  the score is absolutely amazing  ludwig should get an award  in this movie you can see the transformation oppenheimer goes through and yeah i think people should watch this
Aug 10 2023,positive,it was amazing interesting and shocking how oppenheimer was treated  the actors and actresses were so good
Aug 10 2023,positive,the more you watch it the more details and parallels you look at youll understand the disaster thats about to unfold but it was visually very engaging 
Aug 10 2023,positive,an amazing telling of oppenheimers story in the race for the atomic bomb the soundtrack can overwhelm at times but it was a movie i can watch again and again
Aug 10 2023,negative,overall booorrrinnngggg  the acting is amazing the score is perfect the cutting is horrible far too many flashbacks and flashforwards this would be really good recut into a linear storyline the imitation game  was far superior forbes critic mark hughes   matched my thoughts perfectly  the story is really 3 different stories done by flashbackflashforwards in 3 different styles   the sex scenesnudity could be removed completely they dont help the story
Aug 10 2023,negative,very long political and little change of scene
Aug 10 2023,positive,superb acting and compelling story line throghout
Aug 10 2023,positive,some will leave the theater  somber  a piece of art so good your heart feels torn apart that its over somber from what you just witnessed
Aug 10 2023,positive,excellent movie very entertaining  great acting and should definitely be a contender for best movie
Aug 10 2023,positive,seen it twice and love it plan to see it again while its still in theaters
Aug 10 2023,positive,christopher nolan has held us in anticipation for nearly two years and it has paid off    i think that this is one of the greatest films i have ever seen on my 17 and a half years of my life cillian murphy has filled the shoes of j robert oppenheimer with gravitas the remaining cast fit themselves right in to their real life counterparts    of course i may be overselling this but nolan has used his nearly 3 decades of director expertise to craft an evocative portrayal of the mind of oppenheimer with this combined with the greatest visuals ever and the captivating and goosebump inducing score of ludwig g√∂ransson make this movie the must see movie of all time    thank you chrisopher nolan
Aug 10 2023,positive,perfect movie just perfect  the pace showing how corrupt our government can be if you dont fall in line  id see it again
Aug 10 2023,positive,but you need to supply urinals at the seats  the movie was much too long
Aug 10 2023,positive,a masterpiece of cinema christopher nolan delivered with genuine sincerity and vigour   if cillian murphy is denied an oscar for his haunting portrayal of j robert oppenheimer it shall be one of the great injustices in cinema history the supporting cast was brilliant especially emily blunt i lost count of the ensemble cast of brilliant actors lining up for a few moments of silver screen time in this 3hour journey that seemed to flash by   imax certainly does justice to the vision of nolan from overwhelming visuals of the subatomic world and the expanded universe to the floorshaking sound effects the fastcut scenes have an emotional impact when layered on unforgiving sounds   oppie is a flawed and haunted man a notion made quite evident from the beginning frames of the movie he brings the wideeyed wonder of a child as he journeys around the world in the quest for knowledge meeting giants of physics upon whose shoulders our modern life rests in a sense he goes through a complete antiheros journey from naivete to triumphal power and finally down to defeat disillusionment and despair all throughout we see his constant rationalization and justification of his inevitable march towards becoming the destroyer of worlds one is torn between sympathy and hatred for this deeply complex genius   there are so many cautionary tales in this movie about moments in history when one could swerve in a noble direction instead of taking humanity to the brink of selfdestruction there are other lessons about the politics and machinations of power and the urgency of avoiding enemies through humiliation the warnings of einstein delivered throughout the movie hammer home repeatedly   they say the age of discoveries is past us and that there is nothing new to unlock anymore oppie and his companions were the last great explorers of the universe what they unlocked remains the final frontier of science everything that follows rests on their shoulders
Aug 10 2023,positive,learned more history with this movie kudos to robert downey jr hopefully will win best supporting actor excellent performance
Aug 10 2023,positive,three hours flew by as you watch a brilliant man with a brilliant team challenging the boundaries of science while being challenged by the world projecting myself feeling for him wishing to be him and wishing to never experience his main all come about immediately
Aug 10 2023,positive,well made loved every effect fantastic story
Aug 10 2023,positive,excellent movieseems pretty factually correct with a little hollywood drama and loud music tells a back story about oppenheimer that few people know does an excellent job in presenting the dilemma on whether we should have developed and used nuclear weapons without really taking a side
Aug 10 2023,positive,saw this in the theatre in imax format would strongly encourage to see it this way if possible the sound design shines in moments where nolan explores oppenheimers inner thoughts and the power of an atomic bomb surprisingly given the subject and scope of the film the lengthy run time goes by rather quickly some dialogue is muffled per usual for nolan but it seems as if it may have been intentional in parts it can be hard to keep all the names faces and relationships of the characters straight at times but this is a minor complaint for such a sprawling narrative
Aug 10 2023,positive,christopher nolen is a superb director and i was amazed at how he told this story the techniques of how the story was shot and edited really moved the narrative along even at a heavy 3 hour pace cillian murphy who ive seen in several other films was really spectacular and he is the real deal plus robert downey jr was equally spectacular and was a superb foil to murphys oppenheimer just a super film and nothing this year has come closethough that might be pretty easy considering everything else has basically been a marvel movie definitely a must see
Aug 10 2023,positive,the movie started off interesting with awesome sound effect and idea revolving around dieing star  however the movie extremely boring and revolving around the politics that comes from people holding grudges over a genius who realized the he helped creat the armagedon weapon or at the least start of the possibilities and how he regrets it it is not worth the time and compare to inception this movie is showing us what may have happened in history as opposed to awe my brain with intelligence of a complex storyline  still not sure why audience would like this movie
Aug 10 2023,positive,the name of the movie is oppenheimer many of the reviews have discussed to take on the man my view this wasnt a take on the man at all he was the vehicle to discuss the complex issue welcome to mass destruction and i suppose in an ancillary way how valuable people are treated by governments that need them
Aug 10 2023,neutral,while the subject matter is important the movie was much too long and dragged in places
Aug 10 2023,positive,i really liked the movie for its drama editing and historical basis   i hated the violent and perverse previews of coming attractions
Aug 10 2023,negative,unbelievably boring how is this getting such good reviews
Aug 10 2023,positive,too long  1st half was very confusing with flashbacks and not knowing who was who  2nd half was better
Aug 10 2023,positive,very captivating and keeps you interested
Aug 10 2023,positive,oppenheimer is the most intellectually stimulating movie that i have ever seen    a real tour de force
Aug 10 2023,positive,impeccable craft and excellent acting
Aug 10 2023,neutral,i really wanted to like this movie i found myself nodding off about an hour in the old film fatman and little boy was a better film i believe this was overhyped it was better to watch it at the theater with the captions in order to keep up with what was going on 
Aug 10 2023,positive,the movie was very interesting well made great actorrs
Aug 10 2023,positive,excellent movie interesting educational and very well done acting writing and sets were fantastic
Aug 10 2023,positive,best movie ive ever seen teared up in the first 15 minutes absolutely must watch
Aug 10 2023,neutral,ok this was an unbelievable movie experience this is the best movie christopher nolan has ever done the acting is superb great performances all round but the sound was too loud way too loud i even brought er 15 earplugs and my ears were still ringing after the show and right now hours later it was way too loud it was so loud the speakers were distorting way way too loud
Aug 10 2023,positive,i am a nolan fanboy havent watched dunkirk so im a terrible fanboy at that so my opinion is biased   but i thought this was amazing great acting great pacing incredible story telling was on display in this movie to me at the basic level what happens in this movie is boring as shit just bunch of white men in a room discussing a level of science and math that ill never be able to comprehend and yet i was invest i was glued to the screen i credit chris to be able to achieve this his ability to tell this story was smart well thought out and incredibly well executed     only negative i have is imax this was the first film ive watched in imax and will probably be the last it took about half an hour for my nausea to subside since the screen was so big so that hindered my enjoyment a bit still loved the movie but next time ill be watching on a nonimax screen
Aug 9 2023,positive,pros great film in terms of filmmaking and seeing it in the imax 70mm was a great experience in terms of soundvisual quality also thought the acting was great all around so that is the 5 stars its not a depressing movie all history is depressing but its just a heavy movie on a heavy subject matter   cons wished nolan had made more acknowledgements such as showing actual or recreated images of how the atomic bomb actually impacted hiroshima and nagasaki as well as acknowledgements of the history of the hispanic and indigenous locals whos land were taken away from them for los alamos it would have been better to also see some present day stats on who has how many atomic bombs because of this as well as how oppenheimer lived out the rest of his life in short summary blurbs
Aug 9 2023,positive,great historical information great cast
Aug 9 2023,positive,it was a powerful picture and so compellingly written and filmed the imax experience was exceptional a very thoughtprovoking story to start conversations about so many societal issues
Aug 9 2023,positive,excellent acting well known cast fascinating story based on true accounts
Aug 9 2023,positive,interesting story  good acting by all chacters seemed a little long during some of the technical discussions  our theater played the sound way too loud  parts of the movie were very uncomfortable because of that loudness
Aug 9 2023,negative,this movie is just too long and not interesting enough  was tempted to leave multiple times  decided to wait for a grand finale that never arrived its a huge disappointment not sure why there are good reviews for this extremely boring long repetitive tedious  not recommended at all
Aug 9 2023,positive,movie of the year watching it in the way nolan intended was definitely worth the wait and effort
Aug 9 2023,positive,it wasnt bad but it was confusing at first and even after it started making sense it was just an okay watch wouldnt watch it again but i dont regret watching
Aug 9 2023,positive,to slow kinda of boring
Aug 9 2023,negative,twice as long as necessary with no reenactment of bombs landing on japan little scientific detail and overly reliant on lengthy discourse on american politics overbearing and disconnected musical score crying out for zimmermans genius indulgent extended lines for so so many actors seemed excessive and killls the pacing
Aug 9 2023,positive,this is honestly a fantastic work of art as someone who hasnt dug too deep into the history of the atomic bomb this movie really helped me learn more about the creation i did get a bit lost in the movie sometimes but dialogue and casting was really well done and the visual and sound effects  are astonishing highly recommend
Aug 9 2023,positive,i was prepared for disappointment due to high expectations but within the first ten minutes i realized it was a stunning masterpiece movie of the year yes
Aug 9 2023,positive,good flick  a bit long but we found the historical references interesting made us want to know more about what went down
Aug 9 2023,positive,christopher nolan made a movie about one of the greatest crimes against humanity without ever giving the context of its effect or its victims and instead made the author of those crimes the innocent and naive pilgrim who became a victim himself
Aug 9 2023,positive,it was an education on the manhattan project for those of us that were born after that time period the acting was superb and i see several oscar nominations in the making it was a quick three hours i highly recommend this film
Aug 9 2023,negative,the film was ok the 70mm imax experience was very good but i was not happy with the theater the screen at the king of prussia pa theater has a number of bad spots on the screen so it looked like the actors had warts on their faces they really need to repair the screen there was also a light bulb on behind the screen which was very distracting i cant believe that they left that light on for the entire movie  also the popcorn was cold
Aug 9 2023,negative,the movie contained unnecessary sex scenes that could have been left out of the movie and lost any of the story we the public and christians didnt need to know about his sex life i and my two friends that were with me will not speak well regarding the movie also the dialogue was drowned out by the loud background music the movie overall we thought was poorly done and didnt hold our interest so therefore knowing your industry it will probably be nominated for best picture and sound from what im hearing the movie is not getting much positive word of mouth
Aug 9 2023,negative,dramatic foreboding character development  change scene    top class performance as you would expect could have been so educationalinspirational towards the sciences instead of the plight of the working man    was watchable obviously will be oscars for sure so many esg ticks  
Aug 9 2023,positive,if you can get past the constant and highly intrusive music score you will find it an engrossing film  it runs three hours  im pretty sure 2 hours and 45 minutes of it have music intruding on what youre trying to watch and listen to  i think its one of the worst uses of music ive ever encountered in a film
Aug 9 2023,positive,an amazing true story and incredible performances by an stellar cast
Aug 9 2023,positive,fantastic film anyone who can should see this masterpiece
Aug 9 2023,positive,very long dragged out seemed like it was 2 movie plots mixed into one hard to hear what the actors are saying good from a thematic analysis
Aug 9 2023,positive,at times the sound was so so loud   im sure it was meant to contribute to the scene but way too loud  i liked the acting very much   great movie all around
Aug 9 2023,positive,thought it was great but at times the flipping back and forth in time was confusing
Aug 9 2023,positive,a lot of content to digest but very well executed excellent production casting and actingparticularly murphy and downey jr a three hour film that felt more like two much more engaging than nolans most recent major effort tenet
Aug 9 2023,positive,amazing cinematography had me shaking at the scene of the bomb test
Aug 9 2023,positive,what else would you expect fam got to watch it in early screenings and christopher nolan sir you never disappoint  this was a masterpiece of a film go watch it guys youre missing one of the best biographical movies ever made by one of the greatest directors ever in hollywood
Aug 9 2023,positive,nolan did it again he was definitely the man for the job i couldnt think of anyone that would cover a documentarylike movie on such a complex topic better than him the main actors were phenomenal and the way they delivered lines just hit the spot for me i really hope for cilian to get an oscar he definitely deserves one the cinematography sound emotions everything was there and only added to the quality of the movie if you have a chance definitely go and watch it on the big screens while you still can it is an experience you dont want to miss
Aug 9 2023,positive,funnily enough 3 hours didnt feel too long but maybe a tiny bit too short the reallife controversy surrounding oppenheimer was even more complicated than this film suggests painting him in a light that might very well be a bit too positive i also think that this film should have dedicated more time to the controversy of whether dropping the atomic bomb on hiroshima and nagasaki was genuinely necessary or if the war could have been won conventionally and the bombs were dropped just for the sake of showing off its not like the movie completely ignores this idea but its giving it a chance to breathe either i still thoroughly enjoyed my time and was pleasantly surprised that a 3hour film can not feel too long
Aug 9 2023,positive,we were very impressed watching this movie  it was kind of long but it was worth every minute of our time
Aug 9 2023,positive,excellent all around the only thing more devastating than the movies subject matter is watching barbie after it dont do it trust me
Aug 9 2023,positive,this was one of the movies for which you want to stand up at the end and just clap for two minutes straight i didnt know much about the history of the atom bomb but either way i really enjoyed the movie i was surprised by their representation of einstein but that probably wasnt inaccurate at the time in which the movie takes place
Aug 9 2023,positive,acting was excellent very well done great drama very entertaining and informative
Aug 9 2023,positive,this is a mentally intense movie about the man  his mind his fallacies his genius and internal conflicts it helps to do a little research before seeing the movie as it will allow you to keep up with the extreme nuances that are presented for the generation that lived through these times it will haunt your psyche it will be worth it
Aug 9 2023,neutral,3 hours listening to discussions between a lot of different characters hard to follow historically an interesting movie however could be done in 1 hour
Aug 9 2023,negative,i walked out i couldnt hear about a security breach or communist one more time
Aug 9 2023,positive,i liked the movie a lot however the flashbacks and time sequencing are confusing the acting and writing are excellent
Aug 9 2023,negative,yikes first of all this movie was an hour and a half too long there were way too many characters with foreign names to remember couldnt even hear all the dialogue over the annoying music that played in every scene and i dont get all the hype behind having to see this in imax half the movie is set in a tiny room full of dudes asking each other questions if its not one tiny room its another tiny room with a different set of dudes asking each other questions rdj was the saving grace in this movie and the only reason its getting one star instead of zero couldnt pay me to watch it again
Aug 9 2023,positive,so far its the best movie from nolan a masterpiece
Aug 9 2023,positive,loved it it is a masterpiece cillian murphy is exceptional portraying openheimr
Aug 9 2023,positive,well written and fastpaced  robert downey jr did a fantastic job as expected best supporting actor would definately be possible
Aug 9 2023,positive,the trinity test is one of the greatest moment and will be remembered in cinema history everyone was so captivated that there was pin drop silence in a fullhouse theatre no munching popcorn no squeaky chairs nothing that truly showcases the beauty of the movie  its might sound generic but literally all aspects were great and work together so well collectively to tell the story beautifully the visuals the music the cinematography best biography ive seen hands downs being historically accurate while also being so much fun and captivating is truly the beauty of nolans direction im not being a fanboy but nolan deserves all the credit here most of the story is about a single person and hes the person of focus most of the time yet nolan manages to keep everyone hooked for every single moment of the 3hours even after the movie ended i just sat there till after the end of credits and not because the movie felt incomplete but rather because its truly complete and youre just sitting there thinking through it knowing what a great time you had and acknowledging thats it the movie has ended    i feel the critique mostly comes from people who lack some basic understanding of the history of the trinity project  the war and some basic concepts of the bomb    would highly recommend to watch veritasiums yt video about oppenheimer which helps a lot
Aug 9 2023,positive,very well done movie the acting was great with a spectacular cast captivating story well directed
Aug 9 2023,positive,an allstar cast well absent was bruce willis and nicolas cage lol     with a few books that detail much of the same in this movie nolan did have some artistic additions however some parts where you would think were artistic where in fact well documented like the truman scene    its a 3hour movie and some folks from what i gathered didnt like the going back and forth in time i had no problem with that nor did my wife     it is a very good movie very well done actors and actresses all doing their part with excellence
Aug 9 2023,positive,great but not a masterpiece tension building leading up to the test detonation was spectacular but the movie drags for the last hour
Aug 9 2023,positive,as a writerdirector christopher nolan captured attention from his first film following 1998 a spare neonoir thriller through his contribution to the batman canon with the dark knight trilogy to innovative mindbenders like inception and tenet and even historical epics like dunkirk  oppenheimer may be nolans best film to date  this film is the biography of j robert oppenheimer the father of the atomic bomb but rather than focusing solely on oppenheimers time as director of the manhattan project nolan offers a sweeping epic of oppenheimers career from his early years in academia and leftleaning political circles through his time directing the efforts to develop the bomb at los alamos to his eventual undoing during the cold war at the hands of a bureaucrat who was embarrassed by oppenheimer at a congressional hearing years before  in telling this sweeping story nolan uses his typical nonlinear approach  if fairness he does employ blackandwhite flashbacks to give the audience a fighting chance at keeping up  in his script nolan invokes a wide range of historical figures  president harry truman scientists albert einstein werner heisenberg go see the play copenhagen enrico fermi  but the film is at its best when it explores the genius and the foibles of its title character a railthin cillian murphy  tvs peaky blinders  robert oppenheimer singlehandedly transformed theoretical physics in the us  but he also had the leadership skills to effectively manage a group of egotistical worldclass scientists at los alamos  perhaps most important oppenheimer had the prescience to understand and lobby against the nuclear arms race he knew his accomplishment would unleash  but oppenheimer was also a voracious womanizer painfully na√Øve about the political consequences of advocating for leftwing causes in the era of joe mccarthy irrationally and randomly stubborn and intentionally defenseless when facing a sinister bureaucratic machine  nolan addresses this complexity without criticism or judgment  to convey this story nolan relies on much more than his screenplay  the excellent score by ludwig g√∂ransson oscar for black panther emmy for the mandalorian regularly employs a disconcerting rumbling noise to denote impending personal disaster as well as the beginning of an atomic reaction  cinematographer hoyte van hoytema nope nolans tenet interstellar and dunkirk creates visual imagery that while metaphorical is perhaps more impactful than viewing actual footage of an atomic reaction  the use and the elimination of sound during the first atomic test is unexpected and inspired  finally nolans quick cuts and energetic editing create an uneasy sense of cohesion  nolan uses oppenheimer to do much more than detail the development of the hydrogen bomb  he does more than effectively convey the full complexity of one of the most important figures of the twentieth century  from my perspective nolan uses his narrative to make some significant sobering comments about power  he makes a compelling case that while individuals and mankind are inescapably drawn to creating and using ultimate power the arrogance and the singlemindedness of this pursuit simultaneously sow the seeds of our future destruction  oppenheimer offers visuals that im still replaying in my head  it conveys ideas that im thinking about days after seeing the film  christopher nolans latest effort may be the most technically complete film that ive seen in the past several years  its refreshing to see a powerful story and this level of cinematic sophistication in service of something other than a set of comic book characters
Aug 9 2023,positive,this was an amazingly shot movie most if not all are practically shot without the use of vfx which i find quite amazing when visualising the thought process of oppenheimer    i recognised most actors even in small rolls which was quite amazing just shows that many actors wanted to be part of this amazing work    murphy puts in an amazing performance which so far i expect to do put him in contention for an oscar for the leading actor position i also suspect rdj might walk away with a best supporting actor if not he should definitely be on the nomination list    all the actors did a fantastic job the cinematography was amazing and the direction    some people complained about the dialogue but i could hear everything fine    this film kept me engaged for the entire runtime
Aug 9 2023,positive,i never have a problem with long movies because i want my movie experience to last as long as possible but i must say i didnt understand why it was soooo important to show soooo much  of the political maneuvering by the character played by r downy jrlead character should be up for an oscar but i also dont understand the need for the gratuitous nakedness of the supporting actress   i thought those days were gone in hollywood
Aug 9 2023,positive,amazing storytelling acting and music  leaving the cinema was very introspective experience with thoughts of the fragility of life and the immense power we have to destroy ourselves
Aug 9 2023,positive,i only went for my husband  absolutely loved it
Aug 9 2023,positive,very good  great story and excellent performances  it was about 30 minutes too long however  it could have easily been edited down  also the scene with opp and his first wife naked in the hearing room was just dumb
Aug 9 2023,positive,unlike most others i found the film somewhat boring and actionless     i kept waiting for something to happen and then even the bombings in japan lacked drama     does anybody really care about political infighting from the 1940s and 1950s we have more than enough of that today     i sat through the entire 3plus hours but felt empty and robbed of my time  afterwards
Aug 9 2023,negative,movie overall had good story and good acting but for a movie that is mostly talking it shouldnt have been as long as it was couldve removed the unnecessary sex scenes
Aug 9 2023,positive,great movie  a bit long
Aug 9 2023,positive,great story  an american story that was told in a direct and understanble manner  this movie should be part of history classes
Aug 9 2023,positive,fascinating insight to oppenheimers life and struggle with brilliance
Aug 9 2023,positive,i like this movie its a must see
Aug 9 2023,positive,its an awesome movie to watch with the family
Aug 9 2023,positive,was intersted though like that drama in it and the story behind it
Aug 9 2023,negative,to disjointed storyline was hard to follow
Aug 9 2023,positive,i liked the technical parts about making and testing the bomb  they could have left out the nudity  you still can have romance with out being graphic  the political parts at the end could have been condensed some  the movie was too long
Aug 9 2023,positive,this is an exceptional movie bringing together c nolan and c murphy was a clever move loved the classic feel best performance of the season hope they bring more like this
Aug 9 2023,positive,i cant believe it this movie is at least another kissimmee with related to it and this movie to put honestys actually better than the tiny 73 movie of bobby the result list a few months ago its actually better than it but the quality and whats happening in the story
Aug 9 2023,positive,i will watch this movie over and over again if i have to thats why i rated it 5 stars
Aug 9 2023,positive,exceeded all expectations absolutely riveting from start to finish i was nervous about the length of the film being 3 hours but i never looked at my watch once time flew by because it was so well done amazing cast and very thought provoking
Aug 9 2023,positive,a praise video with no less than 20 characters
Aug 9 2023,positive,i reccommend this movie to friends and family i must watch do not hesitate watch it now you will not regret it
Aug 9 2023,positive,excellent choice for a family movie great action also
Aug 9 2023,positive,breathtaking historical scientific movie i would really love to see more of this like the way they think about building the bomb
Aug 9 2023,negative,although bolstered by excellent performances and occasional moments of intrigue and excitement the film is too fussily edited and bound up in its own narrative format to let the viewer fully engage with any of the many themes it presents an overly bombastic score punctuates each scenes drama with a sledgehammer force that would have naturally occoured if the story presented had been told in a more linear fashion the end result of the filmmakers drive to fabricate twists and turns and drama through the editing is an underwhelming and at times confusing biopic of an objectively terrible person     also the atom bomb looks like shit it was the most evil invention ever created and it looks on screen like close ups of a car fire
Aug 9 2023,positive,movies with christopher nolan can never be wrong the movie is a hit and have some life lesson on it
Aug 9 2023,positive,never in my life have i gotten so many goosebumps in one movie christopher nolan somehow made a history story into an exciting journey through the making of the atomic bomb
Aug 9 2023,positive,wow this movie is a masterpiece the goosebump you get when watching the movie a truly magnificent thriller that will make you ask for more cillian murphy is just amazing
Aug 9 2023,positive,incredible the visuals story and score work together so well
Aug 9 2023,positive,oppenheimer is an intelligent movie about an important topic that is never less than powerfully acted incredibly entertaining
Aug 9 2023,positive,great movie about history and world war teaches more about the world war and it teaches the new generation about the war and gives them an insight of history
Aug 9 2023,positive,fascinating movie the performances are completely great it gives one alot to think about the historical stuff  im in love with nolans role
Aug 9 2023,positive,compelling    nolan shows once again that he is one of the greatest story tellers and film makers of our time the screenplay brings everything together and it makes a great job of making something that is stereotypically difficult to understand such as a little thing as theoretical and nuclear phyics as something that a general audience member could consume by explaining things via marbles and whatnot on the contrary and simultaneously nolan masters the art of plot movement with high stakes scene choreography from different moments in time     the main cast completely knocks this movie out of the park the main 3 cillian murphy as the titular character emily blunt as kitty oppenheimer and rdj as lewis strauss all kill their roles as someone who knew nothing about any of the real life people i totally bought into what they were selling murphy embodies the anxiety induced by guilt in oppenheimers endeavors the prometheus comparisons are on par but ill also include icarus who flew too close to the sun his aspirations to create and evolve physics and truly create something that will change all of mindkind leads him down the path of faux glory and self satisfaction he goes down this road with blinders on and sadly even when he knows hes gone too far he keeps going murphy shows the complexity of man especially for one such as a scientist who deals with the burden of the ability for change his performance begs a character study on hubris and capturing knowledge is power all of that leading to an academy nod would be some nice razzle dazzle as well     emily blunt holds her own atop this stacked cast he acting ability is something ive always considered was underrated she doesnt play a likable character but instead a strong and loyal one you can tell that through her prowess that she would be someone who oppenheimer would see as equal to in marriage rdj brings his charm and reminds people that he is great at playing real people just as well as himself in his roles hes slick enough to be a villain and the audience not even know it if the rest of the cast had been given more time to shine then obviously the talent in this movie would have risen to the challenge but at a 3 hour run time im glad we got we got for everyone to showcase the importance of their characters in oppenheimers story honorable mention to matt damon for making general leslie grover what could have been a single note annoying ass character someone with layers and motivation      ludwig g√∂rannsson puts his whole in this music the music makes what would be boring expositional scenes seem like essential and exploding pun hella intended climactic acts the crescendos match the booms of bombs and makes you feel the anxiety that oppenheimer feels this along with the fantastic sound design makes you feel as if you are there in los alamos with the scientists and army people the use of practical affects show that this form of art isnt dead and can be used efficiently in a realistic sense i simply cant wait to see the special features to see how the explosions were done nolan really feels like he made a brand spankin new movie with old school methods but still didnt reinvent the wheel     this movie is for the cinema lover for a casual this movie could potentially come across as boring for the runtime alone especially in a world of action packed superhero movies and tom cruise mind fucking stunt flicks the music and practical effects are really what sold the movie to me as 5 stars the story is filled with names and events that require you to remember with the quick cutaway flashbacks being used at a minimal rate the pacing is fine until the 3rd act where there are a few twists that have you think while the story doesnt wait for you nolan gives an unforgivingly complex and riveting story of history that truly matters     having this and barbie in theatres at the same time reminds why cinema truly matters and that all good story telling needs is just good story telling no matter the genre or medium this movie was the fucking bomb pun intended accidentally on purpose 
Aug 9 2023,positive,the greatest movie i have ever witnessed but not an action nor adventure but intriguing enticing and most importantly fearful and by fearful we see foreshadowing through the phrase now i have become death the destroyer of worlds
Aug 9 2023,positive,great performances by everyone lots of great actors interesting movie
Aug 9 2023,positive,fantastic storytelling despite its length the movie feels fastpaced the acting is thoroughly superb   the last third however leaves a somewhat miscarried impression throughout the movie one cannot help but think that nolan is completely in love with his protagonist he seems to realize this and tries  especially in the movies last third  to emphasize oppenheimers moral ambigutiy in this story unfortunately for nolan this attempt to provide depth complexity and shadiness to his protagonist fails to be convincing when every critic in the movie is sure to add that oppie is of course a genius and the most important man in the history of mankind  it is still a great watch for entertaining purposes that is but it is unsuitable due to its overall positive potrayal to act as a reliable basis for a public debate about oppenheimers moral integrity lets hope it will not be misused this way
Aug 9 2023,positive,christopher nolan doesnt disappoint great direction and screen play
Aug 9 2023,negative,was nut able to view movie
Aug 9 2023,positive,trinity and the killer
Aug 9 2023,negative,ive had the unfortunate opportunity to watch this twice in imax this is 7 hours of my life ill never get back oppenheimer is dull i mean profoundly dull about as exciting as a trip to the dentist there is so much wrong with this movie i would be writing for hours about how tragic it is 110
Aug 9 2023,positive,this movie was an absolute stunning experience from the imagery in the film all the way to the deep thought provoking messages this is one of if not my top movies ive seen
Aug 9 2023,positive,70mm with the sound of the speakers was an amazing experience highly recommend
Aug 9 2023,negative,rated x for sure wasnt necessary to have the sex scenes didnt go there with my grandkids to learn about sex   thought it would a historical movie way to long of a movie the sex scenes were very disturbing at least they should been under the covers did he really have sex at the hearing in front of his wife and with everyone watching   disgusting  is this history
Aug 9 2023,negative,this was a truly awful 3 hours once you hear the violin you cant unhear itno really it is 3 hours of butt clenching tension fast paced one line at a time clip after clip after clip my wife and i left the movie with tinnitus and headaches i admit i learned a lot but i never want to sit through this experience ever again the actors were saying their lines and it never pulled us into the story it just felt like actors saying their lines fast paced over and over and over constant violin back and forth tension that butt clench and no release until the movie is over and then finally you get to use the bathroom to urinate and complain about how awful it was the entire drive home im sorry this movie sucks
Aug 9 2023,positive,very interesting part of history brought to the big screen 
Aug 9 2023,positive,this film is a masterpiece nolan and his cast and crew deserve high praise and many awards 
Aug 9 2023,positive,oppenheimer is one of the greatest movies i have ever seen i went into it knowing it would be decent but i was slightly worried that it might be a bit slow and perhaps too long as it turns out though i couldnt have been more wrong i have never sat through a movie of such considerable length without being even slightly listless or impatient the movie had my full attention from start to finish when i say it is one of the greatest movies ive ever seen im not suggesting that this film is for everyone however i believe this work of cinema is worth viewing for everyone regardless of their preferences in regards to genre themes political leanings or their academic background i intend to see it again before it leaves theaters and i will try to convince all of my friends and acquaintances that it is worth seeing the subject matter of this film is of the greatest importance and it is very much worth deep discussions with oneself and others
Aug 9 2023,positive,very good movie lots of details wish they would of went into more detail about actually dropping the bombs
Aug 9 2023,negative,edited like a tik tok video very odd and no story build up
Aug 9 2023,positive,the acting was wonderful the story intriguing loved watching the movie
Aug 9 2023,positive,loved it what a complex movie i learn a lot along the way also
Aug 9 2023,positive,a little confusing at times as scenes switched time and location interesting depiction of that piece of our history  a bit sad when recalling the incredible loss of life
Aug 9 2023,positive,interesting and boring at the same time i really wanted to leave half way through but stuck it out could have left and not missed much way too long and way to repetitive the acting was good but the movie as a whole way overhyped
Aug 9 2023,positive,good movie about bombs
Aug 9 2023,positive,you must see it in imax just not the same on a smaller screen
Aug 9 2023,negative,oppenheimer is one of nolans weakest films while the acting and photography were great and i could hear every line of dialogue the story was unfocused and was poorly paced the nudity was wholly unnecessary and felt very contrary to what nolan has stood for in the past robert downy jr stole the show and gave a careerbest performance but his role was significantly larger than ever necessary in the film it may even warrant its own movie if any one of the stories was individually the focus of this movie it would have been much better however there were far too many to effectively tell in a threehour movie it is quite obvious that it is adapted from a book since there are a great many extraneous details and storylines kept in if you want to see a movie about the creation of the atomic bomb this is not the movie for you
Aug 9 2023,positive,excellent acting  informative context and perspective
Aug 9 2023,positive,beautifully shot acted and scored fastpaced and gripping throughout
Aug 9 2023,positive,started out a little slow first 20 mi was well worth it
Aug 9 2023,negative,its a lot this movie couldve been an hour long instead it repeated the same scenes  like watching cspan from every angle about the same topic  im drained
Aug 9 2023,positive,movie was riveting  three hours flew by
Aug 9 2023,positive,sometimes it was hard to hear the dialogue due to the music being louder than the voices  id like to watch it again with closed captions to catch all the things i missed
Aug 9 2023,positive,intense and compelling 
Aug 9 2023,positive,what a fantastic film brilliant and bold and so striking with cillian murphys always amazing acting and a script that encapsulates the storys tone while also being extremely entertaining and so thought provoking one thing i particularly loved was the sound design and soundtrack the music blended so well and the sound effectsdirecting was instrumental to the overall effect what an amazing movie about something so critical to our history and society it neither glorifies nor shames merely putting in perspective the creation of the atomic bomb in the eyes of the creators one of my top three movies for sure
Aug 9 2023,positive,a 3hr movie that never dragged  kept my interest the entire time  great job by the director and cast  the best ive seen this year
Aug 9 2023,positive,terrific acting  the film brought to light the truths
Aug 9 2023,positive,one of christopher nolans best films with a career defining performance by murphy
Aug 9 2023,positive,fantastic movie from beginning to end the government is crooked and covers their butts i pray for my family and the rest of the world that we never go through a nuclear war
Aug 9 2023,positive,saw it in imax and was glad for it although it was quite loud performances were nuanced and excellent cillian murphy and robert downey jr owned it but there wasnt a weak lesser character seen a gripping story that flashes around in time but was easy enough to follow even if the actual events were so utterly horrifying and worldchanging nothing silly or light in the monumental story of the bomb nor in oppenheimer himself was a bit worried about length of film but it goes by far quicker than expected a definite must see for 2023  now bring on napoleon
Aug 9 2023,positive,sound too loud couldnt hear dialog in places
Aug 9 2023,positive,kept our attention for the entire 3 hours
Aug 9 2023,positive,excellent story   great cast  solid performance
Aug 9 2023,positive,sooooo long but fantastic
Aug 9 2023,positive,from the second the movie started i was at the edge of my seat the casting cinematography the realism in the history of oppenheimer and accuracy in telling the story easily the best movie i have seen in a long time cillian murphy and christopher nolan absolutely sold this as the most beautiful but realistic movie of 2023 i would watch again and again amazing
Aug 9 2023,positive,it was scary but it was a true story
Aug 9 2023,positive,superb acting and great story telling it is one of the best movies that ive ever seen
Aug 9 2023,negative,terrible movie definitely not family friendly we left half way through the movie
Aug 9 2023,positive,overall i enjoyed the movie many great performances i felt that the time devoted to the backstory about oppenheimers wives was wasted his so called communist affilations through the women and his brother could have been dealt with more efficiently  the movie could have gone heavier on the actual science and less on gratuitous sex im sure 34 of the audience have no clue about fission fusion particle acceleration uranium plutonium or deuterium heavy water at least educate the audience on the rudiments of nuclear physics instead of showing meaningless ta scenes like so many politicians today strauss was a narcissistic selfaggrandizing rat some things never change
Aug 9 2023,positive,everything nolan does best in one film  a bit like interstellar meets imitation game  it felt like every scene was masterful the acting by cillian and downey was outstanding the breadth he got to on weighty subjects physics communismcold war an enigmatic oppenheimer  was impressive  only drawback like most nolan films was length and the roles he gives his female leads
Aug 9 2023,positive,maybe the best movie ever made
Aug 9 2023,positive,great movie telling history that may not always be comforting  it will win numerous awards  im glad that i saw it but it would be difficult to see again given the emotional resonance and the issues that are still with us today
Aug 9 2023,positive,not for kids nor teens or anyone who needs roller coaster theatrics and supernatural fantasy action   this is an american and world history lesson dramatically reenacted  most people dont want to know how hot dogs and sausages are madethey just want to see them on the grill   oppenheimer had quite a lot of grilling in it mentally and emotionally   looking back in time its hard to know the prevailing political and social climate because we have evolved into disunity in america   patriotism is a dirty word to many of the selfserving the narcissistic and the divisive larvae slithering the streets now but 1940s americans were overwhelmingly determined to overcome the nazi shadow and the imperial forces of japan the sooner the better   had they a clue about the danger of stalinist russia who knows whether the british idea to attack russia would have gained vast american support especially with the confidence that came with the abomb   this movie cemented one thing in my mind by its endjoe mccarthy was not a misguided crackpot  communism indeed had a cancerous effect on the weakminded in america   this movie delves into many of the political issues which have been swept under the carpet   my one regret about this movie is that there was not an epilogue posted for the audience to read whatever happened in the sunset years of oppenheimer his family strauss and several of the other prominent figures in the movie
Aug 9 2023,positive,didnt drag like most 3 hour movies riveting drama for those who have interest
Aug 9 2023,positive,this was a masterpiece a very thought provoking movie i love christopher nolan the cast was superb as well
Aug 9 2023,positive,absolute brilliant story telling one of the most powerful movies i have seen in a long time
Aug 9 2023,positive,it filled in the storyline well
Aug 9 2023,positive,great movie enjoyed it
Aug 9 2023,positive,great portrayal of history and the people that lived it
Aug 9 2023,positive,perhaps the finest movie ive seen in a decade  excellent on all levels individual performances compelling story line film editing  murphy is terrific in the lead  potential for 45 academy awards
Aug 9 2023,positive,the movie was good dragged a little  it did get confusing keeping everyone straight it jumped around a lot i thought the ending was the best part of the movie it is a mustsee movie                                                                          it did  get confusing
Aug 9 2023,positive,compelling movie with a serious subject that inspires deeper thinking about the complexities of warfare from many angles excellent performances by lead actors and all secondary actors too film score is effective at heightening tension with few memorable melodic moments some plot ideas not easy to follow yet the story comes across powerfully fundamentally saddened to realize that the truth is not always most important  that deceivers have and still are allowed to flourish unlessuntil good people with the utmost strength in character stand up to them
Aug 9 2023,positive,informative kept your attention character defining excellent 
Aug 9 2023,positive,thought thered be more bombs going off more action and intensity too long otherwise it was alright
Aug 9 2023,positive,the story of oppenheimer is mainly about his personal torment over the overwhelming deadliness of the bomb also about his personal life good bad  the ugly while i thought finding out about his personal turmoil and life was good to know about  some might find it not entertaining one thing that was rather annoying was the loud background music during some of the movie  couldnt understand some of the dialog during those scenes thus a 3 star rating
Aug 9 2023,positive,a fantastic movie from beginning to end a mustsee on the big screen should sweep the oscars
Aug 9 2023,positive,very interesting and well done movie  mostly historical with some artistic license
Aug 9 2023,positive,not a feel good movie very disturbing but it should be
Aug 8 2023,positive,this movie was so intelligent thoughtprovoking and powerful the cast performed excellently my husband and i think it should win best motion picture of the year
Aug 8 2023,positive,if youre not familiar with oppenheimers story you may have trouble following the movie i was familiar with the story and i thought the movie was great but my wife who was not familiar with the story had trouble following it
Aug 8 2023,positive,great movie should get academy awards for best picture best director best actor for cillian murphy who played oppenheimer and matt damon for best supporting actor totally engrossing movie
Aug 8 2023,positive,loved it  the cinematography the musical score  the acting of course  i see many oscars for this movie including best actor and supporting actor  even though it was a little longer than i had anticipated i wouldnt hesitate to see it again in a heart beat
Aug 8 2023,positive,great movie from beginning to end  so nany great actors who did justice to their profession an dr oppenheimer learned so many things i did not know
Aug 8 2023,positive,acting was wonderful
Aug 8 2023,positive,amazing movie  a story that needed to be told   i recommend it to all will win best movie this year
Aug 8 2023,positive,hopefully you are up to date on your politics both prepost wwii a lot of information will pass by you and you have to decided how to feel about not only the manhattan project but how oppenheimer was treated   with a 3 hour run time go easy on the soda so you dont miss anything
Aug 8 2023,positive,followed history very well
Aug 8 2023,positive,to long and talked about same things  feel movies was to long
Aug 8 2023,positive,enjoyed it even more on the second watch
Aug 8 2023,positive,what a great movie to watch in an actual 70mm imax theater this movie was 3 hours long but flew bye
Aug 8 2023,positive,despite its 3 hour long duration that doesnt mean the true fact about keeping more interesting and amusing with a quite dazzling perfomance great direction from nolan and wellcrafted plot what makes it a good film is not only the way to narrate the physic world which is completely relevant but it respects the actual events although in a dramatizedyetfiguratively manner truly a work of art for todays cinema
Aug 8 2023,positive,should be required viewing for all american citizens the message is just as important today the characters were well portrayed and special effects amazing great directing
Aug 8 2023,positive,i dont know if we can be trusted with such a film
Aug 8 2023,positive,there are movies that are just movies and then there are those higher than the rest that feel like cinema nearly every aspect of oppenheimer feels like a masterclass in making history feel cinematic aiming to give more than a retelling of a historical event its filmed incredibly well has excellent performances from all of its actors and feels like the movie has something very direct and real to point out to the audience while some might not consider it the best christopher nolan movie theyve seen it will definitely stand out as a very good film when compared to many others oppenheimer is definitely a contender for one of the best movies you could watch in a long time
Aug 8 2023,positive,it had alot of great people in it it was very interesting historically
Aug 8 2023,positive,it was well done the acting was exceptional and it goes to prove that the government will do anything to discredit you enjoyed it
Aug 8 2023,positive,fast moving over 3 hours captures some of the elements surrounding the most significant event in human history best to prepare for the movie by reading about oppenheimer
Aug 8 2023,positive,i saw barbie the same weekend  that one was good for a few chuckles  this one will stick with me for decades  such a privilege to watch a filmmaker like nolan at the height of his craft  watched it digitally as all the film screenings in my area were front row only  hope to see a 70mm print before it is too dusty to screen
Aug 8 2023,positive,liked  interesting story beautiful cinematography strong acting   disliked really long slow at times
Aug 8 2023,positive,id say 758 out of ten overall  yes id recommend it but i wouldnt personally watch it twice  overall the story was really rich in details  maybe too deep actually  visually and audio were great overall but he over used some of the bright lighting and it played a little cheesey at times on that  it should have been 30 min shorter  i was squirming by 25 hrs  its not a biography its a movie  he needed someone to force him to cut out some stuff  the stuff in europe at the beginning could have been shorter  the deep dive into lewis strauss could have been cut out mostly  didnt need that storyline with this first love that killed herself or was she murdered  i dont think he has done any movies that are based on actual history always his own stories so i think he struggled in finding the heart of the story and just decided to include as much as he possibly could  which made the movie feel bloated a bit i dont think anyone at the studio was willing to tell the director no and he would have benefited from some forced editing down of this very large story
Aug 8 2023,positive,its great i love how they showed los alamos and i wont even start on the vfx 55 an absolute must watch
Aug 8 2023,positive,great historical movie  the dialogue was difficult to understand at times due the the sound track
Aug 8 2023,positive,loved the movie since it had great acting and an actual plot  i was concerned about the 3 hour length of the but it was well paced and the time just flew buy since i was totally involved in the movie
Aug 8 2023,neutral,lots of noise about this but for me just a big meh 1st off no movie should be 3 hrs any story can be told in 2hrs no need to hold us hostage for vanity reasons   rdj was good mary poppins was fine and intense lots of good supporting roles like aflleck junior and josh h 
Aug 8 2023,positive,movie is top quality amazing production and actor selection i wouldve gave it 55 but the movie can be pretty hard to understand in the start and even at the end i was a bit confused also doesnt have alot of action its a perfect movie for people who love history recommended
Aug 8 2023,positive,movie is a tour de force  ive seen it twice its a thriller and a piece of real history that shaped the world chris nolan is a genius in creating this movie out of the pulitzer prize bio of jro american prometheus
Aug 8 2023,positive,excellent cast and reminder of a historical moment in us history
Aug 8 2023,positive,cinematic and artistic masterpiece every educated person must see this film
Aug 8 2023,positive,the movie was confusing at times with so many different names being thrown about i know some of the history due to past viewing of the manhattan project my wife owrver was totally clueless  this was a huge and long story story encompassing many years of historical value i loved the movie but thought they tried to shove too much into 3 hours   all and all an enjoyable 3 hour movie experience
Aug 8 2023,negative,a 3 hour spectacle about morally corrupt men  theyre the stunning cognitive dissonance it took for them to see what they could do  in a word disgusting let alone the portrayal of women the women of oppenheimer boobs babies and a bit of booze bring the washing in dear they may as well have been blow up dolls
Aug 8 2023,positive,i movie oppenheimer covered his life before during and after the atomic bomb  it gave a historic prospective of the manhatten project  the acting is solid with an excellent cast  the story is slow to developer and i thought the better part of the film was after the bomb drop
Aug 8 2023,positive,i loved it  it was much better than cats  im going to see it again and again
Aug 8 2023,positive,a competent if highly stylized imagining of oppenheimers life i had higher hopes for the movie since ive studied the man and the project in great detail but perhaps my knowledge of the subject skewed my viewing experience i still enjoyed it though
Aug 8 2023,positive,the best drama i have ever seen had to leave a review masterpiece
Aug 8 2023,positive,very entertaining for most of the 3h and almost completely historically accurate  but the timeline of scenes and flashbacks isnt easily understandable
Aug 8 2023,positive,despite its 3 hour runtime oppenheimer grabs you and draws you into j robert oppenheimers life and what led him to become the father of the atomic bomb and the aftermath of wwii after little boy and fat man were used to help end the war it never got dragging for me     oppenheimer is portrayed to be a complicated man a brilliant yet flawed person in perhaps cillian murphys best performance he becomes oppenheimer in our eyes he eventually becomes someone that is against nuclear proliferation so despite his contribution to its creation he in fact realizes that it has a terrible and consequential impact on humanity    the oppenheimer cast is stacked downey damon blunt and pugh to name a few plus the likes of hartnett oldman malik and more familiar character actors fill the screen and sprinkle their magic in the their respective screen times perhaps the underutilized aspect of the actors is emily blunt who finally shows her mettle in the 3rd act during the hearing    nolan is truly a master at his craft while there are a great many scenes in this movie to prove this the one thing spoiler here that comes to mind is when the testing at los alamos has finally happened and then he does this visual magic without music or sound wow amazing seconds later when the boom finally follows yowza what brilliance     this may very well be nolans best work and i hope he gets an oscar win for this kudos to the cast and crew for putting together this masterpiece im not normally a biopic nor historical movie viewer but you just have to watch this 5 stars
Aug 8 2023,neutral,two annoyances  first there was no need for the incessant music being pumped out that was supposed to elicit suspense  second it should have been one hour shorter
Aug 8 2023,positive,very enjoyable especially if youre a history buff it portrayed the nuance of the problem of the nuclear bomb quite well i was expecting the film to have morals and views of today such as bomb is evil painted all across it and therefore show the people as all evil but it didnt it showed the very wide range of opinions on whether a weapon of mass destruction is good to create while still hammering down why the us even did it to prevent nazi germany from doing it first great film the three hours flew right by
Aug 8 2023,positive,nolan has done it again he revolutionized the standard of films oppenheimer comprises excellent performances from each cast member a plot that keeps you tense and technological innovations that turn a film into an experience nolan has made a movie of men talking in rooms with one explosion into a blockbuster and he is the only director that i believe could do it i am not joking about the tense plot my bpm was elevated during the entire trinity test setup and sequence
Aug 8 2023,positive,there were some very slow segments it was very long acting was very good
Aug 8 2023,positive,excellent plot manages to hold you from beginning to end so much so that 3 hours pass and you dont even notice magnificent performances rare films of this magnitude produced today i was already homesick
Aug 8 2023,positive,oppenheimer is a masterclass in writing story telling and cinematography the biopic directed by the heavily respected christopher nolan is among one of the best movies to come out in 2023 cillian murphy is astounding and dedicates everything he has into his role as the father of the atomic bomb and has shown himself worthy of a best actor nomination and maybe even win the cinematography of oppenheimer is breathtaking and is deserving of the big screen taking a huge step in modern movie making due to the 70mm format the film uses the movie never stops and is engaging from beginning to end revealing the triumphs and terrors that oppenheimer unleashed into our world specifically talking about that scene the scene people will be waiting for that is made without the use of cgi it is jawdropping terrifying and transcending and will forever go down as one of the best cinematic moments in movie history the messaging and plot are well tied in together and is done in a way to make it seem more powerful than audiences will expect although some people may be turned off by the 3 hour long runtime oppenheimer does not disappoint and will blow audiences away being put down as a cinematic achievement
Aug 8 2023,positive,great acting lots of dramatic tension even though there is little action very thought provoking
Aug 8 2023,positive,liked the movie had watched a couple of documentaries prior to seeing movie which helped in that the movie jumps through the years without any reference a simple date year on the screen would have helped  movie enjoyable and learned a lot about the manhattan project and oppenheimer
Aug 8 2023,positive,speechless  nolan  the legend jrobert oppenheimer 
Aug 8 2023,positive,everything about this movie was brilliant from acting to casting and cinematography cillian murphy truly deserves an oscar for this wonderful performance honourable mentions to rdj emily blunt jason clarke and matt damon for their brilliant performances    the ending was remarkable and the entire movie experience was something ill never forget nolan yet again proves why hes one of the best directors around
Aug 8 2023,positive,oppenheimer shall be mentioned in the future as a flawless masterpiece i have probably seen  all the interviews done by the cast mentioning the fact that this is an immersive experience never done before kind of work but none of this is going to compensate unless you watch this in theatre it feels that you went back to that time and watching the events unfold in front of your eyes probably one of the movies where i cried in the opening sequence during his hearing for security clearance every actor played their part to perfection i know cilian murphy is one of the greats and this performance was his best but honestly i was more excited for rdj performance to play a character who was declared as a villain in american history who after playing a superhero for almost 11 years got a chance to stretch his acting muscles this is the best work of christopher nolan   in nolan we trust
Aug 8 2023,positive,oh my goodness this movie is insane its worth the hype and finally i got a movie that i adore thatll win the oscars justfully cillian murphy and rdj really deserve those oscars because they were so good but matt damon dane dehaan and florence pugh also deserve some nominations they did a phenonimal job as well suprises to see rami malek and gary oldman as president truman didnt expect them in there that ending scene my god truely one of the best nonmarvel movies that ive ever seen so go watch it yourself but have good seats because you dont want to have migraine and neck pain because youve been looking up for 3 hours straight
Aug 8 2023,positive,the movie depicted both the historical aspects of making the bomb and the moral dilemma the acting was exceptional
Aug 8 2023,positive,oppenheimer is a narratively powerful visually masterful work of filmmaking certain to be in the conversation for majorcategory oscars golden globes and other awards next year the casting is superb and performances unimpeachable all round particularly cillian murphy in the title role and the alwayswatchable robert downey jr as oppies main political nemesis lewis strauss kenneth branagh is a pleasantly surprising casting choice as german physicist niels bohr and florence pugh black widows yelena belova is virtually unrecognizable as the illfated mistress jean tatlock particularly timely as we reach the 78th anniversary of the first atomic bombing at hiroshima on august 6
Aug 8 2023,positive,so breathtaking so incredible so climactic everything the characters the plot the pacing the cast all of it is just plain incredible a must watch especially for the barbenhiemer trend you would think thered be tonal whiplash when going to one movie to another like you go from a movie that talks about how you perceive yourself and how the world perceives you and what the world is truly like and then you go to oppenheimer 9410
Aug 8 2023,positive,great movie  it flowed well and did not drag on well worth spending three hours to watch this story
Aug 8 2023,positive,very intense clever thriller that builds and builds  nolan does it again with an amazing cast that he maximises awesome score and rewarding third act  one of the best film makers of our time
Aug 8 2023,positive,i thought the acting was excellent  it was too loud
Aug 8 2023,positive,i dont go to many movies but wanted to see this one it was beyond my expectations and i thoroughly enjoyed it the acting was superb and i liked the period shots in black and white oppenheimer was a complex man and he was portrayed with all those complexities and the betrayal of the people around him was handled with care
Aug 8 2023,positive,very good movie  found it fascinating the way they showed the flashbacks in a way that pulled everything together  i highly recommend it  the 3 hours passed quickly
Aug 8 2023,positive,this is christopher nolans magnum opus in many ways blending his crosscut style hes been perfecting over the years with the best screenplay hes ever written the heaviest themes hes ever explored and the hardest questions hes ever asked its a portrait of a real man that changed the course of history the cast is perfect cillian murphy robert downey jr emily blunt matt damon florence pugh rami malik gary oldman alden ehrenreich and more make up this incredible ensemble all of whom are the best in this that theyve ever been this film showcases the full force of nolans talent as a filmmaker all focused on one character this may be his best work to date
Aug 8 2023,positive,oppenheimer is one of those few films that comes along in a lifetime that seems truly important  christopher nolan who directed the batman trilogy memento dunkirk insomnia inception and interstellar has created his most compelling film ever  with an inspired cast including cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon rami malek and florence pugh the film is a tour de force  j robert oppenheimer was a brilliant flawed and haunted man  his work helped end the most brutal war in human history but he also opened pandoras box to the atomicnuclear age  he was laserfocused on his primary objective yet struggled with his relationship with his wife and his friends  this film should be the overwhelming favorite for at least a dozen academy awards  i cannot think of another film that had a runtime of 3 hours yet left me wanting to see more
Aug 8 2023,positive,great film great actors   a masterpiece  just a movie without slapstick marvel bullshit forced diversity a film where you have to think and you do not get every little shit explained
Aug 8 2023,positive,thenhistory behind the making of this weapon
Aug 8 2023,positive,nolan always delivers on creating engaging and visceral films i always enjoy watching cillian murphy as well as most of the supporting cast including emily blunt robert drowney jr florence pugh id be shocked if this wasnt up for best picture or at least win a few other awards
Aug 8 2023,negative,lets start with the good promotes important world history overall acting is good and cillian potrais oppenheimer phenomonally the movie was well made in terms of quality and tried some innovations    the bad  the incredible slow pacing with a three hour long movie with next to no historical drama and science it felt lazy and uncreative    a lot of the scenes were lies and half truths to make the movie and characters more pretentious  especially how they managed to use and make oppenheimers most famous quote sound like something out of a really bad kinky adult movie    there is a lot of jumping in time in this movie i seriously believe nolan did that to spice it up a very boring slow paced movie with a very bad result    florence pughs skills as one of our generations best actresses went completely to waste as her character jean tatlock was used only for irrelevant nudity and mostly irrelevant sex scenes nothing was even mentioned about her vast influence on the politics of the era as a psychiatrist while she was under the communist party    einstein and john von neumanns involment has been brushed aside pretending like their involvement in the project was minor when its very likely usa wouldve lost the race to the atomic bomb against germany without them    i dont know if i wanna touch on the wokeness because its so silly but i think its important to stick to the history when you retell it not by adding black people and women to a 1930s quantum physics classes and on the manhatten project    summary its a movie filled with fantastic actors that deliver on their eind too bad the pacing is dreadful the writing is horrible and most of the actual story is missing
Aug 8 2023,positive,must watch if you love nolan direction and also a science lover   in simple words watch the masterpiece 
Aug 8 2023,positive,one of the best movies that i ever seen
Aug 8 2023,positive,extremely well done movie from beginning to end  i was questioning if this was actually a movie you needed to see in imax  i big friggin yes for sure      the acting was outstanding much of the characters and information i knew nothing about even though i felt i knew a fair amount going in  now i will need to do some research to find out how much of it was true  lol    i had no issues understanding the dialog as some had mentioned    normally 3hr movies are something i reserve for home  this movie rolled along very quickly  i did find out in advance when to run to the bathroom thanks to a website out there    the hype for this movie is certainly merited
Aug 8 2023,neutral,too long slow boring i felt like i was watching the biography channel
Aug 8 2023,negative,everything about this movie from the scripts plot and architecture to the choice of focus as a political intrigue drama confused with a wwii epic was as uninspired as films come this movie is about as blah as blah can get but im just leaving a one star to counter the underserved praise this intellectual firestorm received  there are essentially three acts oppenheimers beginning and communist flirtations  his emergence as a director and war hero and finally the emotional ball of wax that accompanies his culpability along with his role in political theater during a footnote in us history the plot has aspiration but no direction some pondering  the weight of  morality of nuclear war which is lightly dangled from time to time but really no actual climax which is how you know the movie didnt match the hype even the nuclear detonation scene was somewhat hollow without any sense of proportionality or scale given movie will be forgotten about in less than a year  look forward to more biopics and movies based around scientists however this was not it
Aug 8 2023,positive,a fast paced story a visual wonder totally immersed in the event glad i drove 200 miles to see it in 70mm imax
Aug 8 2023,positive,i went in not knowing much about the history  i only knew who oppenheimer was but not the full story  it was very well done and engaging and worth seeing in the theater
Aug 8 2023,positive,brilliant telling or the life of one of the great minds of our time
Aug 8 2023,positive,was not blown away left craving a cigarette and bigger explosion
Aug 8 2023,positive,great movie but the timeline was very confusing and it was 30 minutes too long
Aug 8 2023,positive,i enjoyed the movie immensely the only drawback was sometimes the dialogue was so soft to be inaudible could be the theater but the trailers were so loud i doubt it ill watch it again when its on a streaming service so i can add subtitles    the movie piqued my interest so ill research more information on oppenheimer and the other major figures involved in the story
Aug 8 2023,positive,i found this movie interesting but difficult maybe it makes a great trailer for the book on which it is based american prometheus but it is not a great movie it takes an important mans life or part of it runs it through a blender and calls it a movie     it is almost too fragmented and too outofsequence to be comprehensible especially if you dont already have a certain amount of background knowledge about the history surrounding oppenheimers life two teens sitting near me walked out of the movie in the middle and i was not too surprised meanwhile perhaps partly because i live near los alamos the movie held my interest if you can follow the story such as it is there is actually some drama that has been wrung out of some rather dry and dusty events now i am interested to read the book maybe then i will want to watch the movie again      as a history lesson the movie leaves something to be desired it does not for instance really explain what uranium or plutonium are or what is involved in mining or processing these elements nor does it directly show any of the documentary photos or footage of the aftermath in japan instead the horrible suffering is only hinted at through special effects and verbal explanations
Aug 8 2023,positive,im still mulling over how i feel about it in the grand scheme of other nolan films but there is no doubt that cillian murphy was brilliant and im fairly confident that he will take home the oscar for his role i wouldnt be surprised if zimmer takes another one for best score and i also think matt damon was at the top of his game    the narrative follows a disjointed timeline jumping between the 20s  40s and early 50s when oppenheimer was subject to mccarthy era witchhunts with a quick pitstop in the 60s before he died     i tend to find that biopics that hone in on very specific periods of time in a persons life work best i think oppenheimer proves how difficult it is to tell the story of a persons life in 23 hours and as a result of trying to condense so much into such a short period nolan has clearly had to make some tough decisions about what aspects of oppenheimers life story to sacrifice on or cut out entirely     the principal focus is on oppenheimers time managing the manhattan project labs leading up to the trinity test in 1945  it also deals briefly with his studies in the first third of the film and then rushes through the aftermath of his work  the  dilemma for the scientists involved with reconciling the work theyve done with its intended use the tension between oppenheimer and some of the other scientists on the program as well as his role as a government policy advisor  and the powerful enemies he made as a result of his strong role  in promoting a policy of what would eventually become under kennedy mutually assured destruction after wwii it cuts out everything else about his life   details about his time in psychotherapy the years after his security clearance was taken away and what he did it doesnt give much insight into his cushy childhood etc and then at points i felt it sacrifices on narrative depth in each of the chapters so as to condense enough of oppenheimers life into the story nolan wanted to tell      i also think the film underutilized the talents of emily blunt who plays oppenheimers wife kitty when she does have her moment toward the end of the film it just sort of made me think that they missed out by not giving her more meaningful screen time she appears quite frequently but has very little dialogue that said oppenheimers marriage to kitty could probably be made into its own film it seems to have been as complex as any individual character in the film the film refers to oppenheimers numerous affairs but it doesnt really spend any time  exploring oppenheimers role as a father and a husband and only very peripherally touches on the impact of what being married to him must have been like it suggests that kitty underwent phases of alcoholism and depression as well as the the impact of what i presume was a very distant and aloof kind of relationship he had with his kids theyre always screaming and crying whenever theyre on film    but dont get me wrong though overall it is a very good film its visually stunning its tense the pace of its editing is a masterclass in building suspense and as i say cillian murphy is brilliant i think when you have have a film like this which jumps between large spaces of time at the potential loss of narrative depth it takes a really brilliant actor to draw out the subtleties and complexities of the subject i definitely didnt leave this film thinking oppenheimer was a straightforward guy he was complex and murphy captures it all so well in every gesture and facial expression i left the film wanting to understand more about the subject
Aug 8 2023,positive,man this movie is amaing might be confusing at first but still a very very good movie
Aug 8 2023,positive,with an incredible rhythm an immersive soundtrack and a great tension this film makes every minute of its three hours worth watching without a doubt one of the best films of the year
Aug 8 2023,positive,it absolutely could have been 30 minutes shorter as the movie was a long slog but there were enough moments of brilliance to overlook that issue the detonation of the bomb in nm was one of the most fascinating moments in cinema
Aug 8 2023,positive,great movie although long reminded me and filled me in on a lot of details of that time and political undercurrents  actors were really compelling and believable  very enjoyable way to spend a hot afternoon and get a history lesson
Aug 8 2023,positive,it was a reminder for me what they went through after the bombing especially oppenheimer as well as how they were treated by those who needed the scientists the most very educational for those who dont remember how the government and politicians treated them great intense film
Aug 8 2023,positive,too long yet thoroughly engaging
Aug 8 2023,negative,epic perplexed fail all come to mind when review this film should have been so much more with the line up of actors and actresses but a fumbling trip through the years from before the war till 1949 leave you trying to grasp huge gaps and jumps in time pared with dialog that baffles and just simply waffles on about nothing but the same thing for hours literally have never wanted to get up and leave a film in such boredom does not deliver on the hype painful tooth pulling watch
Aug 8 2023,positive,one of the best movies ever cillian murphy with this movie marks his spot as one of the greatest actors this decade or even all time
Aug 8 2023,negative,unfortunately this is more about imax than the film it will be a much better viewing experience on a small screen and with some oldschool sound system i expected that the imax screen and sound would play their roles at the abomb test but the use of high volume music score seatshaking was continuous and often not apt intimate dialogue was often drowned out in music and noise  two horseriders at los alamos with a storm in the distance sound like they are in a hurricane boom smash  three scientists in a tent having a conversation that cannot be heard because the soundtrack is amplifying outside wind boom smash  oppenheimer trying to talk to a woman at a party has to contend with swelling music until it is the loudest background track you have ever heard  scientist flicks a switch to start the abomb test ignition sequence that sounds like the slamming of the largest metal door that you can imagine boom smash    there are great performances in this film and robert downey jr is the true star    i have two words for christopher nolan and his sound engineer whoever he or she is and those words are artistic restraint just because you have imax technology doesnt mean you have to exploit it in every scene boom smash
Aug 8 2023,positive,engaging and thought provoking  telling of history and the man oppenheimer  best film ive seen in years  murphy was incredible  3 hours seemed like 2  it was so engrossing 
Aug 8 2023,positive,took a bit to get into this onebut it was a good movie  glad i  deciided to see it large cast and quite diverse too 
Aug 8 2023,positive,incredible movie had possibly one of the best cast i have ever seen come together
Aug 8 2023,positive,i loved it creeping dread regret curiosity power powerlessness  every beat of this movie has one or more of these things it is a tour de force of filmmaking excellent acting excellent everything
Aug 8 2023,positive,a very nuanced biopic
Aug 8 2023,neutral,took way to long to tell the story felt like a movie i would have been forced to watch in high school
Aug 8 2023,positive,doesnt disappoint as someone who hates movies with a lot of talking i very much enjoyed this movie even though it is 70 dialogue cant wait to rewatch and buy a physical copy
Aug 8 2023,positive,probably one of the best films ive ever seen the 3 hrs zoomed by it was just incredibly engaging and powerful  show great insight into the man and one of the worlds most important scientific events
Aug 8 2023,negative,so slow and tedious ended up leaving 23 the way in
Aug 8 2023,positive,yeah this movie is 3 hours of white men talking and in the middle a bomb goes off but it is the most entertaining way of telling that story christopher nolan is one of my favourite directors of all time and this is a very different and fresh film from him it does not pander to the audience it isnt for everyone some may find it boring and unnecessarily long but this is a prestigious war drama and i does what it wants to do extremely well the entire cast does amazing my stand out being emily bunt who btw is definitely not underwritten she kicks ass in the third act rami malek robert downey jr and of course cillian murphy yes the i have become death scene was goofy to say the least but overall this is one of my favourite films of the year
Aug 8 2023,positive,i loved learning about this true story  i was worried about it being 3 hours but it held my interest the whole time
Aug 8 2023,negative,might win longest movie ever the film is only dialogue no action or actual interest to be a film about the father of the atom bomb there really wasnt much exploding on screen both literally and figuratively its very boring dull and an overall regrettable experience ironic though as it has a stunning cast two stars for the amazing cast instead of the 1 star review that i was going to give
Aug 8 2023,positive,thisovie ba rone was singularly the bestobie ive see in a score of years the filmography scripting and presentation the casting snd acting and scenery the scripting casting and acting  everthing  it was excrllent
Aug 8 2023,positive,another great nolan epic
Aug 8 2023,positive,the movie was so well cast and written i was immersed in the story unfortunate viewpoint from the creator of the atomic bomb but now i see it for more than just history but from the perspective of oppenheimer there was so much to unpack after the movie which in my opinion is what the director and writers are always going for
Aug 8 2023,positive,so well done from the story telling to the acting amazing movie
Aug 8 2023,positive,linked to historical events
Aug 8 2023,positive,an exceptional portrayal of a complex figure during a turbulent time
Aug 8 2023,positive,absolutely phenomenal movie score was fantastic as well
Aug 8 2023,positive,gripping depiction of a complicated man leading the manhattan project and its aftermath
Aug 8 2023,negative,so boring i fell asleep do not recommend
Aug 8 2023,positive,awesome and very well acted and produced
Aug 8 2023,positive,movie is riveting especially in imax 70mm thank you christopher nolan we get a deeper understanding of the successful creation of the atomic bomb the debates the moral dilemma the political environment may this movie inspire a new generation of theoretical physicists scientists
Aug 8 2023,positive,outstanding story acting cinematography editing soundtrack
Aug 8 2023,positive,great reenactment of a very crucial time in our history
Aug 8 2023,positive,very good movie and very long
Aug 8 2023,positive,one of the best movies ever made
Aug 8 2023,positive,i learned a lot about the atom  bomb development   but the beginning was a little bit confusing with the flipping between the 1930 and the 1950
Aug 8 2023,negative,this movie is far too drawn out brilliant acting but the length of time that passes to come to a conclusion could have been cut in half    zero action throughout the entire 3 hour film run the last third of the movie is a drawn out court case     the ending is extremely lacking and no thought was really put into the doomsday approach which has been done many times over
Aug 8 2023,positive,while the story did help reveal the truth about a man whose brilliant gift brought an end to a terrible war it also demonstrated the difficulty any human with character faces when unleashing a weapon that is capable of destroying mankind so it seems senselessly incomplete to avoid showing that hell it certainly wasnt out of concern for making a film too long in an age when the masses march to see films full of fantasy and fluff about unreal heroes and their imagined power it would be nice to reveal the full impact of actual power and to provoke thought about how dangerous real power can be
Aug 8 2023,positive,tremendous flick i was concerned about the movie being 3 hours but the time flew by if cillian murphy doesnt win the oscar for best actor shame on the academy rdj does a wonderful job as always and maybe it was just me as a marvel junkie but all i saw was tony stark because he really portray his character no differently conversely cillian murphy became robert oppenheimer matt damon was adequate and in my opinion miscast i believe other actors wouldve better commanded the role sam worthington comes to mind or brian cox
Aug 8 2023,positive,solid 4 great acting not sure how true the actual story was as the leftist media always spins it according to their agenda robert downey jr was fantastic
Aug 8 2023,positive,fantastic movie from beginning to end true art
Aug 8 2023,positive,absolutely brilliant
Aug 8 2023,positive,this movie will blow you away
Aug 8 2023,positive,really enjoyed the movie  it was very long though that was my only dislike
Aug 8 2023,positive,the cast is phenomenal and they all killed it in their respective roles here just as ive seen a lot of other reviews here say it is in fact too long some moments during the movie really dragged on but when it got good it got really good would recommend definitely worth a watch
Aug 8 2023,positive,the acting was excellent it was very thought provoking 
Aug 8 2023,negative,it bored me i couldnt understand what was happening i think it just wasnt my style but for me it just seemed like a bunch of old white guys talking with the occasional explosion other than that the cinematography was amazing and the music always fit the scene
Aug 8 2023,positive,a few movies make me almost cry but this ones last line made me actually cry
Aug 8 2023,positive,ideal for who likes science but a little confusing
Aug 8 2023,positive,i found this movie somewhat difficult to follow
Aug 8 2023,positive,intellectual and great story
Aug 8 2023,positive,constant bombastic soundtrack bombastic making it had to hear dialogue everything at same emotional level flashbacks and forth made it hard to follow unless you had a bit of background on tge characters    would wait to see on tv
Aug 8 2023,positive,a great thinking movie the cast was excellent
Aug 8 2023,positive,wellacted  powerful movie with a strong message
Aug 7 2023,positive,absolutely the best cinematic experience ive ever had
Aug 7 2023,positive,good scenes good acting but the movie is just too long and confusing
Aug 7 2023,negative,i appreciate the history but it could have been told in two hours or less not three way too long the first 2 hours i found extremely boring and hard to follow the last 45 minutes is the best compared to the first two hours im glad i stayed to watch it til the end though something to think about
Aug 7 2023,positive,history a must see
Aug 7 2023,positive,theyre powerful movie it tells a story that needs to be told about the efforts taken to develop the bomb that saved a mutilude of american military that would been be lost invading japan then the politics that followed
Aug 7 2023,positive,cillian murphy and robert downey jr give oscar worthy performances in this sprawling epic there has been much talk about oppenhimers lengh 3 hours and an 11 mile long 70mm imax film print but it never outstays its welcome it perfectly engages its audiance in the mind of a man whos trying to do the right thing for his country and internal struggle feels like our own theres no voice over with internal monolog because the film doesnt need it you feel the weight on oppenhimets sholders as he gifts the world his ticket to nuclear war and everything that needs to be said is on cillian murphys face the huge spectical emurses you in the image and the films trinity test had my heat pounding and my ears ringing this is cinema as we used to experiance it they really dont make them like this anymore nolan has done it agan ps see it in imax if you have the means the 70mm imax print we saw was beautiful
Aug 7 2023,positive,surprisingly in depth and detailed many acting stars present in roles large and smallputs the viewer in the moment with dr robert oppenheimer tracking his varied interests his insecurities and his goals if one hasnt yet read the fine book american prometheus this will make one want to
Aug 7 2023,positive,jumped around in time too much but was very interesting and dramatic  great cast
Aug 7 2023,positive,oppenheimer is a thoughtful and devastating piece of cinema that encapsulates the trauma and suffering that inevitably follows an arms race nolans subtle yet horrifically direct filmmaking is a perfect match with fantastic performances across the board in this mustsee movie of the summer
Aug 7 2023,positive,this well done movie was still a bit muddled it would have been helpful for the years of the earlier scenes were posted on the screen  with the frequent flashbacks and flashforwards made it harder to follow as the movie progressed it was somewhat easier but was still lacking from the movie
Aug 7 2023,positive,i have enjoyed reading books on dr oppenheimer therefore i am happy that it was made into a movie  the movie was very well done and casted  it is historically accurate     i think it was a little too long
Aug 7 2023,positive,performances pace setting story everything top notch
Aug 7 2023,positive,one of the best movies of the last 30 years
Aug 7 2023,positive,loved the movie the historical treatment of the man who invented the bomb
Aug 7 2023,positive,important story filmed very well  acting superb
Aug 7 2023,positive,fantastic film if you have any interested in history its a look into the nuclear race you havent seen before beautifully shot and amazing score a 3 hour movie that doesnt feel like it at all perfection from nolan the only negative is the bomb everyone hyped up this explosion like it was going to knock you out of your seat it was visually stunning and very loud but a bit overblown online
Aug 7 2023,positive,i liked the movie  it was intense and a lot of information   back and forth in time to explain what happened
Aug 7 2023,positive,spoiler alertsso i had to wait three weeks to see this film in our imax theater which is one of the largest in the country  i have to say after seeing the film i was underwhelmed by it on all levels  i dont know what it was i was expecting but what i got was dullboring in many places jumped around timelines too often the conversations were difficult to hear thanks to nolans refusal to dub in better sound after the movie is completed  had i known most of the film would be based on congressional and closed door hearings perpetrated by an enemy of oppenheimer with men just sitting around talking i would have skipped the movie altogether  and why make it in imax with so little material that would require a huge screen  there was no action accept for the test of the bombthere was supposed to be this earth shattering impact of the bombit wasnt that spectacular really not even in imax  the film was definitely a parade of famous actors all of whom probably begged to be in this movie because they love nolans films and figured it would be nominated for oscarsi dont see why it should be  but for me i dont get the hype really  watching a biography about oppenheimer where his life is in chronological order would have probably been preferrable  i dont get where the sex scenesnudity was needed in this film either  i love cillian murphybut in this film he was pretty emotionless throughout  i personally wouldnt have watched it 1x thru and definitely wouldnt see it again  too long for what it was
Aug 7 2023,positive,good story that should have been told in a better way too scrambly poor character development i swear i only knew two characters names and if one referred to another i kept thinking waitwho is that too much dumbing down of some parts just messy its too bad because the story itself when you could pluck it out of the actual movie is very compelling it had the great fortune of the behemoth of barbie to raise its presence and box office reminded me of a made for tv movie with some expensive shots of stars and fire and stuff to make it seem smarter or artsy or something worth seeing to glean for yourself the good story
Aug 7 2023,negative,non linear story telling did nothing due the plot every historical reference was clumsy and heavy handed oh look who it is einstein you can tell because the wind blew his hat off and oh look theres his hair the rdj subplot made no sense the writing was lazy with constant telling instead of sitting 0 character development they literally have to spell out that opp didnt have a spine in 45 and then did in 49 even though he does nothing different you wouldnt even understand that its a point of contention except his wife overdramticly tells him hes weak every so often to remind you that its something you should be noticing and caring about florence pughs character is so terribly written the fridging was actually a relief absolutely nothing believable about their attraction your just supposed to believe it because she keeps yelling at him for bringing flowers two stars one for the pretty filming and one for the sound the acting was great for what they were given but no stars because it was completely wasted if cillian wasnt so good that he can act with his eyes you wouldnt have even known he was there
Aug 7 2023,negative,so i went to watch this movie with my wife and 15yearold daughter hoping for a thrilling historical drama like the imitation game you know but man it got super awkward when we stumbled upon not one but two unexpected sex scenes definitely not what i signed up for with my kid in tow    i was really looking forward to the part where scientists create the bomb but guess what that was like just 20 minutes out of the whole 3hour movie the rest of the time was all about politics and digging into oppenheimers personal life i mean come on i dont mind a bit of drama but 2 hours and 40 minutes of it was way too much    at the 2 12 hour mark i was just praying for it to end dont get me wrong the actors did an awesome job and their acting was topnotch but man the plot was a total snooze fest all tangled up in politics and throwing in those unnecessary sex scenes    i wish they had balanced it out better you know the scientific stuff was actually pretty interesting and they couldve explored that aspect more instead of drowning us in political blah blah also cutting down on those awkward scenes wouldnt hurt either it had potential but the execution left a lot to be desired
Aug 7 2023,positive,outstanding writing and acting the make up artist should get an oscar
Aug 7 2023,positive,a movie where the faces are the superheroes three hours of talking were never be so exciting good to see cilian as a main actor he is awesome
Aug 7 2023,positive,great movie in the epic drama category  had no idea about the dichotomy of aftershocks between power players
Aug 7 2023,positive,it was a great way to present the history around developing the atomic bomb  scenery in new mexico was great
Aug 7 2023,positive,fascinating and absorbing  very wellpaced as it moved backward and forward in time  it did not seem like a 3 hrs long movie  many outstanding performances in particular by the young actor portraying oppenheimer at different ages spanning decades
Aug 7 2023,positive,the movie was great and must watch for imax 70mm for the best experience
Aug 7 2023,positive,liked the black  white viewpoints
Aug 7 2023,neutral,well the movie is called oppenheimer so i guess its about him    yes oppenheimer was a complex character but that complexity has been reduced to a manoatmano with lewis strauss    yet can his life really be just the kind of plot that ive watched in zeffirellis amadeus is this then the story of a person about whom nolan claims he is the most important person who has ever lived    oppenheimer will mostly be remembered as a scientist and mahanttans project manager in the first place and that seems to have been forgotten in the movie nowhere was the interim committee mentioned ultimately responsible for advising the president     key people in los alamos like parsons like von neumann were overlooked whilst others got too much screen time teller for instance of whom all scientists seemed to agree that he had absolute no value to the implosion project why implosion what are the challenges of implosion a key decision where oppenheimer removed seth neddermeyer in favour of  kistiakowsky as head of metallurgy wasnt mentioned yet this is probably the most important decision of the whole implosionprogram    nowhere were the goals of manhattan drop a bomb on nazi germany explicitly put forward stemming from a letter written by szilard and sponsored by einstein the late reluctance by the scientists and the tension it created at los alamos comes because they found that the bomb didnt need to be built and certainly not used since its destined target surrendered    the movie also induces the assumption that there is a direct line from trinity to hiroshima well no absolutely not hiroshima is parsons brainchild nagasaki is oppenheimers the only thing that connects both bombs is that they are nuclear their concept is vastly different    maybe its a character movie in which a character is on trial that could be but then sadly as an audience we were not even given 10 of the pieces of conviction    ultimately what we got is a lot of closeups
Aug 7 2023,negative,meh wanted them to delve into the scientific history of the period not the politics  sex scenes were really a bit much when you think your bringing your family to see a historical film
Aug 7 2023,positive,it was a okay movie i just like more action
Aug 7 2023,positive,wonderfully written story of american history with star power
Aug 7 2023,negative,im not old but i couldnt understand their speech there was too much background noise my seat mate said the same thing too long
Aug 7 2023,positive,christopher nolan is a genius
Aug 7 2023,positive,excellent scriptwriting and directing by nolan premium cast great sound
Aug 7 2023,positive,very intense storyline amazing sfx and christopher nolan additions like the themes of the water ripples and balance of color and bw
Aug 7 2023,positive,awesome great lesson in history humanity and politics a must see movie
Aug 7 2023,positive,the film itself is a work of art start to finish im glad i was fairly aware of the facts of the story of i may have gotten confused the cast are to a person perfect nolan finally made a movie i am totally satisfied with
Aug 7 2023,positive,the acting cinematography and storytelling were all beautiful definitely deserves multiple oscars
Aug 7 2023,positive,great cast  wonderful cinematography  a very important story that needed to be told  i learned so much about oppenheimer his fellow scientists and the political pressure the scientists and the whole project were under from beginning to end and afterward  i highly recommend it
Aug 7 2023,positive,amazing movie  will watch again
Aug 7 2023,positive,quite thought provoking very well done
Aug 7 2023,positive,imax is the way to go  a fantastic sounds system is key to this movie experience
Aug 7 2023,positive,a masterpiece all around i was on the edge of my seat the entire time
Aug 7 2023,positive,the only annoying thing about this movie was that the explosion was tame and thats because it is a real explosion best nolan movie
Aug 7 2023,positive,if you are not very familiar with oppenheimers history this movie is good for people who know about him and those who do not it is a good movie for the leman who knows a little about him the film explains what he did for all those to be able to understand and enjoy the movie most may not realize just how troubled he was but this movies interpretation did a good job of relaying that to the audience
Aug 7 2023,negative,overrated film dialogues centered from the american vision
Aug 7 2023,positive,just a well roundedphenomenal movie
Aug 7 2023,positive,i cant express my fascination about this masterpiece its just perfect and im deeply in love with it
Aug 7 2023,negative,really long underwhelming  too technical  fell asleep
Aug 7 2023,positive,insightful riveting  extremely well acted
Aug 7 2023,positive,christopher nolan does a great job with all his movies so if youre a fan this is a must see the run time seems long but there isnt a moment where youre thinking about it the special effects are fantastic and you can feel the emotions from all the actors this should be the movie of 2023 that you actually go and see
Aug 7 2023,positive,oppenheimer is a somewhat complex film considering the characters and relationships involved  i valued it more for its informational and historical value than its entertainment value  having lived through the cold war homebuilt bunker mania and duckandcover drills the film reminds me of the unthinkable consequences of nuclear war  i hope it awakens awareness in others as well
Aug 7 2023,positive,mr nolans a game beautiful storytelling and acting plot perfectly makes sense and is understandable unlike the other complex pieces
Aug 7 2023,negative,the film recklessly reduces the revered tex gita to a tool for explicit content sacrificing genuine storytelling it raises questions about the filmmakers motives and medias state leaving viewers reflecting on the need for respectful narratives this movie serves as a warning against mishandling complex themes and highlights the importance of honoring history science and spirituality with sincerity
Aug 7 2023,positive,could have been a little shorter by shortening the investigation panel scenes
Aug 7 2023,positive,great movie  but the politics were very difficult to understand
Aug 7 2023,positive,the history of the atom bomb and the details around the politics the cinematics were unique and well received more of the kind shall holly appreciated
Aug 7 2023,positive,nolan is a master story teller i love his movies and this is no exception however at 3 hours with so many characters it necessitates another watch and i cant wait
Aug 7 2023,positive,the cast was uniformly great particularly cillian murphy the story is more complex and intriguing than the basics you learn in history
Aug 7 2023,positive,too bad it is so early for oscars should be nominated for best picture cillian murphy best actor best supporting actor robert downey jr best sound  mixing editing best cinematography best editing best directing and best adapted screenply
Aug 7 2023,positive,long movie that also drug in places
Aug 7 2023,positive,this movie utilizes the flashback technique to tell the story  this technique is extremely exhausting it requires a lot of effort and concentration on the part of the moviegoer to follow the timeline of the movie since it is constantly moving forward and back in time  so much for a relaxing and entertaining movie
Aug 7 2023,positive,masterpiece well researched and accurate to its time oppenheimer will definitely be a must rewatch for me watching the movie in imax was a mind reeling experience with its sound production cinematography and acting especially with the emotions cillian murphy was able to portray nolans top movie for me so far
Aug 7 2023,positive,was a very good movie great cinematics
Aug 7 2023,positive,love seeing movies and appreciating the art and talent that it took to make the film amazing film score direction cinematography and acting rdj nailed it i forgot how talented he is after watching him play himself for so long
Aug 7 2023,positive,excellent movie and actor
Aug 7 2023,positive,this was a thinking persons entertainment the flashbacks to nonsequential and several different events are a bit confusing sound at the beginning made conversations difficult to understand about a third of the way it improved i wished id known the final fate of oppenheimer before seeing the movie i came away from the movie not knowing if i liked it or not but the next day i realized i did like it very much because it was so thought provoking my husband didnt like it because he was distracted by recognizing actors from other movies and the flashbacks id like to see it again to appreciate details i missed with the first viewing i think the movie is more informative than entertaining like a good history lecture
Aug 7 2023,positive,the actors were fabulous
Aug 7 2023,positive,this movie needs close captions the dialog is very quiet throughout the movie
Aug 7 2023,negative,slooooooooow boring and too long
Aug 7 2023,positive,its long but its very intense and keeps you interesting the acting is top level and has a great cast its a very interesting story about a key point in recent history
Aug 7 2023,positive,oppenheimer moved rather quickly through the story line it was a bit difficult to keep up there were flashbacks that did not make sense until later in the movie there were too many really loud bangs and bright flashes to enjoy the movie i walked away thinking for me it was over my head the bombs exploding and the fire bombs did nothing for me it was fun to see someone portray einstein but the characters were messed into the story line so well there was little delineation of them as the story moved forward in the end it was good but not good enough to see again
Aug 7 2023,negative,the sound quality of dialogue was bad  also the noise of the sound explosions was loud very long movie
Aug 7 2023,positive,christopher nolan made a masterpiece    is this the best movie christopher nolan ever made i think so this movie was a masterpiece there wasnt a single scene i wanted to skip i was too captivated by every part of this film cillian gives a performance that not only should bring him to his first academy nomination but imo should win him the whole thing so did downey this was also the best performance by emily blunt i think ever matt damon was fantastic and florence was too   loved the small roles of 3 academy award winners with affleck being terrifying with just a little screen time oldman being unrecognizable and malek stealing the last 20 minutes of the film hoyte van hoytema once again made fantastic cinematography one of his best and ludwig g√∂ransson ate that score i think its one of the best scores in a film ever period i have chills listening to those melodies even now what a score   this film left a big impact on me and i wish nolan and the crew all luck on award season but i think that this is his moment
Aug 7 2023,positive,very engaging great acting by all
Aug 7 2023,positive,one best movie i have ever watched
Aug 7 2023,positive,would have been a perfect five stars if i could have heard the dialogue very frustrating music far too loud making it impossible to hear about 40 of what was being said we really wanted to understand all of the dialogue the nuances etc  we will have to wait until we can rent it and choose closecaption also the nude scenes were unnecessarily explicit and rather exploitative of the woman other than that the film was excellent the actors just brilliant robert downey jr amazes with his intensity in that character
Aug 7 2023,positive,i enjoyed learning more about this history and the acting was superb  my only complaint was the soundtrack with loud background music apparently intended to heighten the drama but i found it to be annoying and tiring  remove the music concentrate on the actors and i would give it 5 stars
Aug 7 2023,positive,this movie blew me away it was the bomb
Aug 7 2023,positive,only thing to add to all the praise is that it has one of the best sound mixes i have heard for a film  not so much for the dialogue but in crucial emotional scenes toward the end
Aug 7 2023,positive,very gripping movie i learned a lot i did not know
Aug 7 2023,positive,overall fantastic film just a little bit confusing with all the different people in it as well as the jumps in time
Aug 7 2023,positive,the 3 hours passed so quickly
Aug 7 2023,positive,oppenheimer is a visually spectacular and captivating cinematic experience the characterization of j robert oppenheimer as a complex figure both hero and villain is masterfully balanced leaving audiences compelled and emotionally invested throughout the journey nolans exploration of the scientists life and his contribution to history showcases a film that is both thoughtprovoking and visually stunning a mustwatch for those who appreciate the art of filmmaking     read my ¬Ω review of oppenheimer on letterboxd 
Aug 7 2023,negative,the physics part was decent along with the portrayal of oppenheimers psyche but the plot in general really dragged not really much suspense in the movie except some blaring music the entire time and dialogue so quick i swore i was watching a tiktok
Aug 7 2023,positive,excellent acting fast moving totally interesting movie
Aug 7 2023,positive,fascinating movie with excellent acting and tremendous importance in history
Aug 7 2023,positive,thought provoking suspenseful chucked full of history and literally every actor you could think of  this movie was amazing in imax although i could have used a touch more really big screen coolness  a must see which had our group who went to the theater talking all night after the movie and the next day
Aug 7 2023,positive,great movie made me think a lot after watching it the sound quality was definitely one of the best in business and the quality of visuals was crazy especially no cgi was involved in the making of it
Aug 7 2023,positive,a movie everyone needs to see the ending scene was an absolute gutpunch will be thinking about this one for a while
Aug 7 2023,positive,historically amazing
Aug 7 2023,positive,i would recommend this movie as i found it interesting however i thought it was too long  would have been an even better movie if it had been at least 30 minutes shorter as there were definitely things that could have been cut without ruining the integrity of the story  great cast and acting
Aug 7 2023,positive,the acting was fantastic it totally kept me watching for the entire movie 3hours it was great i will go see it again
Aug 7 2023,positive,its complex story may be hard to follow but oppenheimer is still a beautifully crafted work of art
Aug 7 2023,positive,excellent screen play and acting3 hours went quickly
Aug 7 2023,positive,theater ruined the explosion by turning the lights on n leaving them of for 10 minutes after the explosion lots of politics
Aug 7 2023,positive,masterfully made film no notes
Aug 7 2023,positive,expertly shot and edited worth the 3 hour investment in a theatre  best on the big screen it was very absorbing and insightful with an amazingly good cast  i would rank it as chris nolans best
Aug 7 2023,positive,5 stars for a historical event movie not a cartoon about dolls 
Aug 7 2023,positive,a masterpiece 3 hours of filmmaking brilliance a riveting moral warning to the world the cast led by cillian murphy is excellent with a standout performance by robert downey jr
Aug 7 2023,positive,thrilling story that stayed true to historical facts maybe 20 mins too long but other than that there isnt too much to criticize
Aug 7 2023,positive,all the negative reviews almost persuaded me not to go but im glad i didnt listen  i agree with some that the back and forth from one hearing to another was confusing initially and annoying elsewhere but it was an excellent film  the performances were outstanding and i dont think i was the only one whose heart was beating very fast and hard during the trinity countdown
Aug 7 2023,positive,i was engrossed in the movie it was a cast of many actors that were recognizable but you didnt know who they were in the movie that didnt matter the story was captivating and held my attention for the entire duration such an entertaining movie that i must read the book
Aug 7 2023,negative,horrible movie  incredibly boring especially the dialogues just wanted it to be over
Aug 7 2023,positive,excellent acting great story the time wizzed by
Aug 7 2023,positive,great movieq bit long but interesting
Aug 7 2023,positive,excellent movie  portraying the life of the man who created the atomic bomb was eye opening  the story showed his success to his downgrade  a must see a
Aug 7 2023,positive,loved everything about this movie the sound effects were amazing
Aug 7 2023,positive,the direction and the assemble cast the sound was amazing it was three hours long but did not even seem like it was three hours
Aug 7 2023,positive,great film long but great the start is a bit confusing but once you get the time jumps it all comes together
Aug 7 2023,neutral,too long too loud patchy storytelling unnecessary nudity
Aug 7 2023,positive,a tour de force a cinematic experience especially when viewed in imax the story is so well crafted that despite the outcome of the main event being so well known you could hear a pin drop in the theatre during the trinity test as the reality of the force that has been unleashed on the world is realized   cillian murphy  robert downey jr give the performance of their lives as their separate stories hurtle towards their controversial and cathartic conclusions in what must be one of christopher nolans defining spectacles as a film maker   make no mistake this is real film making and real story telling the likes of which is sadly beyond the capabilities of many of those populating the picket lines today
Aug 7 2023,positive,a compelling story from one of the most challenging periods in american history  i liked that it showed many aspects of oppenheimers life work and beliefs
Aug 7 2023,positive,really good movie   i dont know it being a date movie so i went by myself and didnt hardly even notice the 3 hours
Aug 7 2023,positive,great cast well written powerful story
Aug 7 2023,negative,dragged for forever everyone around me fell asleep it was so confusing and had no real plot that i could follow waste of 3 hours
Aug 7 2023,negative,no plot whatsoever the movie just bounces all over the place with no real character development and a bunch of different timelinessubplots  its confusing and not enough about the project itself and the science behind it  the only cool part is the testing of the bomb   and even that coulda been better  spielberg or fincher shoulda made this movie nolan is the most overrated director of all time  he just throws up a script all over the screen  he also always has music going on in the background which is super annoying i was so disappointed cause i thought this would be good but nolan took a great story and really messed it up in my opinion the acting is great which makes it even more a shame cause it had so much potential
Aug 7 2023,positive,the acting and accuracy were high caliber
Aug 7 2023,positive,going to see it a 2nd time with my bff so we can discuss it  i am glad this movie is out in theaters now and shows the consequences of science deniers in power  imaging if germany understood the brilliance of these scientists and built them a city such as los alamos to design the gadget   i appreciated the bw portions of the fil being true to the book and the color portions of the film being speculations   the multiple death scenes of his first lover was confusing until i read a review that indicated there were multiple theories surrounding her death and suicide was only one theory  overall i think this movie will spawn a new generation of researchers and thinkers 
Aug 7 2023,negative,jumbled mess of cut scenes that leave the viewer confused the concept of the movie was very interesting but poorly executed with lack of character development and choppy narrative i was thoroughly excited to see this movie nolan could have done better to develop the plot in a way that sequentially makes sense to the viewer  he included a very talented cast but did little to ensure that all of their skills were utilized this movie had a lot of potential but definitely missed the mark for a film lasting 3 hours
Aug 7 2023,positive,amazing cast and movie absolutely loved it very impactful
Aug 7 2023,positive,this movie was long but it was also necessary so many characters were trotted out that it took a conscious effort to keep up but each played a part in the unfolding of this story i tried to keep up because i knew i was being taught both history and a frightful lesson of power i left the theater somber with my new knowledge
Aug 7 2023,positive,a devastatingly beautiful commentary on humanitys appetite for war and its atrocious consequences despite the best intentions of those who made the atomic bomb possible
Aug 7 2023,positive,it was good  acting was good  held my interest 3 hours though
Aug 7 2023,positive,great acting cinematography plot

Aug 7 2023,positive,an engaging film a surefire oscar contender for best picture nominee
Aug 7 2023,positive,oppenheimer is the kind of movie that transports you into another dimension    the extraordinary narrative and incredible actors will make you forgive that movies length of 3 hours    i strongly recommend this movie because beyond its extraordinary narrative it gives you new culture and information you probably dont know it can motivate you to investigate more about the historical events that change the world
Aug 7 2023,positive,great movie about an important time in our history
Aug 7 2023,positive,a very good movie enjoyed it  would recommend it to others  helped me to see how the atomic bomb came to n was very close to home 18 miles away
Aug 7 2023,positive,its heady ill need to see it again to absorb it all the acting and cinematography were superb its not easy to shed all the hindsight weve gained about nuclear weapons either politically or technically and fathom a world where humans weapons capable of annihilating all humanity were simply nonexistent this movie does a great job of examining moments minds and politics just before and after that changed
Aug 7 2023,negative,hard to hear and follow in movie theater will watch second half at home with subtitles and google
Aug 7 2023,positive,so real and informative as well as sensitive to the toll the creation of this bomb took on all who were involved very emotional
Aug 7 2023,positive,an important piece of world history  dramatic yet fact based
Aug 7 2023,negative,good cast but i found it too slow paced hard to follow just felt like sitting through 3h of documentary reenactment
Aug 7 2023,positive,as i watched this movie chronicle the development of the atom bomb i was deeply struck with how worldchanging this was it was fascinating the biographical aspects of oppenheimers life the politics and the tension between building a bomb that could either save the world or destroy it also interesting was watching the team of scientists and their various contributions the length of the movie did not bother me i was engrossed the entire movie
Aug 7 2023,positive,great movie a little long
Aug 7 2023,positive,it was a great way to see what it took to make the bomb
Aug 7 2023,positive,the movie is essentially in 3 parts his rise as a leader in nuclear physics his leadership of the manhattan project and finally his political struggles  the first two parts are fantastic  the movie slows down in the third part  it is an important movie and worth a watch
Aug 7 2023,positive,it is three hours of essentially dialogue
Aug 7 2023,positive,well done great job representing the complex man and modern political woke garbage very refreshing
Aug 7 2023,positive,was below my expectations movie was too long couldve been edited shouldve been 2 12 hours instead of three
Aug 7 2023,negative,oppenheimer a waste of  3 hours  cant make up their mind to a nuclear bomb creation a tangled love affair or a witch for a communist  enough of a topless woman and visit with einstien to enrich a sad story  the actors were good but the story is very disappointing
Aug 7 2023,positive,great film i really enjoyed it leave your brain on and appreciate the science you dont have to have a phd to experience it
Aug 7 2023,positive,i rated oppenheimer a 3 star due to the fact it was too long  not the theaters fault could have gotten away with 25 hours
Aug 7 2023,neutral,kinda boring  both the people sitting on the right and left of me left the theatre in the middle of the movie  i was thinking about leaving also  robert downey jr  was the best actor in the movie  not enough sex scenes to jerk off too but too many to watch with your kids or parents  i thought it was a dud
Aug 7 2023,positive,directorwriter christopher nolan again slingshots us from past to present to inbetween in order to explain what matters to his protagonist  he does so masterfully in this homage to several wwiiera amerucanljewish physicists tearing off j robert oppenheimers moral bandaids as he goes from theoretical to very practical scientist over 3 film hours  although not really fastpaced the movie never   has you l looking at the luminous hands of your radioactive watch  the array of name actors some of whom have been toolong absent from our screens do an outstanding job of avoiding charactures sp of oftenstereotypical roles i never knew that oppenheimer was both a passionate moralist and a rabid slutpig  thanks cillian murphy for all your mad bombers facets
Aug 7 2023,positive,well written great acting its a long movie but it does build along the way walking out of the theater it really leaves you thinking about our future
Aug 7 2023,positive,wonderful movie from beginning to end
Aug 7 2023,positive,it was a very historically accurate movie and a great story it truly shows how scary it was working on the manhattan project the last few scenes relate to modern day and whats going on now very well i recommend this movie to all adults especially people from that time
Aug 7 2023,negative,i wanted to like this movie my son is a physicists and i was so looking forward to see it with him it was not for me not sure what i was suppose to feel but  i felt no connection to the characters or the story i was bored i wanted more of the science and the horrors of the bomb and less dialog less love scenes that seemed so ill placed
Aug 7 2023,neutral,very long lots of talk jumped around
Aug 7 2023,positive,great historical representation in my humble opinion quick action with impressive talent in many roles my lady and i really enjoyed it
Aug 7 2023,positive,excellently acted directed edited  just a fine piece of tactile filmmaking anchored by a towering performance by cillian murphy
Aug 7 2023,positive,it was okay its an overrated movie for me i give it 3 out of 5 stars had good moments powerful moments but dragged too much at times with the hearing scenes which had me bored and disengaged its an okay movie not as good as people claim it to be for me
Aug 7 2023,positive,will probably win best picture and other oscars didnt seem like 3 hours because it keeps you engaged
Aug 7 2023,positive,i enjoyed the story the acting the historical information it was a little too long
Aug 7 2023,positive,epic from start to finish

Aug 7 2023,positive,great movie  great actors
Aug 7 2023,positive,loved everything about this movie
Aug 7 2023,negative,too long and boring jumps all over the place from time to time and the viewers have no idea when something is happening and whos who no mention of the horrific result after the bombing of japan the movie shows oppenheimer like hes the victim here two sex scenes and nudity that make zero sense to the story and dont fit into the style whatsoever overhyped
Aug 7 2023,positive,nice movie i liked the story hard to follow at times and too long great acting in this show
Aug 7 2023,positive,it was about 30 minutes too long the last part of the movie drags when it should have been ending its more about politics than science and it seems that there wasnt a definitive direction the movie wanted to take there were a lot of characters to keep track of and jumping from different time periods was confusing at times the acting was excellent but better editing could have made the movie more interesting through the end
Aug 7 2023,positive,all of the performances were top notch robert downey jr really stepped it up from iron man
Aug 7 2023,positive,imax 70mm is a must for this movie best way to experience the music sound mixing and not miss out on picture quality
Aug 7 2023,positive,cillian was amazing and another amazing movie by nolan
Aug 7 2023,positive,very good movie but should have emphasized pearl harbor a bit more to show why we dropped the bomb
Aug 7 2023,positive,longbut very good
Aug 7 2023,positive,great filmwas reluctant on a biopic but seeing it in 70mm imax is something to behold
Aug 7 2023,positive,excellent history lesson and riveting actors
Aug 7 2023,positive,good plot too lengthy
Aug 6 2023,positive,history everyone should know

Aug 6 2023,positive,amazing story great acting
Aug 6 2023,positive,slow moving and draggy in the first hour  acting was good picked up when the story moved towards the issues surrounding developing the atomic bomb
Aug 6 2023,negative,the trailer was nothing like the actual movie there was very little about the development of the atomic bomb it was almost all about the politics surrounding oppenheimer
Aug 6 2023,positive,acting and everything else a must see 3 hours went quickly
Aug 6 2023,negative,three hours of my life wasted this was incredibly boring
Aug 6 2023,negative,prosnice looking movie cons sound dialog like with  all nolan movies was not clear and story pacing was too frenetic
Aug 6 2023,positive,even thought the movie is king it didnt feel like it excellent above all measures make sure you are wide awake when seeing this movie fast moving
Aug 6 2023,negative,completely garbage one of the worst movies of my life loss of money and time cinema audience quiet for 3 hours no laugh no expression irritating
Aug 6 2023,positive,a masterpiece the performances are stunning the scenes are powerful and intense it is just incredible
Aug 6 2023,positive,simply fantastic i could not stop thinking about this movie for days after i saw it it captures incredibly well the gravity contradictions motivations and emotions around the development of the atomic bomb in the context of its time
Aug 6 2023,positive,christopher nolan has delivered yet another masterpiece that will no doubt have to questioning the power that us humans hold over the world
Aug 6 2023,positive,an incredible and riveting story we were glued to the screen  so many twists and turns  very enlightening  and incredibly sad  oppenheimer was so brilliant  excellent actors too
Aug 6 2023,positive,wow christopher nolan has a masterpiece with oppenheimer cillian murphy and robert downey jr seem to sure to be nominated during awards season the move keeps a steady pace and moves the story along all the while making you feel that you havent missed a thing all of the supporting actors as absolutely superb and the story stays gripping all throughout its fantastic and three hours felt like half that absolutely worth the effort to see
Aug 6 2023,positive,absolutely wonderful
Aug 6 2023,neutral,way too long and totally underwhelmed  yawn
Aug 6 2023,positive,the tensions of some scenes in imax 70mm
Aug 6 2023,positive,best drama ive seen in a while the cast was fabulous
Aug 6 2023,positive,great movie  i didnt feel like it was that long just too many faces to remember
Aug 6 2023,positive,historically accurate except for the american flags should be 48 not 50 stars
Aug 6 2023,positive,well acted very long but a good story about history
Aug 6 2023,negative,tedious  over indulging unless you have any real interest in the subject matter as an entertaining movie not for me
Aug 6 2023,positive,well done movie lots of historical information and well cast
Aug 6 2023,positive,sound is extremely loud
Aug 6 2023,positive,i was slightly disappointed with the explosion it should have been computer animated much bigger and more dramatic with the explosion that they used they attempted to make it more dramatic by zooming into the fire but an atomic blast isnt like that its on a different level the movie moved a little too quickly too despite being 3 hours long im gonna have do watch it again as a few things slid past me overall excellent movie but not my favorite i hope they come out with a follow up movie about bombing japan and integrating that into the pearl harbor movie
Aug 6 2023,positive,oppenheimer was an excellent movie the story was riveting and the audience was captivated for the entire 3 hours i highly recommend oppenheimer for your viewing pleasure
Aug 6 2023,neutral,eh it was okay i found it to be kinda drawn out too long but maybe thats just me i found most of the scenes except for the spoiler kinda bomb being dropped but its worth a watch at least once especially if youre into history
Aug 6 2023,positive,excellent movie with great acting
Aug 6 2023,negative,this film is long and boring and just doesnt work in my view it was very disappointed after all the hype its down there with some of the worst sadly
Aug 6 2023,positive,the room temperature was perfect  pre ordered seats good time
Aug 6 2023,positive,it is an oscar winner but the length is at 3hrs long might put some off but its worth it
Aug 6 2023,positive,so amazing wonderful cast an incredible part of history so sad what the did to oppenheimer
Aug 6 2023,positive,this is a pure masterpiece everything about it just landed perfectly like the cinematography music just everything the actors fit the roles perfectly particularly cilian murphys outstanding performance the highlight for me is the ending which is the scene that wraps all the whole movie together i had high expectations from all the hype this received and to say that they were broken is an understatement christopher nolan did it again highly recommend seeing this
Aug 6 2023,negative,this movie was very long and mostly boring  the entire story of the manhattan project is largely irrelevant to the the plot here which is really just three oddly interwoven stories about oppenheimers affairs his hearings to have his security clearance revoked and strauss nomination as secretary of commerce  the sex in the movie is gratuitous  i honestly cant understand why so many people are giving this movie high marks  it was 3 hours of my life that i will never get back
Aug 6 2023,positive,it was absolutely amazing i never once felt bored throughout the 3 hour runtime it told an fantastic story with amazing visuals would recommend to anyone over 15 due to certain scenes but brilliant movie flawless acting cillan murphy was spectacular must see
Aug 6 2023,positive,i didnt dislike a single thing
Aug 6 2023,positive,this is a powerful story with powerful acting my husband and i did not feel like we were sitting for three hours we were transported to another place and time which is always a good sign of a riveting filmstory id see it again tomorrow and ive ordered the pulitzerprizewinning book on which the movie is based
Aug 6 2023,positive,this was one of the first 3 hour movies where no one had to use the restroom during the show lol
Aug 6 2023,negative,the movie was beautiful and well acted by the entire cast that said it really dragged on up until the successful first nuclear explosion it was good the last was just boring anyways i understand why it will win awards but i dont think anyone will be excited to watch it a second time
Aug 6 2023,positive,the acting was great the story line was riveting seldom do i make it through a long movie without visiting the restroom i never left my seat for three hours as i didnt want to miss one word or one bit of action
Aug 6 2023,positive,gripping story riveting production  such a great movie
Aug 6 2023,positive,important historical film  highly recommend
Aug 6 2023,positive,great insight on who was oppenheimer
Aug 6 2023,positive,exquisite movie very intelligent and great performances
Aug 6 2023,positive,a wellmade bio pic every american over 13 should see a great americanworld history lesson wrapped up in great filmmaking and storytelling cant give it five stars because of its unnecessary length at 3 hours and some distracting stunt casting
Aug 6 2023,positive,beautiful amazing camera and great plot amazing scripts amazing actin robert downey junior was phenomenal
Aug 6 2023,positive,the history was fascinating and the hopscotch sequencing added depth to the storytelling  the interspersion of the blackandwhite scenes with those in color underscored the bifurcated nature of the tale  it otherwise rates at least a full 4 stars the chararcterizations by the lead actors were a bit too wooden but probably necessary for contrasting effect but i took off a halfstar solely for the american flag glitch  the britishborn christopher nolan can be forgiven but thats what an editorial team is for  cmon guys
Aug 6 2023,negative,the movie was ridiculous it wasnt relatable to young people the young people will have no idea why the united states was messing with fission or fusion young people will not understand why it was necessary to create fat man or little boy in regards to the threat from the japanese as well as the germans the movie completely glossed over mr oppenheimers life prior to creating a bomb and seriously was it necessary for them to show him having sex or fantasizing about sex during his hearing it was ridiculous sorry i wasted my money
Aug 6 2023,negative,its too long and really downplays the magnitude of the atomic bomb on history oppenheimer is a very flat character that just moves from scene to scene
Aug 6 2023,positive,compelling story fantastic acting but the first half was too long and drawn out
Aug 6 2023,positive,getting a good old fashion history lesson
Aug 6 2023,positive,i think its the best movie i ever watched
Aug 6 2023,negative,boring sub par acting way too long
Aug 6 2023,negative,too long and slowly 
Aug 6 2023,positive,the movie was great but a little too long
Aug 6 2023,negative,absolutely boring and jumps around too much my husband and i both have undergraduate degrees in the sciences our son and daughterinlaw both work at a nuclear power plant as engineers in fact my son works at a los alamos in new mexico found out a few interesting tidbits of information that i need to verify about los alamos overall i really dont understand what the point of the movie was it seems like it was a whole team of people who made this atomic bomb and that oppenheimer was engaged in making it with the hopes of stopping the enemy from making one too because they would realize everyone would suffer sounds like war games from the 80s my husband is a huge history fan and he absolutely hated this movie he said he found no redeeming qualities in it
Aug 6 2023,positive,the movie tells the true story of this who worked on the manhattan project and the toll it took on their personal lives great movie with a sad end
Aug 6 2023,positive,beginning of the movie is very slow after it picks up it is really interesting
Aug 6 2023,negative,disliked constant background music to try and maintain interest in stunted and disjointed dialog  liked the topic  would not recommend it to friends
Aug 6 2023,negative,this was the worst movie i have seen in awhile love all the actors in itthe storyboarding was done so poorly
Aug 6 2023,positive,best movie ive been in 5 years
Aug 6 2023,positive,it was a great biopic of oppenheimer it gave me an insight into the man that is considered the father of the atomic bom to see how he saw the world as a scientist and how his struggling with the use of the bom and its creation a great cast and director
Aug 6 2023,positive,a must see movie  there is history and then theres politics great movie
Aug 6 2023,positive,chris nolan excels at weaving parallel stories into a thematic whole so this film succeeds as history as psychological combat as biography  dont turn over the rock unless you are prepared for the snakes underneath  especially the snakes in washington dc
Aug 6 2023,positive,captivating for a 3 hr docudrama
Aug 6 2023,neutral,dialog was very hard to hear and follow constant close up of the main actor made this movie a bore should have waited to stream it i was not impressed by the nuclear explosion 
Aug 6 2023,positive,what a great movie it was really great learning about what the life of oppenheimer was like it makes me want to read more about the history after watching it
Aug 6 2023,positive,it was an extraordinary look into the life of oppenheimer the only difficulty was following the rapidly changing timeline and keeping some characters straight beautiful cinematography and screenplay
Aug 6 2023,positive,so great on many levels visually narrative historically scientifically politically socially masterpiece
Aug 6 2023,positive,i loved it it was a complex story but i thought that it was very well laid out the acting was top notch
Aug 6 2023,negative,im a big fan of nolan but i have to say this film was utterly disappointing the dialogue was unintelligible due the the poor execution of nolans classic jumping back and forth in time     i would probably give this film a higher rating if id watched it a home with subtitles rather than at an  imax cinema     dont believe the 5 star reviews save your money
Aug 6 2023,negative,too long too slow beginning nothing exciting until the last hour nothing was drawing me in to keep watching i had to leave the theater with about 45 mins left 1st time ive had to walk out on a movie
Aug 6 2023,positive,loved everything the casting cinephotography   the detailed story line  i was totally involved and engaged throughout thanks great movie
Aug 6 2023,positive,cillian murphy was very good the movie was long and could have used more action for the three hour sit down robert downey jr filled his serious role as strauss but i couldnt help but wonder how ironman would have handled things
Aug 6 2023,positive,a perfect movie  shows brilliance and the fact that the us gov will turn on you  i was in the usaf for 23 years  seven years in a nuclear titan ii icbm nine megatons  it would destroy everything in a 96 square mile radius  i was a launch officer   i would push the button  we speak english because of heroes like doctor oppenheimer
Aug 6 2023,positive,common christopher nolan peak movie excellent plot excellent characters everything about this movie is just beautiful
Aug 6 2023,positive,very intriguing film the story keeps you hooked from start to finish excellent
Aug 6 2023,neutral,too long played out by a set of hand wringing self indulgent scientists and politicians played out for 3 hrs with a couple of bangs it was raining
Aug 6 2023,neutral,i watched openheimer excited to see a cillian murphy collab with robert downey jr and instead all i got out of it was 3 hours of wasted time there were good scenes but none that made me go crazy for the movie instead it was more of a sciencey thing rather than what i was expecting which was a historical movie that was interesting and kept the viewer feel excited i saw this after i saw barbie and barbie 2023 was actually good i hope saw patrol isnt like barbenheimer where only one of them is good and the more mature one is less thrilling and less interesting and yeah so in conclusion i dont want paw patrol to be better than saw x in the end
Aug 6 2023,negative,self indulgent awful sound design i couldnt understand half the time the story is interesting but poorly told doesnt focus on the victims at all which i personally find distasteful but also bad storytelling how can we understand oppenheimers guilt without understand the impact the bomb had at the end of the day the film just like oppenheimer didnt take a firm stance the film is a manifestation of nolans ego which is why i suspect he relates to oppenheimer
Aug 6 2023,positive,the first film ive ever watched in imax and i was absolutely blown away christopher nolan is a genius
Aug 6 2023,positive,amazing movie superior acting and story telling i want to see it again
Aug 6 2023,positive,if you are looking for a drama thriller and also a scifi tasting entisiasist you will feel the rythym of the movie good chracter placement as well as thrilling drama screen play actors gave their best to bring the movie to its full potential
Aug 6 2023,positive,too long and drawn out kind of boring
Aug 6 2023,negative,the jumping back and forth between time periods without any dates displayed to give you a time frame im a student of history and i couldnt figure it out imagine the average dope trying to  the weird sex scenes always unnecessary in such a movie yeah we all know how we got here no need to show it im no prude but really was that necessary  and too long
Aug 6 2023,positive,good presentation of the persecution of him by our government
Aug 6 2023,positive,eye opening  a must see movie  dont leave early the ending hits home
Aug 6 2023,negative,i couldnt hear half the dialogue because the background music and sound was very loud it overwhelmed the dialogue in almost every scene i dont know if the theater can correct this or not its hard to believe they would release this film in this condition i would not recommend anyone seeing this movie
Aug 6 2023,positive,absolutely brilliant filmed movie inthralling acting masterful storytelling and spellbinding visuals this movie should sweep the oscars  havent seen dune part 2 go watch this movie enjoy good cinema it can be still made and this movie shows it
Aug 6 2023,positive,incredible movie amazing performance from murphy and good dialogue could have been a little shorter
Aug 6 2023,positive,the acting is wonderful with robert downey jr doing leading the pack
Aug 6 2023,positive,best movie of 2023 so far
Aug 6 2023,positive,fantastic movie and brilliantly acted the fact that people are complaining about length or pacing is ridiculous my only complaint would actually be that the beginning was a bit too choppy and fast but it calmed down after the actual building of the bomb commenced and the ending was stellar if you dont have the attention span to sit through go see the barbie movie instead
Aug 6 2023,negative,boring incoherent uneven bombastic and loud are the kindest things i can say about this 3 hour snooze how does this director still have a job in hollywood what was this movie supposed to be about who was it supposed to be about ive never suffered through such a bizarre film the director is so insecure with his film making he needs to crank up the awful score at the end of every scene he makes spielberg look subtle the story is all over the place and thinks it is being so clever by never telling its audience where when or even why the scene is taking place so the viewer is left guessing throughout the entire film not to mention the fast dialogue that is supposed to impress the viewer by completely confusing them and not bothering to actually explain what a atomic bomb is nor how devastating such a thing is the arrogance of this directorwriter regarding the subject matter and subject of this film is truly shocking      save your hard earned money save 3 hours of your life and avoid the hollywood and little boy noise surrounding this dudd robert oppenheimer is a fascinating subject and i am sure there is a good film to be made about him his life and his role in creating the atomic bomb its just not hereno way close
Aug 6 2023,positive,very compelling kept you engaged and interested at every point long but never felt long it was really really good
Aug 6 2023,positive,masterpiece  my best experience of all time 
Aug 6 2023,positive,it was disappointing but still worth seeing i learned a lot but it could have been 30 minutes shorter
Aug 6 2023,negative,movie didnt live up to the hype main character was good but everything else fell apart
Aug 6 2023,positive,a masterpiece composed of art science history and science  superb acting eye opening fantastic film editing  one of the best movies of all times
Aug 6 2023,positive,literally amazing a very important movie and a story that finally got told the correct way with brilliant creativity
Aug 6 2023,positive,really enjoyed the movie  acting was awsome and beautifully filmed kept you interested and very informative  could have cut out a good half hour
Aug 6 2023,positive,great film but our audio at times was not good
Aug 6 2023,positive,really weird take  for me personally i never had barbies that built weapons of mass destruction so i guess i couldnt relate well to the story everyones different though i suppose 
Aug 6 2023,negative,this movie was very dry and boring it has no entertainment value whatsoever a documentary would have been better jmo
Aug 6 2023,positive,from a moviemaking and technical skill point of view it was a wellmade movie the story left out so many important details and included factually inaccurate information though robert downey jr did a great job but not a single japanese person not a single image of ww2 no mention of the hispanic families forcibly removed from their homes near los alamos slightly disappointed
Aug 6 2023,neutral,some great acting performances but boy is it overlong three solid hours is just too much it would have been better as a tv miniseries  great special effects but it goes onand onand on
Aug 6 2023,positive,just a little too long dragged out
Aug 6 2023,positive,this movie had so many great actors it was very well done i just thought it would have had more action and the story was a bit hard to follow it all comes together in the end it really shows how our government works  i just wish there was more action other than that it was a great performance by all
Aug 6 2023,negative,the sound system was too loud especially the background music  the voices were hard to hear and i expected closed captions as that is what your theater offers
Aug 6 2023,negative,if youre a physicist or someone studying quantum mechanics youll love this movie if youre not youll be bored to tears i think this movie should have put more edge of your seat mystery behind the unknowning aspect of dropping the bomb and what an atomic disaster could really mean for the world instead it only lasted 8 minutes in addtion this movie was probably an one hour too long it could of been shortened to an hour and half with more anxiety and thrills
Aug 6 2023,positive,the history we were never taught great movie
Aug 6 2023,positive,cinematic masterpiece those who dont enjoy it are in my opinion not mature enough to follow the plot of what was a very complicated time in reality and this not dumbed down to placate the novice     everything from the story to the sound was spot on    when people are curious why their government is not trustworthy and trusted they can refer to this and countless other documentaries    its only decades later if someone puts in the work to connect the truth and publish it in some form do we actually understand what happened     the next time you fly off the handle because of some spoon feed media story keep in mind that its a complete lie or a tiny sliver of the truth
Aug 6 2023,positive,incredible piece of cinema huge fan of true stories
Aug 6 2023,positive,what a master class in storytelling
Aug 6 2023,positive,flashbacks have a place this one was all over time lines they used volume and sound effects to accompany thought noisy and overly loud just because they could make it that way added nothing but made it too loud throughout
Aug 6 2023,positive,had trouble with speech clarity could have used cc
Aug 6 2023,negative,the movie drags and drags its way to long and boring and took way to long to get to the point
Aug 6 2023,positive,masterpiece the scenes acting music i will remember for along time thank you nolan
Aug 6 2023,positive,way to long completely unnecessary nudity and often slow paced
Aug 6 2023,positive,great storytelling and fantastic acting
Aug 6 2023,positive,performances and directing  were outstanding fastest 3 hours ever
Aug 6 2023,neutral,pros really striking visuals spectacularly done bomb sequence and an a performance by cillian murphy never fails to bring it  cons gonewiththewind long obscenely written dialogue way too many characters to keep up with and an allstar cast for easy parts     allup refuse to sit through it again but will remember it fondly
Aug 6 2023,positive,intelligent writing with excellent acting talent
Aug 6 2023,negative,poorly written dialogue cant be masked by impressive sound design big twist reveals dont work well for a biographical film wouldve cut the first half of the film honestly and just got into the meat of  the story especially because of how rushed the first half of the film is tremendously disappointing film deserves the technical awards and robert downey jr was excellent with the slop he was handed but nothing else
Aug 6 2023,positive,a technical milestone outstanding casting production acting and directing the story is very good not great the final act drags a bit but has a great twist
Aug 6 2023,positive,cillian murphy was excellent my husband and i love history so with this based on a true story made it all more enjoyable 1st movie he wanted to see in a theater in over 10 years he was very pleased
Aug 6 2023,neutral,interesting but boring

Aug 6 2023,positive,way too long but still a great movieacting was superb  highly recommend sitting through this filmi learned a lot too
Aug 6 2023,positive,christopher nolan brings the story of robert j oppenheimer and the invention of the atomic bomb to the big screen in his mammoth threehour epic oppenheimer after five previous collaborations with the applauded director cillian murphy finally takes the lead role helming a cast packed full of famous faces nolan takes audiences on an adventure through one mans life switching between black and white and coloured film and between the perspectives of oppenheimer himself and lewis strauss portrayed by robert downey jr     stretching across multiple decades oppenheimer opens in 1926 where were introduced to a 22yearold j robert oppenheimer cillian murphy as he studies at cambridge after narrowly avoiding poisoning scientist niels bohr kenneth branagh oppenheimer continues his education getting a phd in physics and ends up becoming a professor himself he soon meets his future wife kitty emily blunt whilst also beginning an affair with communist jean tatlock florence pugh when 1942 rolls around america finds themself involved in world war 2 with the nazis appearing to have nearcompleted their own nuclear weapons program oppenheimer is recruited by army general lesley groves matt damon to lead the manhattan project and develop an atomic bomb a top secret base is built in the deserts of los alamos new mexico with oppenheimer assembling his own team of scientists to create the bomb the events that follow will forever change the world placing america in a new position of power and unleashing a whole host of new dangers     irish actor cillian murphy takes on the role of j robert oppenheimer and the peaky blinders star is an absolute revelation in the titular role delivering a magnificent performance that is easily one of the best of his career murphy skillfully walks the line between oppenheimers loyalty to the us and the myriad of moral qualms he must face along the way he fully immerses himself into the role and the results are nothing short of incredible adeptly anchoring the film and breathing life into this stellar character study murphy leads the massive ensemble cast who all give strong performances while bringing nolans screenplay to the screen robert downey jr shines in his role as failed secretary of commerce lewis strauss marking his second acting role following his 11year tenure as iron man in the marvel cinematic universe the twotime oscar nominee gives a powerful performance that feels worthy enough to land him his third oscar nomination in the coming awards season downey jr excels in the third act of the film in the scenes he shares with aldren ehrenreich solo a star wars story which give audiences an insight into life and politics postoppenheimer finally while only appearing in the second half of the film jason clarke who portrays roger robb does a stellar job creating an unnerving and intimidating atmosphere for not only oppenheimer himself but also for the audiences watching his verbal tirades during numerous scenes    the film tightly walks the line between being an informative biopic about the father of the atomic bomb and a dreadfuelled thrillerhorror its ghastly subject matter and chilling warnings about nuclear warfare allow audiences to understand the history and the man behind this part of history while also giving warnings that are eerily relevant to todays society and the present threat of nuclear warfare nolan skillfully weaves emotion and ethics through his portrayal of these historical events creating an eyeopening depiction of this chapter of history that sends chills through the audiences the britishamerican filmmaker once again asserts himself as someone who can deliver stunning feats of cinema again and again without flaw making oppenheimer the latest stunning edition of his applauded filmography the film forces its audience to confront the sheer danger and destruction that occurred during this period of history and shows just how close these scientists came to potentially ending the world and the entity of mankind oppenheimer covers a myriad of heavy themes throughout its threehour runtime including loyalty to your family and your country destruction of both one man and the entity of mankind and the dangers of science the themes blend together with the performances and stunning technical aspects to create a thoughtprovoking film that raises its own questions     typical of nolans films oppenheimer is bolstered and bettered by its marvellous technical aspects on show throughout the film nolan reunited with oscarwinner ludwig g√∂ransson for the films score after previously working with the swedish composer on the score for his previous film tenet g√∂ransson crafts a magnificent score that builds tension and dread in all the right places with a constantly changing tempo that reflects the tone flawlessly nolans long desire to make a film about oppenheimer translates into a stunning film powered by a compelling screenplay his decision to portray some parts of the film directly from oppenheimers perspective as well as write the script from his pov is met with stellar results as it brings a unique look at one of the darkest chapters of modern history frequent nolan collaborator hoyte van hoytema provides the film with gorgeous cinematography that makes oppenheimer a visual feast and easily one of the best looking films of the year     performances and technical aspects marry together in oppenheimer to create a masterful piece of cinema fuelled by a powerhouse performance from cillian murphy nolans monstrous affair tells the story of how one man and a group of scientists forever changed the world in 1945 from a makeshift town located in the middle of the los alamos desert the culmination of peoples work on the film results in a mammoth threehour biopic that can easily be considered one of the best films of this year
Aug 6 2023,positive,for a film nearly three hours long this leaves you wondering what more might you have missed by not having read the book that it was based upon  although obviously based on factual events some of which filmgoers are familiar the script event jumbling acting and styling of the movie still make it an outstanding adventure  see it in the theater
Aug 6 2023,positive,a phenimenal historical retelling and cinematic masterpiece the trailer says all that needs to be said without spoiler movie of the year as far as im concerned
Aug 6 2023,positive,the movie is great and the storyline flowed entertaining and historical when i got home i conducted research on oppenheimer to learn more
Aug 6 2023,positive,i dont think it needed the few explicit nudity scenes thrown in they seemed mostly out of place in a somber intense thought provoiking moviethe point of oppenheimers emotional state even sexually could have been expressed specifically without the chair sex scene during the mock trial
Aug 6 2023,positive,great movie  enjoyed it  a lot of science though  i mean i knew there would be but never my favorite subject a lot cb of names to try and keep straight
Aug 6 2023,positive,not crazy about movie being crude in showing mistress scene with boob nudity wasnt needed to get the point across    didnt like that previews made me think more action and a lot of movie was cerebral over action content
Aug 6 2023,negative,3 hours of a preview disjointed filming i think maybe that was just the metaphor for the whole manhattan project but as a film it didnt work too long for a story i already knew with very little extra information to fill 3 hours
Aug 6 2023,positive,acting was superb story compelling and welltold oscar nominations should be plentiful
Aug 6 2023,neutral,pros some amazing acting from the cast cillian murphy matt damon and emily blunt were particular standouts for me    i did enjoy the dialogue content but i hated its delivery see below    cons rapid fire edits throughout the entire movie made it very difficult to follow the storyline i dont think more than 3 or 4 mins was spent on each scene  which was not enjoyable for a 3hr long movie    very dialogue heavy  combined with the fast edits above it felt like they were trying to cram too much into 3 hrs and its okay to have fast conversations in each scene but then it jumps to the next fastpaced conversation scene and the next and so forth there was no time to digest the weight of what just happened or what was discussed    poor visual storytelling  the fast edits  dialogue heavy script combined made it feel like the cinema format was not properly delivered and it felt like i was being told what was happening not shown based on this i probably couldbe just listened to this movie like an audiobook and had the same experience     no emotive storytelling either  when i finally figured out oppenheimer was a person and the main character i thought this would become an emotional story about his life relationships aspirations and fears instead it felt more like a rapidfire roll call of his personal and work resume  almost like a documentary it also means theres no character development for anyone whatsoever throughout an entire 3 hr movie    strange sound design in some parts  there were some parts when the actors were speaking eg emily blunt and i had no idea what she saying so much so it made me wish the cinema had included subtitles surely i could expect more for a 100m movie    not a movie id watch again and not understanding why this is considered a masterpiece
Aug 6 2023,positive,gretra story  well told  too long
Aug 6 2023,positive,terrific acting revealing story
Aug 6 2023,positive,well made but too long and sometimes a bit confusing
Aug 6 2023,positive,very well done story about a critical time in human history excellent performances and script impactful presentation
Aug 6 2023,positive,visual grandeur vs narrative depth    despite the anticipation surrounding christopher nolans latest work the film might not meet all expectations the grandiosity of the movie driven partly by nolans stellar reputation and the extensive marketing creates a halo effect that might be misleading    the casting of cillian murphy in the lead role under nolans direction is a welcome decision and his remarkable performance rightly takes center stage however the inclusion of over 21 celebrity cameos appears as an unneeded distraction drawing attention away from the central narrative and undermining murphys role    concerns also arise around the films pacing from the beginning it plunges into a frantic tempo that continues relentlessly throughout while this pace might be fitting for certain plot elementssuch as racing against the germansrussiansthe unyielding speed becomes disorienting quick scene cuts and often inaudible dialogue further contribute to the confusion    this incessant pace though potentially intentional restricts the artistrys room to breathe the audience is left with little chance to immerse themselves and feel the film with an expansive budget and a threehour runtime the rush to include substantial footage feels more like an attempt to justify the spending rather than letting the narrative unfold organically    nevertheless the movies merits are undeniable the visual splendor combined with a beautiful musical score and murphys compelling performance enriches the films artistic value still these qualities as exceptional as they may be do not suffice to label the work as a masterpiece    the conclusion to be drawn from nolans latest creation is that while there is much to admire certain choices undermine its overall impact it might not connect with everyone especially those seeking a more cohesive and immersive cinematic journey the film shines in parts but may disappoint viewers expecting more than a hollywood spectacle    reflecting further the true core of the story seems lost in the spectacle surrounding it nolans name the hollywood cameos the dominant score and the grand imax visuals all contribute to the narrative receding into the background the films indulgence in cinematic glamour though visually and auditorily thrilling risks losing storytellings essence the intricate weave of characters emotions and themes gets overshadowed tilting the balance towards appearance over depth the result is a dazzling yet soulunsatisfying movie that comes across more as a hollywood extravaganza than a poignant human drama
Aug 6 2023,positive,this was awesome experience personally i like medieval history oppenheimer is good chunk of knowleadge
Aug 6 2023,positive,the wide and full screen made you feel like you were in the room
Aug 6 2023,positive,its an absoluty masterpiece it takes the audience into the world of j robert oppenheimer for 180 minutes it gets better with every watch and almost every actor delivers a worldclass performance   a must see in cinema
Aug 6 2023,positive,christopher nolan does it again  amazing score visuals and story telling
Aug 6 2023,positive,technically a wellmade movie but not a masterpiece some physics aspects are very detailed and other historical points on the other side not very profound
Aug 6 2023,positive,compelling and thought provoking
Aug 6 2023,positive,heady stuff in a remarkably accessible cinematic imagining of reallife events light on science heavy on thought visualization oscar nominations to be expected in many categories including sound and cinematography
Aug 6 2023,positive,cillian murphy and robert downey jr have oscar worthy performances  bravo
Aug 6 2023,negative,unecessarily complex timeline in a movie with already a lot of secondary characters has a strong iamverysmart vibe
Aug 6 2023,positive,great movie and cinematography however there were some times when it was just too loud
Aug 6 2023,positive,a cinematic masterpiece i loved it it kept me hooked throughout loved every bit of it the action direction acting and sets everything was tip notch
Aug 6 2023,negative,the storyville documentary the trials of oppenheimer directed by david gruber tells the same story but better and more succinctly only 90 minutes nolans work is selfindulgent and sometimes missteps terribly we didnt need the gratuitous nudity hardly any attempt made to explain the physics but perhaps most people not interested quantum mechanics illustrated by sparkly lights
Aug 6 2023,positive,amazing love the use of colourblack and white aspects of the film very good storyline great cast robert downey jr was really so impressive did not recognise him at all visually made me jump in parts sound was amazing the period aspects  costume makeup  hair was spot on and all the set design such an impressive film best of the year or years since i saw schindlers list shocking story of what happened really original film the only aspect i didnt like was the actress emily blunt she didnt look visually right in the film and her acting was bad and unbelievable naomi watts or kate winslet would of been a better placement oscar for cillian  robert please and chris nolan
Aug 6 2023,positive,good but never great i think i was expecting more 
Aug 6 2023,positive,the overall story telling was great and just kept you captivated throughout the whole movie up until the very end the acting cinematography soundtrack was just amazing highly recommend to see
Aug 6 2023,positive,was a pretty good movie
Aug 6 2023,positive,amazing story arc before and after the nuclear bomb project dialog rarely a bit out of place but the pacing and top notch acting just redeems it a lot can be learned about this film than just watching explosions all day

Aug 6 2023,positive,absolutely amazing one of nolans best
Aug 6 2023,positive,excellent acting  great use of historical fixed points  this
Aug 6 2023,positive,a little bit long and predictable
Aug 6 2023,positive,loved the theater and the recliners  one of the best movies weve ever seen
Aug 6 2023,positive,third time seeing this movie and i was able to grasp at so many details and nuances i missed the first time around one of nolans masterpieces one of the best things a movie can do particularly biopics is bring to life story figures on screen and let them live in your head while i was pretty knowledgeable about ww2 i knew very little about nuclear testing i find myself wanting to learn more about this part of history ill leave my personal feelings on nuclear weapons but this movie does a great job to show why the allies felt the need to create the bomb great movie that reminds me why i love movies
Aug 6 2023,negative,60 minute crescendo third act without a beat drop  not sure why needed to know oppenheimer wife a drunk cuck  florence pugh boobs not needed  meh  why is rd jr story line there
Aug 6 2023,positive,so much talking in this movie but overall is very great movie
Aug 6 2023,positive,overly long i like biopics but this one lacked depth to any of the characters most of the performances were instantly forgettable i couldnt name more than a few characters out of a very large cast i caught too many actors acting at least i wont have to build time into my schedule to watch this during award season before voting on performances    i saw it in 70mm film not imax given what i saw it wouldnt make a difference to me film grain and scratches are distracting the nostalgia factor of seeing a film on film is something that i got over quickly and i wished i chose a digital showing instead sound was ok cinematography left a lot to be desired effects were ok not great i gave it a shot due to the hype but christopher nolan films remain a chore to watch your milage may very
Aug 6 2023,positive,interesting and very well presented   the detail and complexity  a deep look at the story of how the bomb was created   a complex story and good character definition to help portray the people and the politics
Aug 6 2023,negative,3 hours of talking heads worlds longest documentary really boring unfortunately this horrible movie will win best picture 
Aug 6 2023,positive,cillian is god in this movie
Aug 6 2023,positive,love the movie really liked all the hidden meaningsmessages in it most definitely will have to rewatch it to catch everything i missed most definitely recommend you watch it
Aug 6 2023,positive,oscar nomination for chris nolan and cillian murphy what a moral dilemma this movie captures do well
Aug 6 2023,negative,the music compared to the dialogues is so loud that most of the dialogues could not be understood in addition jumping backward and forward in time makes following the movie highly cumbersome good subject not well shown
Aug 6 2023,negative,it was very long and all over the place hard to understand i even fell asleep watching it but it was good acting
Aug 6 2023,positive,nolan did it again ladies and gents and man cillian murphy was epic in this one
Aug 6 2023,positive,first time ive ever seen a film in 70 mm i cannot wait to see another movie in that format it was an absolutely entrancing experience and what an excellent film to be exposed to for the first time

Aug 6 2023,positive,powerful and extremely well done movie highly recommend
Aug 6 2023,positive,good movie but i would not say great youll need every brain cell to follow the plot as its super twisted and jumping back and forth in time
Aug 6 2023,positive,excellent film disappointing theater experience at amc metreon 16 imax in sf it has a front row that limits the view of the screen the seats do not recline in any row and have headrests that push the head forward very uncomfortable when looking up at such a sharp angle to watch the movie
Aug 6 2023,positive,uses the boomerang style where 3 different storylines happen at the same time and converge when all you really want to see is the storyline with the nuke dropping still very impressive visuals and good talent
Aug 6 2023,positive,too long  could have shortened by 45 minutes without losing any of the story
Aug 6 2023,positive,another nolan masterpiece no argument over it best movie of the year excellent acting excellent picture excellent direction wonderful
Aug 6 2023,positive,not for everyone as dialogue is swift and time jumps happen frequently nolan has done it again
Aug 6 2023,neutral,so unbelievably long and boring couldve wrapped it all up in an hour couldnt wait for it to end
Aug 6 2023,positive,very long drama  movie  very good sound movie
Aug 6 2023,positive,810 83100  his thought experiments are so identical to mine for my theory the first hour or so is a little off in the story telling even though this is a 3 hour epic the first hour of story telling feels rushed and i wanted einstein in it more lol my 2 main negatives but this film is amazing   now nolan needs to make an einstein film please christopher nolan   and im wired different lol my dad and i paired this with meg 2 a 2 hr movie  a 3 hr movie 5 hrs at the theater aka my 3rd home
Aug 6 2023,negative,overrated   boring
Aug 6 2023,positive,oppenheimer is a must watch film the story is told beautifully and the cinematography is very much christopher nolan a 3 hour film that does not feel like one as there is so much going on in a good way  wry dialect heavy however there is a nice balance between all the characters and their roles
Aug 6 2023,positive,oppenheimer   nonspoiler review  rate 9410    with a 3 hour runtime oppenheimer didnt disappoint in carrying out outstanding acting and great story telling of the journey throughout the before and after of the atomic bomb the film also gave out spectacular cinematography original sound tracks audio effects and visuals that makes it so appealing it can be difficult to wrap your head around whats going on in the film but along the way you would manage to figure it out
Aug 6 2023,positive,very intellectual movie i absolutely loved it and how it followed true to the nature of things
Aug 6 2023,positive,too long and too many themes

Aug 6 2023,positive,its an another nolan masterpiece the way he narrated it and the sound effects  god damn
Aug 6 2023,positive,good movie but could have been shorter
Aug 6 2023,positive,it was very interesting and i liked it very much
Aug 6 2023,positive,very long but outstanding character study on oppenheimers complex personality and times in america  actors all splendid but music was way too loud and extremely ominous
Aug 6 2023,positive,have not seen a quality movie in a while this is why we go to movies captivating the whole time
Aug 6 2023,positive,its long but keeps you entertained
Aug 6 2023,positive,cast writing grappling with all the nuance of this story the bigger ethical quandary of being a scientist and creating something evil  prometheus  wow
Aug 6 2023,positive,great movie with fantastic acting all around the board but especially by cillian murphy and robert downey jr
Aug 6 2023,positive,surprisingly good movie  interesting story
Aug 6 2023,positive,nolans script is an impressive cinematic distilation of bird and sherwins biography of oppenheimer american prometheus
Aug 6 2023,positive,it starts slow like many nolan movies but the build up is worth it add to that the score is amazing would see it again for sure
Aug 6 2023,positive,very accurate and compelling  great acting
Aug 6 2023,positive,a movie worthy of multiple nominations the story was well told acting sound lighting cinematography all a i genuinely felt like i had not taken a breath the entire time must see
Aug 6 2023,positive,excellent  fully engaging does not feel like 3 hours  interesting backstory of political maneuvering around the scientific breakthrough  compelling performances including some awesome emily blunt strength in the last third
Aug 6 2023,positive,extremely well done great acting kept me on the edge of my my seat the whole movie
Aug 6 2023,positive,the perfect dilation of time accompanied by conscience expressed by violins an incessant questioning about morality physics politics love all virtuously assembled by christopher nolan and the brilliant performance of cillian murphy robert downey jr emily blunt matt damon and florence pugh in addition to the entire working group and actors
Aug 6 2023,neutral,rambling movie with too many story lines coming and going youll need a scorecard to keep everything together way too much music too i dont need three hours of nonstop music i really can figure out an important line of dialogue without the help of overly dramatic music behind it half the time it was hard to hear the dialogue anyway because the music and sound effects were in full force we saw it in imax and suffered the blistering loud music and sound effects quite a few times the audience covered their ears it was that loud the one good thing was robert downey jr his was definitely an academy award performance
Aug 6 2023,positive,gave me a new understanding as to what went on with the decision to create and utilize the two bombs
Aug 6 2023,positive,outstanding performances
Aug 6 2023,positive,while a bit long  this is a top notch film from beginning to end  and a nice contrast from all the vapid and wile films being cranked out as of late  must see history for the public  not pretty but immensely important subject matter 
Aug 6 2023,positive,fantastic movie best ive seen in many many years
Aug 6 2023,positive,oppenheimer was a good movie the story is well executed but focus mostly on the character they didnt show everything about project manhattan certainly not the radiation accident i wish it would have been there just to show it wasnt that easy the acting is superb the pace is fantastic i was confuse on how we got from the pseudo trial of oppenheimer to the congress hearing in black and white the music is fun and special the length of the movie was a bit much for me but its hard to say what should have been cut oppenheimer was a complicated person after all i give it 92 not a real documentary but clause enough to historical facts nolan was masterful in its craft here so did the majority of the actors that made me think of thirteen days in terms of acting performance
Aug 6 2023,positive,hands down the best movie of the year well acted and thoughtful while also riveting the four leads are standouts
Aug 6 2023,negative,so unnecessarily long could have cut out lots of scenes to make it more digestible also unnecessary nude scenes never understand those and never will i felt as though i saw more boob than atomic bomb this movie was a snooze and was weird
Aug 6 2023,positive,a terrific film about the complex life of the j robert oppenheimer and his involvement in the development of the atomic bomb another triumph for christopher nolan grade a
Aug 6 2023,positive,this is a great movie and plays out a monumental time in history  though this ended a war the creation of the abomb lead to careless nuclear testing throughout the country and lots of cancer especially in children
Aug 6 2023,positive,seems american government has changed very little
Aug 6 2023,positive,wonderful movie  great story and wonderful actors
Aug 6 2023,positive,kept the interest moving along in such an intense film
Aug 6 2023,positive,methodically done nolans work is phenomenal the frame with florence and cillian in the chairs  looked like a painting by matisse the pieces of flesh and skeletons of the japanese floating into the shot were artful and all that was needed   cillian murphy gives a stellar performance as oppenheimer he is focused and determined as the father of the atomic bomb his eyes so full of light and darkness at the same time how do you do that many accolades ahead also robert downey jr was impressive my favourite performance of his loved seeing him play this kind of role all the cast brought the a game this is chris nolans genius the script tells the story so movingly the journey of a man   who was needed then discarded a man so brilliant yet so unsure a person of great passion yet very serious it was all there in the script also the horrific power of this bomb its  deadly force which was brought to life on the screen  what could be ahead nolans vision of the manhattan project is timely and thought provoking a master piece
Aug 6 2023,positive,definitely deserves to run the table at the oscars this year  best movie ive ever seen and thats saying something
Aug 6 2023,positive,it just astounded me how they treated oppenheimer  it amazes me how people in power can ruin  other people with their 12 truths
Aug 6 2023,positive,oppenheimer is the type of movie to have you root for the people who made the nuclear bomb you leave the theater feeling unsafe and it goes further than what was advertised in the trailers where its more about his life and what he faced after he made the bombs it never gives a simple answer with twists throughout this is a slow movie though so if youre not up to sitting in a theater for 3 hours watching people talking then this might not be for you this movie is about the characters not about the explosions its an extremely interesting and compelling film great acting it looks amazing this is a must see film for everyone its better than barbie go watch it in theaters 9410
Aug 6 2023,neutral,the acting visuals directing cinematography are all absolutely fantastic the movie is far far too long and drags considerably because of this nolan overindulges and this should have been edited down to a much shorter movie     the story revolves around two courtlike hearings the development and science behind the atomic bomb is really not the focus of the movie this makes the story very dry and quite boring    the movie starts with interesting visuals when oppenheimer is imagining atomic structures but this is dropped very quickly why i fully expected this to return later during the bomb test showing us the steps of the explosion at the atomic level instead there is a bright light and cillian murphy speaks those famous lines we all know will be in the movie then its over then the movie keeps going completely unnecessarily for another hour or so    did this particular story need to be told after seeing the movie i dont actually think so
Aug 6 2023,positive,engaging and engrossing never bored highly recommend
Aug 6 2023,positive,cillian murphy and rdjr brought an acting class to this movie  in depth story that utilizes color b and w and creative uses of sound and explosions to create thought provoking piece  highly recommend although some parts do go on longer than they should but nothing too egregious
Aug 6 2023,positive,why did they have those awful sex scenes in the movie  it took away from the story  they could have been showed talking without the nudity  thats why i didnt give it 5 stars
Aug 6 2023,positive,this is absolutely a masterpiece its wonderful and complete its like a gift from god its an awesome experience congratulations to the director and the cast the team to everyone that make this movie was possible yeah this is cinema ladys and gentlemans
Aug 6 2023,positive,very good movie  three stories intervowen oppenheimers life and its framing before the manhattan project the manhattan project itself and then his moral quandry and political fallout behind his legacy of being the father of the abomb his association with communism and his expressed dubiousness of inventing thermonuclear weapons    the movie lost a star because the stakes triumph and destructive power of trinity were still understated even though the movie made the test a major plot point
Aug 6 2023,positive,made a rotten tomatoes account just to rate this movie 5 stars would rate it 6 if i could
Aug 6 2023,positive,very informative a little slow going but still a good movie wish it gave more detail of what happened to him in the years he did not get security clearance what he did before the truth was told
Aug 6 2023,positive,it was a great movie from beginning to end great plot
Aug 6 2023,positive,oppenheimer consists of tremendous performances by multiple members of the cast along with breathtaking visuals that will leave audiences in awe this film definitely lived up to the hype and is worth seeing a plethora of times
Aug 6 2023,positive,film hopefully corrected the reputation of oppenheimer it could have been 1234 of an hour shorter and still make the points
Aug 6 2023,positive,great movie just a little too long
Aug 6 2023,positive,a cinematic masterpiece the best movie ive seen in years phenomenal cast and acting was superb
Aug 6 2023,positive,historical interesting great acting but too long wish i waited to watch it at home
Aug 6 2023,positive,i predict an academy award for robert downey jr
Aug 6 2023,positive,very interesting well done
Aug 6 2023,positive,extremely good movie that kept moving forward it was a 3 hour movie that did not feel like it very good supporting cast
Aug 6 2023,positive,fantastic time well spent on a quality film a rarity these days highly recommend cillian well earned an oscar  incredible performance by him and this outstanding cast
Aug 6 2023,positive,interesting story a little long
Aug 6 2023,positive,did not like hearing gods name taken in vein but then hollywood has become a godless cesspool other than that the movie was boring
Aug 6 2023,positive,cinematography was really amazing  the back and forth in history was really well done  great historical narrative of this time during world war ii
Aug 6 2023,positive,long and dry at times great acting
Aug 6 2023,positive,intense movie with great actors
Aug 6 2023,positive,we related to the timing since we were children listening to the motorola during ww2
Aug 5 2023,positive,the movie was excellent phenomenal cast and interesting story but the audio was so loud as to be oppressive not so much the dialogue and the musical track i had a huge headache after 3 hours of it
Aug 5 2023,negative,saw it based on other good reviews id seen  however i really didnt like this movie  kept jumping around in time i couldnt tell who the characters were and seemed to be no character development   i just really didnt think it was a good script or story
Aug 5 2023,positive,oppenheimer was a well made movie but cross cutting was terribly confusing they spent way too much on senate hearings oppenheimer investigation they could have easily cut 30 minutes from the film the best part of the film was robert downey jr although it took me most of the fin to understand his role
Aug 5 2023,positive,bomb go boom robert slanging that cockenheimer
Aug 5 2023,positive,it was a good movie if you understood all about atomic   bomb if you just wanted  to be entertained i give it a thumbs down so i thought the acting was really good
Aug 5 2023,positive,oscar worthy performance by cillian murphy  nolan employed his usual cast of character actors with great work by downey jr and matt damon  sometimes the score would drown out the dialogue but that just may have been the theater
Aug 5 2023,positive,kept my interest from beginning to the end
Aug 5 2023,positive,riveting performances and an in depth dive into oppenheimer
Aug 5 2023,positive,amazing movie christopher nolan deserves an oscar for this film  the whole cast is amazing
Aug 5 2023,positive,not as good as hopedadvertised long but a decent watch for sure more documentary than entertaining movie
Aug 5 2023,positive,movie was excellent
Aug 5 2023,positive,epitome of acting direction and cinematography its hard to express how great this movie was so sad this generation will understand what this movie stands for waiting for more nolan movies
Aug 5 2023,negative,just saw oppenheimer kept waiting for tommys crew to deliver some hurt in the name of the peaky blinders it was hard to get over that and one of the other characters was the man who shot jesse james hard to get over that not my idea of physicists    the movie was too long the political slant was also hard to ignore i imagine the left loves this movie
Aug 5 2023,positive,run dont walk go see it best movie in years wow
Aug 5 2023,negative,feels like the movie was written by a lawyer how can you make a movie so boring and void of emotional impact this movie is about politics not a single frame shows any actual impact the atomic bombs can cause the guy who sat in front of me left in the middle of the film my wife fell asleep and i was constantly thinking when does the movie start  what a waste of time
Aug 5 2023,positive,loved it  very intense and informative the whole way thru  cillian murphy and r downy jr both amazing
Aug 5 2023,positive,excellent movie  conflict between human americans highly engaging and troubling
Aug 5 2023,positive,great historical account excellent acting ensemble
Aug 5 2023,positive,great movie great soundtrack good acting and very historical its one of christopher nolans best movies i liked seeing a lot of established and actors that i havent seen in a while in the movie definitely a must watch
Aug 5 2023,positive,i saw it with my 47 year old son and we both found it entertaining and informative
Aug 5 2023,positive,a masterpiece of film
Aug 5 2023,positive,though it was three hours i was glad nothing was cut everything added to understanding the era the man the world he was in the movie moved fast i was never bored  even the science was understanable  the only bad thing was that robert downey jr and matt damon did not disaappear into their characters you never forgot that it was them the other actors were absolutely brilliant cillian murphy was mesmerizing emily blunt florence pugh were brilliant even josh harnett ravi malek kenneth branaugh matthew modine disappeared into their roles
Aug 5 2023,positive,incredibly made biopic can not recommend enough i have seen this twice and already and still want to see it again
Aug 5 2023,neutral,long movie with a lot of dialog when nolan wants you to feel something he turns up the volume to 11  seems overly indulgent
Aug 5 2023,positive,cillian murphy is fantastic rdj as captivating as ever the film doesnt feel as long as it is as christopher nolan takes you through brilliant plot of the father of the atomic bomb
Aug 5 2023,positive,a few peoples laughed a few people cried most people were silent  i am become death destroyer of worlds    amazing movie if you fall asleep and or dont like it youre an idiot who only thinks mid ass fighting movies are good and are too dumb to realize good writing since youve numbed your brain with pure trash 1010 movie
Aug 5 2023,positive,spectacular cillian murphy was magnificent
Aug 5 2023,neutral,certainly not for me though it was intelligent with an amazing cast it was far too long and too boring to keep my attention it felt to me that most if not all of this movie was scripted interviews and lectures it was mostly talking while our main character stares into space i was ready for it to be over an hour in and still had two hours to sit through however with that being said a lot of history was in this movie and it was a very educational film that was well filmed and directed
Aug 5 2023,positive,phenomenal outstanding acting and a gripping story
Aug 5 2023,positive,this movie is unquestionably the best movie i have ever seen it is truly a masterpiece
Aug 5 2023,positive,that movie totally blew me away great acting great cinematograph great directing however one needs a bit of curiosity in world history to fully enjoy it as it is mostly conversation based and pretty long
Aug 5 2023,positive,i thought this movie was great its not for everyone due to it being 3 hours long but the acting was superb visuals amazing soundtrack comparable to interstellar and the story was great some inaccuracies but it was still a fantastic watch i give it five stars because as most five star movies are this is definitely a must see
Aug 5 2023,positive,i wasnt big brain to understand
Aug 5 2023,positive,incredible acting for the most part well done
Aug 5 2023,positive,the story is amazing  the acting was superb  but in my opinion the film was overdramatized choppy and contained unnecessary nudity that we didnt need to see   the plot jumped around too much making it challenging to follow the numerous characters  sometimes a movie is more powerful when its told in a simple straightforward way without all the artistic dramatization
Aug 5 2023,positive,i thought it was visually stunning but i lost interest in the middle of the movie and came back toward the end
Aug 5 2023,positive,masterpiece top to bottom acting cinematography score just amazing better win best picture
Aug 5 2023,positive,room for improvement but pretty good movie as a whole especially considering the length of it any movie of that length has to be somewhat decent otherwise it would quickly get bad reviews
Aug 5 2023,positive,there were parts that were too sciency for me and i got lost but thats just me and it didnt impact the story as a whole  sometimes the musical score was so loud that it was hard to hear what they were saying so i may have missed some details especially with different accents  lots of complex characters and stellar acting by everyone  it was such a rollercoaster
Aug 5 2023,positive,the best movie ive ever seen 10 out of 10
Aug 5 2023,positive,should win at least best actor award and best picture
Aug 5 2023,positive,brilliant beautifully paced stellar performances very serious subject sad dont go tired unless youre a history lecturer you need to keep up a masterpiece cillian murphy owned it without overplaying it perfect performance
Aug 5 2023,positive,flawless cast and riveting detailed story about the events that would change our world forever its a long movie yet a shorter film would not have been possible a must see
Aug 5 2023,positive,oppenheimer has been my most anticipated movie ever since it was announced the hype going into this movie for me was absurd every single expectation i had for this was met and exceeded christopher nolans direction was astonishing it blew my mind seeing some of the scenes he made the writing was perfect and i loved the way how the movie jumped through time the editing was incredible and it made every scene so much better the sound design is what made this movie it singlehandedly made this movie stand out from any other christopher nolan movie ive seen the bomb test scene is probably the most extraordinary scene ive ever seen in a theater i need to see this movie again and again i never thought id say this but it rivals interstellar in terms of christopher nolan films im genuinely astonished at how incredible this was this is without a doubt the best movie of 2023 as of july 20th
Aug 5 2023,positive,wow  well hear oppenheimer several times at the academy awards next year
Aug 5 2023,positive,great movie very long but moves at a really good pace
Aug 5 2023,positive,probably nolans best movie since interstellar the story the performances the score and i mean all is just too perfect for me the ending really did give me chills
Aug 5 2023,positive,i love cillian murphy since 28 days later thats it and that is all
Aug 5 2023,positive,good movie but i wish it wouldve flowed differently
Aug 5 2023,positive,superb a film buffs dream relying on acting and not cgi
Aug 5 2023,positive,great acting and story  this provided a very interesting backstory about the manhattan project and conflicts for all involved
Aug 5 2023,positive,the ultimate cinema experience
Aug 5 2023,positive,fabulous job telling the story of a flawed hero
Aug 5 2023,positive,nolan does it again oppenheimer has so many levels but is manageable for most viewers to follow from the physics to the story behind each scientist involved from the politics to the morality of building such a beautiful but frightening creation it wont be everyones cup of tea but cant deny it was brilliantly shot
Aug 5 2023,positive,outstanding movie nolans best to date
Aug 5 2023,positive,such a great film cillian murphy deserves an oscar for this film
Aug 5 2023,positive,this movie really is a masterpiece see it in imax if possible the storyline script visuals actors sound and score are on point i really cant think of a single critical thing to say about it and even at three hours the time flew by memorable and worth a second viewing
Aug 5 2023,positive,blew my mind  even better than barbie
Aug 5 2023,positive,this is a really deep movie makes you think
Aug 5 2023,positive,great acting great story  the dialogues should have been more audible very difficult to follow the conversations with the constant background score and without subtitles  whole movie has no positive note of background scorelighting ranging from serious to negative tone
Aug 5 2023,positive,it was very well doneacting and directingbut very sobering  scary if someone in power decides to use weapons irresponsibly  my faith in god sustains me in any case scenario
Aug 5 2023,positive,incredible movie must watch
Aug 5 2023,positive,too longstory line was hard to follow
Aug 5 2023,positive,it was a great history movie
Aug 5 2023,positive,imax 70mm full screen projection without interferance reclyning seats with pre selection to avoid long wait well producted film tells a story in a quick paced  thrilling fashion  a few scenes could be removed to shorten viewing time a must see in imax for honest movie experience
Aug 5 2023,positive,beautifully shot and sequences interspersed to keep it interesting but it was far too long and boring in the middle for me great cast too but just felt it should have been two hours or less
Aug 5 2023,positive,easily the best movie of the year emily blunt and cillian murphy was outstanding again as they were in quite place the nudity was unnecessary but overall i give it a 99 out of 10 this will be a longtime classic unlike most of the movies being pumped out today which will be forgettable
Aug 5 2023,positive,this movie was 3 hours long and fascinating  but the sound editing or the absence of adr was such a terrible distraction  there was loud music over much of the dialogue so that i missed relevant facts that prevented me from really knowing the entire story of oppenheimer and his ultimate relationship with the government  my understanding is that mr nolan does not like adr and so that is his choice but i found it extremely annoying as did many of the other people in the theater  i went back to see it a 2nd time which i imagine many people will and that should make universal happy and nolan if he has points
Aug 5 2023,positive,it was a great movie but if you think that this movie is about the bomb just remember its about the man who makes the bomb its a great movie
Aug 5 2023,positive,this movie is visually stunning and the acting is amazing    really shows the trauma this man went through      truly an experience
Aug 5 2023,positive,great movie be sure to go to a cinema with recliner seats so you dont get too uncomfortable in normal cinema seats as its 3hrs long
Aug 5 2023,positive,amazing acting great drama and captured the emotional rollercoaster so well
Aug 5 2023,positive,oppenheimer has stunning cinematography perfect cast cillian murphy fits so well as roberts character
Aug 5 2023,positive,loved everything about the movie  great story and cast  thought a movie this long might drag at some point but this was not the case
Aug 5 2023,positive,i had to mark down this movie because wu chien shiung was missing from it  shes a great example of an intelligent strong woman especially considering the time she lived in during the early 20th century in real life she played a very important part in the project and made significant contributions in the fields of nuclear and particle physics
Aug 5 2023,positive,loved it have now seen it three times its a must see in cinemas the feeling of the score played on a cinema surround sound system and extremely beautiful shots on the big screen cannot be replicated any other place than at the cinemas its very well paced and there was never a dull moment i found myself being completely engaged in the movie for the entire 3 hours
Aug 5 2023,positive,loved the story line acting and overall feel of the movie
Aug 5 2023,positive,the the script was effective and stimulating  the fx and setting were stunning  the script arrears to be quite historically accurate
Aug 5 2023,positive,very entertaining and educational
Aug 5 2023,positive,it was a great story but could have been edited better and was imho too long  the story in 3 acts felt a bit out of order and perhaps should have culminated with the los alamos test  aside from that would very much recommend
Aug 5 2023,positive,although not action packed nolan was able to keep you on the edge of your seat with magnificent production and storytelling
Aug 5 2023,positive,another absolutely engrossing nolan movie where he gets the best out of every top tier actor involved clearly actors are dying to work with him because it seems like every scene has another a list actor happy to say just one or two lines and give it their all 3 hours moves and feels like 2 i wish nolan would prioritize dialogue clarity a bit more in the sound mixing though its not as bad as tenet and dark knight rises but otherwise another sensational movie only nolan could have made
Aug 5 2023,positive,the pacing was good and as long as you go in expecting a biopic and not just a history of the manhattan project youll be pleased     more nudity than id like though didnt serve much real purpose either
Aug 5 2023,positive,a five  in every category 
Aug 5 2023,positive,three hours but felt like less than one wish it had been longer to include more excellent editing
Aug 5 2023,positive,it was a very interesting and relevant story with a lot of top actors in it
Aug 5 2023,neutral,moviewas too long and although interesting  it was tedious
Aug 5 2023,positive,a little long but a well acted informative film
Aug 5 2023,positive,i understood like 20 of it but it was still really good some scenes were unnecessary which is why im giving it a four star
Aug 5 2023,positive,i loved this movie cillian murphy was utterly believable the entire way through emily blunt was fantastic and this was probably the best ive ever seen from robert downey jr  the pacing was excellent nolan pulls the viewer along and provides an intensity that youd normally experience in an action movie or thriller combined with that you feel the struggle and anguish that came with creating a weapon of mass destruction and knowing what was being unleashed    the story the acting the score and the visual effects were second to none christopher nolan has once again achieved an incredible success and remains one of my favourite directors
Aug 5 2023,positive,oppenheimer a sort of biopic dedicated to the creator of the atomic bomb and director christopher nolans obsession with time right at the beginning the film is divided into fission and fusion terms that correspond as a timeline to oppenheimers story in the first division we find the protagonist in his younger period in europe then in the usa and his involvement with the communist party and the manhattan project fus√£o on the other hand is related to the future differing by the use of black and white on the scene at a certain point this timeline will end up clashing which i thought was an excellent idea an excellent metaphor to follow when the film is about the life of the creator and father of the bomb as well as its explosion itself    the film is not mostly about the bomb or a historical drama or an autobiography the feature works well as a character study making the project more intimate and much more tense however without the great action sequences that some of the directors films bring  we are faced with long moral ethical and also social dialogues about the impact and the decision to use the material produced in the midst of a war scenario the famous what if in my view it is like a dome in the narrative if the americans didnt do it the germans could do it or the russians one way or another there would be a big explosion    nolan and his team managed to create a real explosion in miniature with elements that simulated the brightness of the mushroom cloud and the footage was taken very close the result of which was seen and felt on screen and its really mad at the moment    oppenheimer is a dense mature objective intelligent film and an instigation to the most inappetizing productions for cinema the atmosphere that the film creates from its beginning to its end is a mutation and explosion worthy of a bomb while valuing the viewers intelligence    this is cinema
Aug 5 2023,negative,tell dont show experience 
Aug 5 2023,positive,pace complexity nuance
Aug 5 2023,positive,outstanding its a 3 hour movie that feels like a 2 hour movie in the best way must see
Aug 5 2023,negative,only christopher nolan could take a truly fascinating story from history and coat it in such an overwhelming thick layer of nolanness to leave the viewer more bewildered than engaged    watching oppenheimer felt like watching the prestige memento and interstellar simultaneously too loud too jumbled too long overwhelming spectacle but lacking actual intimacy with the characters typical nolan in other words    there are some flashes of good moments but the whole thing just doesnt come together in any coherent way for me somehow in three hours nolan didnt find time to get me to care about any of the characters or the focal events of the movie two confirmation hearings he tried to turn it into the prestige or memento and i just dont think it worked for this story
Aug 5 2023,positive,this movie doesnt limited itself within just a bomb blast it didnt justify or discredits someone they way it brings us inside the mind and thoughts of characters are deeply impactful its a movie to think about and even might give you some answer about yourself if you see it right and wise
Aug 5 2023,neutral,the storyline was fine the nudity and graphic sexual behavior was totally unnecessary had i known it was in the movie i would have chosen another movie
Aug 5 2023,positive,frenetic energy starts this film and keeps the pace going with an amazing score all the way to the end nolan has done it again
Aug 5 2023,positive,to start i have seen oppenheimer 10 times all in different formats  imax dolby 70mm etc i believe this is christopher nolans masterpiece he is running on all cylinders in very way wheee i was completely in gaged in the characters work dialogue production design the score  sound mixing  editing  i believe this film will stand the rest of time and will be remembered as a classic  nolans best work so far 
Aug 5 2023,negative,slow long boring great acting but horrible horrible story and script slow slow slow wanted to leave before end
Aug 5 2023,positive,i really didnt want to go but glad i did it was better than i expected not a lot of action so you had to follow the dialog to keep up the end of the movie was very similar to what is actually happening today with the trump indictments
Aug 5 2023,negative,i havent seen barbie so maybe thats the one but for me this is the most overrated movie of this decade absolutely zero reason to see it in imax and my god i miss hans zimmer working with nolan dont remember a single bit of the score which was such a big reason why nolans films held up so well
Aug 5 2023,positive,quantum physics not a subject that im remotely interested in or understand however thats not necessary to enjoy this film the human elements of a genius are at work here loved that he and many others involved in this project struggled with the impact their work had on the world we still have the effects of this today also loved that einstein was in the mix
Aug 5 2023,positive,a movie that is a neccessity to see the last scene alone is just haunting    extremely well acted extremely well composed visually stunning incredible sound product    just all round an incredible film
Aug 5 2023,positive,a thoughtprovoking film on the atomic bombs devastating consequences with excellent casting and superior filming techniques its 3 hours fly by swiftly
Aug 5 2023,positive,great movie i learned so much about that time in history the movie was long but kept you interested and at the edge of your seat
Aug 5 2023,positive,fantastic movie i went in with the expectation that i would like the film but being 3 hours long that it would drag on at some points this was not the case brilliant acting and tremendous writing kept me fully engaged and entertained throughout the musical score also does a good job in setting the scenes i saw it opening afternoon in a regular imax the following week in a regular theater and seeing it again tonight in imax 70mm  the format christopher nolan himself says is the best way to watch it its that good that i wouldnt forgive myself for not seeing it in this format
Aug 5 2023,positive,really great movie 1010 would see it again you can really tell they did research about it before making the film
Aug 5 2023,positive,interesting narrative from mr oppenheimers point of view and his internal conflicts and contradictions superb use of images in contrasts with soundssilences i found however unbearable that its entirely made of dialogues with a constant background music as if it was a soap opera deffo not the best nolan as limited by a real history
Aug 5 2023,positive,to watch this movie you need to be interested in physics and history so not everyone will like it but i can say one thing its a movie worth watching it is very interesting and valuable i recommend this movie for anyone who is curious about how the most deadly weapon in history was created
Aug 5 2023,positive,the drama and complexity of the movie
Aug 5 2023,positive,im tired of movie companies and producers just making movie documentaries as well as some scenes were in black and white which i think knowbody is a fan ofand lastly the moive was way to longa lot of people in the generation have short attention spans and know one can watch a moive for 3 hoursbut the rest of the moive was alright
Aug 5 2023,positive,just a well made movie from start to finish
Aug 5 2023,negative,what a waste of cast and my time at the movie theater by far nolans worst
Aug 5 2023,positive,nolans follow up to his first historical movie reaches even higher levels a masterpiece
Aug 5 2023,positive,amazing to see in the 70mm codec
Aug 5 2023,positive,volume was overall too loud and had moments of intended shock by going from dead silence to a very loud sequence still i feel that this movie is going to win awards for it sound design and editing
Aug 5 2023,positive,a cinematic masterpiece from christopher nolan a great casting with immaculate performance all around a perfect goal from the director after the disappointment from tenet deserves all the hype anyone saying otherwise either didnt understood the movie or dont know how movies are made   the movie is no way perfect like others from the director but the positives outways the negative   cillian finally gets the role he deserves and other casts are great as well
Aug 5 2023,positive,outstanding brilliant masterpiece     all the stellar actors in the movie were superb but if i have to choose from the bunch then it would obviously be cillian murphy and rdj
Aug 5 2023,neutral,this film is more of the same rewriting of history in which we are supposed to believe that committing genocide on innocent people is ok if some people think it may end war  genocide is never ok and the rush to make the nuclear bomb and dropping it on innocent people in japan was about world domination and racism not ending war    yes oppenheimer came to regret his involvement later but this may have had more to do with his persecution as a suspected communist by us authorities rather than true regret   there is a legitimate question of whether oppenheimer would have regretted anything if he was regarded as a hero by the us government rather than a suspect who gave away the nuclear secrets to the russians  russia getting the bomb as well undermined us hegemony which has always been the ultimate goal of the deep state even today    they talk about freedom and democracy but when it comes right down to it the us being on top of the world is all that really matters
Aug 5 2023,neutral,i dont understand all the five star reviews i entered the cinema really wanting to like this instead i found it overwrought with intense ceaseless dialogue and illogical editing monotonous and somewhat mind numbing i wanted to leave a number of times but hung in there for perhaps some profound wrap up that never occurred 
Aug 5 2023,negative,probably the worst film i can recall  excessive and unnecessary loud music  i imagine the productionediting team must be marvel comic fans    pity the interesting subject matter was so badly treated
Aug 5 2023,positive,really great movie felt the impact of what they achieved and it makes you want to study physics 
Aug 5 2023,positive,it was great but flawed in some respects
Aug 5 2023,positive,it was hard to follow in some places and it was quite long but the cast was excellent
Aug 5 2023,positive,extraordinary movie with brilliant script and narrationvery well picturised and screen play is very goodmust watch movie
Aug 5 2023,positive,very good very long
Aug 5 2023,positive,excellent movie did not feel like 3 hours highly recommended
Aug 5 2023,positive,first thoughts  this is an incredibly horrifying movie i am sad and i am scared and nobody seems to care     additional thoughts  1 i believe people need to understand that when we try to play god we actually become a god of sorts that is a power that no one should have     2 i think that there is a lesson we all must revisit with this movie a lesson as old as time  that once fire catches it catches quickly and it is capable of casting both light and shadows    final thoughts  as people left the theater someone said you should be happy remind me again what exactly it is that i should be happy about
Aug 5 2023,negative,did not live up to the hype so much jumping around and so much happening yet felt like it dragged on no emotional pull for any of the characters overall a very big disappointment
Aug 5 2023,positive,i was so happy when einstein appear and the name heissenberg was mention
Aug 5 2023,positive,the powerful narrative enhanced the suspense direct and indirect characterization the movie clearly explained the historical perspective of the time and had a twist at the climax that completed the story multiple award winner
Aug 5 2023,positive,boring at the  beginning  but got better
Aug 5 2023,positive,well to me it was a great movie but is not the best movie of nolan and i also dont believe it is gonna be the best movie of the year will see is a historic movie so i understand nolan had to respect the story but for me it was too long the last 12 hour was more for give some time to robert jr i suppose they both talked about the role and the time on the screen but i seems to me downey should do more in this movie but early on  put him until the end it feels a waste of time i guess it is because history is that way but overall i think it was a good movie in the beginning i felt i was watching the scenes of the movie a beautiful mind of russell crowe with that said i believe the performances of all actors were top notch my advice is if you get distracted easily this one is not for you you have to pay attention to keep the ritmo great job to nolan but to be honest this is the first time i dont want to see a movie of him twice
Aug 5 2023,positive,what i really liked about it where the stories of the manhattan team that was assembled
Aug 5 2023,positive,what an incredible experience with 70mm not sure if i can justify the added cost and the 70mm benefits i think it was an awesome experience but not sure if it was really worth it seeing it being on an actual paper film was neat though aside from that its a great movie drama ofc but great story
Aug 5 2023,negative,this movie sucks it looks just a reshape of history and brain wash
Aug 5 2023,negative,nudity and sex scenes unnecessary detraction from movie making unsuitable for family viewing scene about poisoned apple possibly a lie and thus rather criminal to show and the advertisements before the show were way way way too long and contained occultism and lude content which was something i deeply resent being exposed to especially at the high cost of tickets
Aug 5 2023,positive,i had looked forward to oppenheimer and wasnt disappointed i thought it was well acted extremely believable and true to history the fact that his work was turned into a political weapon was tragic
Aug 5 2023,positive,    12  out of 5  fantastically written dynamic edited and powerful historical take several geniuses that changed the world    writer director and producer christophernolen created another triumph in filmmaking and ill start this review with my only problem with the film  the length at 180 minutes long 3 hours  i barely made it all the way through  however in the course of the first 2 hours at least 20 people in the packed theatre left and returned to relieve themselves when movies in the 30s 40s and 50s were made of this length  intermissions were written in now because commerce wins over the experience  even imax cant relieve your bladder this is why i didnt give this film 5 stars unfortunately being comfortable and not peeing in your pants is important to me    about the film  cillianmurphy does an awardwinning performance as the oppressed genius oppenheimer  emilyblunt portrays one of the confused wives of oppenheimer mattdamon plays a military colonel who both hinders and eventually helps the cause of the heart of the story robertdowneyjr pulls in an amazing bad guy performance as egotistically driven republican senator thatoh spoilers smaller but important roles went to great performances from both ramimalek and kennethbranagh    the story is about his life colleagues and the realization of the world geniuses and their regret to becoming gods    with the cinematography by hoytevanhoytema the dynamic editing of the historic timeline and complicated script by editor jennifer lame and the accompanying signature heartpounding score by themandalorians own ludwigg√∂ransson  this film is wonderfully entertaining    films these days are way to long do twopartners add intermissions or read the script and cut and edit what isnt relevant to the characters or story when doing epics  never forget your audience great film  you might enjoy it more in the comfort of your own home    lorenzo m    geekauthority thegeekauthority     film film  website   youtube   twiter geekauthorty    instagram thegeekauthority  
Aug 5 2023,positive,astonishing from the sound to the cinematography to the dialog really amazing experience all around i highly recommend to watch it in theater
Aug 5 2023,positive,this is probably the best movie of the last decade welltold enticing and massive
Aug 5 2023,positive,the movie was well profound and thought provoking
Aug 5 2023,positive,amazing film about historically significant events long but flows well 
Aug 5 2023,positive,if you dont enjoy history documentaries or facing the truth of our past then you need to steer clear of this movie i seenheard alot of complaints exiting the movie from knuckle draggers and mouth breathers that thought somehow this would be a ji joe type of film    this movie was everything the trailers made it out to be a man deep in thought contemplating what he has done to the world and trying to justify it  all the actors were amazing
Aug 5 2023,positive,the movie kept me yearning for more
Aug 5 2023,positive,interesting story around the lives who helped create the atomic bomb and fantastic dreamlike visuals in the great mind of j robert oppenheimer
Aug 5 2023,positive,out of all of nolans movies this one probably took me the longest to figure out how all of the different timelines fit together but i think it is a very well made movie personally i do think the insistence on not using cgi for the bomb resulted in something that was very obviously not a nuclear explosion still a good moment but cgi could have improved it imo visuals and score are top notch as always see it in imax 70mm if you can or at least 4k hdr later
Aug 5 2023,negative,more about politics than the bombtrailer way better than the film will probably win oscars for performances but not a sign of an entertaining film also an hour to long
Aug 5 2023,negative,too loud too long technically well made except for the soundtrack which played loudly in the background 9999 of the time for much of the movie i could barely make sense of what the characters were saying i was getting bored after the first hour but had another two hours to endure historically an important film but history isnt always exciting
Aug 5 2023,positive,the movie did not have to be that long   at times the flash backs were confusing
Aug 5 2023,positive,great cast  intense story
Aug 5 2023,neutral,couldnt even been done with 45 minutes less one climax and the rest meh
Aug 5 2023,positive,phenomenal pacing did not notice how 3 hours were over
Aug 5 2023,positive,excellent simply great script casting  cinematography
Aug 5 2023,positive,absolutely phenomenal film christopher nolan is a literal god at filmmaking
Aug 5 2023,negative,if i wanted to go deaf from a background sound track i can think of lots of other movies to watch the volume level of the soundtrack had my wife and i covering our ears repeatedly because of the volume at which the movies soundtrack played was so loud it was painful then to make matters worse the volume for the dialogue was low and difficult to make out its too bad they allowed background audio track to overwhelm the dialogue very unfortunate then lets add the faux sepia tone in the coloring neither black and white nor color which has been done way too many times cant imagine how this movie gets a 4 star rating in the chicago papers it sucked
Aug 5 2023,negative,please for the love of god dont believe the hype this movie was bad as in capital f effing awful this was my birthday wish to go to the flicks and i thought how could this go wrong but man was i wrong please dont trust rotten tomatoes i cant trust them anymore everyone has given this pile of dog crap a good score it doesnt deserve it it was absolutely awful please believe me its over 3 hours of your life you could literally be doing almost anything else and have a better time if youre reading this to yourself or your partner and wondering whether or not you should watch it please just know that i had to create a rotten tomatos account just to write this review my first one thats how effing bad this movie was dont try it im right
Aug 5 2023,positive,it is a good movie but felt extremely choppy as they jumped back and forth between timeframes  i would have liked to see more about the development of the bomb itself  also it was hard to keep track of all the different characters responsibilities role in building the bomb
Aug 5 2023,negative,i honestly dont know how its getting such high reviews i would rather watch paint dry
Aug 5 2023,positive,a film we didnt know we needed shoutout josh peck too
Aug 5 2023,positive,loved the history lesson that was this movie
Aug 5 2023,positive,cant believe this was a 3 hour movie great movie if all movies were this good theaters would be packed
Aug 5 2023,positive,a masterpiece in cinematography a well thought out story there are so many small details you might have to watch it a second time to fully see them all best seen in imax
Aug 5 2023,negative,i dont understand the rave reviews to call it a masterpiece is pretty ridiculous too long of a movie thats drags through most of it based on the subject matter i was looking for something more captivating decent acting but a boring film feel like i need to go see a proctologist now for the damage the theater seat did to my posterior
Aug 5 2023,negative,this movie is so longgggg and boring i have no idea why there are any good reviews they tried to hard and they could have cut out 1 hour of the trial and the movie would have been a thousand times better everyone in the theater was just happy to leave when it finally ended dont watch this
Aug 5 2023,positive,the perfect antimarvel film at last we got hands down the movie that zoomers deserved perhaps even a generational film event of the likes of pulp fiction and the matrix oppenheimer lights up peoples intelligence and curiosity instead reducing them to tiktok level as the blockbusters of the last few years have been doing    but anyone regardless the age that has grown a brain and has a minimum of interest in history will love this and this is also a pleaser for the scientists out there and to them one major educational film about moral choices in the evermorecompromising stem careers     i could only repeat the mild critic raised by others about the soundtrack being sometimes maybe a bit too much but like its being said at the start of the film during roberts university years you cant understand the universe properly without learning from the music     the editing is hectic yet the backandforth doesnt look too confusing at some point during that long mock trial that makes up most of the third act i was wondering where it was going how it would end but then bam out of the blue nolan once again came up with a glorious inyourface conclusion as answer to a mystery left open during the whole movie thumbs up for the storytelling    after a few blunders in his last productions dark knight rises tenet even interstellar deserved a level of criticism for the whack storytelling nolan is serving us with a fine work of art of profound philosophical value disguised as a blockbuster
Aug 5 2023,positive,it was exceptionally accurate and sad 
Aug 5 2023,positive,yes a mustsee a bit slow in the beginning but comes together as it progresses some great special effects for oppenheimers surreal struggles with the realities of his work and of course for the explosion scenes and overall outstanding acting
Aug 5 2023,positive,excellent in every way and very thought provoking especially in the times we live in
Aug 5 2023,positive,it was a fine movie until benny safdie attempted whatever dialect that was and then casey affleck mumbled through another role but other than that
Aug 5 2023,neutral,its a good movie but is flawed the sound carried the movie hard but the interpersonal relationships take focus which isnt an issue but there is simply too many of them for me to fully care i also went into this expecting more discussion about theory and the process of building the a bomb and felt that it was lacking it also bounced around way to much felt like a chore at times and for a movie thats already extremely long it suffers from it i cant say i didnt enjoy it because i did but this is definitely a movie that im gonna need a good 5 years before id feel like revisiting go out and see it but temper your expectations
Aug 5 2023,positive,cinematography was amazing and einstein cameos were amazing
Aug 5 2023,positive,a masterpiece truly     incredible cast incredible cinematography and the sound in the 700mm imax was outstanding    instant 100 masterpiece of a movie cannot explain in words how good this movie experience waswhich is exactly what is was a true movie experience and it was just beautiful     theres suspense drama history science military wow insights into how this incredible part of history happened at the end we are human who cannot help ourselvesits within our nature to build create exploreeven if it means something awesome and terrible at the same time     like prometheus oppenheimer gave us fire
Aug 5 2023,positive,it was very well done and enlightening rather than entertaining refreshed some things i knew but learned many things i hadnt known cinematography was incredibly well done and the acting was superb especially cillian murphy emily blunt matt damon snd robert downey jr were all exceptional dont miss this one on the big screen
Aug 5 2023,positive,while it has several scenes of people in a room talking  those scenes are shot like an action movie moving but even more so if you know more of the story
Aug 5 2023,positive,great movie i love historical movies
Aug 5 2023,negative,highly overrated all the characters except the the head actor feels very 1 dimensional i dont like the peaky blinders actor acting it always seems like he is on drugs or something  the movie dragged out way to long editing was horrible lots of mistakes to fit the story  why make everyone speak german in a dutch school in holland dutch is not german why is everyone cheering when they just killed 200000 people and does only the head actor have a moral sense   for a movie of 3 hours i didnt feel connected to 1 character it was watchable but thats it for me if i wasnt in bios i would have go to sleep after the first 30 minutes
Aug 5 2023,positive,the true story is awesome
Aug 5 2023,positive,well produced great acting and insightful recommended
Aug 5 2023,positive,if you went to the movie to see a lot of dead bodies you will be disappointed  the movie is all about oppenheimer like the title and how he got the job to build the bomb how he built it and what happened afterward to disgrace him and how that turned out
Aug 5 2023,positive,i was worried as it is a long movie but it totally held my attention the writing is crisp and doesnt really waste a word i agree that is is much more impactful on a big a screen this isnt one to wait on for streaming
Aug 5 2023,positive,if you grew up huddling under your desk in grade school this is the movie that explains it and the devastating effects of war this movie definitley gets you thinking
Aug 5 2023,positive,great movie and acting
Aug 5 2023,positive,best film ive seen in ages truly outstanding on so many levels if i was king for a day this film would be mandatory viewing in all public schools and institutions of higher learning its not an academic narrative but it is an important benchmark in american history entertainment with a heavy dose of scientific polemics 
Aug 4 2023,positive,the story was griping and engaging my only complaint was that it was too long but i guess it was necessary to make it good
Aug 4 2023,positive,thought the movie was good very good acting by cillian and robert it lost me in some parts but other than that it was good and they could of made the movie little shorter
Aug 4 2023,positive,outstanding movie and acting directed outstandingly by christopher nolan couldnt have asked for more would highly recommend to anyone with an interest in history
Aug 4 2023,positive,it is ok more about the ins and out of the then deep state swamp watchable once i need not see it again
Aug 4 2023,positive,special effects script acting soundtrack superior
Aug 4 2023,positive,star studded movie that takes you on an emotional roller coaster from the opening scene absolutely loved this movie
Aug 4 2023,positive,excellent direction writing and acting by all
Aug 4 2023,positive,the story was too long and wasnt properly executed the character development just wasnt there the filmmaker expected us the audience to know who some of these people were the performances and acting was great my favorite characters were matt damons character einstein and robert downey jrs assistant the cinematography was brilliant the music and sound really hit all the right marks and points
Aug 4 2023,positive,10010 love historical movies and everything about this one is great
Aug 4 2023,positive,great acting  keep me fully engaged throughout the movie

Aug 4 2023,positive,beautiful cinematography nolan is an amazing story teller 1010 would recommend 
Aug 4 2023,positive,hard to hear what the actors were saying voices too fast and low cant wait to see it again on tv with closed caption so my elderly mom can also watch it
Aug 4 2023,positive,at times it was difficult to understand the time frame in a particular sequence
Aug 4 2023,positive,the screenplay and casting are very good  cillian murphy is excellent as oppenheimer and robert downey jr also gives a great performance as does emily blunt  also the sets and location shooting add to the films authenticity and historic relevance  j robert oppenheimer was a very brilliant charismatic enigmatic and engaging scientist of our times  definitely worth viewing on the big screen
Aug 4 2023,positive,seemed to be an accurate historical film very good
Aug 4 2023,positive,well done more than interesting
Aug 4 2023,positive,very good not sure of all the facts i was too young to have any knowledge of the events worth the viewing
Aug 4 2023,positive,a stunning movie with an amazing story with so much historical value while still being able to understand it the visuals were so amazing and it portrays him as such an interesting man as he was this movie deserves more than five stars this hass to be one of the greatest movies ive ever seen in my life congrats to director and everyone who worked on this movie the store it was amazing and everything was amazing about it this movie deserves nothing but five stars or even 10 the acting was amazing the sounds were amazing everything amazing about this movie
Aug 4 2023,positive,stunning a new alltime favorite and certainly my top christopher nolan movie
Aug 4 2023,positive,amazing film  great acting
Aug 4 2023,positive,absolutely a brilliant movie with a script that will make you forget that it is a 3 hour movie  best movie i have seen in years
Aug 4 2023,positive,thinking this would be a great moviehowever saw it today 3 hours long way too long horribly edited no excitement almost fell asleep the movie jumps all over the place no time frames given or understanding who so many characters are in the movie
Aug 4 2023,positive,loved the storyline i had watched a video bio of oppenheimer so it did help me understand the movie a bit more i did like the way the movie showed what happened to him after the bomb very cut throat politician just because he was made to look silly by oppenheimer
Aug 4 2023,positive,some of the editing sound design and coloring of scenes didnt appeal
Aug 4 2023,positive,wonderfully done great actors the clock showed it was 3 hours long but it by no means felt long
Aug 4 2023,positive,interesting story good acting  didnt care for computerized version of the atomic bomb testing  i watched several bombs being tested  i guess thats hollywoods interpretation
Aug 4 2023,positive,very slow start to the movie as well as no explanation as to oppenheimers early years of study  rather confusing back and forth clips of various parts of the project and people involved
Aug 4 2023,neutral,a very important topic with a lot of very important and good actors who unfortunately say nothing important
Aug 4 2023,neutral,too long  took too long to understand what was going on   found it rather boring
Aug 4 2023,positive,well acted movie on a subject we need to remember
Aug 4 2023,positive,important historical background makes for an interesting and important movie wonderful acting star studded cast
Aug 4 2023,negative,i failed to meet our expectations it was disjointed and hard to follow
Aug 4 2023,positive,long the politics got a little tedious the end builds up and lets you down    but a fascinating story of one of the great minds of the 20th century
Aug 4 2023,negative,too hard to follow and i dont recommend
Aug 4 2023,positive,very long but believe it or not enjoyed the constant music throughout that fit the mood at the time
Aug 4 2023,positive,just saw it and its been ages since ive seen a movie this good very smart  long but smart
Aug 4 2023,positive,i thought it was very good   very good story line and outstanding acting
Aug 4 2023,negative,i walked out of the imax showing a hour into it too much nudity for me otherwise was very i interested
Aug 4 2023,negative,i just watched it 70mm at lincoln square to be completely honest about this movie it was a huge disappointment and i feel like this film is overrated by people it was a miss for me compared the fact that this was directed by christopher nolan the direction of this movie was going a bit off and i feel like there were so many unnecessary scenes in this film some potential of the casts were hugely wasted in this film and in my opinion this movie did ignore a lot of facts about oppenheimer was a person who did not take responsibility for his consequences that he did to the world and being in denial about his doings throughout his life     people mentioned barbenheimer a lot i personally would say barbie movie was more successful in many ways comparing to this film
Aug 4 2023,positive,very eye opening and informative excellent visuals and acting
Aug 4 2023,positive,bureaucracy filled with mind boggling stories   extremely well executed
Aug 4 2023,positive,the way the story is told is brilliant and the cast is amazing
Aug 4 2023,positive,fantastic movie  acting was great  highly recommend it
Aug 4 2023,positive,loved movie loved best scenes after bomb developed  the government interference
Aug 4 2023,positive,very cinematic and thought provoking
Aug 4 2023,positive,it was an interesting movie to learn things about the bomb but too long and too hard to keep track of all the different scientists and politicians i thought that maybe at the end they shouldve shown actual footage of the bombings  what was depicted throughout the movie was a little too artsy for me had i watched it at home  i probably would have been up and down during the entire movie
Aug 4 2023,positive,great historical drama
Aug 4 2023,positive,this is nolan at his best amazing storytelling cinematography music score pacing acting especially cillian murphy and robert downey junior really impressed me the rest of the cast was also being very good you would think that a threehour film about the man who invented the atomic bomb would be too long but it works perfectly and leaves you feeling that time just flew by some audio mixing isnt great in the first part of the film with the score being louder than some dialogue making it harder to understand some characters this is the first time in a while that i could only think of the film after seeing it for a few hours this is a masterpiece
Aug 4 2023,positive,freddie mercury helping thomas shelby against iron man not clickbait
Aug 4 2023,negative,if you are sick of staring at your shoe for 3 hrs you might find this interesting
Aug 4 2023,positive,typically intelligent film from christopher nolan with a hard working totally believable 5 star cast it wont work for the marvel generation because ironically there arent enough explosions  one for people who understand film
Aug 4 2023,negative,expecting a lot from this film but feeling the bomb bombed instead  its unusually spasmodic and the characters arent those one feels any empathy for
Aug 4 2023,positive,masterpiece cillian has best actor oscar with his name on it rdj gave his greatest performance leaves you a bit gutted
Aug 4 2023,positive,one of nolans best  compelling story told in his nonlinear style with powerful performances from a long list of notable actors  highly recommend in 70 mm imax  long list of academy awards here
Aug 4 2023,positive,yes it was a long movie 3 hours but very informative and based on true story i was glad to learn so much detail of an important history very well written script and great acting so many emotional scenes and the casts really portrait these characters perfectly
Aug 4 2023,positive,acting was superb i expected a long movie about the topic to get boring but it never did i can see a bunch of nominations for oscar for this film
Aug 4 2023,positive,it was just an ok movie i didnt really like the gong back and forth or the time line
Aug 4 2023,positive,unnecessarily long gratuitous sex scenes bw scenes for mixed in for what to save money  left out some explanations of what was really going on with development of the bomb
Aug 4 2023,negative,fuck me this movie is atomically boring heheh bomb joke    that above is the only time i have laughed this entire time i am half way through the movie and i want to swallow a bunch of pills to be so off my fucking head i forget how much of a waste of my life it is     if you want to be as suicidal as that one girl in the movie whose name i forget due to the amount of boredom leads to not knowing the name of anyone i am bloody confused i would genuinely prefer to stare at a fucking wall
Aug 4 2023,positive,wow this movie was excellent  it is a must see
Aug 4 2023,positive,it was exquisite it gave a sense of reality and humanity the drama the scenes everything was so heavy and almost pulled you from your seat every waking second of the movie made me sit on the edge of my seat and made me bite my teeth it showcased the resilience in oppenheimer and could also teach you a thing or two yet another masterpiece from christopher nolan
Aug 4 2023,positive,isnt sure if its a historical drama or an exploration of one unique mans unique existence murphy gives oscarworthy performance but the early years of oppenheimers life and the relationships he has with women are not sufficiently explored and feel like an afterthought damon and downey jr are better than solid in their supporting roles wouldnt watch a second time unlike almost every other nolan film of the past 15 years
Aug 4 2023,positive,well done and well paced covered the story well
Aug 4 2023,negative,i really felt like i was missing something and that is why its rated so high  most of the scenes are dark and at times was hard to follow  good to see if you have nothing else to do i guess  not as all what i expected
Aug 4 2023,positive,i like how it was presented for those that didnt know what the manhattan project was about
Aug 4 2023,negative,very dull i immediately fell asleep
Aug 4 2023,negative,i havent been this bored during a film in years movies are supposed to entertain oppenheimer fails terribly at this with at least a third of the film being completely unnecessary and every supporting actor coming off as a cheap cameo its a classic example of an overhyped director who gets way more praise than deserved and who quite frankly hasnt made a good film since memento
Aug 4 2023,negative,incredibly disappointed  first the volume and dialogue was very hard to hear and understand and second the pace the timeline and the namesimportanceduties of the characters was awful  dont waste your money see it at home where you can add closed caption pause and rewind
Aug 4 2023,positive,wow what an important film with so many amazing performances thoughtprovoking anxietyproducing frustrating maddening sobering wish i had seen less of florence pugh  performance was good but nudity was unnecessary
Aug 4 2023,positive,the music was great and intensity throughout kept my attention
Aug 4 2023,positive,a little convoluted but filled with drama and care
Aug 4 2023,positive,big loud and long oppenheimer darts back and forth in time covering roberts early studies entry into the manhattan project and the subsequent political fallout of the 1950s the film assumes state of confusing tension throughout which results in a frustrating and often boring experience script lacked emotional depth unlike interstellar good acting but i would have taken all robert d j scenes out and replaced with pugh potential to bring in more of roberts emotional struggle rather than esoteric us political history
Aug 4 2023,negative,bad dialogue bad pacing and lets down the incredible and important story it is based on    it constantly destroyed the immersion of the experience by having goofy and unrealistic interactions between characters used a conventional petrolladen explosive for the trinity test and jumped into key scenes without the contextsetting they necessitated    baffled by the positive reviews and i dont think figures like oppenheimer operations like the manhattan project or the bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki should be treated like that
Aug 4 2023,neutral,meh it did not live up to the rave reviews  yes its better quality than most movies and the dialogue was snappy and the pacing was good in most of it but here are the flaws   oppenheimers character and motivations are not explored  why does he feel morally comfortable making the bomb  given the tensions with his leftwing sympathies why does he always according to the movie come out in favor of loyalty to the united states  the movies answer to this is essentially to have oppenheimer repeatedly give a confused wideeyed stare   the plot issues about whether the committee that stripped him of his security clearance was acting correctly are tedious and  i just dont care about the intrigue here  there may be historians who are intensely interested in this and take sides as to who is the villain in this story but the ordinary person does not care  this all culminates in the drama of someone not being named commerce secretary to eisenhower but really do i care who is commerce secretary   communist sympathies and the conflict with patriotism play a large role in the plot but communist ideas are never explored  were the communists right did they have a point or not  no one in the film seems to care   the film makes the revocation of oppenheimers security clearance the fulcrum of the overall plot in the same vein as something like the trial of joan of arc  you know the script wicked biased judges lack of due process the true hero wrongly condemned you the audience member are supposed to feel outraged  the only problem is the consequence seems so trivial  unlike joan of arc no one is going to burn oppenheimer at the stake  i cant care that much about whether he loses his security clearance in retirement  especially in a movie that involves the creation and use of atomic weapons that kill hundreds of thousands of innocent people can we really get emotionally involved over the loss of security clearance  the film seems to recognize the issue and tries to build up the importance of the loss of security clearance oppenheimers wife at one point laments that he will lose his job and theyll lose their home my god they may have to rent for a while but still   the presentation of physics was simplistic  the film explores the underlying physics only in the most shallow way  quantum physics is briefly described as the result of the fact that light can be both a wave and a particle  thats all  it was like the level of physics knowledge presented was designed to be easily consumed by most junior high students  it would have been interesting for the film to explore more of the underlying physics
Aug 4 2023,neutral,disliked all the unneeded nudity and foul language the story could be done without nudity and sexual situations  the story itself was riveting and would have stood on its own without all the sexual scenes
Aug 4 2023,positive,i had not paid any attention to the r rating and was surprised at the sex nudity and language  it was a good movie however
Aug 4 2023,positive,if the atomic bomb detonation looked like an actual atomic bomb detonation and not a brick oven going off this movie would have earned my 5 star rating
Aug 4 2023,positive,rich storyline and visuals a little complex for some to follow explosions were way too loud in the theater in which i saw this
Aug 4 2023,neutral,the early graphics of the star fieldnuclear reaction or whatever they were going for did not work  in addition it was too long  anyone who did not have a prior knowledge of oppenheimers life story would be confused by this presentation  the nudity scene with his lover was totally unnecessary  the depiction of the first nuclear test explosion was not realistic  the science adviser was out to lunch that day   a mushroom cloud would have been more convincing  the movie time could have been cut 12 hour and not lost anything  not recommended
Aug 4 2023,positive,other than the sound mixing being off at times which isnt uncommon for nolan i really enjoyed this film as someone who is interested in the history of that era i found this movie to be quite interesting
Aug 4 2023,positive,good movie for history buffs it was a long movie but interesting a little hard to follow in spots
Aug 4 2023,positive,very good film it didnt feel as long as it was my one criticism is that nolan throws you into the blended timelines narrative and it takes a while to get used to
Aug 4 2023,positive,very intense loud movie which filled me in on history i did not know excellent
Aug 4 2023,positive,acting was impeccable
Aug 4 2023,positive,absolutely awesome movie and actors showcase both cillian and robert downey jr deserve an oscar for their performances in this movie    and that last line in the movie god damn that had me thinking dont watch it before bed
Aug 4 2023,positive,an historic cinematic event which combines emotion amazing acting and great direction by nolan yet too long
Aug 4 2023,positive,awesome movie sorry to c our country was corrupt even back n the truman days
Aug 4 2023,positive,one of the best serious movies ive ever seen  right up there with shindlers list
Aug 4 2023,positive,probably the best movie of the year
Aug 4 2023,positive,first 45 min couldve been elimination   very choppy going back back from past to present and it was super loud
Aug 4 2023,positive,music tooooo loud for the small theater  book is better  glad i watched itbut not one to watch again
Aug 4 2023,negative,one of the worst movies i have wasted time on
Aug 4 2023,positive,christopher nolans first biopic an extraordinary 3hrslong maledominated magnum opus is ostensibly about the creation of the atomic bomb until it pivots unexpectedly into an exploration of mccarthyism throwing you into the deep end right from the beginning with a typically nolanesque crisscrossing of a bunch of different timelines and flashbacks the genesis story of the manhattan project during the wwii is intertwined with 2 postwar hearings one in 1954 regarding the security clearance of cillian murphys robert oppenheimer where his leftleaning politics and loyalties are being questioned juxtaposed against a more public one in 1959 to confirm robert downing jrs lewis strauss as secretary of commerce not content with just wrangling an enormous cast of mostly white men talking science into a watchable let alone engrossing film nolan further demands his audiences attention and cerebral engagement by fragmenting the linear narrative structure so that he can realign them later for a bigger impact after an infodump first hour edited like a trailer introduces us to the various components and characters the midsection settles down for a tightly paced and more conventional historical account of his work leading up to the trinity test before it gallops into the last hour where various narrative strands and themes of the film coalesce into a poignant and revelatory denouement which wrestles with the ethical quandaries and personal toil his achievement has on a conflicted oppenheimer and the world at large perfectly calibrated with hoyte van hoytemas superb cinematography and ludwig goranssons stirringly effective soundscape of a score nolans film is emotionally tense breathtakingly beautiful and technically brilliant but its humanity lies in murphys still and intense internal performance where extreme closeups of his expressive face further communicate oppenheimers complex emotional contradictions and a sublime standout supporting turn by downey jr
Aug 4 2023,positive,excellent editing phenomenal sound the silence between the light of the trinity explosion and the arrival of the shock wave is perhaps the greatest moment in the history of cinematic sound settled as it is between the wildly different but equally tumultuous noises of suspense and release hard to pick out a standout actor simply because everyone seems to be allin although cillian murphy is clearly playing at considerable depth and getting deeper as oppenhiemer ages simply one of the finest films ever made  which is remarkable given its length and the fact that much of the action takes place in small rooms  can christopher nolan continue this trajectory if so what could possibly be next
Aug 4 2023,positive,needed more science and less mccarthyisim what was the question
Aug 4 2023,positive,the sound was so loud that it was sometimes hard to hear the dialog  acting was excellent cinematography was interesting and sometimes very distracting
Aug 4 2023,negative,boring political movie dragging its story was hoping for physics and talking about atomic fission
Aug 4 2023,neutral,more like law  order emo science edition 510  inadequate watch terminator 2 instead
Aug 4 2023,positive,magnificent film true oscar performances by cillian murphy and robert downey jr loved the score and the editing although at times it was a little confusing 3 hrs flew by because i was so engrossed
Aug 4 2023,positive,phenomenalchristopher nolan delivers again
Aug 4 2023,positive,first 2 acts were great 3rd act dragged a bit
Aug 4 2023,positive,displays the best and worst of nolans talents as a filmmaker
Aug 4 2023,positive,great movie that not only telles the history of a man in the development of the first weapon of mass destruction but shows the struggle of brilliant scientists who struggle with the intersection of innovation and development with ethical responsibility it illuminates the politics of arrogance and hubris as a baby boomer it illustrated the absurdity of duck and cover drills at school in case of nuclear attack that we had to participate in
Aug 4 2023,positive,couldnt bring myself to speak for 10 minutes after the film  had me immersed from the first raindrops to the last and i could find no fault such compelling acting from the entire cast especially murphy and downey jr and captivating score by goransson which really added to the intensity of the film nolans usual nonlinear approach works really well with his adaptation of american prometheus and every scene including nude scenes which i believe were supposed to convey oppenheimers openness to tatlock and later how this is exposed at the trials is crafted to serve a purpose    the visual effects were astounding especially considering that reportedly no cgi was used the horror sequence in the hall scene was the most intense thing id seen in cinemas besides cillians blueeyed stare and the use of sound throughout made it all the more profound    this is officially my new favourite nolanmurphy collaboration and definitely the film of the century
Aug 4 2023,positive,christopher nolen has done it again this movie has oscars written all over it
Aug 4 2023,positive,masterpiece of a movie i was so engaged into every single part of this nolan film
Aug 4 2023,positive,great watch although the movie was 3 hours i was entertained for every single minute of it i also just learn a lot from this movie
Aug 4 2023,positive,this movie had me engaged and surprised the whole 3 hours the score was amazing as well as the acting i will definitely go and this movie again
Aug 4 2023,positive,woow the trinity test scene is so marvelous a wonderful movie from a classic director
Aug 4 2023,positive,beautifully shot  harrowing soundtrack and a captivating lead performance
Aug 4 2023,negative,its terrible another ww2 we the good guys  good ol times propaganda movie watch barbie instead
Aug 4 2023,positive,one of nolans best
Aug 4 2023,positive,yet another truly nolan masterpiece specially seeing it in the film format that brought me so much nostalgia the story was great and helped open my eyes a lot more fantastic historical film
Aug 4 2023,positive,i found this movie to be engaging i was concerned that a 3 hour docu movie would be tedious or boring this movie was neither it was visually appealing and the story line kept you interested
Aug 4 2023,positive,amazingly accurate and horrifying portrayal of the consequences of the atomic bomb as well as the life of robert oppenheimer ill refrain from giving it a five star review as it is certainly not for everyone a basic knowledge of world war 2 is pretty much needed in order to understand this movie otherwise a beautiful piece of art
Aug 4 2023,positive,i really liked this movie if the story rings true it gives a small look at behind the scenes in the manhattan project very interesting
Aug 4 2023,positive,i saw the movie and what i can say is that this movie is amazing everything is right with this film christopher nolan is an amazing director and the entire cast was fantastic i loved this movie if you ask me you have to see it
Aug 4 2023,positive,as any epic is it did run a long time  but there was never a slow spot you didnt need to pay attention to  the story was riveting and i kept wanting to rewind at spots to make sure what had happened  i was expecting the bomb to be center but the bomb just ended act i  all the fallout after the bomb was made was much more of the story than i had ever thought
Aug 4 2023,positive,wonderful movie matt damon emily blunt cilian murphy etc all did superb acting jobs my only issue with the movie were the few nudity scenes those were things that could have been left out imo
Aug 4 2023,positive,christopher nolan understands cinema in a way that is completely unique to him this movie is so stimulating and real
Aug 4 2023,positive,fascinating story telling well done and interesting
Aug 4 2023,positive,excellent movie with many top tier actors i will be seeing it again
Aug 4 2023,positive,the movie was hard to follow at times as it went back and forth in timelines it was also very long and probably could have been shorter
Aug 4 2023,negative,the most boring movie ever cant believe chris nolan directed this piece of trash avoid at all costs as its a dumpster fire  
Aug 4 2023,neutral,was left a little disappointed with this flick the advertising built it up so big but was just ehhhh
Aug 4 2023,positive,maybe this one will sneak up on me later sad to waste the talent of the actresses with so little to work with
Aug 4 2023,positive,the plot enjoys a high classy quality a particular feature of nolans movies with a fluent thrilling and amusing development of the films sequence of events notably production ascertained a creative usage of the soundtrack from dainty to vigorous notes to intensify the final outcome of events perhaps the weak spots of this movie deal with the accuracy of some historical events not to mention the reliability of some of them
Aug 4 2023,positive,robert downey was excellent
Aug 4 2023,positive,a very important subject especially during these unstable times informative and thoughtprovoking if not a tad depressing would have given it 5 stars if i hadnt found it so confusing going back and forth with the time line will need to see it again to catch the parts i didnt pick up on to clarify the message
Aug 4 2023,positive,i have become death the destroyer of worlds   j robert oppenheimer  9410
Aug 4 2023,positive,i see some award nominations in the future a wonderfully told story or emotinal and moral turmoil oppenheimers energy throughout is engaging and visually stunning
Aug 4 2023,neutral,this movie was too long and boring im not saying it because im not into history or science this felt like a 3 hour history lesson with tense classical music imagine this film without the score it would put most people to sleep this release should have been the directors cut not the theatrical version they wrote in way too much backstory for oppe in the initial scene a lot of the drama felt stretched and artificially inflated the bomb detonation was underwhelming i went for the shot with imax cameras selling point and i felt like they should have gave the budget to another movie
Aug 4 2023,positive,did well at exposing the political divisiveness behind the initiation of atomic warfare
Aug 4 2023,positive,i watched it in imax 70mm to experience the bomb explosion but the scene was underwhelming and did not meet my expectations from what the director said
Aug 4 2023,positive,great movie even better venue  what a great theater here in downtown scranton
Aug 4 2023,positive,im a nolan fan and believe this to be his best work  complex chilling and haunting with an exquisite central performance by the otherworldly cillian murphy and incredible work from robert downey jr
Aug 4 2023,positive,its a long movie but worth it the characters are basically look just like the real people did such a great story
Aug 4 2023,positive,excellent performances the sound was the only negative it was difficult to know what was being said at times it got easier to understand as the movie went on
Aug 4 2023,positive,proof that hollywood can still produce epic movies  oppenheimer is without question the best movie ive seen in years  it should win every award possible
Aug 4 2023,positive,good story thought provoking some of the dialogue was hard to understand
Aug 4 2023,positive,real story great intrigue it was compelling and held me in its grip for the whole movie
Aug 4 2023,positive,disliked nudity scene
Aug 4 2023,neutral,it isnt as though christopher nolans oppenheimer isnt without merit  cillian murphy is fantastic in the lead role  robert downey jr does a great job as the films antagonist  the rest of the cast is uniformly solid  the story is fascinating a tale that needed to be told  many of the production values are topnotch  however it has some faults  the music score is often deafening and mostly unnecessary especially since it drowns out much of the dialogue  even when not drowned out some of the dialogue is inexcusably unintelligible  most frustrating is the final 45 minutes or so of the film all of which could have been replaced with a brief written epilogue to sum things up  those who slurp up nolans movies will love oppenheimer  others should proceed with some caution
Aug 4 2023,positive,superb acting gripping score gorgeous cinematography and focused direction that keeps a 3 hour film compromised of hearings and discussions on physics very compelling but im simplifying the story because theres much to this modern classic just take in albert einsteins stern warning while ludwig goranssons destroyer of worlds slowly builds to a shattering crescendo and we end with horrific images of what could be after that i guarantee the film will stay with you long after you leave the theater just beautiful
Aug 4 2023,positive,it was a piece of history that i had not been aware of previously major spotlight on the dirty politics in this country
Aug 4 2023,neutral,first 23 slow and boring  dialog mostly in monotone almost whispers too long
Aug 4 2023,positive,this is a brilliant fascinating and historically accurate story every performance is excellent the pacing is near perfect for its long runtime christopher nolan knocks it out of the park again with this one its my favorite of his work just behind the dark night oppenheimer is a 1010 masterpiece
Aug 4 2023,positive,too long the back and forth about the hearings disrupted the flow of the story too much time spent on his early days
Aug 4 2023,positive,better than barbie and overall an amazing retrospective
Aug 4 2023,positive,riveting not a moment wasted
Aug 4 2023,neutral,not enough details about the accusations and whatever the complicated background was that was referred to often and wasted time on the first wife  mistress
Aug 4 2023,positive,a truly visceral experience  cast was amazing   the historical facts needed to be shared in these times lest we forget
Aug 4 2023,positive,incredible story with excellent acting    so interesting to see historical situation behind the development and dropping of the atomic bomb in japan during wwii  music incredible too  intense  loved it
Aug 4 2023,positive,as beautiful as a movie can be made i enjoyed it but against barbies mind bending film this one is made all the more oldschool in terms of normalized ideas about so many things
Aug 4 2023,positive,oppenheimer was excellent  the run time was not an issue  the 70mm imax presentation was great and it was done with practical effects no cgi  i may have to see it again sometime soon
Aug 4 2023,positive,liked the continuous action throughout the movie  perfect actors
Aug 4 2023,positive,slow beginning but then it takes off  great acting
Aug 4 2023,positive,great movie but sound was garbled so several times it was hard to understand what the actors were saying
Aug 4 2023,positive,great acting with a good cast  
Aug 3 2023,positive,the entire movie was great
Aug 3 2023,positive,even if youve seen the trailers the movie delivers everything promised and then some i went in expecting a life story and an explosion and left with a new understanding this is what cinema has always dreamed of becoming
Aug 3 2023,positive,too much fiction was added very good movie however
Aug 3 2023,positive,very good not for tiktok attention span tho theres not an explosion every 5 minutes
Aug 3 2023,positive,extremely unique camera work and sound amazing acting across the board
Aug 3 2023,positive,even my english and brain are not good enough to understand all the dialogues but the acting and sound and cinematic made up  i hope he win oscar  what a great performance love it
Aug 3 2023,positive,i loved that there were no trailers it is a very complex story to tell and christopher nolan didnt brilliantly cillian murphy and robert downey jr were outstanding as were the many wellknown actors enlisted to bring the story to film
Aug 3 2023,positive,nolan at his best a modern masterpiece
Aug 3 2023,positive,accurate and sobering depiction of how the existential crisis that characterizes our world  today developed acting was magnificent
Aug 3 2023,positive,outstanding movie learned a lot of historical information i wasnt aware of as well 
Aug 3 2023,positive,the cast was exceptional with their portrayals of the characters
Aug 3 2023,positive,thinking persons cold war film really dialogue heavy so you have to pay attention or you may miss something the nonlinear narrative may not work for everyone but we all know this is how nolan makes his films therefore we need to be ready for it the acting was top notch although emily blunt deserved more screen time same for florence pugh really so theres a lot of mansplaining in this film so to speak maybe thats a reflection of the subject matters eras but in a modern world it is very noticeable it doesnt detract from the quality of the film but perhaps it makes us think that the film could have been a lot better if done differently either way highly recommend this film for informative intellectual and thoughtprovoking ideas about humanity and science probably a lot of lessons in here about ai too using the idea expressed in jurassic park the scientists were so concerned with whether they could they didnt think about whether they should
Aug 3 2023,positive,this movie is one of the best movies of this year
Aug 3 2023,positive,i watched oppenheimer today and all i can say about it was a very enjoyable experience the movie was great from start to finish cillian murphy was a great character to play oppenheimer the only problem i had with it was the 3 hour run time but that doesnt knock any stars of it in my book final conclusion bomb go boom 
Aug 3 2023,negative,if you like watching biography of someone you probably studied 50 times in school complete with screeming babies and insignificant conversation this is for you the trinity was really poorly done and i found it disappointing as it is not actual footage of the explosion but pyrotechnic display
Aug 3 2023,positive,exquisitely filmed and wonderful to see in the original imax format  sound is generally okay however there are segments ranging from a few seconds up to a few minutes in duration during which the sound volume becomes very noticeably increased to levels that i found to be physically uncomfortable and annoying a very unfortunate distraction from my enjoyment of the otherwise most thrilling parts of the film
Aug 3 2023,positive,excellent acting suspensefulgreat ending
Aug 3 2023,positive,wonderful movie well acted beautifully cinematic
Aug 3 2023,positive,loved the movie and robert downy jr should get an oscar superb cillian murphy was also good but his part as main character had fewer lines just a lot of facial moves he was good but downers part was meatier all in all worth the three hours
Aug 3 2023,positive,stunning in every possible way
Aug 3 2023,positive,definitely one of the best movie of the last years just amazing and definitely a must see in imax if you can the sound and screen is a crazy experience
Aug 3 2023,positive,great movie and acting a little too long
Aug 3 2023,positive,excellent story telling sometimes after i felt it was long but it all came together in the end
Aug 3 2023,positive,omg  this movie was awesome   i thought it was going to be more of a documentary and it sure wasnt  this is one of those must see movies  i think the only negative about my experience is that it was super loud in many scenes  however ear protection might be recommended lol
Aug 3 2023,positive,dragged a bit in the middle but was well acted and thought provoking not one of nolans best but definitely worth seeing
Aug 3 2023,positive,longboring  no acting required  the pr machine worked well for this movie
Aug 3 2023,positive,excellent in every aspect
Aug 3 2023,positive,great price great sound great picture and great movie
Aug 3 2023,positive,well it was not hard to choose  what to watch this weekend     oppenheimer seems to be densely daunting at first to understand given its complicated background of science  but fortunately it is not treated as such its technical marvels ventures on the humanity of the man conflicted with guilt ambition and politics surrounding his important decision some say it fell short to explore the moral  intricacies far more detailed than it should but a 3 hour biopic  had given some justice for me    i could appreciate the film from its attempt to make things visceral cinematic and relentlessly making me feel the shock of an explosion or a mini heart attack it has succeeded this is a normal thing to look for but deep down the film suddenly makes sense in the end  with the atmosphere of this film created  it is an important narrative that needs to be known and it was compelling  i will not even mentioned the actors portrayals in this film  fondly familiar and extremely talented just beyond  what is expected     although it can be taxing admittedly at some point you will remain at your seat at the end    truly it will leave you shaken mainly because you have asked yourself with the question  will it destroy the world    810
Aug 3 2023,positive,this movie is shot beautifully the acting is outstanding subject material is interesting and even the three hour running time wasnt a drag but it sadly falls short of greatness  i wondered why as i was watching     at the end of the day to tell a story that has this level of complexity with its multiple plot points and large number of characters and slice it up for nonlinear reassembly made things confusing and left footed  it didnt need to be  yesthis is how c nolan likes to spin a tale but in this instance it was a distraction which pulled you out of the moment and messed with the flow      while i would recommend it to friends it is a frustrating movie to watch because there is so much potential
Aug 3 2023,positive,another brilliant film by christopher nolan he never fails to amaze with his movies
Aug 3 2023,positive,oppenheimer was an amazing movie with great acting and an amazing cillian murphy but the ending dragged on for a very long time with the trial scene but christopher nolan has done it again
Aug 3 2023,positive,thought that a three hour movie would be dull but it wasnt  complicated but not dull at all ill be researching more on the subject since i wasnt born at the time and had little interrest   i read about los alamos years ago the girls of atomic city but nothing about oppenheimer
Aug 3 2023,positive,an incredible feat of cinema  i would have never guessed that a three hour biographical movie would be so enthralling  from the script to the performances to the practical effects everything is top notch and keeps you invested each moment of the film  if i could find one fault it would be that the last act is somewhat of an anticlimax compared to what came before i expect this film will clean up at the yearly award shows
Aug 3 2023,positive,absolutely amazing loved it
Aug 3 2023,positive,was better the second time
Aug 3 2023,positive,oppenheimer is a masterpiece it is a film that is both epic in scope and intimate in its character study christopher nolan has crafted a work of art that is both visually stunning and intellectually stimulating    the film tells the story of j robert oppenheimer the physicist who led the manhattan project to develop the atomic bomb nolan does an excellent job of capturing the complex personality of oppenheimer he is a brilliant scientist but he is also a deeply flawed man he is driven by a desire to use science to solve the worlds problems but he is also haunted by the knowledge that he has created a weapon of unimaginable destruction    the film is beautifully shot nolan uses his trademark long takes and sweeping camerawork to create a sense of awe and wonder the film is also very wellacted cillian murphy gives a tourdeforce performance as oppenheimer he is ably supported by a cast of talented actors including emily blunt matt damon and robert downey jr    oppenheimer is a film that will stay with you long after you have seen it it is a film that is both important and entertaining it is a film that everyone should see    here are some of the things that i particularly liked about the film    the performances cillian murphy is absolutely brilliant as oppenheimer he captures the scientists brilliance his charisma and his inner turmoil with equal measure emily blunt is also excellent as oppenheimers wife katherine    the visuals the film is visually stunning nolan uses his trademark long takes and sweeping camerawork to create a sense of awe and wonder the film is also beautifully shot in black and white    the story the film tells a complex and fascinating story it is not just a biopic of oppenheimer but also a meditation on the nature of science and the consequences of nuclear weapons    the message the film has a powerful message about the dangers of nuclear weapons and the importance of using science for good it is a film that is both timely and important    overall i highly recommend oppenheimer it is a film that is both entertaining and thoughtprovoking it is a film that will stay with you long after you have seen it
Aug 3 2023,positive,it is an excellent film but too long and slow at times the performances are fantastic especially cillian murphy
Aug 3 2023,positive,i would have liked a little more explanation of supporting characters im not a history buff so to follow along took concentration 
Aug 3 2023,positive,this movie was so good i cried in my car  the sound design the overall movie was amazing this is one of my fav movies all time and the edits from this movie are fire the sex scenes were kinda iffy tho
Aug 3 2023,positive,didnt see it there is no longer a movie theater at that location
Aug 3 2023,negative,this is going to be a short review as ive already given up 3 hours off my time i didnt realise i was going to watch a pissing competition between two egotistical men    a missed opportunity to explore the ethical issues which was barely touched on with more time spent on pugh tits the 30 second scene where blunt handing a few tough questions didnt in anyway make up for the lack of female character building through out the film    oppenheimer appeared more rabbit in the head lights than erratic genius this was a one dimensional and selfindulgent film sorry guys this film was basically oscar beat
Aug 3 2023,positive,amazing performances and a story that needed to be told
Aug 3 2023,positive,it was better than barbie
Aug 3 2023,positive,a fantastic view of the beginnings of the cold war the implications of wielding atomic power and the destructive nature of unchecked ambition
Aug 3 2023,positive,it was pretty good a christopher nolan masterpiece this was cinema
Aug 3 2023,positive,thought provoking and emotional in an instance he permanently changed the world
Aug 3 2023,positive,this was a hard to watch film emotionally evocative cinematically stunning talentedly delivered with enigmatically tense and provocative acting both vulnerable and cosmically charged 
Aug 3 2023,positive,acting performances were outstanding
Aug 3 2023,positive,i liked watching the elected officials interrogate oppenheimer and comparing that to today climate
Aug 3 2023,positive,interesting story and also shocking well made
Aug 3 2023,positive,incredibly well done poignant
Aug 3 2023,positive, the most intense soundtrack for a nonaction historical drama i have ever seen   love that nolan cast especially oldman as president truman fucking crybaby   i hope robert downy jr didnt strain something going for an oscar that hard   inception pacing so much information and timeline jumping to take in maybe too much even for a 3 hour movie   when the hiroshima bomb got dropped i said alright good movie then saw there was 70 minutes left
Aug 3 2023,positive,loved the movie based on book american prometheus by bird and sherwin but not sequential order   movie goes back and forth through different periods of robert oppenheimers life
Aug 3 2023,positive,important non fiction movie well written great acting
Aug 3 2023,positive,absolutely incredible one of the best films ive ever seen
Aug 3 2023,positive,brilliant story telling visually and through dialog of a very complicated time and event nolan does it again
Aug 3 2023,positive,incredible part of us and world history   sad but true story of professional jealousy that almost ruined dr oppenheimer
Aug 3 2023,positive,excellent film  actually makes you think about the consequences of our actions in the world and the profound legacy it leaves us with  this film needs to be watched a couple of times to fully appreciate the layers of complexity and characters in it but it is a very rewarding experience
Aug 3 2023,negative,it was kind of a mess im sorry i wanted to love it
Aug 3 2023,positive,best movie that i have seen in the last time
Aug 3 2023,negative,this movie suckedi was hoping to see bodies turned to ash  
Aug 3 2023,positive,excellent riveting awesome acting great script  very loud
Aug 3 2023,positive,a very well acted film it dragged in a few places for me but otherwise was very engaging and interesting
Aug 3 2023,positive,one of the best movies ive ever watched
Aug 3 2023,positive,too much on the nudity and sex really stick to the narrative it was interesting without all that the beginning of the movie was a bit out there and took a while to get into and up to speed
Aug 3 2023,positive,perfect by all means
Aug 3 2023,positive,i have seen this movie at least a 20 times i love it cillian murphy is fantastic
Aug 3 2023,positive,oddly this is the best movie of the summer and probably the year so far id go as far as saying it it nolans best movie even though the subject matter isnt exactly mainstream fare really worth seeing this in imax format also beautifully filmed eloquent and well written and featuring some great star turns by the lead actor and supporting cast it is nearly 3 hours long and is just a fantastic movie experience
Aug 3 2023,positive,this was not just a movie this was an experience
Aug 3 2023,positive,me my sister and my nephew all injoy the movie
Aug 3 2023,positive,the story as written the excellent acting
Aug 3 2023,positive,masterpiece you could have just listened to this film and been moved the soundtrack is incredbile on its on but when put together with the incredible visuals that nolan brings it stands alone not only was the acting on point with so many stars but the writing was brilliant would absolutely see this again preferably in a true imax theatre this movie was everything i expected and then more great work nolan and team
Aug 3 2023,positive,powerful well directed movies must see
Aug 3 2023,positive,nolan at his finest this is a masterpiece i must watch it again at an imax 70mm cinema i have to
Aug 3 2023,positive,not a great storyline and was nudity thrown in for what purpose
Aug 3 2023,negative,the pacing is terrible and its needlessly complicated in a way that only nolan knows how to do     because there is no room to act between the lines of dialogue it doesnt matter who is saying them making every casting decision feel completely random     im convinced people only like this movie because they were told to like it     making a movie more complicated than it needs to be doesnt make it better
Aug 3 2023,positive,it was load anyone that has anxiety issues might have a problem otherwise an excellent movie
Aug 3 2023,positive,impeccable nolans best movie all of oppenheimers duality anguish and torment are in murphy
Aug 3 2023,positive,a breath of fresh air in modern storytelling the movie doesnt try to push any particular message or agendas only show oppenheimers perspective and plant the seeds for the viewer to get to their own conclusions    oppenheimer can get convoluted after the first two hours relying heavily on extensive dialogue instead of events pushing the narrative forward that if missed makes the viewing experience tedious    that said the first two hours amount to some of the most impactful sequences in cinema in the past few years i was genuinely holding onto my seat with my heart pounding in some moments
Aug 3 2023,positive,best picture biography in my life  i love all the visual elements background music performances  imax is best cinematic experiences
Aug 3 2023,positive,its a beautiful piece of modern cinema that is well crafted and tells a real horrific and sad tal that doesnt potrat oppenheimer as good or evil just a man fighting his demons christopher nolan  never wasted his actors everyone does such a perfect job this is oscar material they better eat this up cillian murphy and rdj are the high lights of the film so is emile blunt this movie is long but it feels you with the crave for more the practical effects or out of this world and the camera shots are well done know on to barbie
Aug 3 2023,positive,final a film made for adults pure art and craft excellent storytelling beautiful cinematography wonderful soup to nuts maybe nolans best film yet certainly his most gripping
Aug 3 2023,positive,excellent cinematography exceptional narration magnificent acting everything about this movie is fucking great  livelaughlovecillianmurphy
Aug 3 2023,negative,this isnt the worst movie ive ever seen but it might be the most boring literally three hours of people talking and smoking cigarettes i guess the profound revelation here is that people who made a bomb that was used to kill thousands of people had feelings about it terrible movie
Aug 3 2023,positive,a truly masterful film
Aug 3 2023,positive,the story is fascinating and the acting was fantastic especially cillian murphy and matt damon
Aug 3 2023,positive,a very tense movie through a character study of j robert oppenheimer i love that this is the point of view of oppenheimer and how strauss view him of creating the atomic bomb brought to his rise and fall of his fame in a world where movies are comedic throwing punches and overuse cgi this movie was very refreshing
Aug 3 2023,positive,oppenheimer is much more than a movie its an experience it leaves you wondering and wanting more
Aug 3 2023,negative,this movie was terrible  they shouldve put a little more focus on the manhattan project such as the hanford site that supplied the plutonium  its an extremely long and boring three hours
Aug 3 2023,positive,this movie is amazing i loved it
Aug 3 2023,positive,excellent movie very powerful and thought provoking acting staging music and production were all superb would see it again
Aug 3 2023,positive,an accurate biography of robert oppenheimer the story of trinity is one few have studied but a great backstory to world war ii
Aug 3 2023,positive,it was too long and draggy at times  the acting was great though
Aug 3 2023,neutral,this movie just didnt resonate with me im sure its good for the right person but it just isnt for me
Aug 3 2023,positive,powerful leaves you with the what ifs
Aug 3 2023,positive,despite its lengthy run time oppenheimer seemed to fly by bolstered by stellar acting the movie seemed to capture the reality of a decision made by a number of old white men living far from the consequences of their actions
Aug 3 2023,positive,the best biopic ive ever seen  magnificant thoughtprovoking masterpiece
Aug 3 2023,positive,it was hard for me to follow  i liked best the trial
Aug 3 2023,positive,such a masterpiece especially the music
Aug 3 2023,positive,superb acting and script best movie of the year
Aug 3 2023,positive,absolutely incredible movie starting with the whole entire cast that did a fantastic job several actors should be up for awards for their roles in this one next was how nolan directed the movie from the incredible images to the sound editing really making you feel like you were there 95 out of 10
Aug 3 2023,positive,oppenheimer is a biographical film about dr j robert oppenheimer cillian murphy an american theoretical physicist best known as the father of the atomic bomb due to his significant contributions to the development of the atomic bomb during the second world war adapted from american prometheus by kai bird and martin j sherwin the film covers a broad range of events that happened in oppenheimers life and is especially interested in his involvement in the manhattan project and its consequences on his life    oppenheimer is a stunning masterpiece i do not use this word lightly and director christopher nolans latest work certainly deserves it with almost no reservations oppenheimer is nolans magnum opus and currently the film of the year for me    score 1010    check out my full review here   
Aug 3 2023,positive,amazing movie even for someone who has a very limited attention span i cant even describe in words how good this movie is was
Aug 3 2023,positive,epic nolan film must see
Aug 3 2023,positive,good movie i recommend checking it
Aug 3 2023,positive,i was leery about sitting through a 3hour flick but this one held my attention right from the start i knew much about the invention of the atomic bomb but the details i didnt know were presented well enough that nonscientific folks could easily understand it was sad to see how oppenheimer went from us hero to disgraced citizen all due to he and his wifes supposed ties to the communist party and his wish to see arms control discussions pre and post bombing of japan stellar cast and great cinematography
Aug 3 2023,positive,a masterpiece indeed
Aug 3 2023,positive,loved it and it made me want to research more about him and that time period  so well acted and filmed i was skeptical of the length 3 hours but the time flew it was so good
Aug 3 2023,positive,people overvalue the movie because of christopher nolan and the casting i do not believe it is such an amazing film as many say
Aug 3 2023,positive,fastest paced 3 hour movie ive seen incredible acting and an accompanying audio that demands for the movie to be seen in the cinema nolan utilizes incredible performances from his lead actors and creative methods to paint robert oppenheimer in a light that helps better understand him
Aug 3 2023,positive,creative way to tell a true story  included the dilemma and soul searching
Aug 3 2023,positive,great movie harrowing story great performance from all actors and actress
Aug 3 2023,positive,great acting great story but very complicated when it comes to analize physics i swear nolan wont ever ever get rid of physics and the concepts of spacetime ever but thats not what i disliked from this movie in fact im bad at understanding cientific concepts and i need a whole hourclass for it minimum but i liked how oppenheimer and the rest of the experts explain everything related with atomic energy and whatsoever its so captivating and they of course are seen as pioneers with a lot of intelligence and powerful aspirations you know that they know what theyre doing already what i didnt like was what happens after trinity the oppenheimer accusation there are so many dialogues that its impossible to understand everything the first time and i hate that but anyway im quite satisfied yet impacted to know better now about the story of this physicist and everyone that was related with him clearly
Aug 3 2023,positive,the time shifting was somewhat difficult to follow yet it tended to highlight the lack of factual basis for his treatment and how he was used chewed up and discarded  the very personal nature of the scientific relationships was intriguing i was fortunate enough to have had a high school physics teacher who was there and involved so the names were familiar
Aug 3 2023,positive,the movie is just so great i watched it on theater yesterday and i love the small detail and the amazing soun effect i cant imagine how awesome if someone watch it on special theater that have imax 70mm film
Aug 3 2023,positive,good movie pay attention
Aug 3 2023,negative,too long  more of a documentary then an entertainment piece like watching cnn for 3 hoursboo
Aug 3 2023,positive,if i could give it more stars i would while there have been some criticisms regarding aspects of the whole story about los alamos have been leveled this was a story essentially designed to tell the story from one mans perspective and how it affected him do not let the the three hour length deter you  it flies by acting is fabulous and the audience is drawn into wanting a relationship with many of the characters
Aug 3 2023,negative,the way the sound came in and out was not pleasant too much time at beginner mnemonic my for development not a good movie documentary is better
Aug 3 2023,positive,it was a great movie
Aug 3 2023,negative,long winded and very drawn out would have been better if it were an hour shorter  background music and noise was uncomfortably loud all way through movie so difficult to hear the dialogue a waste of 25 hours of my life
Aug 3 2023,positive,this is arguably christopher nolans best work the best part is knowing that most of it is practical effects and not cgi i didnt fully  understand it the fist time yes ive watched it more than once but this is christopher nolan  were talking aboutyoure not supposed to get it the first time still great movie must watch
Aug 3 2023,positive,some may feel as though this movie is hard to follow and understand i thought it was perfectly done the exile of cgi gave it an amazing purity the acting was unlike any ive seen in quite some time and as always nolan gave us some of the best audio  cinematic synergy ive seen
Aug 3 2023,neutral,the story was interesting but the movie was about an hour too long a lot of time was wasted with weird symbolism and annoying flashes there was no footage of the actual bomb that was dropped just all of a sudden theyre reading a headline that it had been done im sure it was meant to symbolize after all their work they just had the headline as well but as movie goers it would have made the move more interesting way too much skipping back and forth between time i absolutely hated that overall i have not recommended it to anyone who has asked its a shame because i was really looking forward to it
Aug 3 2023,positive,overall a realy good film there are great characters with wonderful cinematography the second act really pulled through and seeing oppenheimers visions of the particles was wonderful as the movie progressed you saw less and less of those particle scene as oppenheimer moves further from science and more to politics one major criticism i hold though is the run time the first two acts pulled through as a good introduction and an amazing second act but the third act felt like a drag and could have been edited further additinally florence pughs character felt a bit unnecessary and could have less screen time as it didnt seem to add much to the story until a very brief point made towards the second half 
Aug 3 2023,positive,it was good story telling but it dragged on for to long
Aug 3 2023,positive,typical nolans way of a movie excellently captured every actors actions the noise 
Aug 3 2023,positive,guess im not into history movie if thats what this was  honestly it became boring and i almost got up and left  way too long
Aug 3 2023,negative,you have to know your facts when you go into this movie  even if you do they dont do a good job explaining whos who so its hard to followknow exactly what was going on  it was well done though  i would wait for video so you can pause and rewind and watch in 2 sessions  too long also
Aug 3 2023,negative,characters were not fully developed there was too much jumping forward and backward in time and it was too long i was very disappointed
Aug 3 2023,positive,i think this is the best nolans film yet because of the visual and the how the story is being telling and how nolan is trying to communicate to the audience
Aug 3 2023,positive,sensational the performances were so great cinematography was great soundtrack was great this movie must win the oscar 
Aug 3 2023,positive,really well made def worth the price of admission
Aug 3 2023,neutral,i usually love christopher nolan movies and was excited to see oppenheimer but i found it disappointing the storytelling lacked focus and perspective making its length fatiguing there was a lot of dialogue which wouldnt have been a problem in the hands of a more capable writer but detailed lengthy dialogue isnt nolans strong suit it was wordy clumsy at times took itself too seriously and was constantly backdropped with orchestral strings for the entire 3 hours    then theres all the boring hearings youre telling the story of the creation of the atomic bomb but you make a senate confirmation and backroom hearing the centerpieces of the story it felt like nolan was trying to do his own version of oliver stones jfk but failed    even the expected climax of the movie was a bit of a dud once the explosion happened i was expecting it to either wrap up or explore the regret of what hed done but most of the remaining time is spent on boring inside politics and reprisals against oppenheimer    on the upside this was one of the best performances of robert downey jrs career even though i found the hearings to be a bizarre and boring misstep downey really delivered i just wish it had been in a different movie
Aug 3 2023,positive,i loved this for the whole last hour i was on the edge of my seat and i was tired after sitting through 5 hours of movies so i was impressed it kept my attention despite the 3 hours i would definitely watch this again the build up was incredible and the actors blew me away 1010 must see
Aug 3 2023,negative,far too much political intrigue pretentious dialogue scenes of back and forth verbal fencing and not enough substance on the science of the creation of the atom bomb and its repercussions although touched upon great use of sound for effect but overlaid too much in dialogue scenes reminiscent of dunkirk the more the story developed the less i cared to know about oppenheimer unlike other biographical films where at the finale your wanting to know more disappointing but maybe worth a rewatch at home on a lazy sunday afternoon
Aug 3 2023,negative,sound it is horribly badly mixed and loud christopher nolan is a brilliant director and im a big fan of his work and support his work because i like real cinema not cgi stuff but in this movie she should fix some stuff before the blueray come out
Aug 3 2023,negative,the movie includes some brilliant well filmed moments shame that they are swallowed up by so much tediousness not as bad as tenent but far from nolans best works
Aug 3 2023,positive,some mild fanservice the most entertaining thing about this movie as a piece of art is watching how the vast majority of public dissent around it being not enough scenes of nukes runs perpendicular to the entire point of the movie
Aug 3 2023,positive,truly peak cinema christopher nolan just cant miss
Aug 3 2023,positive,a 3 hour movie that leaves you wanting more
Aug 3 2023,negative,really quite poor was expecting a cinematic masterpiece in reality its a biopic and not a great one    the main thing this movie is missing is more bomb aside from the test explosion we see nothing i mean seriously show the windows in texas cities that were blown when the test happened show the bombs actually being dropped on japan show something that actually relates to them being used and the fact that the war was actually happening at the time     also maybe admit that the bomb wasnt even needed the japanese were ready to surrender and dropping this bomb was essentially murder
Aug 3 2023,positive,absolute cinematic masterpiece the cinematography the suspense the objective vs subjective telling of the story the emotion the unfolding of events the truth coming out it can only be described as beautiful in a morbid kind of way the story of a great physicist during an era of war and destruction as told by christoper nolan and the cast of oppenheimer what more could you possibly ask for
Aug 3 2023,positive,it gave very interesting insights into oppenheimers life and his accomplishments to build the bomb
Aug 3 2023,negative,the soundtrack was so damn loud that i almost walked out of the theater even though the story itself was very good i went with four friends of various ages and they all said the same thing
Aug 3 2023,positive,a masterfully crafted piece of cinema that transcends a historical pic about the atomic bomb oppenheimer addresses the man beneath the hat depicting leadership genius and flaws all while not shying away from the moral war within  nolan strikes again with stunning visuals and tense cinematography while teaming up with goransson to deliver a soundtrack that makes you as unsure as the scientist on screen
Aug 3 2023,positive,phenomenal engrossing from beginning to end with a marquee performance from murphy and cast the biggest compliment i can give it is that after 3 hours i could have done another 3 watch it and go to the cinema for it for gods sake
Aug 3 2023,positive,saw this in 70mm in manchester vue printworks on the 28th of july 2023 and omfg it was the best movie i have seen
Aug 3 2023,positive,nolan at his best story was stellar but the visual and sound effects were amazing best score in a long time
Aug 3 2023,positive,words wouldnt do this film justicejust experience it
Aug 3 2023,positive,amazing movie casting was spot on the story was great love it
Aug 3 2023,positive,great story that set the record straight
Aug 3 2023,negative,horrible would give it less stars if i could too much dialogue fails to tell a story visually and ends up creating a jumbled mess 
Aug 3 2023,positive,well paced for a 3 hour movie it looks like its a fairly accurate portrayal of his life i did think nolan favored the antiatom bomb dropping on japan side they avoided any discussion of the other side and they used gimmicks to sell their views this is a complex debate and both sides can make decent arguments to leave this debate out is propaganda
Aug 3 2023,negative,very boring and too long  took a story that could be interesting but focuses on things that are not  checked my watch a lot during the final act
Aug 3 2023,positive,this movie was very interesting and kept my attention the whole time i would definitely recommend it
Aug 3 2023,neutral,i didnt like the movie because it went on to long but its my fault for watching insidious before it recommend it by the way i probably could have been more patient if i didnt now on my review as i said it went on to long and it felt like forever i was falling asleep in the first 45 min and i came with my momuncleaunt and my uncle fell asleep in the first 45 min i didnt completely but he straight up fell asleep wouldnt recommend and i saw a lot of people rating it really well but im giving it a 2 and half stars because it at least was decent also we left 150 in 
Aug 3 2023,positive,it was worth watching once but i doubt i will watch it again it was a bit confusing at times with many characters who were not well introduced i frequently didnt know the names of some characters or what their position on the project was or who they were politically i also thought this would have more focus on the development of the bomb and oppenheimers inner struggles with moralsethics along with some political issues involving communism however the main focus was political and the anticommunism struggles i never felt like i got to know oppenheimer or any of the other characters very well also two serious problems with regal theater woodstock  1 seating chart was a scam i chose two seats dead center with 45 empty seats on either side the actual seats irl were off to the left with only one seat further left that was fraud i will not trust the seating chart in the future 2 sound volume was way too loud the loudest sounds hurt my ears and distorted heavily from speakers being overdriven even normal conversations sometimes distorted from overdriven speakers a lot of times i could not understand what characters were saying not the worst movie ive seen but heavily disappointed
Aug 3 2023,positive,great movie definitely see it in film if you can
Aug 3 2023,positive,poor sound quality would be better with subtitles
Aug 3 2023,negative,the acting was pretty good the story was a bit hard to follow at times the nudity was completely unnecessary 
Aug 3 2023,positive,did it have to be 3 hrs probably not it was indeed a good dramatization of a historical figure thats complex enough for a movie
Aug 3 2023,positive,unarguably the best movie of the year chris nolan is the mit of movie directing this one movie director doesnt stop to amaze me cillian murphy graduated from dr craine to dr oppenheimer matt damons 2nd straight good movie of this year both robert downy jr and emily blunt were so good too i do sincerely hope this movie bags a few oscars in the major categories instead of some unassuming launder mat movie like last year i did feel it was bit too long but storyline comes around towards the end to justify lengthiness of the plot overall what i lost in intellect while watching barbie i regained by watching oppenheimer
Aug 3 2023,positive,so overhyped  and didnt need to be 3 hours long at all there was one big explosion
Aug 3 2023,negative,ugh  three hours of close ups and whispered profundities in dodgy accents  are we to believe nobody ever had a normal conversation with old oppenheimer  constant underscoring often made mumbled scenes impenetrable  great costumes scenic design and cinematography could not make up for the melodramatic script and schmacting  2 stars
Aug 3 2023,positive,simply beautiful music and all
Aug 3 2023,positive,masterful storytelling wow
Aug 3 2023,positive,left me in total emptiness after watching it one movie every human being should watch
Aug 3 2023,positive,literally shaking after it ended brilliant movie
Aug 3 2023,positive,it was a really good movie
Aug 3 2023,positive,incredible acting visually astounding but probably 30 minutes too long some scenes were absolutely brilliant while others dragged on such gaps could have been filled with content highlighting the victims of oppenheimers creation in some way which was a huge missed opportunity and by some standards an obligation
Aug 3 2023,positive,amazing cinematic experience and wonderful score  movie never slowed down  3 hours were like 1  highly recommend
Aug 3 2023,positive,it was interesting and well made but dragged on too long
Aug 3 2023,positive,we loved everything about this movie we especially appreciated the cinematography and unique ways the story unfolded some people said it was hard to follow but not for us also we didnt notice how long it is because we were really into it we were surprised when it ended paying for imax was worth it
Aug 3 2023,positive,story is really chopped up you can follow it but with all the cameo characters it is hard to tell the good guys from the bad  film is not so much about building the bomb as it is a character study of oppenheimer and his adversaries  acting uniformly good direction slow paced
Aug 3 2023,positive,left me speechless absolute insane film christopher nolan does it again imax 70mm was 1010
Aug 3 2023,positive,they could have cut an hour out of the movie if they didnt have so much focus on all of the discussions about trying to cut out the jew who created the bomb it is important that people know how many amazing things the jews have created but we got the point of all the discussions other than that the acting was great and the movie was great just a bit too long
Aug 3 2023,positive,superb acting and directorship just way too long could have been reduced to 2 hours instead of 3 
Aug 3 2023,positive,the 3hrs flew by as such an interesting story line and great acting
Aug 3 2023,positive,this movie was phenomenal i would definitely see again movie kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time loved it so much 
Aug 3 2023,positive,brilliant as a physics graduate i found the story of the manhattan project fascinating but knew little of the personal story of oppenheimer beautiful cinematography excellent composition and overall a
Aug 3 2023,positive,great historical display
Aug 3 2023,positive,i really love this movie it make my brain thinking as hard i played chess where i need to focus most of the time to understand it nolan is freaking genius cant believe this movie are in par with other nolans movies
Aug 3 2023,positive,too much noise and unnecessary visual effects
Aug 3 2023,positive,absolute masterpiece simply put acting was absolutely phenomenal especially by robert downey jr
Aug 3 2023,negative,had to be one of the most boring movies ive ever seen  too many characters to keep up with and way too long  was falling asleep after the first 30 minutes
Aug 3 2023,positive,good long but good nice
Aug 3 2023,positive,great movie imax experience was poor did not like the 43 format and the sound was marginal  i think a modern digital experience would have been much better   constant dirt on lens showing up on picture was truly annoying  would not go back to an old imax theater ever again
Aug 3 2023,positive,fabulous cast engrossing thought provoking  never realize it is such a long movie
Aug 3 2023,positive,very serious movie with significant implications of this planets future  unfortunately politics plays too large a role in leaderships quest for power and can override that which is good for mankind  great acting
Aug 3 2023,negative,it didnt not have enough 911 refrences
Aug 3 2023,positive,i may have liked it more if michael bay had been behind this    he has the best explosions
Aug 3 2023,positive,overall i felt that it was a very good movie however i thought that it was a little too long
Aug 3 2023,positive,enthralling story with spotless acting  no great technical detail bummer  too long
Aug 3 2023,positive,the best movie in this year so far the bottom half let me have another level enjoy
Aug 3 2023,positive,unbelievable production christopher nolan did a fantastic job bringing oppenheimer to the big screen and telling this remarkable story 1010 there were definitely a couple controversial scenes compared to history but overall it kept me on the edge of my seat
Aug 3 2023,positive,honest back story of the the man who helped developed the bomb  his path before  after its development his drive to develop the bomb before the germans  his moral objections after its development a must for history buffs and recommended for non history enthusiasts to learn how the past affects the present
Aug 3 2023,positive,it was slow in the beginning and hard to follow but it picked up and as it went along was easier to follow the story line  glad i went  very interesting to learn how some things transpired
Aug 3 2023,positive,it was too long and the 1st hour was very slow moving
Aug 3 2023,positive,well done in every aspect
Aug 3 2023,positive,dont drink the koolaid the last hour could have been left on the cutting room floor i would have been happier to watch a three episode miniseries
Aug 3 2023,positive,i really couldve used subtitles for this movie so many times i couldnt understand what they were saying and i thought it was just me but getting with other people who have seen it they couldnt hear it well either i think i missed maybe 40 of the dialogue and spent most of the movie just trying to put together what was being said that along with crazy editing and a rdj story line i still have no idea why was in there or what was going on with that seriously just ask people who saw the movie no one can answer lol everyone says its good but everyone agrees with everything im saying music phenomenal acting is great as well good movie but its not great not til i can watch with subtitles because the sound and spoken word is bad
Aug 3 2023,positive,disjointed story telling good performances powerful effects
Aug 3 2023,positive,loved the movie but it made me hate politicians even more than l already do
Aug 3 2023,positive,a little too long found myself almost dosing off midway through
Aug 3 2023,positive,thoroughly enjoyed it
Aug 3 2023,positive,interesting almostdocumentary movie  kind of long
Aug 3 2023,positive,it was enjoyable and educational   actors in the movie were a great fit for their roles
Aug 3 2023,positive,it held my interest while not an action film despite the tease about the bomb lots of scenery and interaction with the actors  35mm    it starts at the end with a committee hearing to revoke oppies security clearance since the committee looks back on his contacts and things that went on over his life it flashes back  while back there is weaves in what else was happening    i would have liked to hear more about oppie as a person and his life and the science but the book does not either  the book is more chronological noting oppies left wing contacts and refusal to name folks who may have been a security risk so even at this point one knows this is a major part of the book and film    the science is really lacking at one point they discuss doing a hydrogen bomb which the movie claims would need a regular atomic bomb to detonate  i thought the book said it would require the acquiring of heavy water which would take too long  besides the science this is where oppie made at least one scientist unhappy    in passing it mentions there were concerns about making the bomb but not really discussed until after wwii and the development of the hydrogen bomb  the movie is even more brief than the book on this part  the movie seems to blame strauss for this witch hunt but the book seems to point to a larger desire to get rid of oppie by the defense industry  too bad the movie did not read opinion of the one casting the designating vote    i did fall asleep near the start probably the food and 2 beers i had  after 2 hours i was sort of ready to go but thought this was the good part of the book    i would recommend but you will probably enjoy it more if you are not expecting too much  i forgot my ear plugs but did not need them
Aug 3 2023,positive,its a masterpiece the soundtrack the plot and the individual performances are outstanding i loved the way it explored and showed the characters perception of the events and their psychology it is a long film however it keeps a fast pace so you dont ever get bored the images colors and accurate setting combine perfectly to give the viewer a deep experience while watching it i recommend it 100
Aug 3 2023,positive,its one of the years best films real history christopher nolan made a best director and cillian murphy did a best performance imax 70mm film is perfect
Aug 3 2023,positive,we liked it a lot so much that it didnt feel like a 3 hour movie
Aug 2 2023,positive,incredible picture go see it perfect casting too
Aug 2 2023,positive,best movie in years
Aug 2 2023,positive,i saw this 2 weeks ago and it completely rolled me the rest of my day was a blur and even when i tried to watch another movie that night nothing could compare its quite special when a film stays with you for as long as this one did with me potentially one of the best films ive seen in my entire life
Aug 2 2023,negative,the story was fascinating but if i wanted to see a porno i would have gone to see a porno there was no need to show oppenheimer screwing his mistress or sitting naked in chairs having a discussion unless they wanted us to see the dimensions of her nipples which played no part in the plotstory i would have given it a higher rating but these scenes really put me off
Aug 2 2023,positive,love the movie was very interesting i recommend it 100
Aug 2 2023,positive,the acting superb  the writing  intelligent loved it
Aug 2 2023,positive,likes its an incredible story whether its made into a movie or not 70mm big imax screen usually im fine with watching things on a 40 tv but this movie should really be seen on the big screen great acting by cillian murphey and r downey jr heck i didnt even recognize downey performances by everyone else good as well good graphics not over blown  indifferent a little hard to follow at times only a little because it wasnt all in chronological order no intermission  for a three hour movie it went by fast intermission wasnt really needed  dislikes it was never painfully loud and some shots certainly deserved to be loud for the effect but it was unnecessarily loud a fair amount of the time   hates 25 minutes of advertisements and previews but that will depend on the theater
Aug 2 2023,negative,move was very boring
Aug 2 2023,positive,everyone in this movie delivers in what can simply be called a spectacle while it is 3 hours long the musical score and sheer will of the cast and crew gets you through the movie  it was a fun ride indeed watch it now lol
Aug 2 2023,positive,never read the bio book and only vaguely familiar with his story but totally enjoyed the movie yes i was able to sit thru all 3 hours of it and it did not seem that long  at the end you want to know more about this man
Aug 2 2023,positive,the movie was well done as christopher nolan almost always accomplishes and cillian murphy is a neardoppelganger for j robert oppenheimer  the story is truly more about the man than his work on trinity which was refreshing it was a really good drama with some excitement and historical education
Aug 2 2023,neutral,way too long needs to get rid of at least 30 minutes decent movie overall could have been better
Aug 2 2023,positive,great story telling   acting was magnificent
Aug 2 2023,positive,i saw it in 70 mm imax  as a 3 hour film it kept my attention and presented many aspects of oppenheimers life that i didnt know before  however the cinematography sound and video were quirky and distracting     much of the dialog was presented in short cryptic scenes that made it difficult to follow the conversations and context  the soundtrack was punctuated with very loud noises that vibrated my seat with delayed sounds of nuclear explosions and what sounded like a very loud train  there were also confusing and repeated flashforwards where the current older scenes were in color and the flashforwards were in bw  i eventually caught on that the bw meant future  but the chronology was frenetic and difficult to piece together    outdoor scenes filmed during the day were very dark and underexposed which surprised me  it was not clear to me why an outdoor daylight scene eg riding horses should be so dark    all in all the film was worth seeing i thought  however a new cut of it could improve the overall presentation  i dont know how the parsimonious dialog bits could be expanded unless there are some parts of dialog left on the cutting room floor that could be reinserted  the new cut would have to reconsider what else to cut given that the film is already 3 hours long  it may be that the story is more suited to be a multipart series
Aug 2 2023,positive,perfectly crafted movie each character has acted their bests a masterpiece
Aug 2 2023,positive,absolutely astounding movie loses its way a little bit though
Aug 2 2023,positive,this movie was a cinematic masterpiece and a must see for anyone who loves movies inspired by real events  christopher nolan knocked this one out of the park
Aug 2 2023,positive,a masterpiece  blown away by the acting  intense true historical piece unfolding  oscar for cillian murphy  must see
Aug 2 2023,positive,too long and they should have to shave an hour off  and focus on the main subject  other things to that shouldnt be in there as well
Aug 2 2023,positive,amazing depiction of the people and the effort that went into the nuclear arms race and the science behind it
Aug 2 2023,positive,did not seem like it took 3 hrs to get through from beginning to end it does show how the people given power in the government will and do attempt to destroy people after they no longer are useful great movie
Aug 2 2023,positive,powerful movie  though over long there is mo wasted space  brilliant acting powerful soundtrack   great cast  well done without much cgi
Aug 2 2023,positive,a brilliant movie about brilliant men and one brilliant woman a masterpiece as good as mystic river spotlight or some of the coen brothers films not an action film by any means but its exciting nonetheless as it builds to the moment that those brilliant people actually test out what up to then had only been theory then the aftermath i wouldnt call myself a christopher nolan fan i like some of his movies better than others oppenheimer has to be considered the best film of his career imo the pacing of the movie is perfect imo so many actors that ill just point out a few cillian murphy is terrific as always gary oldman steals his very brief scene it might be robert downey jrs best work since chaplin or maybe zodiak emily blunt is mostly in the shadows for most of the film but gets her chance to shine in hour number three jason clarke stands out as an irritating adam schiff type my one warning go easy on that 48ounce soda that you bought or you could be using it as a peecup by the closing credits three hours and 20 minutes by my watchincluding previews and commercials but worth every minute
Aug 2 2023,positive,i thought the movie was an accurate representation of the facts i know from growing up in northern california in the early 1950s
Aug 2 2023,positive,awesome movie i learned a lot about the man and that time
Aug 2 2023,positive,wish they would have a scene where they actually dropped the bombs on japan
Aug 2 2023,positive,i was hoping they would focus more on the seriousness physics  and incredible work that went in to the abomb the second part of the movie put us to sleep here was such a momentous thing such as the making and impact of the a bomb that lacked focus while the film focus was turned to the later discrediting of one man of a team by a jealous rival meh
Aug 2 2023,negative,easily the worst christopher nolan film i thought it was very boring and its not because i didnt understandfollow it im a chartered engineer with a strong interest in the manhattan project the film barely focused at all in the manhattan project it self nor the spying it focused almost solely on the obvious surface left moral issues oppenheimer had with his work it wasnt enlightening in any way and where it wasnt focusing on his basic moral issues it was focused in a sham hearing to review his security clearance
Aug 2 2023,positive,oppenheimer is a highly detailed character study that will leave you thinkinghorrified about the convergence of science and politics long after the credits roll sound mixing issues aside this is a top 3 nolan movie and my favorite movie so far of 2023
Aug 2 2023,positive,the storytelling and visuals were amazing cillian was awesome one thing that didnt make it a 5 for me was the length  amount of dialogue the movie was a lot of dialogue so kinda hard to keep up with especially due to the length
Aug 2 2023,positive,wow  it can still be done  it is possible for hollywood in the 21st c to produce a movie with adult sensibilities  a film dealing with complex human beings  their interactions reality historical events politics  and the various motivations behind interpersonal relationships      oppenheimer is living proof of this  in short a competent film rooted in reality  which is considerably more than one has any right to expect in these times     this despite the fact that the vast majority of todays offerings seem aimed at 10year olds  involving cartoon characters andor comic book superheroes sequels prequels sidequels and a fixation on senseless gunplayviolence  plus of course the fortuitous destruction of very many things special effects and stunt people rule    i should mention that the movie is 3 hours long and that some interest in the subject matter would be helpful  and is assumed  it didnt drag for me  even though i already knew this story    bill of nh
Aug 2 2023,positive,oppenheimer whats a great historical movie the effects and sound were amazing also christopher nolan really blew this up pun intended
Aug 2 2023,positive,great movie  slow at times good history lesson in many ways
Aug 2 2023,positive,too long and hard to follow  i got lost with the black and white vs color scenes  couldnt tell that was flashback vs the present
Aug 2 2023,positive,movie has great story telling and offers interesting dialogue between fellow scientists
Aug 2 2023,positive,good but a little long at three hours
Aug 2 2023,positive,absolutely factual historically correct and very captuvating  i want to see it again
Aug 2 2023,positive,very good adaptation of his life the other people involved and the events surrounding the manhattan project regal does need to turn down the volume  i like loud but its in excess
Aug 2 2023,positive,i just had to know who directed the movie and i already knew i as in for a stunning movie visually storywise and also with great dialogues and it was just that great camerawork great music great acting the movie had me the enitre three hours through not let ups not saying there werent some weaker passages where the music carries the movie but overall it was still really great if you are not willing to sit in a chair for three hours and watch people talking about theories politics and physics for 3 hours straight with an ocassional break in the form of a sex scene or a party etc then this might not be the movie for you otherwisee an absolute must see
Aug 2 2023,positive,fantastic acting that glued you to the screen
Aug 2 2023,positive,yeah its pretty amazing three hours fly by due to a gripping story and amazing performances the only thing i would be critical of was the terrible awkward nude scenes
Aug 2 2023,positive,well oppenheimer didnt actually pass the time it wandered from science to relocation in the desert to adulteries and boozing and world history to turgid explications of brilliance  folly culpability and betrayal all bookended by fictional scenes with a twinkly albert einstein so it did not pass the time except sorry dr einstein in a relative sense i hate to say it but my major complaint about the movie is that it is three hours too long
Aug 2 2023,positive,i loved this masterpiece of a film
Aug 2 2023,positive,very interesting history of a bomb and awesome graphics
Aug 2 2023,positive,i loved this movie i didnt have many expectations going in but the trailer looked quite cool i was blown away pun intended the visuals script and sound made this movie incredible everything was so thought out and it is probably the best film ive watched this year even though it was over 3 hours long it didnt feel like this and was such an engaging film loved every minute of it
Aug 2 2023,positive,very well done story telling with great sound effects
Aug 2 2023,positive,best movie i have seen in years  so much action even the 3 hrs was totally worth every minute  it wasnt just about 1 thing  it was about a person with great capabilities who was doing something he did not always want but felt necessary  makes everyone conscience of our world as a whole and how destruction can be felt by all
Aug 2 2023,positive,when awards time comes this movie will be up there best picture  actor best director supporting actor and actress maybe best actress emily  blunt
Aug 2 2023,positive,masterfully written dexterously controlled multiple flashbacks weave a suspenseful and intriguing story even though everyone knows the ending or do we several more flashes to the past already witnessed takes the viewer down one last exhilarating finish without going off the rails into some nonsensical multiverse  superb imagery   depicts the horror of his invention allowing the viewer to draw the same conclusions which turned oppenheimers reactions and refections on releasing to mankind this new fire
Aug 2 2023,negative,too long no action very disappointed
Aug 2 2023,positive,i loved the movie but i thought the music to it was awful and at times not even in sink with the mood of the scene in the movie  hence the downrating from 5 stars
Aug 2 2023,positive,great movie very historical great acting  the three hours go by quickly
Aug 2 2023,negative,my wife myself and our 20 year old daughter all agreed we were bored and had little idea what was going on so left half way through far too jumpy one minute hes in the desert then on a horse then shagging someone very disappointed how folk found it entertaining is beyond me
Aug 2 2023,positive,it was an eyeopener i had no idea of the turmoil he endured many years beyond trumans decision
Aug 2 2023,positive,excellent movie great acting from cillian murphy and great directing from christopher nolan imho should win several academy awards three hours is a bit long can be slightly edited to make it shorter
Aug 2 2023,positive,the actors were amazing especially cillian murphy and robert downing jr the overall movie is oscar worthy
Aug 2 2023,positive,great movie  great acting
Aug 2 2023,positive,loved the bgm and the actors were great
Aug 2 2023,positive,initial part moved at a bit of a frenetic pace to get through years of history  once it slowed down around the time of the manhattan project itself one had time to think about and process the ethical dilemma and the political theater that made this such an important story
Aug 2 2023,positive,one of the best movies ive ever seentop five
Aug 2 2023,neutral,very good performances by the actors murphy blunt downey were amazing regarding a monumental event and tragic treatment of an american icon but it made 3 hours feel like 5
Aug 2 2023,positive,this is a must see movie this nolans best work since the dark knight the action g a especially from robert downy jr this movie is going to a lot of oscars
Aug 2 2023,positive,followed the book but was way too long
Aug 2 2023,positive,i never did dramas unless there was some action to balance it out its movie just proved i dont need action to love a drama
Aug 2 2023,positive,oppenheimer is a fascinating story
Aug 2 2023,negative,overhyped over melodramatic too long
Aug 2 2023,positive,this movie is just excellent what a story what casting and acting what filmmaking and cinematography what sounddesign what a treat on 70mmnolan is a genius himself just like the protagonist here
Aug 2 2023,neutral,it was too longtoo boring
Aug 2 2023,positive,i thought the movie was brilliant including the visuals the acting the creativity from nolan i fully believe multiple osacr nominations surrounding this movie are in order
Aug 2 2023,positive,great movie actorsactress did an amazing job portraying their characters the writing was incredible as well although the first half was a bit confusing the way it all came back to one point in the later half was done well
Aug 2 2023,positive,score 1010    cinematography 1010    acting 1010    perfection
Aug 2 2023,positive,overall a great movie that moved fast and covered a lot of ground at times that movement was a bit jarring and disconnected superb acting by all involved especially the star cillian murphy matt damon though was miscast as army brass this story is an important chapter in us and world history
Aug 2 2023,positive,i liked the story the soundtrack the flashbacks the black and white and the dedication to realism
Aug 2 2023,positive,must see movie only thing as a long movie it should have an interval 
Aug 2 2023,negative,nolan misses the the opportunity to show the unimaginable horrors of nuclear war nolan is the master of  visualizing the unimaginable dark knoght tenet interstellar with no scenes of nagasaki or hiroshima i was extremely disappointed that the master of cinema declined to visualize the potential horrors of nuclear holocaust in 2023 we live in a real threat of nuclear war with russia and china i had hoped that nolan would have taken the opportunity to show depict the unimaginable horror of nagasaki and hiroshima as a warning  echoed from history to present day    instead the audiences attention is directed to strauss rejection for an senate appointment i was disappointed in the artistic direction of story telling to the inconsequential
Aug 2 2023,positive,amazing although its 3 hours you never know it so well written  acted should be awards for cillian and robert both and others
Aug 2 2023,positive,the feeling i had leaving the theater after watching oppenheimer was like no other truly spectacular piece of cinema
Aug 2 2023,positive,there were several times i could not understand what was being said  others with me had the same problem  my daughter saw it in boston area and had the same problem
Aug 2 2023,positive,amazing storytelling centered around one character and how he perceives things versus just portraying events
Aug 2 2023,positive,oppenheimer is a cinematic masterpiece that will keep you thinking its 3 hour runtime beautiful cinematography and poignant dialogue this biopic dispels any expectations about the atomic bombs creations and focuses on two lesser known events as the framing device an eloquent antiwar film on the risks of science and civilization survival through a flawed but brilliant protagonist a welcome feature from nolan after disappointments with tenet dunkirk and interstellar
Aug 2 2023,positive,first time i had physically felt chills down my spine at the end of a movie
Aug 2 2023,positive,another nolan masterpiece stunning visuals dramatic presentation excellent performances important topic
Aug 2 2023,positive,great cast the time jumpes were easy to follow  overall a really great movie
Aug 2 2023,positive,realism and historic detail great acting
Aug 2 2023,positive,it had a bit of a slow start but as things transpired it developed into a very powerful and historical account humanizing the minds behind the greatest achievement while simultaneously being the most horrific development known to man it also touched upon the importance of integrity and whistleblowers who need to address the pride that can lead to fiendish pursuits of ultimate power
Aug 2 2023,negative,too long and too stressful i wanted a more lighthearted movie spending more money on imax wasnt necessary as most of it was just talking
Aug 2 2023,positive,i loved it so much its very long but i think its worth the watch j robert oppenheimer is someone that a lot of people have animosity towards but this movie manages to humanize him christopher nolan said it best even the best intentions have the most profound and negative consequences i love the score its my favorite thing about this movie besides cillian murphys performance the only thing this movie lacks is the perspective of the indigenous community in new mexico who suffered immensely from the making and the testing of the atomic bomb
Aug 2 2023,positive,great movie automatic nolanclassic cast was phenomenal hands down one of cillian murphys best performances
Aug 2 2023,positive,theater was to hot and seats to cramped
Aug 2 2023,positive,the best time i had at a movie in a long time
Aug 2 2023,negative,bored not very interesting i was confused most of the movie
Aug 2 2023,positive,absolutely stunning   intense thought provoking and the story of one of the most pivotal times in us history  acting is stellar   for anyone who ponders the manhattan project the movie lends much discussion to the great debate of creating the atom bomb and the world consequences that it has incurred
Aug 2 2023,positive,i loved the nuisance  complexity i thought nolan did an excellent job portraying both his brilliance  the difficulty of putting so much power in the hands of government
Aug 2 2023,positive,great movie lil long but great
Aug 2 2023,positive,if you are a teen i dont recommend this movie as it was really slow and confusing
Aug 2 2023,positive,real to live and a likeable plot
Aug 2 2023,positive,overall great movie that being said one needs to be 1 a history lover 2 have a love of science  or both preferably   it is a bit long however i understand the reasoning to covey how he was blacklisted which is horrible but that is the true history so one cant change it
Aug 2 2023,positive,normally i stay away from 3 hour movies but this movie was so good that i never even checked my watch
Aug 2 2023,positive,a cant miss movie  very thought provoking
Aug 2 2023,positive,excellent in every way  highly recommend
Aug 2 2023,positive,great movie overall but i was definitely expecting some more visuals though the trailers and intro made it seem like the visual imax experience was going to be a lot more exciting than it turned out to be that said i do think the enhanced audio from the imax version was noticeable and really added to the atmosphere of certain scenes i dont know thay i would recommend the imax version but i would definitely recommend the movie itself given its incredible story script and acting  just dont expect a ton of visuals for the explosions itselfthemselves if youre only or mainly in it for the story though it absolutely will not disappoint
Aug 2 2023,positive,very good acting    explained a lot about the a bomb i never understood why oppenheimer was under investigation after receiving so many accolades  and so much praise for his work the blackwhite and color filming was very helpful in understanding the time line  a long movie but did not seem so
Aug 2 2023,negative,you are better off watching a documentary on oppenheimer its a rather boring story with an emotionless cast its a pity because christopher nolan made some remarkable films in the past
Aug 2 2023,positive,uncomfortable piece of historylearned so much
Aug 2 2023,positive,excellent acting and writing learned that the scientists involved had conflicted thoughts about what the future of atomic energy would be oppenheimer got caught up in the political machinations of the mccarthy era oppenheimer was a complex man the movie is oscarworthy in all categories it was thoughtprovoking
Aug 2 2023,positive,great story  told wellmakes you think of what our planet could become in the wrong hands  i totaly enjoyed the movie over many i have seen before
Aug 2 2023,positive,another stunning movie by christopher nolan a mustsee 3hour film full of unique sounds actors and best of the best scenes
Aug 2 2023,positive,pure cinema just a beautifully writen and filmwd story
Aug 2 2023,positive,the best movie ive ever seen and nothing else comes close to being this good
Aug 2 2023,positive,this was an amazing movie very worth the money and the 3 hour run time very well done from the acting to directing i would definitely go back and see it again
Aug 2 2023,positive,the best nolans movie
Aug 2 2023,positive,fantastic film great screenplay and great performances from all involved  an instant favorite for oscar gold
Aug 2 2023,positive,from documentaries i have seen oppenheimer struck a good balance between entertaining artistic liberty and historical facts it is a great movie for those who want to learn yet arent into documentaries   my only gripe was actually with the movie theater their sound effects volume was ridiculously loud it is the only movie i can think of where i left with my ears ringing
Aug 2 2023,positive,very important historically but movie drawn out too long about the accusations about oppenheimer visual and sound effects of the test bomb were great but disappointed that bombs on japan were not shown and the effect it had on those who dropped them
Aug 2 2023,positive,the culture has grown to the point where people feel ready to be told about things like this very interesting topic that even worked in infinity wars the physics einstein was acclaimed in theaters 
Aug 2 2023,negative,i thought the actors did a good job but the subject matter was over most peoples heads it jumped around too much meaning the dates also too long
Aug 2 2023,positive,loved the movie but can see how many would think its too scientific if you are not into the history and story the movie is not for you well made and interesting
Aug 2 2023,positive,great film but at over 3 hours in length it was a grind  i found the nudity to be a bit excessive as well  aside from that it looked amazing and the acting should earn an oscar for someone  my pick would be downey for best supporting actor
Aug 2 2023,positive,a depressing movie but a good movie i couldve done without the nudity it added nothing to the movie
Aug 2 2023,negative,this movie was no bestseller in my eyes i fell asleep during a lot of it boring as all get out hard to make out words
Aug 2 2023,positive,the movie was compelling from the very beginning we never felt the 3 hours as it moved right along the volume was a bit loud at times but the acting by all was spectacular we left the theater and both of us agreed we could and would see it again
Aug 2 2023,positive,amazing work from nolan  co
Aug 2 2023,positive,nolans masterpiece a true work of art oppenheimer displays beautiful frames and a shivering and spectacular soundtrack the plot is so immersive and the acting is flawless nolan couldnt have had a better cast for this picture
Aug 2 2023,negative,pomposity personified    my least favourite auteur christopher nolan has produced a loud bombastic film concerning the great jewish american physicist j for julius robert oppenheimer based on the wonderful pulitzer prize winning bio american prometheus at over 3 hours long zipping in and out in black and white for no reason it depicts oppenheimer as an unknowable genius who is a lefty womaniser and a morally conflicted autistic victim of his own success nolan often casts brits irish and aussies as americans  especially as heroes the entire cast of batman for example but this time he has outdone himself  casting irish catholic cillian murphy with a nose that points to the sky as oppenheimer with a nose that pointed to the ground bizarre casting choices abound  brit tom conti as einstein for example i would be glad to introduce nolan to some americans and perhaps a few hollywood jewish actors people praise murphy for his performance but as a jewish new yorker familiar with you know what jewish new yorkers look like and sound  i found him vacuous and unconvincing by far the best acting was robert downey jr who made the movie worthwhile as the villain strauss half american jew 100 villain eh chris followed by matt damon as general groves but 4 inches shorter and 40 pounds lighter at least     weaving in and out of time intercutting celestial and atomic graffiti throughout the music of ludwig goransson ripping the screen whenever the film tried to achieve in sensory overload in place of you know pace and reasoned storytelling nolan continues to fool the critics and film goers into thinking he is an intellectual with this tripe inception interstellar and tenet but he is far better at doing lightweight stuff like the batman movies with absurd plots visual dynamism and cartoon characters his attempts at serious films like this could have been are best left to people who know how to make decent films not this overloaded bullshit shame too american prometheus deserved better as did poor oppie
Aug 2 2023,positive,great movie but soundtrack drowned out the dialogue so many times in so many scenes glad i didnt see it at an imax 
Aug 2 2023,positive,the movie is fabulous  well written excellent cinematography incredible acting however the graphic pornography on screen of the relationship between oppenheimer  jean tatlock was unneccasary to convey the depth of her dependence on him  it could have been done more tastefully to open the movie up to a wider audience
Aug 2 2023,positive,brilliant acting and it addresses the man oppenheimer as the central subject not the bombing not japan the man as a complex confounding imperfect being
Aug 2 2023,positive,excellent production powerful movie deep thoughtprovoking great performance really really great performance when the tree starts branching its really quick cant take your eyes off for one second
Aug 2 2023,positive,outstanding movie in all aspects thorough historical account transferred to the screen to perfection superb acting and direction
Aug 2 2023,positive,fascinating movie audio was in and out in the first half hour evidently a known issue with larger format a lot to unpack will watch it again but probably not in imax
Aug 2 2023,positive,a little slow to start with but a very good movie overall
Aug 2 2023,positive,we liked everything about this movie best weve seen in a very long time
Aug 2 2023,positive,very informative about the way things were then
Aug 2 2023,positive,amazing film would see it 100 times more
Aug 2 2023,positive,a complicated story made easy and riveting to the viewers who sat motionless and absorbed during the entire movie so good to finally have an intelligent well written story excellently told with 5star actors
Aug 2 2023,positive,the acting was fantastic i didnt know the whole story and i think it was a great history lesson
Aug 2 2023,positive,great movie very intense the acting was outstanding
Aug 2 2023,positive,great acting but movie was an hour too long
Aug 2 2023,positive,it really told the story and characters did well to portray them the only thing that i thought was unnecessary was the sex scenes
Aug 2 2023,positive,awsome movie now its my favourite among nolans movies
Aug 2 2023,positive,enjoyed the movie 3 hours is a long time to sit  i dont think they could have cut anything and preserved the quality but at about 225 hours i sure got antsy
Aug 2 2023,positive,to long could have been 1752 hr movie
Aug 2 2023,positive,honestly best movie ive seen went to watch it 5 times now
Aug 2 2023,negative,endless dialogue didnt talk about the science somehow made fission boring
Aug 2 2023,positive,well done as far as acting and technical presentation important historical review however failed to really emphasize and call out the monstrous and unforgivable deployment of the atomic bomb on hiroshima and nagasaki and what it did to those 100s of thousands of people also missed pointing out that japanese surrender was already imminent finally was unnecessarily long could have been reduced to 25 hours easily
Aug 2 2023,positive,great story and fantastic acting
Aug 2 2023,positive,mistake to see in imax format missed at least half the dialogue which was spoken behind repeated explosions unnecessary exaggerated sound effects spouse removed his hearing aids and i wore ear plugs which we always have now when going to the cinema speaking with neighbors who saw it in regular format we learned that it wasnt much better why do films have to be projected so loudly acting outstanding script truetolife using words spoken by the  principals years ago  the words we could actually hear disappointing experience
Aug 2 2023,negative,quick cutaways to scenes not adding any value to the titular character or greater story feels like family guy at times   loud in between scene physic reaction graphics out of place in otherwise quiet film nolans use of noise was poor especially at climactic bomb scene where silence meant to add drama actually takes away from communicating power of the bomb  first thirty minutes should have been cut out  added nothing and was slow  and movie barely salvaged by performances from rdj and matt damon   movie does a poor job of being a character driven drama documentary or timepiece
Aug 2 2023,negative,i thought it was terrible if you need a good nap in the air conditioning dialog was repetitive and predictable there was not much to like about it not a fan
Aug 2 2023,positive,this was a very powerful movie  the characters were very strong and nononsense
Aug 2 2023,positive,vey entertaining and sad
Aug 2 2023,positive,christopher nolans movie thought provoking
Aug 2 2023,positive,i loved the movie  the acting the story the score the presentation everything
Aug 2 2023,positive,amazing sound an incredibly immersive storytelling probably the most emotionally charged drama ive ever seen highly recommend
Aug 2 2023,positive,emotional and mental background of robert oppenheimer  would have been nice to understand his parents siblings and early upbringing rather than starting at his college ages
Aug 2 2023,positive,be aware this movie is american history in incredibly teaching on whats going on in this country all those years so yes i highly recommend it
Aug 2 2023,positive,an epic blast by the master christopher nolen
Aug 2 2023,positive,this 3 hour long story kept my attention and interest beautifully and i felt like i was in a great history classroom that taught me so many things i hadnt known  i will definitely read more on this man and his life  the actors the script the scenes were so well done    i tell my friends this is not to be missed
Aug 2 2023,positive,despite the length of the movie and already knowing some of the story going into it nolans pacing use of sound and oppenheimers everpresent dread that transitions from trying to understand the universe to fearing the use of his understanding there are constant threads pulling you through the story closer to the edge of your seat building to the very end where most threads end and leave you with one more you can continue to pull on long after the movie do you now share his dread that you will have to decide
Aug 2 2023,negative,too many long unnecessary closeup scenes of boiling explosions sunbursts etc ditto closeups of oppenheimer staring forlornly into  nothing     oppenheimers troubles with politics were never clearly explained and seemed almost besidethepoint vs the development of the bombs     i believe that the hype over the movie was prematurely established even before its release it doesnt deserve accolades if you havent seen it yet tamper your expectations
Aug 2 2023,positive,oppenheimer was alright visually nice to watch the special effects was good and the use of black and white and colour scenes was smart however it was quite long and at times confusing i feel like it could have been a shorter film and we could have had the same thing its not the kind of film id choose to watch again but it was a fun and interesting experience
Aug 2 2023,positive,great story and acting
Aug 2 2023,positive,fantastic acting and cast i never knew the depths of his involvement in the atomic bomb but do know  for a drama the sound and video editing were amazing  the depth of storytelling and character development were excellent  sure they could have shortened it up maybe 2030 minutes but that is only a minor gripe
Aug 2 2023,positive,great movie i was not bored at all
Aug 2 2023,neutral,on the positive side i learnt more about robert oppenheimers career than i had previously known and the acting was good when it was allowed to be however i found the film unnecessarily disjointed hopping back and forth in time some scenes in black and white postdated those in full colour to add to the confusion the film score more like an incessant effects track with musical instruments was loud and obtrusive in the narrative  for example a tumutuous drum crescendo as we studied the protagonists face to indicate his troubled mind or dialogue with orchestral backing to tell us of the importance of a particular conversation for heavens sake this is not the 1930s why not just let the actors act i am confident that they would hold our attention and inform us less clumsily of their thoughts the impression was left of an overbearing director andor editor more suited to action fantasies than the psycological and political drama that this should have been
Aug 2 2023,positive,it was too long  many stars  well done could have done a better job of explaining the science if you are not familiar with physics you really have to pay attention  the actors were fantastic
Aug 2 2023,negative,for a movie about atoms bombs they showed one they talked a lot and it wasnt entertaining
Aug 2 2023,positive,it was good for me but i was hoping for an awesome movie and i didnt get it  its 3 hours of basically dialog and a lot of it is interesting but i thought it was way too long especially the hearing at the end i thought was never going to end  depending on your interest level your mileage will vary  i cant give it an across the board recommendation  i would have to know the persons movie interests and if i thought this kind of movie would be one that they would want to see
Aug 2 2023,positive,great acting and directing  a bit long but a definite must see
Aug 2 2023,neutral,predictable  superficial  underwhelming  laced with uninspired acting
Aug 2 2023,positive,a film to think about cinematically a masterpiece acting a masterpiece soundtrack a masterpiece i have little to complain  historically fantastic many moments that make you think
Aug 2 2023,positive,if your into history  its a great story really makes you think
Aug 2 2023,negative,3 hours of my life wasted
Aug 2 2023,positive,more visual excitement than expected nolan definitely makes up for tenant with oppenheimer i would see it again
Aug 2 2023,positive,absolutely stunning cinematography acting audio directing all make you feel the movie is one for the ages
Aug 2 2023,positive,great movie overall brush up on your physics history beforehand or you might get a little overwhelmed by the name drops and lingo while it does take some creative liberties with history it generally tells a great story of the man that brought us the most destructive power to date the conflicts and hubris which oppenheimer lived with really shone through along with his genius three hours is a short time for such a tale and yet a long time to stay parked in a theater seat  the visuals and sound effects made it worthwhile
Aug 2 2023,positive,great cast what a 
Aug 2 2023,positive,absolutely superb
Aug 2 2023,positive,it was an interest look at our history
Aug 2 2023,positive,another christopher nolan masterpiece  the directing writing acting score and filmography are superb and phenomenal while its not an easy movie to watch it is one of the most important movies of the last 30 years and it shows a very scary reality we are living in
Aug 2 2023,positive,it was exceptional christopher nolan never misses every detail in this movie has obviously been paid attention to the plot structure acting and the execution of the most important scenes left me awestruck this movie also proves that a storyline accompanied by an awesome score guarantees a masterpiece interstellar has proven nolans genius especially in scifi but to see him nail a biopic is a whole new story 1000000010
Aug 2 2023,positive,story of oppenheimers  life worth telling and visualizing on screen  incredible part of history not treated lightly
Aug 2 2023,positive,incredible storytelling not someone i was too familiar with but left with a better sense of who he was and how troubled he was to have had such a huge part in one of the most horrific events in human history
Aug 2 2023,positive,it was excellent   the 3 hour length was well worth it to give a better understanding of the scope of the project and the people involved
Aug 2 2023,positive,the intriguing history of this monumental time of patriotism
Aug 2 2023,positive,intelligent and mind blowing
Aug 2 2023,negative,short scenes jumping around through time and locations was annoying but not as annoying as the musical score or should i say noise score that loud and obnoxious music virtually overpowered every scene including on top of dialogue i was looking forward to seeing this movie but came out very disappointed because of the way it was made not the subject
Aug 2 2023,positive,it was an amazing movie the actors were brilliant
Aug 2 2023,positive,i loved the way that sounds and visuals came together to convey mental states  the triggering of a traumatic episode cues to near flashback is there several times before you get the story of it  i found it so powerful    and im grateful for the younger generation to get a feel for the cold war our fear of extermination by nuclear war  the terror of communism and how crazy the red scare was
Aug 2 2023,positive,a very thought provoking piece of history cillian murphy will surely be nominated for his portrait of oppenheimer great cast and very well acted
Aug 2 2023,positive,got an education on what occurred the theater did have an odor and probably needs a deep clean
Aug 2 2023,positive,absolutely brilliant a must see for everyone
Aug 2 2023,positive,long movie  good story  good actors  so many actors
Aug 2 2023,positive,this work should be the last cinematic work in the world i do not think that something more wonderful can be produced than this legendary artistic miracle
Aug 2 2023,neutral,oppenheimer  bang and a whimper    perhaps it was my expectations after reading the initial reviews the big names on the billboard or the star director in christopher nolan but i had high hopes before i watched this movie yesterday on imax my feelings are now mixed at best    where do we start  i havent read the oppenheimer biography but who hasnt heard his name the movie is in 3 parts  the journey leading up to the trinity test the senate hearing of strauss intercut with the advisory board review of oppenheimers security clearance in the later part of his life christopher nolan has made a brave attempt at weaving the various narratives but the subject matter is so thin that in the attempt to stretch it to cover the 3 hours the fabric has become very thin and one can see through it  the most impressive part of oppenheimers legacy  the trinity test  was handled quite well all the scenes leading up to it were really well made and well performed the scenes depicting the test itself  left something to be desired oppenheimers uneasiness with what followed japan bombings was handled in a very flaky manner perhaps it was the man or the storywriting at fault well never know  the other two parts of the story were very weak the intensity of those scenes certainly for dramatic effect didnt sync well with the material the advisory review was blown out of proportion including a completely gratuitous sex scene which felt completely out of place  and not only intentionally so  the quick cuts of strauss confirmation hearing were much better handled but again it was not enough material compared to the time spent on it  to be fair the actors acted the hell out of their characters as many critics have said so far at the risk of eating their nonexistent hats cillian murphy will certainly be nominated for an oscar rdj may also be nominated for a supporting role cinematography and sound may also be recognised however the movie as a whole doesnt work well   the supposedly strong women in the movie dont have much to do as is often the case they have been reduced to twodimensional characters florence pugh is neurotic and horny emily blunt is frustrated and drunk we never get a chance to explore their motivations beyond some throwaway lines the one scene where emily blunts character gets a chance to shine is too short    overall i wouldnt recommend my friends to see the movie i would wait until there is a shorter cut or it inevitably shows up on the streaming platforms
Aug 2 2023,positive,the actors were superb in their roles i learned so much more about this time in history than i had previously known allinallwell done
Aug 2 2023,positive,very good movie just a little too long
Aug 2 2023,positive,christopher nolans oppenheimer is a thoughtprovoking and visually breathtaking film supported by exceptional performances and meticulous craftsmanship despite occasional emotional detachment and some personal issues with the nonlinear structure oppenheimer remains a deeply compelling and intellectually stimulating film that leaves a lasting impression
Aug 2 2023,positive,sound and picture editing couldve really done better with continuity control
Aug 2 2023,positive,a little long but worth the time  younger generation should see it since they dont realize the horrors of the a nuclear bomb
Aug 2 2023,positive,amazing movie wasnt bored for even a second of the watch great cinematography you could watch this movie for the shots alone
Aug 2 2023,positive,this is the best oppenheimer movie ever
Aug 2 2023,positive,both entertaining ad thought provoking learned much of this part of our history three hours went by quickly
Aug 2 2023,positive,great acting interesting story amazing effects
Aug 2 2023,positive,intriguing fantastic acting sets etc
Aug 2 2023,positive,the cinematography music and sound are perfect  but because the story is too heavy there are lots of dialogues that cant be skipped and the storyline goes back and forth making many viewers including myself dizzy with the story
Aug 2 2023,positive,the movie was excellent there were characters you love and hated the actors were amazing in their roles
Aug 2 2023,positive,fantastic big screen experience  the allstar cast is impressive and there were amazing performances from cillian murphy robert downy jr and matt damon  there are too many star studded cameo performances to mention but my favorites were rami malek and casey affleck  the story of oppenheimer the manhattan project the creation of the atomic bomb and the devastating aftermath of its use is captivating  ive seen it twice already
Aug 2 2023,positive,after witnessing this epic episode this week i cannot stop thinking about the entire dramatic episode and its repercussions for humanity i seemed to have a fantastic head start on things which kept me learning ahead of other people but at one point in the film it offered me a horrifying yet satisfying sensation as well as an additional load of emotions to deal with christopher nolan has been a lifelong engineer and a prophet of mindbending thrillers mixed with emotions he knows how to bring the best out of the people hes working with  in rdjs language hes kind of like a dad that you cant beef with because hes actually just a really good parent    oppenheimer is a captivating biographical film that delves into the life of j robert oppenheimer the brilliant physicist who led the manhattan project during wwii directed by a talented team the movie skillfully weaves together historical footage and compelling performances to showcase the complex personality of this enigmatic figure the film offers a thoughtprovoking exploration of oppenheimers role in creating the atomic bomb and the moral dilemmas he faced overall it is a mustsee movie and carries a lot of enriching information about why and specifically how the los alamos incident made dr oppenheimer as famous as he is today  hes neither a hero nor a villain neither monster nor savior just a man in flesh and blood trying to do the right things at the wrong time altogether the los alamos secret project that maybe he took too personally was successful in terms of yield but for a moment he didnt even sit and think about the innocent peoples livespeople that will be exterminated without knowing anything about what they have done maybe fate has nothing to do with us it is us who decide who we shall be and who we will become without considering the most probable consequences that we will create in the future or simply we chose not to see
Aug 2 2023,positive,cillian murphy is most certainly an oscar nominee for this role the films honesty about humanity including the oversized ego at its best and its worst
Aug 2 2023,positive,good but very long winded towards the end
Aug 2 2023,negative,i hated the movie
Aug 2 2023,positive,christoper nolan delivers an emotionally complex film with strong themes of intense subject matters its able to deliver such a strong message while showing the reality of such an intense subject acting performances by cillian murphy are highlighted in this film in which he plays such a complex character in robert oppenheimer
Aug 2 2023,positive,after witnessing this epic episode this week i cannot stop thinking about the entire dramatic episode and its repercussions for humanity i seemed to have a fantastic head start on things which kept me learning ahead of other people but at one point in the film it offered me a horrifying yet satisfying sensation as well as an additional load of emotions to deal with christopher nolan has been a lifelong engineer and a prophet of mindbending thrillers mixed with emotions he knows how to bring the best out of the people hes working with  in rdjs language hes kind of like a dad that you cant beef with because hes actually just a really good parent    oppenheimer is a captivating biographical film that delves into the life of j robert oppenheimer the brilliant physicist who led the manhattan project during wwii directed by a talented team the movie skillfully weaves together historical footage and compelling performances to showcase the complex personality of this enigmatic figure the film offers a thoughtprovoking exploration of oppenheimers role in creating the atomic bomb and the moral dilemmas he faced overall it is a mustsee movie and carries a lot of enriching information about why and specifically how the los alamos incident made dr oppenheimer as famous as he is today  hes neither a hero nor a villain neither monster nor savior just a man in flesh and blood trying to do the right things at the wrong time altogether the los alamos secret project that maybe he took too personally was successful in terms of yield but for a moment he didnt even sit and think about the innocent peoples livespeople that will be exterminated without knowing anything about what they have done maybe fate has nothing to do with us it is us who decide who we shall be and who we will become without considering the most probable consequences that we will create in the future or simply we chose not to see
Aug 2 2023,positive,story line included a lot more that just about building the bomb casting was excellent and except for the workers at los alamos waving  50 star flags at the celebration party after the first bomb went off the sets cars and wardrobe looked like the 40s  well worth the 3 hours it took to watch it all
Aug 2 2023,negative,sorry but the 3 hours was too long  boring wish i hadnt gone to see it mission impossible  sound of freedom much better dont waste your time with oppenheimer people walked out i stayed to the end but it was  torture alot of stars i liked  interesting story but they made it way too boring  long
Aug 2 2023,neutral,at times i felt it did too much like it did things only because it could  because it was a nolan film but the second half was equal parts heartbreaking and intense and i admired how the story unraveled 
Aug 2 2023,negative,it was way way too noisy  i was hoping for much more on oppenheimer not all the noise of war
Aug 2 2023,positive,this was really good the trailer looks kinda boring but i could take my eyes off this
Aug 2 2023,positive,i knew of him but not about him i learned alot about him and the making of the abomb and what happened to him afterwards   all the performances are excellent i highly recommend this movie
Aug 2 2023,positive,excellent treatment of this story great performances  fantastic filmmaking
Aug 2 2023,positive,excellent movie not sure why it was filmed in imax if there arent as many imax theatres 70mm was probably good
Aug 2 2023,positive,the movie captures oppenheimers complex character but could have used some editing  too long
Aug 2 2023,positive,historical and entertaining  my wife and i really enjoyed the movie and we learned so much about that time in history  must see
Aug 2 2023,positive,was a little slow for me if you like history youll like this movie
Aug 2 2023,neutral,i am the girlfriend of a man who made me watch this i suffered but i must say i am not a scientist if you arent a scientist dont expect to understand 70 of what is said bomb scene is underwhelming but acting is insanely good and made me okay with watching the whole thing
Aug 2 2023,positive,good movie but too much dialogue a little more action wouldve been good
Aug 2 2023,positive,mesmerizing film an incredible slice of american history highly recommend
Aug 2 2023,positive,amazing production the  insertion of background sounds effects subtly set the unquestionable underlying emotion for scenes  terrific acting  best movie ive seen since forever  its haunting
Aug 2 2023,positive,a very convoluted story with so many characters  it was a bit hard to follow  the ending was very revealing and robert downy was excellent in his role  i really liked seeing so many actors who have not been seen in many years such as matthew modine josh hartnett kenneth branagh  i feel they could have cut about 30 mins out and still told the story as effectively as they did
Aug 2 2023,negative,boring pompous vapid unnecessarily sprawling
Aug 2 2023,positive,oppenheimer delivers a compelling portrayal of j robert oppenheimer brilliantly brought to life by cillian murphy the film is elevated further by standout performances from matt damon as gen leslie groves and robert downey jr as lewis strauss however the first part of the movie may feel a bit sluggish though it picks up its pace in the second half creating a smoother narrative flow admittedly the storys complexity can be challenging to follow making it difficult to keep track of all the characters despite this the films gripping moments leading up to the atomic bomb explosion and the impressive depiction of the explosion scene itself make it an exhilarating experience although the 3hour runtime and occasional slow moments might deter some viewers the movie is undeniably a great watch that benefits from a second viewing even if not necessarily in imax
Aug 2 2023,negative,half a star for the scene of the bomb being tested and the beautiful shots of the desert boring dialogue boring movie never have i fallen asleep so many times in a highly rated movie great for those who want to fall asleep 
Aug 2 2023,positive,amazing direction great acting powerpacked performances
Aug 2 2023,positive,this is probably the second best film this year so far if you love ww2 films than this is a must see
Aug 2 2023,positive,brilliant direction cinematography and acting by downey
Aug 2 2023,positive,i checked the watch when the trinity test happened and was highly ecstatic to find out that there was still an hour of runtime left but that excitement didnt last    the movie successfully captures the tension and intrigue surrounding the trinity test providing a gripping experience for viewers however as the credits rolled i couldnt help but feel a twinge of disappointment at the missed opportunity to delve deeper into the psychological aftermath of oppenheimers actions    having established such a remarkable character study in the first act it felt like a missed opportunity not to delve into the internal turmoil and moral dilemmas that must have plagued oppenheimer post the devastating bombings in japan a deeper examination of the inner conflicts faced by the protagonist would have not only added depth to the narrative but also elevated the film to a more profound and thoughtprovoking level    one cannot deny the compelling performance of the lead actor whose nuanced portrayal of j robert oppenheimer brings a sense of authenticity to the character his ability to convey complex emotions with subtlety is truly commendable and carries much of the films emotional weight however the screenplays failure to provide a stronger psychological arc for the protagonist limits the actors range and deprives the audience of a more profound connection with the central figure  oppenheimer is undeniably a captivating biopic that vividly portrays the events surrounding the trinity test and the life of j robert oppenheimer yet its refusal to fully delve into the psychological aspects of its complex protagonist leaves a lingering sense of unfulfilled potential    ps the score by ludwig was amazing
Aug 2 2023,positive,excellent writing phenomenal acting spectacular cinematography
Aug 2 2023,positive,incredible story well acted and filmed   it is a long historically based film  i think it is important to do some reading before you attend the brilliance of founders of quantum physics combined with the need for the country to end a horrific war brings about scholarly discussions about how to do this and consider the humanity of an atom bomb  packed with incredible and familiar actors i wonder if you will spot them all   the sound was palpable my seat shook    make sure to go with someone you can talk to after the film so much to discuss
Aug 2 2023,positive,the movie was overall excellent  interesting to see the crap oppenheimer was given re his security clearance after the war but no problem during the war  also the early dream images of atoms etc maybe to show a warped mind were a little disjointed and a time waster  special effects for unknown reasons  but otherwise excellent
Aug 2 2023,positive,this movie is about an hour too long a lot of talk a lot of very boring at least to me i did get a little bit of a history lesson so theres that
Aug 2 2023,positive,very enjoyable came in expecting a lot of dialog which it did have but the musical score kept the intensity up move was fast paced and made you peer into the mind and noise of robert oppenheimer would watch again
Aug 2 2023,positive,acting was superbwell written and directed
Aug 2 2023,positive,phenomenal acting by the whole cast wish i knew more about oppenheimer before this movie came out so it made a little more sense but overall i thought it was a great movie
Aug 2 2023,positive,the history the use of both black and white and color filming really excellent character portrayal too
Aug 2 2023,positive,great production great casting cinematography on point while its undeniable that this movie has everything in its power to be one of the best releases of 2023 as a member of the audience and nonfilmmaker i found myself literally lost in the story and not being able to follow along for the majority of the movie not too mention i dont understand why movies are being too long lately 3 hours felt too much will not be able to watch again
Aug 2 2023,positive,it was a good movie but i thought it would be more about the technical building of the atom bomb but it was a autobiography of oppenheimer
Aug 2 2023,positive,excellent movie cillian murphy actor exceptional 
Aug 2 2023,positive,i cant remember a time that i felt more emotional impacted and enjoyed a movie more than this experience this truly is one of the best modern day movies telling a long true sad story please go see this yall you wont regret it and please dont see barbie instead horid movie that was if you want to feel emotional amazed suprised and every emotion at once lol go to oppenheimer
Aug 2 2023,positive,a very fine historical piece not 100 accurate plus close enough the acting is superb it doesnt seem like a three hour movie
Aug 2 2023,positive,like most nolan films post dark knight i felt underwhelmed by the overall film but the acting was incredible
Aug 2 2023,positive,incredible cast captivating
Aug 2 2023,positive,great acting and storytelling  powerful and intense
Aug 2 2023,positive,dramatic acting  amazing sound
Aug 2 2023,positive,great how they portrayed this transcendental event like the creation of the atomic bomb in a biomovie everything nolan does is art
Aug 2 2023,positive,my second favorite christopher nolan movie outstanding acting cinematography sound and editing some of his most creative use of nonlinear storytelling by going back to the same scene from two different perspectives
Aug 2 2023,positive,a masterpiece serious topic extraordinary acting  especially murphy downey jr blunt worth seeimg multiple times
Aug 2 2023,positive,stellar sound design elevates this visually stunning and poignant film  all performances are topnotch  does not feel like 3 hours despite being 3 hours    as a biopic it cannot really control that the events of oppenheimers life dont exactly follow a normal climactic structure but one gripe i have is that the movie does peak in tension at around the middle and never fully recovers from that  this is especially true if you already know the history of oppenheimers postww2 life which makes an event presented as a plot twist not land
Aug 2 2023,positive,openhiemer seems one prepared to do hard things  does a single man convince the us government military to build a community for scientists in a vast barren landscape simply because of his childhood longing and familiarity or is it destiny
Aug 2 2023,positive,possible spoilers i absolutely love this movie it was a blast and a half all puns are intended to watch like most movies there were a few slow bits and a romantic bplot but the movie was excellent really putting into perspective the affect that the development of the abomb can do to everyone
Aug 2 2023,positive,one of the best films of the year so far one of the best performances by cillian murphy and robert downey jr christopher nolan has made a modern masterpiece
Aug 2 2023,positive,extremely loud which was distractingi wish i had brought concert type ear plugs the storyline was okmade me want to read more about oppenheimer
Aug 2 2023,positive,nothing quite like seeing the film on film instead of a digital projection the scens were extremely compelling and the contrast was amazing
Aug 2 2023,positive,incredible minds and glad we didnt see the mass destruction
Aug 2 2023,positive,oppenheimer fires across all cylinders writing editing cinematography and a soundtrack with a role of its own  christopher nolan makes complex historical subjects entertaining and exciting  the ensemble cast played well together without anyone one player chewing the scenery  i was glad to see this big film in the theater
Aug 2 2023,positive,great movie about history of atomic bomb could have left the nudity out  still had a great movie
Aug 2 2023,positive,the story of j robert oppenheimer was delivered very well to the audience and the brilliant work done by christopher nolan in the director seat this is a must watch movie
Aug 2 2023,positive,nolan delivered another classic i was so glad i did my homework on dr oppenheimer prior to watching the film in imax i knew so much about the manhattan projects but not very much about los alamos the the studying prior to the day of release helped me understand what i was walking in to
Aug 2 2023,positive,great historical drama with excellent acting
Aug 2 2023,positive,excellent movie  it did not feel like a 3 hour movie  a part of history that needs to be understood
Aug 2 2023,neutral,threehour movie that could have been done in two hours  whoever did the soundtrack should be shot overshadowed the dialogue and the screeching of the violin was too much  couple to the left of us left the couple on the right of us got fidgety  we left tired and unsatisfied with the story
Aug 2 2023,positive,this film will go down as one of the greats a superb history lesson to those that have no idea of the manipulation of government   a sobering reality of what this whole event has meant to ours  future generations  this is a complex film that requires concentration to fully understand the story a must see for intelligent adults
Aug 2 2023,positive,an elegant and beautiful piece of art that i would love to experience again like the first time i saw it
Aug 2 2023,negative,too long and didnt keep my attention
Aug 2 2023,positive,enjoyed the history about making the bomb and his life very well done
Aug 2 2023,positive,it was long but it didnt feel long
Aug 2 2023,positive,i thought the movie was very good they went into so much detail and it was nice to see how much effort they put into the movie cillian murphy is phenomenal
Aug 2 2023,positive,its worth it just to see the story which is better than anything any hollywood writers could come up with but i wasnt thrilled with the format used starting at the end of his life and seeing the story from his memories basicallywhile defending himself on an inquiry board meh well shot though
Aug 2 2023,positive,very good acting and performance too many critics with different views go see it for your self
Aug 2 2023,positive,it seemed to be very historically accurate
Aug 2 2023,positive,the acting was outstanding
Aug 2 2023,positive,really long movie very well made good story
Aug 2 2023,positive,interesting movie about the atomic bomb and its creator  wish there wasnt nudity and sex scenes it really added nothing to the movie and wasnt necessary im sure most people went  to learn about  dr oppenheimer  not sure why hollywood has to add something so unnecessary
Aug 2 2023,positive,the movie never showed the war it is like the audience is isolating with the scientists
Aug 2 2023,positive,amazing movie absolutely excellent story line truly great acting great actors i was consumed in the entire movie the actor that played oppenheimer did a spectacular job he deserves an oscar will definitely watch it again
Aug 2 2023,positive,paul schrader was right one of the greatest movies of the century

Aug 2 2023,positive,good acting bad directing 3 hours is too long for a shallow movie like this  looks like the people who made it tried hard to satisfy the audience with different views about the atomic bomb creation and its use by us at the end of wwii but completely failed
Aug 2 2023,positive,the movie is an awesome the acting is great both cillian and robert downey jr are stellar i hope they win an oscar overall the whole cast was amazing the movie photography is fantastic i love the combination of the blackandwhite frames and how the two stories are clearly differentiated with the fission vs fusion  the music is great i liked that they didnt focus on the bombings but rather on oppenheimers and strauss views i feel you dont have to know any physics to understand how they develop the bombs 3 hours  went by very quickly since one can get invested in the story very easily

Aug 2 2023,positive,my expectations were too high not enough on the effects on japans people
Aug 2 2023,positive,there was lots to like including all the different actors the characters and story telling  i wish there had been more about the science and less about the military and politics
Aug 2 2023,positive,great acting and filming would like to have seen more about the science and consequences of the two bombs dropped on japan dont know why it was filmed in imax there was no reason to see it that way as it was basically just a drama
Aug 2 2023,positive,very powerful and well acted cillian murphy will definitely get an oscar for this
Aug 2 2023,positive,didnt like the flash forward and backward format and switching from color to black and white also a waste to film in imax great cast and well acted

Aug 2 2023,positive,movie was incredible a cillian  rdj mastercraft the entire cast gave the best performance that they could with the amount of screen time they had it was amazing ludwig again showing everyone that he is now  the future of cinema scores
Aug 2 2023,positive,a very long 3 hour movie of mostly just talking i almost fell asleep  especially in the beginning i really dont see what the hype is about this film
Aug 2 2023,positive,the thorough examination of history was amzing
Aug 2 2023,positive,it was an ok film albeit quite long the acting was good but it dragged in spots
Aug 2 2023,positive,this was a remarkable movie  the story is compelling  the history is close enough i have read american prometheus and the acting was the best i have seen in years  just a great film  nolan has written produced and directed a masterpiece
Aug 2 2023,negative,i was confused throughout the movie  names time frames scenes that made no sense when they first appeared

Aug 2 2023,positive,all star cast that did an indepth examination of oppenheimer  execellent job
Aug 2 2023,positive,great acting and great story unneeded nudity absolutely unnecessary
Aug 2 2023,positive,awesome movie sound was awful in the theater we pickednot the fault of the movie
Aug 2 2023,positive,pretty good a little discombobulating given nolans tendency to jump between time periods i guess he got drunk on breaking the three act structure when he was making tenet and never really went through proper withdrawal afterwards otherwise its a decent war science film caveat its not a military science fiction film its a historical war science drama film im much pleased
Aug 2 2023,positive,an amazing film on so many levels  the creativity of christopher nolan in telling this story through flashbacks and cutting between the present and the past worked so well  the photography was impressive especially the contrast between the bacl and white segments and the color segments  the set design and costumes added so much to the story  and the special effects were riveting  but most impressive were the actors themselves  i found cillian murphy and emily blunt to be absolutely compelling but they head a stellar cast not because of their star power but because of their authenticity  a powerful movie that spotlights genius and hubris
Aug 2 2023,neutral,it was a reminder that politics rules the current environment i like movies that take me away from reality
Aug 2 2023,positive,awesome  i can see this getting nominated for many awards
Aug 2 2023,positive,a masterpiece by nolan visually spectacular but it will be low on my rewatch playlist
Aug 2 2023,positive,it was a good movie but a very long one i feel like they could have cut at least an hour off of it and still told the story
Aug 2 2023,positive,acting picture cinematography all awards that should be coming to oppenheimer

Aug 2 2023,positive,too long and drawn out a good movie but over rated and over hyped
Aug 2 2023,negative,first movie ive been to that i didnt even realize it had started music is loud movie is very choppy it is like watch a movie preview for 3 hours
Aug 2 2023,positive,a stunning visual showcase for a moral paradox at three hours there are still threads left to explore but the film raises important historical and human questions that resonate even today
Aug 2 2023,neutral,to long didnt need to be
Aug 2 2023,positive,70 mm film imax was just amazingly impactful  moved along nicely didnt seem as long as the clock would indicate
Aug 2 2023,positive,this movie was well done the acting performance was great and i liked how nolan showed the elements in oppenheimers mind i liked how they set up the bomb scene and it was very well done my only issue with it was the nudity and sex scene i thought it was unnecessary because it is a historical movie and there was no need for a sex scene but other than that it is a great movie and nolan has done it again
Aug 2 2023,positive,one of the better movies ive seen in years would definitely recommend you see it on the largest screen possible
Aug 2 2023,positive,gorgeous movie with an incredible cast cillian murphy deserves an oscar very dense material but a very satisfying story with a devastating ending i loved it
Aug 2 2023,positive,authentic a film of many themes that truly embraces the gravity of oppenheimers situation been a while since ive seen a blockbuster that delivered to its hype
Aug 2 2023,negative,i cant believe i didnt sleep during this it was basically 3 hours of people in rooms talking to each other theres einstein theres enrico fermi theres good will hunting playing another military guy theres a lot of people who dont give a sh in the audience what are we all doing here theyre discussing why didnt oppenheimer make the hbomb when he had a chance was he a commie or something     i didnt find the portrayal robert oppenheimer the man really interesting nor did i like him much maybe its because cillian murphy looks about as american as stephen fry he was just cold and weird and aloof even while having sex or was the real oppenheimer boring af and cillian is killing it either way its dull as hell when is the effing bomb going off there it goes but wait was oppenheimer a commie who cares
Aug 2 2023,positive,it was great bring your attention span and your a game so you follow along only complaint was it was longggg
Aug 2 2023,positive,awesome movie and a great history lesson  was let down by the bomb explosion but other then that it is a cinematic master class by nolan
Aug 2 2023,positive,beautifully structured  shot  and told a fascinating first 30 minutes  an even better middle 30 minutes  and the last 30 are the cherry on top fantastic ending to a fantastic film  the score was great  the performances riveting  the dialogue well written the historical events told in a intense connected fashion all the characters were great  and the way it all interlinks works so well the ending was a classic 
Aug 2 2023,negative,well i didnt get to see it  because i made a mistake and bought ticket at the wrong theater and called when i realized it it was still in previews but would not refund or exchange  thanks alot for taking 28 dollars from me fandango 
Aug 2 2023,positive,the musical score was brilliant   the actual showing of the galaxies and the atomic explosions were breathtaking
Aug 2 2023,positive,great movie  really describes an important time in world history
Aug 2 2023,neutral,it was very informative but very very very slow  i actually nodded off a few times during the movie  i was disappointed in it
Aug 2 2023,positive,a phenomenal movie based on the true story of the inventor of the atom bomb it has remarkable acting and stunning visual effects and sound i highly recommend watching it in imax
Aug 2 2023,positive,wow just amazing  great performances by all especially the main character
Aug 2 2023,positive,very well done although the start and end dragged a little
Aug 2 2023,positive,just saw this in theaters in imax and am thankful for it was left absolutely speechless with plenty of questions and wanting to watch it again its a movie that really gets you thinking while the suspense is absolutely thrilling definitely a film to watch if youre interested in something that mentally engages you
Aug 2 2023,positive,great directing and storytelling i loved how the emotions of the characters were told in the movie and how visual effects were used i do feel the sex scenes could have been done better and didnt do enough to move the plot to be warranted but the positives severely outweigh the negatives
Aug 2 2023,positive,it was well acted and suspenseful eventhough we know the conclusion
Aug 2 2023,positive,felt like they dragged the los alimos portion of the movie i fell asleep the beginning was great as was the end the complexities and politics that go along with developing the bomb were displayed in an interesting way the dialog between friends colleagues and lovers was engaging as someone who didnt know anything about this particular moment in history i throughly enjoyed the movie but i wouldnt watch it in theaters if you had a long day you will fall asleep excited to re watch at home so i can break it up into 2 or 3 sittings and really take in some of the parts i missed
Aug 2 2023,positive,im not sure but i feel like i need to watch this again it jumped around alot and the music underneath the dialogue was almost constant and distracting it felt unnecessary maybe it was to keep the audience alert as it is a very long film my husband said and i agree that it felt like a constant trailer for the film particularly at the start it was so disjointed it also lacked character development so i didnt feel like you got to know the characters fully and it therefore left me unmoved the acting was good and there were some great visual cinematic moments so thats my 3 stars but it didnt live up to the hype for me i was a bit disappointed to be honest
Aug 2 2023,positive,great story telling at its best
Aug 2 2023,positive,it was the best movie weve seen in years it was extremely well done the actors were amazing and the makeup department was exceptionally subtle as the actors aged
Aug 2 2023,positive,brilliant movie that explains things well and respects the intelligence of the audience highly entertaining
Aug 2 2023,positive,excellent movie could probably have been a little shorter but told an interesting story very well im still thinking about it days later
Aug 2 2023,positive,great acting great pace not a boring moment
Aug 2 2023,positive,i call it reality history  great acting  a must see for students 7th grade and up
Aug 2 2023,positive,good story of an important time during americas involvement of world war 11 
Aug 2 2023,positive,very engrossing and well scripted and wellacted movie  it was the fastest three hours ive ever watched in a movie theater  i learned so much history i had not previously know but in a very entertaining manner  highly recommend
Aug 2 2023,positive,great movie very timey an inch bit long but overall great

Aug 2 2023,positive,it was long but very good
Aug 2 2023,positive,i learned more in depth information from the movie i always knew bits and pieces of the development of the bomb this tied it al together it was interesting and suspenseful i liked it a lot i really liked the various characters
Aug 2 2023,positive,reality learned more than i knew
Aug 2 2023,positive,riveting suspenseful great acting
Aug 2 2023,neutral,story was good but very slow sorry i expected more
Aug 2 2023,neutral,it was well written probably well produced but  lacked anything that grabbed me
Aug 2 2023,positive,if youre a history buff and interested in ww2 andor the development of the atomic bomb you will like this movie  it is presented in a unique way that i first kind of found confusing but in about 15 minutes understood it and found it really entertaining and informative  3 hours so start with an empty bladder
Aug 2 2023,positive,3 hour movie was too long  also unnecessary nudity
Aug 2 2023,positive,great moviestory was intriguing  acting very good and the filming excellent
Aug 2 2023,positive,great acting and intense storyline  intelligent and captivating  length of movie not an issue good cinematography and needs to be seen on a giant screen  makes you think and highly recommend
Aug 2 2023,positive,excellent actorsacting
Aug 2 2023,negative,wasnt expecting a work of art but certainly hoping for a better movie still not sure what christopher nolans contribution to the spectacular sad event of the bomb was  or of oppenheimer for that matter in addition to cliches some well known details and a few distortions the film lacks character development and historical analysis  whats there could be edited down to one hour
Aug 1 2023,positive,have to watch it again even tho its 3 hours long it went at a fast place at times and i couldnt understand some of the dialogue because of the background sounds should win an oscar
Aug 1 2023,positive,a great story but complicated to follow the way it was presented in the movie jumping from past to present and the sound at the theater we attended was terrible to loud and distorted  the acting in the movie was top drawer all the way all were super
Aug 1 2023,positive,great acting and christopher nolan movies do not disappoint
Aug 1 2023,negative,batman director gets in over his head
Aug 1 2023,positive,this movie was okay the pacing of it has this strong tension brewing and it feels like its giving me anxiety at times but overall it was a good movie i do agree with someone who mentioned the sex scenes were strongly unnecessary there was no purpose for florence to go topless and it doesnt change anything about the movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,fantastic fascinating story i never knew  provides a in depth look at how aggressive the us government pursued anybody that contemplated aspects of communism at the time  even those who performed miracles in the service of their country
Aug 1 2023,positive,amazing movie  intelligent informative thrilling complex  maybe best movie material  do not miss it  its a part of history still relevant today
Aug 1 2023,positive,nolan is one of my favorite directors and cillian murphy is brilliant i found it a bit complex to follow unless you know the story before hand and while the director likes to play with the different optics and give it some spin i felt it was hard to follow at times the photography was awesome and the images about the bomb were amazing
Aug 1 2023,positive,very well done intense and accurate
Aug 1 2023,positive,too long but great story line and acting was fantastic
Aug 1 2023,positive,very good good story
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie very intense learned so much about all of the information surrounding this historical event
Aug 1 2023,positive,this movie is a cinematic masterpiece cillian murphy has a careerbest amazing and oscarworthy performance so does robert downey jr has a oscarworthy performance but the whole cast is great the cinematographey in here is spectacular this movie is a must see movie in imax
Aug 1 2023,negative,as what most critic reviews have said and even friends that have seen it the middle act is the meat the beginning and end act are the bones  part 1 and 3 is part history channel part cspan  yeah it was interesting to get to know some of the history the entire movie is not 100 factual of oppenheimers life but i wanted more drama and for 3hrs it was not enough payoff in the end  usual nolans epic movies fly by the 3hrs but this one i was counting the minutes til it ended    but great performance by cilian murphy  oscar worthy  perhaps though not enough to win but he could be nominated
Aug 1 2023,positive,great acting  learned so much history that is relevant today
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie  but sometimes tough to keep track of the interactions
Aug 1 2023,positive,this was more of a mental movie on the history of ww11 younger audiences would  find it hard to follow if they are not up on their history
Aug 1 2023,positive,very technically correct and accurate portrayal of oppenheimers sacrifice and subsequent punishment for doing exactly what the country wanted from him you can see it coming a mile away  that being said you can only wonder why a man of such intellect could be so conflicted and not expect the eventual outcome  cillian murphy does a fantastic job portraying robert oppenheimer realistically
Aug 1 2023,positive,a fascinating story about the manmen who developed the atomic bomb and their misgivings about their work
Aug 1 2023,positive,well made and presented as historically correct as possible complex characters pique my interest thee only downside is that three hours without a restroom break is a bit much for a person who lived through this event
Aug 1 2023,positive,the acting was terrific and most interesting story
Aug 1 2023,negative,i did not have the opportunity to watch the movie during the previews the loud noises of the previews prevented me from continuing to watch what was on the screen i had to leave the theater with a headache that came on so suddenly it caused tears
Aug 1 2023,neutral,not very well documented to the facts  this guy was not a saint  they should have spent more time developing the real story behind the reason the bomb was developed  his story on its own was very geeky
Aug 1 2023,positive,a bit too discursive and slow otherwise an interesting story
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent movie overall with pretty good pacing and cinematography i just felt the last act couldve been truncated a little bit it started dragging after a while but i still loved the film overall and thought it did a really good job of telling oppenheimers story
Aug 1 2023,positive,the first 2030 minutes were confusing but the movie was excellent  robert downey jr should get an oscar nomination for his performance  a little long still a terrific movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,awesome in large format and awesome sound
Aug 1 2023,positive,phenomenal acting by starstudded cast and really delves into the moral emotional political and technical issues oppie was facing  it really told the story  i thought the musical score could be a bit more muted since the acting was so tremendous the movie didnt need it and i found it distracting  visually a great movie  one gets so immersed you do not realize its a three hour movie  this movie is about the man and his struggles during and after the project so if youre looking for overly technical details such as the delivery or actual dropping of the bombs this is not the focus
Aug 1 2023,positive,loved it thought provoking realistic and well filmed would recommend to everyone  we need to be aware and prodded to think through history as it impacts our future
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was an interesting part of world history  i dont think the sex scenes on film were really necessary but understand why they included them  i have recommended the movie to others even if it was longer than it needed to be to convey the message of the film
Aug 1 2023,positive,i will see this again  by far the best movie in a generation
Aug 1 2023,positive,brilliant i would have happily walked back into the cinema and watched the whole thing again if i could its a haunting movie that sticks with you long after you have finished watching it might be three hours long but i never once looked at the time as i was totally engaged
Aug 1 2023,negative,way too long disappointed to say the least  christopher dolan messed up yet again but thats not surprising given his other weakly directed movies  save you  and stay away
Aug 1 2023,positive,performances were amazing  cillian and rdj should definitely win an  oscar  but all performed well  a great history lesson
Aug 1 2023,positive,very insightful how major scientific research and politics work
Aug 1 2023,positive,the cast was excellent and the cinematography was phenomenal this was one of the best films i have ever seen
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent movie lots of well known actorsactresses
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent storytelling suspenseful emotionally gripping top notch acting cinematography  sound a true masterpiece by nolan  company
Aug 1 2023,positive,cleverly it together but difficult to follow all the plot lines very good overall but i need to see it again
Aug 1 2023,positive,thoroughly researched with extraordinary performances of a watershed moment in us history
Aug 1 2023,positive,this was a very compelling movie although it was 3 hours long i was entertained throughout the movies it presented some historical facts that i was unaware of i enjoyed it very much
Aug 1 2023,positive,fine film making by one of our best
Aug 1 2023,positive,extremely well acted and beautifully filmed although it could have been 30 minutes shorter  some scenes like the security hearing dragged on still a very good movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,acting script cinematography story all magnificent  best film for me in a decade
Aug 1 2023,positive,the story was wonderfully told and the director was able to really build the tension both before the trinity test and the end of the movie so that you felt that you were part of the experience
Aug 1 2023,positive,acting superb  engrossing biopic about events that changed the world forever
Aug 1 2023,negative,sound sucked couldnt hear dialogues edited in back flashes to the point you couldnt follow the story choppy and muddled
Aug 1 2023,positive,best movie of the year christopher nolan hits it out of the park
Aug 1 2023,positive,save the time and give oppenheimer the oscar now
Aug 1 2023,positive,a little long but very good
Aug 1 2023,positive,terrifying masterpiece
Aug 1 2023,positive,very thought provoking
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was refreshing to see such an action packed historical movie and the acting was terrific
Aug 1 2023,positive,loved this movie though its very aggravating how our government turns on people who help us out  cillian murphy deserves an oscar for his performance was outstanding
Aug 1 2023,positive,very interesting story but itt was definitely about oppenheimer and not the making of the atomic bomb  some parts dragged about pacts of his life that made me uncomfortable
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was a good movie but too long
Aug 1 2023,positive,wonderful performances especially by robert downey jr it certainly showed oppenheimers terrible treatment by the government an extremely thoughtprovoking film
Aug 1 2023,positive,great road down history showing the double edge sword of the emotional burden of bombing a country and victory of winning the war coupled with the suspicions of communism and betrayal made it captivating the actress shown prolonged and openly topless in many scenes is more than tasteless and very unnecessary i would not see it again for that reason
Aug 1 2023,positive,a necessary watch for historic and entertainment purposes
Aug 1 2023,positive,overall a good movie moving back and forth between earlier and later time periods was surprisingly effective     thought there would be more focus on the development of the bomb was also surprised of the duration spent dealing with the 1950s congressional hearings    only questionable material were the multiple nude scenes that didnt add anything to the film
Aug 1 2023,negative,not the movie i expected it was more about the dismantling of his government position than the project didnt appreciate the sex scenes that added nothing to the story but made it uncomfortable sitting next to my sons
Aug 1 2023,neutral,the movie was excellent   the seats were horrible the employees at the service counter were not helpful ours was sucking ice from her cup while waiting on us the bar was broken no beer service i expected comfortable seats i need to have my legs elevated they werent
Aug 1 2023,positive,acting was superb robert downey jr  cillian murphy  and emily blunt were all equally fabulous
Aug 1 2023,positive,the dialog was amazing  there is never a dull moment
Aug 1 2023,positive,beautiful cinematography all around with a fast paced narrative and some intriguing displays of creativity near perfect storytelling that puts the weight of the situation onto the audience and serves as a grave reminder of the danger of nuclear war overall an impressive film from that surpassed my expectations and deserves to be seen in imax  recommendation bring a blanket bc after 3 hours the theatre gets pretty cold
Aug 1 2023,positive,actors and actors were superb movie kept we curious and alert even though it was 3 hours long
Aug 1 2023,positive,great performances great visuals just a great film definitely recommend it this may be nolans best

Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie but a bit hard to follow especially in the beginning
Aug 1 2023,negative,it was ok but not great definitely not imax worthy too many characters to keep track of couldve waited for it to come to streaming services

Aug 1 2023,positive,very good story a bit wordy and long at three hours
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie could of been a half hour shorter but other than that i liked it a lot
Aug 1 2023,positive,phenomenal movie especially when you see it in the 70mm imax experience please do yourself a service and watch it
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent movie well done by an outstanding cast hope to see oscar nominations
Aug 1 2023,positive,the history was enlightening  had no idea he  his fellow science community endured such maligning through political chanels  the nudity did not enhance the back story  facts in evidence are sufficient for the truth
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent movie  three 3 hours of what must be 5000 script pages and pay attention rapid fire dialogue  well done you must pay attention it is worth it
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was very fast moving quick dialogue which made you have to pay attention and the music was perfect to keep you on edge as the story moved forward 
Aug 1 2023,positive,one of the best movies ive seen in the last 10 years highly recommend it
Aug 1 2023,negative,movie fail to make  any point  i am surprised how it get over 8 rating
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent cast very interesting and telling about our history  a tad long but great to see on the big screen without any interruptions
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie was a good history lesson and some brief research into oppenheimers life and accomplishments beforehand would have helped us to follow the plot better  since it jumped around the cinematics were beautiful and acting good although i thought a few minor actors were stale despite seeing it in imax or maybe because of the high volume of the theater sound we had trouble hearing or understanding at times accents may have played a part it was interesting seeing all the young stars siblings and kids of major stars making appearances
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie unfolded in a very careful deliberate pace which gave it ample time to explore mr oppenheimers story but it also became tedious after a while i felt it could have achieved the same results with a more streamlined film
Aug 1 2023,positive,a little too much drama needlessly added
Aug 1 2023,positive,amazing actors honest portrayal and storytelling
Aug 1 2023,positive,great representations of the complexity of the man the moralethical vs security questions at play the political environment and interactions in the academicresearch space well done
Aug 1 2023,positive,absolutely great movie the acting of the cast was phenomenal all around the movie is extremely loud so keep that in mind if you have any sensitivity
Aug 1 2023,positive,its very long but i enjoy courtroom style discussion and this movie had plenty of that   action only fans could be disappointed
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie is 1 hour too long the sex scenes were completely unnecessary nearly lost my hearing in some of the final scenes why
Aug 1 2023,positive,gripping story well acted amazing direction an important piece of cinema
Aug 1 2023,positive,great cast great soundtrack
Aug 1 2023,positive,holds your attention the 3 hours goes by very quickly great plot and good acting
Aug 1 2023,positive,long but excellent  great acting
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie after all these time it is worthy to go to a movie theatre to see this historial movie it did not feel that long as it is a 3 hours long movie it is a good show produced
Aug 1 2023,positive,nolan does it again out of nolans war chest of great movies this is definitely up there ive watched many biopics and by far this is my favorite the cast is absolutely incredible there were so many great actors playing side characters that its quite funny to see cillian murphy was absolutely amazing as oppenheimer and it will definitely be one of those acting jobs where the actor is forever remembered for that one character they play    the trinity test as we all know was groundbreaking but the movie really does it justice with its dramatization you really feel the power and groundbreakingness of the test by far my favorite scene the movie keeps you on your seat and at the end of the movie you really do learn a lot about robert oppenheimer all i knew before this movie was that he was the father of the atomic bomb and this movie truly teaches you this mans life story and the hell of a life i must say he lived    overall the story was great and the movies cinematography was amazing as expected from nolan but i truly love the antiwar message that comes up during the movie especially towards the end it really is a powerful and beautiful message which resonates a lot especially with the other themes of the movie    the only problem was the relationship between strauss and oppenheimer the movie goes by way too fast and a lot of it seemed underdeveloped in my opinion i wish they did more with it although im sure most of it happens subtly and i may not have caught it other than that fantastic movie which is a mustwatch
Aug 1 2023,positive,could have edited out 30 minutes
Aug 1 2023,positive,great story beautifully portrayed
Aug 1 2023,positive,disliked the experience  unfortunately it was hard too follow bc i couldnt hear    loved the movie  i need to rent when available  and research the political side covered in the last hour  i say with a 3 a hrs 12 should be on the editing room floor  i dont think anything  scenes was too much or unnecessary but why sex in the first 1520 minutes  how did it affect the movie  more and more customers are sick and tired of the graphic sex and gratuitous horrible language
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie was great actors were perfect
Aug 1 2023,positive,beautiful movie best movie of the year from acting to visuals
Aug 1 2023,positive,one question i usually ask myself after seeing a filmwould i pay good hard earned money to see it again  in this case yesyesyes acting was superior by all the stars had to double check who played einstien  money very well spent for sure5  stars without a doubt
Aug 1 2023,positive,incredible film even for its length the movie stays interesting throughout
Aug 1 2023,positive,historical  drama but a bit too long
Aug 1 2023,positive,this is the type of movie that used to always win best picture academy award  i hope it does so this year  so many great performances and such an interesting story   three hours was a long time to sit  i wish it had an intermission 
Aug 1 2023,positive,loved the story and depiction of oppenheimers patriotic character and views on nuclear nonproliferation however he could have been portrayed as a womanizer without the unnecessary explicit nudity and sex scenes makes it difficult to share this movie for its historical significance with underage teens for r rated movies
Aug 1 2023,positive,cillian murphy was excellent
Aug 1 2023,positive,it is very deep with lots of historical events but its very personal  i feel like i need to learn more about the events after the bomb was dropped more than the actual making of the bomb  that was the story
Aug 1 2023,positive,loved the actors and their acting not so crazy about the movie although it held my interest for 3 hours a compelling story
Aug 1 2023,positive,too longplot meandered around too much between oppe and strauss disappointing because of the hype not a 5 star movie 30 minutes less nonsense and it might be a 4
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie was very good however im glad that i saw a short documentary about the movie before since for many movie goers the story could be difficult to follow because of several flashbacks throughout the story
Aug 1 2023,positive,i would have liked less politics and more science but the christopher nolan story was excellent
Aug 1 2023,positive,imax is a waste  see it in standard 70mm film projection or dolby vision  the audio at the imax screening was deafening and there was something off in the mix as the music which by the way distracting to the max overpowered the dialogue  that got better after the first hour or so but the music overall seemed forced  visually the imax seemed unnecessary as so much of the film is in closeups
Aug 1 2023,positive,a film like oppenheimer can easily be regarded as a well made film but is not for everyone rating it based on filmmaking then its a 10 and thats where i will stay personally too certainly there are things that could be changed to make it better but the decisions that were made by nolan were the correct ones narratively    the purpose of the film is not about creating the bomb but its true intentions other than being focused on oppenheimer are not truly revealed until the third act the characters and their ideals drive the plots forward in a very interesting way revealing how people especially the physicist and scientists act in this place and time fits the structure of the story to a t we dont need to know the direction that the film is going since we already know the end who oppenheimer is and how he communicates with those around him is all the audience needs for the first hour and the next hour dealing with the bomb is paid off dramatically based on our personal experience with these characters theres a lot of plot but not much story which is exactly what this film needed    by the time we get to the true meaning of the film and why its told as a drama rather than a documentary is realized in its third act its a human story that will make you question history and not so much the how of the bomb but the why the 3 hour journey is a completely original experience its an audio and visual experience that doesnt let go of its audience you will be forced to watch the movie at a high volume or with subtitles but the payoff of a loud 3 hours spent with oppenheimer is relentlessly rewarding while it may not be for everyone it is a film made perfectly for what nolan was going for and its perfect for that reason alone
Aug 1 2023,positive,a great movie that was very realistic and portrayed the a harsh reality of war and political tricks the issues wereare real and the dangers of  the atom bomb opened pandoras box on our world anyone walking out or bitching about this film is either a commie or and idiot
Aug 1 2023,positive,ive always been fascinated with oppenheimer and all of his accomplishments in the movie did not disappoint cast was terrific
Aug 1 2023,positive,sound other than dialog too loud
Aug 1 2023,positive,it is the perfect movie  the acting the writing the sound the cinematography the sad history of it all to i wish remind us just how we should not repeat it  3 hour movie and the time just flew because you are so into it  it will sweep the awards
Aug 1 2023,positive,despite the length of the movie i was never bored distracted or disinterested melding currentpast scenarios were seamless and effective detailing his story from a personal professional legal historical perspective oscar nomination at least
Aug 1 2023,positive,loved it everything was just great everything
Aug 1 2023,positive,this was well done my wife commented on the nudesex scenes as well done in proper context of adult behavior  anybody that walked out on this must have been a commie or dumb as the realistic nature of time and events was spot on its not for kids only adult only for realistic nuance of the cold harsh facts of life in that time
Aug 1 2023,negative,wasnt much more than a documentary  very hard to stay awake
Aug 1 2023,positive,this movie helped me understand more about the history and lives behind the bombs that helped end the war with japan  the only parts i thought were not really needed were the scenes with the partial nudity  overall an excellent wellmade movie the three hours passed by very fast
Aug 1 2023,positive,only its running time and nolans characteristically knotty screenwriting compromise what is a hugely powerful examination of the moral and political costs of the invention of the worlds most dreadful weapons superb photography and a clutch of excellent performances carry the film not least cillian murphys incredibly complex and vulnerable oppenheimer great casting and surely a shoein for best actor everywhere
Aug 1 2023,positive,very realistic movie the editing acting tense and drama were vast parts of this great movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,great cast superb acting excellent filming etc etc etc
Aug 1 2023,positive,this movie is brilliant start to finish
Aug 1 2023,positive,i loved this film made a special trip to see it in 70mm film format and was not disappointed the cinematography was amazing i loved the rich coloring and textured feel of the film stock that was used the story itself was told so well that it made the 3 hours move by at a great pace it interwove the personal narrative well with the historical factual narrative very well
Aug 1 2023,positive,epic story  chris nolan  is a genius
Aug 1 2023,positive,very informative well made movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent movie we absolutely thought it top notch the only complaint was the unnecessary explicit sexual content it was not needed the almost 3 hour movie went by quickly
Aug 1 2023,neutral,the story line jumped all over making it hard to know who exactly the characters were there were so many scientists who were only touched on briefly i ended the movie not really knowing which scientist was whom i literally almost walked out three times thinking if i have sit through another long monologue of men in a small room questioning oppenheimer i am done i made it through but honestly i have made better decisions
Aug 1 2023,positive,it is so refreshing to not only see a movie like this come out in the current movie landscape but it was done incredibly well this is christopher nolans best work and cillian murphy could not have done better truly a must see
Aug 1 2023,positive,the acting was suburb  cillian murphy was suburb glad we finally got to see him play a totally different role  emilly blunt and mat damon were perfect in their parts and who doesnt love robert downey jr  all of the casting members were good choices and played their parts well there were lots of details that resonated with the attitudes of that era  i especially liked the idea that oppenheimer as well as eistein had some regrets about what their discoveries would mean for mankind and the future of the world  they certainly made an impact on our lives
Aug 1 2023,positive,outstanding movie  everything about it is spot on
Aug 1 2023,positive,the performances were oscarcalbre but the film dragged the story wasnt told well and the constant underlying buzz of anxietyprovoking music became annoying within the 1st hour
Aug 1 2023,negative,too bad that we were not able to see this movie since the show was canceled by the theater at irvine spectrum   one star rating is for the theater not the movie  we will have to rebook again
Aug 1 2023,positive,could this be christopher nolans best movie everything he has done as a director was in preparation for this movie i predict this movie will be nominated for best director best picture best actor best adapted screenplay among others a classic
Aug 1 2023,negative,terrible long boring redundant unnecessary nudity
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie would have been better without the sex and nudity scenes and less of the f word especially when pushing this movie in combination with the barbie movie     i watched the msnbc documentary on oppenheimer and found it to be better than the movie at least i wasnt embarrassed watching it like i was the movie along with my 91 year old friend
Aug 1 2023,negative,this was a movie my husband wanted to see and we saw it in imax  the larger screen was not necessary as there were no scenes that required it  the movie was mostly dialogue  it was long and boring in my opinion
Aug 1 2023,positive,extremely well done
Aug 1 2023,positive,educational too long acting was outstanding
Aug 1 2023,positive,so beautiful and horrifying the acting is impeccable the story telling is top tier it felt like i held my breath for 3 hours as i sat on the edge of my seat the visual design and sound design were incredible and intoxicating this has become one of my favorite films of all time this is truly nolans masterpiece
Aug 1 2023,positive,all the characters were well played and i felt oppenheimers anguish
Aug 1 2023,positive,oppenheimer is a well made film with a very watchable cast of characters throughly enjoyed it 
Aug 1 2023,negative,the acting was extraordinary and the set was fantastic but the directors approach did not enhance the story line it was disjointed lack cohesiveness and did not focus this most important issue of war and nuclear armament this should have been 3 separate films so that oppenheimer the person and his weapon of death could have been more deeply explored
Aug 1 2023,positive,liked the indepth script and the performances particularly the cillian murphy  did not think the affair with mstatlock was needed it didnt advance the story only added to the runtime
Aug 1 2023,positive,movie was great theater needed to turn down volume by 10
Aug 1 2023,positive,this historical movie was very well done and led to many interesting conversations afterwards cant say that ive seen a movie quite like it in a long time
Aug 1 2023,positive,such a well written story with excellent pace and factual the acting was superb it could not have been better
Aug 1 2023,negative,borring not because main characters are theoretical physicists i am theoretical physicist by myself but because the scenario is horribly written and the film is poorly made i love emily blunt but this is her worst performance even matt damon is not helping this ship is sinking as film is progressing and nobody can save it what a waste of time and money
Aug 1 2023,positive,this movie is 3 hours long 3 hour tour some of those hearing and arguments could have been cut down to a few relevant quotes the acting is phenomenal  i see oscars for cillian murphy and robert downey
Aug 1 2023,positive,an important reminder of our history and lessons and parallels for the present
Aug 1 2023,positive,too long  not as good as the hype for it
Aug 1 2023,negative,did not like the directing and could not follow the dialogue
Aug 1 2023,positive,the film was beautifully segmented and while i think some of the sex scenes were unnecessary the buildup of the characters were evenly and reasonably placed
Aug 1 2023,positive,even though its a 3 hour movie it kept you engaged and interested and the time went by fast its much better than i thought it would be sequentially put together very well
Aug 1 2023,negative,very boring more action in previews
Aug 1 2023,positive,the special effects were good  the acting was good  but the way the story was told needed work  the first hour was confusing with alot of time period jumping back and forth the second hour was focused on the manhattan project and was too hyper technical and the third hour tried to resolve what the first hour teed up  the third hour was the clearest but it took too long to get there
Aug 1 2023,positive,very informative and very entertaining
Aug 1 2023,positive,too long the close ups of cillian were a bit much at the beginning  not much about the after effects of dropping the bomb or the long lasting effects on the lives of those living around the los  alamos region    it did a good job showing the politicians not really understanding what they had  truman came across as an ass  actually no one knew what they had    special effects of the trinity blast were intense
Aug 1 2023,positive,this was a well written  directed movie  the cast was sublime
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie full of suspense and intrigue
Aug 1 2023,positive,powerful movie makes you really think about what is going on in the world today
Aug 1 2023,positive,oppenheimer is long not too long just long beautifully shot loved the imagery throughout  jumps around back and forth through decades not necessarily hard to keep up just makes you want to see again again to see what you may have missed bc theres so much  oscarcontender  for sure
Aug 1 2023,positive,although it is a long movie it keeps your interest i walked out thinking wow theres a lot to unpack there
Aug 1 2023,positive,loved the movie great historical story that everyone should see acting was excellent
Aug 1 2023,negative,bored from the start not good at all dont know why they made this film
Aug 1 2023,positive,the score and visual storytelling were crazy good
Aug 1 2023,positive,it evoked very powerful emotions  a definite must see
Aug 1 2023,positive,while this may not be the movie for everybody it was excellent in my opinion another year in waiting and they could have even covered the posthumous reinstatement of his clearance
Aug 1 2023,positive,we almost always like true life stories at the movies i wasnt aware of much of the story on how that all came to be i was glad to see that some thought went into the making of the bomb and its possible consequences  we enjoyed it 
Aug 1 2023,positive,the story was interesting but it was very slow3 hours is too long
Aug 1 2023,positive,entertaining and very historically informative   superb acting and visual effects
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie has an incredible plot that makes you feel like a character
Aug 1 2023,positive,its as if one of francisco goyas black paintings soul was somehow turned into a movie a depiction of a creation so terrifying and mesmerizing that you cant look away    helped by a stellar cast it is an amalgam of visuals and sound that are able to literally control the way that your heart beats mind you this is a movie that needs to be experienced either at the cinema or with a surround sound system    in a way the music and sound mixing becomes an unofficial narrator for the movie it takes you by the hand and guides you through a beautifully haunting and at times infuriating story a story about how a man that was too brilliant for this world ultimately doomed it due to events that were out of his control in order to save his country    the movie also excels in its pacing as it feels like theres a continuous crescendo until the inevitable boom and subsequent silence thereafter there were moments where the air felt like it was on fire something that not a lot of movies can even attempt to do let alone succeed    impeccable acting impeccable writing and a reminder that the world is simply waiting for the doomsday clock to strike midnight in order for it to be able to heal from what humanity has brought to it    this is christopher nolans best movie but if existential dread is not something that you can cope with maybe skip it
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie  told me a lot of things i didnt know about oppenheimer
Aug 1 2023,positive,outstanding historical drama  will definitely go see it again after researching to learn more about some of the people involved in the project
Aug 1 2023,positive,awesome movie lots of stars super interesting
Aug 1 2023,positive,this movie was a generational story of how one man and one event can change the course of history for better and worse some of christopher nolans greatest work while remaining true to his unique style of storytelling while also experimenting to push the boundaries of what a film can become
Aug 1 2023,positive,visually stunning but not very successful at storytelling this long movie is made up of vignettes of actors making speeches the dialogue doesnt flow in a natural believable manner most of the characters are black or white and not very likable    i found it disappointing
Aug 1 2023,positive,an amazing docudrama that told the mostly unknown story about oppenheimer and his very complex life  the acting was award winning especially cillian murphy in the lead role  just a beautiful production
Aug 1 2023,positive,was very insightful and also very captivating only dislike would be rapid fire dialogue without subtitles and lots of names to keep track of
Aug 1 2023,positive,liked portrayal of the historical background rami maleks acting  disliked too much dry dialog and wordiness too little human engagement   i plan to watch it again when its streaming in case i missed important dialogue and elements of the plot that i missed
Aug 1 2023,positive,great acting and storyline a must see
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent movie loved it
Aug 1 2023,positive,one of the most accurate historical biopics ever
Aug 1 2023,positive,a very well made film the 3 hours of film were very well carried out entertaining way of telling the story
Aug 1 2023,positive,outstanding acting great cinematography wonderful score
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was a fasinating dive into the creator of the atom bomb at first it was a bit confusing with several events being protrayed but once i sorted out what events and how they were intertwined the movie became more interesting and very educational
Aug 1 2023,positive,very fine film interesting wii history
Aug 1 2023,positive,loved the details of the development of the bomb enjoyed the look at his relationship with einstein and fellow researchers  never knew he had an affair found it sad how he was treated once he changed his views about such instruments of death
Aug 1 2023,positive,oppenheimer lived up to the hype definitely a must see
Aug 1 2023,positive,cillian murphys performance was truly oscar worthy  the move would have benefitted from some tighter editing
Aug 1 2023,positive,spectacular film in every wayfrom the writing to acting to cinematography  to music to casting    spellbinding
Aug 1 2023,positive,i recommend the movie the reason i do not give it 5 stars is because it was very difficult to follow the dialogue i know the hollywood fashion is for actors to speak in muffled voices that are not audible and to drown even that out with blaring music dont they think that people go to movies to hear this one went over the top on both counts numerous other people have told me that they caught no more than 30 of the dialogue this was particularly true of the women actors as bad as the mumbling was the blaring bombastic music was particularly a dialogue destroyer in this movie the music was good but tone it down
Aug 1 2023,positive,suspenseful telling of a period of history that is not well known cillian murphy an supporting cast especially robert downey junior were stellarc
Aug 1 2023,positive,great story excellent acting
Aug 1 2023,positive,the science and politics was a part of the sign of the times back then and even now seeing the bombs drop or even the more of the surrender was quick
Aug 1 2023,positive,oppenheimer brought fourth many deep and effectively moody settings for the character analysis to occur for the complexity of the overall story and science involved in the actual retelling it was never dull or overly wordy rather it was witty and engaging so that i felt challenged to listen intently along the journey the backdrop of new mexico was especially captivating
Aug 1 2023,positive,i would give this 6 stars if i could  oppenheimer is a film for the ages with a compelling story amazing cinematography outstanding direction and a knockout ensemble cast  imax70mm is the undisputed king of movie formats  ive seen this film in every imax70certified venue in southern california  universal citywalk should be regarded as the gold standard imax theater for picture and sound
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent stars excellent directing and writing
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie might have deserved a 5star rating if wed been able to hear what they were saying more than 80 of the time unfortunately we watched it at an imax and it was so loud that in addition to distorting the sound it was loud enough to shake our seats terrible experience
Aug 1 2023,positive,the director captured the story well it was very educating and informative there were many factual things that occured and wasnt discussed in school and  history    all the actors were great and believable  hope the film and director get its recognition and oscar   well done
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie portrayed truman in a bad light the japanese were not surrendering and we had the choice of sending a huge number of soldiers or dropping the bomb at the time the public did not want to send more soldiers and a decision was made to drop the bomb that fact should have been noted
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie but too long
Aug 1 2023,positive,great history lesson
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie was very well done great acting  good history coming to light  wanted to read more about the time and situation   the theatre at amc prairie fire was terribly hot and uncomfortable for three hours
Aug 1 2023,negative,jump around between scenes to much and the background music was way to load
Aug 1 2023,positive,this was so well done very intense work it gives you a feel of the internal struggle of making a weapon of such power
Aug 1 2023,positive,such a great movie very insightful and a cinematic treasure
Aug 1 2023,neutral,i liked the history behind the movie but it was entirely too long and drawn out
Aug 1 2023,positive,epic intense great acting
Aug 1 2023,positive,likely the movie of the year  all around great film robert downy jr a shoe in for best supporting
Aug 1 2023,positive,great visuals compelling storyline and superb cast
Aug 1 2023,negative,too much communism content  nude scene really  why  who wants to see oppenheimer in the nude  tried to squeeze all biography into 3 hours   interrogation flash back was boring  should have concentrated on activity at los alamos and the science and the bomb  truman scene was boring
Aug 1 2023,negative,the story was good but way too long it could have told the story in 1 hour and 45 minutes i think and the jumping from present to past to future and back again was annoying confusing at times totally unnecessary too the story would be much better in chronological order
Aug 1 2023,positive,explained information  was not aware of also showed the corruption that has always been underlying in the power hungry politicians something i feel everyone should view i wish there had been more emphasis on the people who were affected by the test blast and what the repercussions for them moving forward looked like
Aug 1 2023,positive,to say oppenheimer is a feat in itself of filmmaking is an absolute understatement all aspects are working together fluently the score is fantastic writing acting editing all top notch has some of the best and most fascinating imagery ive ever seen on film its riveting gripping and nolan really outdid himself and so did cillian and robert couple oscars incoming and please see this in 70mm 
Aug 1 2023,negative,too long and story not well developed
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie was a bit nervous when i saw it was 3 hours but movie was fantastic great casting and really enjoyed the movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,good optics and imagery  the story line seemed a little slow at times  the implied conclusion that the atomic bomb was the main reason for the end of ww2 is not historically accurate
Aug 1 2023,positive,such a well done film will have you walking out of the cinema speechless an absolute must see movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,a very thought provoking film with some terrific performancesmr murphy is outstanding
Aug 1 2023,positive,the writing directing and acting all came together to provide a first rate movie about a complex man and his impact on history
Aug 1 2023,positive,it kept me engaged the whole time  i dont think the nude scenes were necessary  it was a good movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,all of the major themes and characters were well fleshed out beautiful music the women were full interesting characters i loved the science i loved the history the real horrors of the bombing of japan were conveyed that was a relief well done christopher nolan
Aug 1 2023,negative,thought it was too long  found it to be confusing  boring
Aug 1 2023,positive,disturbing and gratifying really brought a human face to several legendary scientists who we never think of as people with the same problems and dilemmas we all have visually stunning
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was all entertaining and i hope truthful
Aug 1 2023,positive,it has great pace and plot development
Aug 1 2023,positive,powerful story with amazing actors
Aug 1 2023,positive,the cinematography is spectacular  i found it going back and forth from one event to another in time unappealing the sexual scenes were completely unnecessary  and added nothing profound to the film  cillian murphy did a fine job of oppenheimer some scenes better than others but not capture the myriad characteristics of his personality that to me was nolans fault  robert downey was brilliant beyond belief as strauss  i feel it was a mistake not to show even if for a few minutes hiroshima and nagasaki after the bombing
Aug 1 2023,positive,well done but there was a lack of representation in the experiences or pov of the japanese people who were actually affected by the deployment of the atomic bomb
Aug 1 2023,positive,i loved it i enjoyed it much more than i thought i would i respect christopher nolan and his work he puts in so much effort to deliver big event original movies that matter hes one of the most important film makers of our time i have not been a die hard fan though some of his movies although impressive left me feeling kind of uninspired which maybe thats my fault but i go into his movies with such high hopes that i feel let down occasionally i think this is his best film by quite a lot the pace the acting the music the editing jumping back and forth in time the insane build up scene to the trinity test and then the third act of the film some people are cold on the third act not me i think this is the most fascinating part of the movie i was curious why nolan didnt name the film american prometheus that would have been such a killer title but i see why he chose oppenheimer its perfect the third act puts a bow on this epic character study an awe inspiring important timeless film about what the film may suggest the most significant man in modern history perhaps ever no clue how nolan pulled this off cannot wait to see what he and his cocreators do next
Aug 1 2023,positive,well acted excellent background on historic time younger voters need to see movie to learn about history
Aug 1 2023,positive,i appreciate the accuracy of the storyline  the presentation itself was fragmented especially for the current generation many of whom either dont know or understand how politicians manipulate what happens in our country
Aug 1 2023,positive,wish the movie had shown more about building and dropping the bomb spent too much time with the backstory of his life
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was educational eye opening  interesting  i loved every thing about the movie  would like to purchase the dvd when available to watch from home again
Aug 1 2023,positive,great writing cinematography  music just too long for my taste
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent movie quite an expose on the politics he endured post explosion of the test bomb wish more on the fallout experienced by nm residents at the time
Aug 1 2023,positive,beautiful cinematography  beautiful sound effects  breathtaking soundtracks  great acting  a masterpiece in general

Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie everything thing about it was fabulous acting sound cinematography storyline
Aug 1 2023,negative,historically somewhat accurate but movie was not as heartfelt about the many people who suffered and long term effects of the bomb especially to the numbers who lost their lives or suffered from the radiation cancer sickness loved ones dealing with loss etc i disliked the constant orchestra during dialogue
Aug 1 2023,positive,stunning visuals haunting sound engaging storyline stellar acting
Aug 1 2023,positive,cast was amazing brilliantly written loved everything about it
Aug 1 2023,positive,loved the whole story but i wished i had done some history research so it made more sense  it was too loud in some places
Aug 1 2023,positive,it seemed more like a documentary it was interesting but not very entertaining to me
Aug 1 2023,positive,i enjoyed the history of the bomb the government involvement and the twists and turns of the scientists character and the man  n government whose personal goal came into play
Aug 1 2023,positive,christopher nolan once more didnt disappoint i thought the movie stayed true to historical events and the acting from each of the cast was outstanding i recommend anyone interested in history  science see this film just be prepared to sit for awhile
Aug 1 2023,positive,i had expected more of a war movie but was pleasantly surprised the movie was entertaining but also informative i guess i should have paid attention in school great acting as well i see an oscar for robert downing jr
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie was full of moral passion and pathos excellent and a must see

Aug 1 2023,positive,a good story with good effects

Aug 1 2023,negative,too long and very boring

Aug 1 2023,positive,beautifully shot  excellent performances but ultimately a fartootalky treatise on oppenheimers security clearance woes
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie was well done the acting cinematography directing i liked that nolan focused more on the atomic bomb and oppenheimer himself rather than the war im just excited to see nonsequel or rebooted content please give us more of this

Aug 1 2023,positive,it was an amazingbrilliant movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,the casting was perfect and the movie showed the many sides of oppenheimer including the aftermath of the abomb the three hour duration passed quickly
Aug 1 2023,positive,like this type of movie  interested in the bomb creation
Aug 1 2023,positive,great multiple story lines and acting could have been 1530 minutes shorter
Aug 1 2023,negative,about 15 hours too long  same things over and over
Aug 1 2023,positive,oppenheimer may be one of the most artistic and impressive movies so far this year nolan once again shows that there is a medium of art and entertainment which kept me engaged throughout the film fantastic acting accompanied by stunning visuals and audio collections that brings history to life the film is a summary of a tremendous mans life and they did a great job covering the bases while adding a little hollywood spectacle its a marathon and it isnt easy to sit through especially coming off of a long day but the pace and content are engaging to keep your attention some issues with character balancing and pacing could have been cut down and it may not be the most entertaining escape for certain viewers but the movie is worth the praise given what it achieves in this genre
Aug 1 2023,positive,terrific movie  it was exciting educational and thought provoking
Aug 1 2023,positive,phenomenal cast and acting long movie but i didnt fidget once because it was so engrossing from start to finish
Aug 1 2023,positive,the acting was excellent should be seen twice to keep up with all the characters extremely well done
Aug 1 2023,positive,great facts about oppenheimer great cast as well just a tad too long
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie lived up to the hype we all know that the united states initiated the manhattan project and was able to defeat japan however we didnt know how difficult this task was we also didnt know that success was far from guaranteed
Aug 1 2023,positive,i think oppenheimer is one of the best movies i have ever seen acting pacing storytelling  it is masterful few movies have ever held my attention for 3 full hours the gobsmacking reality versus intellectual theory of creating an atomic bomb was so intrinsic to the intent and then reaction of the individuals  and so perfectly portrayed by cillian murphy robert downey jr matt damon and emily blunt 5 stars and then some
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent cast and story line ignited an interest in ready more about the subject
Aug 1 2023,positive,good character development some of the dialogue was hard to distinguish in that the music was too overpowering  well scripted  strong performances
Aug 1 2023,positive,too long and complicated but interesting
Aug 1 2023,positive,this movie was fantastic 100 viewing worthy   my husband even liked it
Aug 1 2023,positive,great story  a crucial period in us and world history  terrific acting  oscar worthy performances by cillian murphy and robert downey jr and wonderful acrosstheboard  beautifully directed filmed and produced  the kind of film that we need many more of  if movie theater venues are going to survive
Aug 1 2023,positive,didnt understand all the visions at the beginning of the movie didnt like story line
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was intriguing but never settled into a clear arc i was not sure what the actual drama was never got to know the guy enough
Aug 1 2023,positive,direction and production values are excellent film techniques to keep the viewer attentive during the three hours are quite successful  however it had the qualities of a quasidocumentary and the assertive charismatic qualities that have been attributed to oppie were not ever in evidence in this film murphys stance was consistently that of a martyr the directors preoccupation with the injustice done to oppenheimer seemed to overwhelm the expressiveness and humanity of the characters to give the movie more of a feel of the medieval morality play however the moral conflicts of the scientists and the horror as a consequence of the bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki were very well portrayed
Aug 1 2023,positive,it is a great and complex story and the acting is superb it is too long though and the script could have been better to make the story flow better
Aug 1 2023,positive,riveting well filmed picture the story is long but never boring a must see for science andor history buffs
Aug 1 2023,positive,stacked cast great writing and cinematography cillian murphy is fantastic
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie great acting and certainly didnt seem like 3 hours  even though i knew the story it was still jammed packed drama
Aug 1 2023,negative,too loud and too long very uncomfortable topic main character not sympathetic weird choppy editing   acting was great very intense script
Aug 1 2023,positive,learned things i didnt know about j robert oppenheimer
Aug 1 2023,positive,good acting interesting dialogues amazing story maybe casting more jewish actors to represent the events more accurately we are doing that with spanish african american other minorities but for some reason jewish actors are not represented  just a thought
Aug 1 2023,positive,i think it was a great movie  i liked all the detail that  was shown regarding the things that took place leading up to the big explosion and the aftermath
Aug 1 2023,positive,historical and excellent acting
Aug 1 2023,positive,the story was vivid and true to murphys performance and that was mentally refreshing to watch
Aug 1 2023,positive,great show if you like history and need validation of what a swamp full of swamp creatures washington dc is you will like this show its a flashback and forward format so youll u have to pay attention lol  really good
Aug 1 2023,positive,there were many aspects of this film that i felt were outstanding and topnotch   ill definitely be adding it to my collection when it becomes available  do be prepared for moments of loud sound as one may expect and some brief nudity which didnt really add  the deep dive into this mans mind and the historical depiction which by all accounts is accurate i found to be fascinating
Aug 1 2023,positive,very interesting movie  probably need to watch at least twice unless you are a history buff to understand the true timeline of events
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie is extremely powerful but i do not recommend seeing it in imax your hearing will be affected damaged also the focus of the movie is more on the obsession with communists than on the development of the nuclear weapons
Aug 1 2023,positive,the acting the writing the story
Aug 1 2023,positive,very long and drawn out
Aug 1 2023,negative,it meandered too much between the past and present  i kept trying to like it but after three hours i gave up
Aug 1 2023,positive,oppenheimer was an amazing movie it really made the viewers think about the effects of the nuclear bomb while keeping the attention almost throughout the entire movie which is impressive with almost only dialogue overall i will most likely go back to get the imax experience which i wish to experience
Aug 1 2023,positive,should have pictures of real people and what happened to them in end credits and perhaps shown the horrific effects of the bombs
Aug 1 2023,positive,the acting was phenomenal  special effects were just right and editing was impressive  all should win an oscars
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent movie it is well written and acted with a great storyline there was so much i didnt know about his life i love stories based on historical people and events i highly recommend this movie to everyone 
Aug 1 2023,positive,oppenheimers story is fascinating and the film tells it well
Aug 1 2023,positive,close to actual historical events this movie moves so quickly and seamlessly between scenes that you dont notice its overall length some great performances too
Aug 1 2023,positive,authentic story of an important event and its consequences in our country  well written well acted and well presented
Aug 1 2023,positive,a marvelously acted captivating film looking at white masculinity and its sometimes troubled relationship with the desire to explore and understand the unknown
Aug 1 2023,positive,intentionally saw in 70mm imax format wow great history and the effects were amazing favorite movie in a long long time well done
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was excellent movie it was just very long and drawn out  they could have eliminated his imaginations  we were disappointed that there was no real discussion or scene that focused on what happened in santa fe nm  also the actual process of developing the weapon was alluded to many times but was never really explained
Aug 1 2023,positive,the first hour was so boring but the rest was very good  the performances were excellent
Aug 1 2023,positive,well written great acting   sound volume felt excessive despite the artistic desire for shock value
Aug 1 2023,positive,great acting in an accurate telling of the dawn of the nuclear age and all the angst that went with it
Aug 1 2023,positive,great acting seemed true to history little too dialogue heavy
Aug 1 2023,positive,wellwritten incredible historical sets solid acting a shame they had to throw in the gratuitous sex scene it detracted
Aug 1 2023,positive,accurate and exciting view of oppenheimers science and the mccartheyism hazing later in his life
Aug 1 2023,negative,nothing special that required seeing it on the big screen it felt like something that should have aired on the history channel acting was excellent i fault the screenplay for making it boring
Aug 1 2023,positive,its not what story is being told anyone can find the historical facts of the manhattan project but how its being told this takes its place alongside greats come and see and the thin red line exploring the psychological effects of war this time showing its effects on a civilian a cinematic tour de force
Aug 1 2023,positive,nolan hit it out of the park with this one i love how he went for an aaron sorkin drama in the last hour and nailed it
Aug 1 2023,negative,comfortable seats in the theater and ample running time allowed me to catch up on my sleep this was a complete bore what am i missing here
Aug 1 2023,positive,a movie that mostly dialogue for 3 hours long and ive never been more awake
Aug 1 2023,positive,great story fantastic cast
Aug 1 2023,negative,generally i like thoughtful complex movies of a dramatic nature but we left after 1 hour this hour could have been summarized into a dramatic 10 minutes easily the main focus seemed to be on senate communist party hearings and unionization of university faculty it also bounces between multiple time periods with no particular reasoning and we had to use fashion of the period to keep it organized in our minds its needlessly lengthy and boring even for those of us into these kind of flicks
Aug 1 2023,positive,this movie was very academic most of the science above everyones head this made the dialogue tedious even though it was fast paced there was just way too much talking the actors made it good to watch with what they were dealt i found the score to be irritating it was too much of the same for three hours it would have been a great story but missed the mark
Aug 1 2023,positive,great film chris nolan does it again
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was incredible from start to finish it impacted me physically as well as emotionally  will be hard to match the imax experience
Aug 1 2023,positive,it took too long to deliver the challenge oppenheimer was experiencing morally it was not clear the second halfwas far superior to the first
Aug 1 2023,negative,too documentary and definitely too long
Aug 1 2023,negative,the movie theater didnt give us warning the imax wasnt working a lot of people were upset they only said its imax and not the theater s problem at least email the people that theres a problem we had to drive far for this
Aug 1 2023,positive,im not a huge christopher nolan fan i find a lot of his work to be too long supercilious and confusing i like to be able to follow the story and the plot so that the narrative unfolds in such a way that i dont have to say wait can we rewind that scene ive had to do that in several of nolans films inception was probably the worst offender i wrote this the day after i saw the movie    inception was a blessedly short film for me since during it i entered a dream state deep rem naps several times these refreshing sleeps populated with dreams far more interesting than anything in the film i am always naked and running through huge crowds were made possible because i was in a recliner stadium chair allowing me to stretch out thus the film was more like a trailer than a full blown theatrical feature and as far as i can tell i missed nothing nor did the story make any more sense since lets be clear it made no sense at all for those who stayed awake anybody claiming otherwise is an idiot or afraid to admit that they had no idea whatsoever what the movie was about    i dont feel that way about oppenheimer for two acts right up until the bomb goes off not a vfx shot for the film purist nolan the writerdirector had to stick to the conventions of a biopic ie tell us about this mans life in chronological order in this respect it is a magnificent piece of work beautifully shot in 70mm film splendid production and costume design with bravura historically acccurate performances from the ensemble    act 3 is a little perplexing because it is so dense with political intrigue that i wanted to revisit certain scenes to keep things understandable its also too long after the bomb goes off everything that follows is somewhat anticlimactic but again the exceptional acting and the mise en scene makes the length of the act forgivable its clear that nolan loves the content and the era his fascination with the period the story and our flawed hero is infectious    so without question this is the best most cerebral and most engaging film amidst a slew of cinematic flotsam that pass as entertainment these days btw i saw the film on a standard screen with standard audio if i see it again it will be in an imax theater nolan is one of the few remaining film traditionalists so i will respect that commitment and see the film the next time in a manner consistent with the way he shot it
Aug 1 2023,positive,great history something everyone should know
Aug 1 2023,positive,nothing was shown about the people displaced by the bomb in los alamos
Aug 1 2023,positive,incredible history lesson  beautifully crafted story and powerful message
Aug 1 2023,positive,want to watch it again i never want that very rate for me
Aug 1 2023,positive,my husband and i saw this movie we liked it a lot so much information you needed to listen very closely to follow we recommend seeing it
Aug 1 2023,positive,we both really enjoyed the movie  but unfortunately the dialog seemed to be mixed down quite a bit of the time hard to understand what was said  i noticed several other patrons actually sitting forward to try to hear  other than that  the soundtrack was wonderful  as was the movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,saw it in imax  definitely recommend
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie and performances but the first hour drug on a little
Aug 1 2023,positive,a great storytelling experience of a true event the impact of nolans choices struck in my opinion 3 hours is a little long for a movie like this especially when it feels like the buildup is the dropping of the bombs but then theres like an hour or so after that of his story and impacts on his life the film doesnt dwell heavily on the lives lost and repercussions for society which i was glad for  theres other and better ways to learn about that stuff in my opinion i do think the sex scenes were a bit thrown in just because they could with the rating there was one scene where it was impactful but the character felt used for the nudity and not very impactful on the story  but again its a true story so its not like it was based on nothing its a shame because i think it could have been used as an educational movie to show in school without those scenes
Aug 1 2023,positive,the acting is superb and the story very interesting  robert downey jr shows us how great of an actor he is
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was hard to follow
Aug 1 2023,positive,the oscar for best actor is already assured for cillian murphy  he has no competition as this performance is simply sublime  as for christopher nolan i am sure there must be another oscar in the bag also maybe best picture or best director     this is a mustsee movie as it is a significant piece of movie making  nolan might be the stanley kubrick of his generation
Aug 1 2023,positive,too many previews movie should start on time not 20 minutes late
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent story acting history and settings
Aug 1 2023,neutral,it was too long we took senior citizens that really did not enjoy the length of the movie even i fell asleep
Aug 1 2023,positive,one of the best films ive seen in my life nolan did amazing on this one and its one of if not his best movie its definitely one of the best biopics ive ever seen its up there with movies like shindlers list storytelling wise and gives off a similar feeling with the lighting and the music the only thing i would suggest is not having those sx scenes because i found them slightly unnecessary and it would have appealed to a larger audience if they did remove it
Aug 1 2023,positive,8123    the film was incredible the performances were stellar  and oscars will be awarded  plus chris nolan is a genius     however the film was tooooooooooooooooo long     and tooooooooooooooo loud
Aug 1 2023,positive,well acted and interesting but slow
Aug 1 2023,positive,great move sex scenes could have been either eliminated or done with less skin
Aug 1 2023,positive,i liked all of the history represented in the movie
Aug 1 2023,negative,quite possibly the most overhyped movie of all time the first hour was moderately ok but the last two hours was like hoping to watch the best boxing match of all time but instead watching cspan boring movie about an interesting topic
Aug 1 2023,positive,interesting realistic good look at behind the scenes activities during the development of the bomb   i learned a lot about oppenheimer and how he was treated    i thought was well done    it is a long movie i thought some story lines could have been developed in a shorter time frame  i enjoyed the movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie exploring historical events with overlay of ethical tangles loved it  impressive accomplishment by nolan and the actors
Aug 1 2023,negative,i was totally lost dialogue was hard to understand longest 3 hours of my life
Aug 1 2023,negative,the movie was toooo longgggg it was 3 hours and could have been told in 2 hours we went with a large group and everyone thought it was not worth watching save your money and wait till you can stream for free
Aug 1 2023,positive,i liked learning the history of oppenheimer and the project to make the atomic bomb i did not like how long the movie was there were characters and situations they added that made it very long that i did not think were important to get the message across
Aug 1 2023,positive,just watched it and it was great maybe a little too long but it was an interesting movie that was made by nolan the cast was great cillian murphy did a great job as oppenheimer and robert downey jr was great and florence and matt and the every other actor in this many cameos of actors in this that surprised me
Aug 1 2023,positive,fabulous piece of history that many may not be aware of the politics the societal implications the emotional strain
Aug 1 2023,positive,absolutely magnificent  totally captivating  superb acting and a riveting plot will keep you completely engaged and fascinated from beginning to end
Aug 1 2023,positive,it is a 3 hour movie but it does not seem like it  excellent pacing along with a lot of material to cover
Aug 1 2023,positive,great story and actors very engaging and informative
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent acting and movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,the viewer who expects a variation of fat man and little boy will be disappointed   the bomb is only a supporting actor in this political drama and exploration  into the psychoanalysis of a troubled genius  most of the film is consumed with events in the mccarthy era 50s with oppenheimer dealing with national security apparatus  the history story is told through flashbacks
Aug 1 2023,negative,could not understand one third of the dialogue some of the sound effects which had nothing to do with the bomb were louder than the bomb effect could have been the theaters sound system but whatever it was it made the whole experience even more unpleasant than the theater seats damon and downey were both great and completely understandable some of the other actors actresses studied at the mumble method school of acting
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was just a little to long  enjoyed all of the information
Aug 1 2023,positive,i thought the movie gave great insight to oppenheimer himself and sums of the players involved    what i didnt like was the theater that had the volume way to loud this was an imax theater so they should have had it set properly
Aug 1 2023,positive,not a lot of action and a lot of talking involved for a 3 hour film  movie was the bomb however
Aug 1 2023,positive,great film loaded with fantastic actorsactresses  this movie is one of the best new films ive seen in many years  so good in fact that for the first time in my life my wife and i went twice and cannot wait until the bluray release scheduled for this november and we may go to see it again before that release the interaction between the principles and the set design are amazing  cillian murphy for best actor robert downy jr for supporting actor and emily blunt for best actress best movie and best director  this film takes you inside the entire world as it was for oppenheimer at the time and is truly an amazing film to watch christopher nolan is genius
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent movie with really good actors
Aug 1 2023,positive,terrific performances particularly by robert downey and cillian murphy stayed true to the facts could have been a wee bit shorter though
Aug 1 2023,positive,powerful movie based on history special effects were fantastic actors were excellent
Aug 1 2023,positive,the casting of this movie was well donewith plenty of action
Aug 1 2023,positive,kept my interest for the full 3 hours
Aug 1 2023,positive,christopher nolans masterpiece bring on the oscars
Aug 1 2023,positive,fascinating telling of a real story would have liked some insight into oppenheimers management techniques
Aug 1 2023,positive,engrossing story  well acted
Aug 1 2023,positive,i had difficulty hearing  understanding the dialogue throughout anyone who had an accent especially
Aug 1 2023,positive,operatic epic in scope and marvelously done with a starstudded cast big enough to play largerthanlife figures but sensitive enough to disappear into their roles the sound design is masterful it gets incredibly loud at times but that only serves to highlight the huge range of dynamics and the eloquent silences scattered throughout
Aug 1 2023,positive,good film overall but just about 30 minutes too long in my opinion
Aug 1 2023,negative,meh perhaps the most overratedoverhyped movie of the year next to barbie of course entire 3 hours felt like expositioni literally cant recall a single moment of subtext in the entire filmjust a vomit of endless words on the screen with each character spelling out exactly what they were saying feeling and thinking for exactly 180 minutes there was maybe a few moments of actual nondialogue but so much jumpcutting and editingit all felt hastily thrown together jumping from one scene and point in time year month or daynot counting the obvious black and white flashbacks to the next edited like a giant real of endless linear film that must have been 80 hours like they were trying to squeeze in every conceivable word of dialog they could without any thought to what was actually needed some shots were even poorly edited for continuity you could spot differences in actors gestures or faces from camera angles that were clearly from different shots continuity that even most sitcoms do a better job of concealing during the editing process    if you want to see a good examples of how to compile huge amounts of exposition history and fiction inspired by true events in a much more entertaining and thoughtprovoking fashion go watch oliver stones jfk which weaves through hundreds of points in time positions and perspectives masterfully    honestly i have no desire to ever watch this movie again terribly boring uninspiring and not thoughtprovoking save for the singular wellanticipated special effect big wow moment of test detonation shortly followed by a complete glossing over the actual event itself plus the second nagasaki bombing mentioned only 1 time in passing as if it were a throwaway line which still left an hour or more to go in the film afterwards you could see people looking at their watches wondering where the rest of the movie was going the answer is nowhere
Aug 1 2023,positive,loved the movie and all the actors only comment is it is a little too long
Aug 1 2023,positive,great story with superb acting
Aug 1 2023,positive,really helped me understand the conflict that these scientists were facing and how horribly dr oppenheimer was treated by the united states
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie was very good and i enjoyed it but had higher expectations due to all the hype
Aug 1 2023,positive,the film provided an historical account of the creation of the atomic bomb and humanized oppenheimer who was clearly a flawed and brilliant man
Aug 1 2023,positive,great acting informative history
Aug 1 2023,positive,movie was fantastic however one complaint everyone came out with that while the music was great and certainly added to the movie it more often than not got in the way of the dialogue which made it very difficult to understand what the actors were saying you found yourself trying to follow the plot by piecing the scenes together in order to follow along
Aug 1 2023,positive,spectacular and did not feel like it was 3 hours long the cast writingeverything was superb i will see again in the theater and purchase when it becomes available
Aug 1 2023,positive,christopher nolan couldve easily cut at least an hour he also committed what i think is a cardinal sin half the time like forever i  didnt know who the characters werewhere they were or what they were doing there that distracted me from the storyline and enjoyment of what couldve been one of the best movies ever on a positive note robert downey junior stole the show
Aug 1 2023,positive,i wear hearing aids the german dialect was hard to understand could be my fault historical accuracy was good  the man who played oppenheimer deserves an oscar
Aug 1 2023,positive,somewhat drawn out
Aug 1 2023,positive,great character development 3 hour movie with no low or slow parts kept the audience engaged the whole time
Aug 1 2023,positive,the story structure and visual style of the film including the use of black and white is very cool  the soundtrack is beautiful and nicely supports the narrative  the cast is great oppenheimer neatly imparts the mood of the time  and captures timeless aspects of essential inherent conflicts between science technology war and politics its a film for all seasons
Aug 1 2023,positive,fascinating story hearings scenes hard to follow and too long
Aug 1 2023,positive,insane sound and image quality  this movie is in my top 3 for sure  great job 
Aug 1 2023,positive,well made and perfect acting just so real not a dull moment  and very educational
Aug 1 2023,positive,watching it again and i never watch a film again in the theaters
Aug 1 2023,positive,incredibly thought provoking  movie that largely adhered to 1981 oppenheimer documentary with original sources  outstanding acting by every cast member  particularly timely ethical and moral theme applies to current issues about ai  among many themes in the movie  just because it can be done does not mean it should be done thorny issues regarding greater good decisionmaking and moral reasoning insight into political and cultural recurring trends and processes the heros journey joseph campbell recognition of disconfirmation bias as a powerful human behavior the context of division of beliefs among political and military leaders about how to break the will of a people with either precision bombing of industrial choke points vs carpet bombing of civilian population both of which were done in europe and japan and the eventual supremacy of truman and lemay still being played out in ukraine the lost opportunity to have empowered the un the question who was the audience for hiroshima and nagasaki  japan or russia  and the context of antisemitism both in germany and among the allies and in the us  this movie goes on and on it left me weepy and unable to move until the credits were over  one of the greatest movies of all time in my experience
Aug 1 2023,positive,outstanding performances cast wide the best movie i have seen in two years
Aug 1 2023,positive,oppenheimer and sound of freedom are the best movies that i have seen this year both movies are very sobering impactful and provide food for thought about extremely important topics oppenheimer is a must see with excellent acting and held my attention for 3 hours go see oppenheimer and go see sound of freedom i promise that you will not be the same afterward
Aug 1 2023,positive,great story on the history of oppenheimer career   not worthy of all the imax hype it was just as good at a regular theater  the detonation of the trinity bomb was not spectacular look like a big explosion not atomic at all from history pictures   i think they screwed up and should had cgi the explosion   a little long but worth watching i expect to see some oscar nods here
Aug 1 2023,negative,movie got off to a slow start was too long  drawn out unnecessary scenes could have been much shorter  to the point did not care for the movie at all
Aug 1 2023,positive,a must see amazing performances by all  the cinematography was exceptional for 3 hours i did not move in my seat i learned a bit more history regarding oppenheimer do not wait for this to stream also i have never been to a sold out performance where the audience did not make a sound it was mesmerizing
Aug 1 2023,positive,spectacular movie three hours of film that you dont feel pass  rdj was fantastic  this was the movie of the year
Aug 1 2023,positive,a film that stays true to its title and chooses to focus on the father of the atomic bomb rather than the bomb itself while some may not like this approach its a stylistic choice that pays off and allows the audience to truly feel the weight of what was created and the price to pay for living in a world where politics always seems to be 1
Aug 1 2023,positive,way too many fabulous performances to pick an oscar winner  we didnt believe we had sat in our seats without moving for three hours  maybe several oscars including c nolan now that i think of it  absolutely mesmerizing
Aug 1 2023,positive,tremendous actors in a tremendous story one which change the history for the entire world i was a little disappointed they didnt discuss some of the indigenous people who are downwind but they probably just didnt have time in the film
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie was overall good however the fact that it jumped around between the present 1930s40s and the future his investigation and the senate hearings made it difficult to follow moreover the movie could have probably been completed in 2 hours vs 3 after hour 2 it just felt like it was dragging on     i would not say it is nolans best  thats reserved for the dark knight or interstellar
Aug 1 2023,positive,riveting movie from start to finish  the 3 hours flew by amazing actors filming  just every aspect one of the best films i have ever seen
Aug 1 2023,positive,even thought the movie follows history and we already know the story christopher nolan did a spectacular job in adding suspense to the movie his story telling is so elegant that he makes you feel like you are a spectator during that time experiencing history being made
Aug 1 2023,positive,great moviedid not feel like i was there for 3 hours
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was well done but a little to long

Aug 1 2023,positive,enjoyed everything about the film
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie  did not feel like three hours at all  moved along very nicely  intriguing story about not only the development of the atom bomb but also the scientists and politicians involved
Aug 1 2023,positive,the storyline was accurate the acting was good and overall a great movie in spite of its length the story could not be told as well in a shorter movie and i would see it again theater was great with comfortable seats contributing to an enjoyable long film
Aug 1 2023,positive,this is an incredible film told in a way that some may find  as three interwoven stories play out parts in blackandwhite and not in chronological order the score is incredibly dynamic and for me at least sometimes too loud and too present i saw it in an imax theater though not the most modern one i saw another movie in the same theater a few months ago and had the same complaint which is that the loud parts were far too loud in fact painful to my ear having said that however nolan has produced an incredible feast for the eyes and a story that goes deep for some perhaps too deep
Aug 1 2023,positive,great view into the life of oppie suporting cast we outstanding
Aug 1 2023,positive,riveting storyline excellent acting superb direction fabulous cinematography
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie was very cleverly done  three hours went by quick as they captured my attention the whole time  highly recommend
Aug 1 2023,positive,pacing at times was not great  took 3 hours to tell a 15 hour story
Aug 1 2023,negative,very disjointed nonlinear movie  it jumped forward and backward in time so many times i was getting whiplash the sound was awful they couldnt have 2 minutes of dialog without covering it with a loud blast of music  they love explosions  not just the bomb  but at many other places such as when oppenheimer was contemplating the cosmos  i wanted to see more about the work of the scientists but the movie was totally focused on oppenheimers life his loves and his political problems
Aug 1 2023,positive,detailed story great acting

Aug 1 2023,positive,too long a bit confusing at times but also very interesting robert downey jr did a hell of a great job
Aug 1 2023,positive,tremendous movie little longer than id have liked
Aug 1 2023,positive,very informative from what i already knew

Aug 1 2023,positive,pleasantly surprised at how much i enjoyed this movie  the movie was so well done and paced that the 3 hour length went by quickly  learned a lot about the history of dr oppenheimer and the manhattan project  acting was superb  highly recommend
Aug 1 2023,positive,i thought the movie was quite good i have been interested in technical devlopements of wwii for a long time and the movie tracked very well there was one glaring goof when they were counting down to the detionation they used a nixietube clock these did not exist at the time wish they spent a bit more time on the theory of the bomb process
Aug 1 2023,positive,just a bit heavy for me
Aug 1 2023,positive,too much political hearings  needed more about life at los alamos
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent and very intense movie may have been about 30 minutes too long but would highly recommend this is an adult movie dealing with a critical time in our country still relevant today
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was a cinematic experience and masterpiece when the boom blew that moment was so jaw dropping a visually stunning
Aug 1 2023,positive,oppenheimer was sensational it showed mans fraility with compassion and intellect while also showing the sad underbelly world of government and dog eat dog politics   cillian murphy  was remarkable at demonstrating his euphoria at accomplishing the practicality of the applied science yet the let down when the scientists were immediately discarded and the military industrial complex took over  the pride of accomplishment and the shame were felt side by side  it was magnificent at showing all this in a short three hours  i mean that  3 hours felt like nothing  no one even left the theater for the toilet  it was so riveting   every adult should see this
Aug 1 2023,positive,a gripping masterpiece from start to finish
Aug 1 2023,positive,was an excellent movie  good pace and great axtion
Aug 1 2023,positive,i just saw oppenheimer    wow    just wow     incredible piece of cinema not a movie not even a film pure cinema    a beautiful and stunning cinematic experience and masterpiece    christopher nolan should never make another movie again because he will never come close to this cinematic masterpiece this should be his signature    its loud its intense it takes moments of discussion about theoretical physics and makes them riveting    and robert downy jr is remarkable every scene with him is a something truly special and intense     and cillian murphy doesnt just portray j  robert oppenheimer he shows us what oppenheimer felt in the aftermath its stunning and beautiful and horrifying all at once     this is nolans schindlers list a true masterpiece expertly crafted and executed and wholly engrossing     bring earplugs
Aug 1 2023,positive,thought the movie was excellent but perhaps a little longer than it needed to be   did wish the end had said that  president lyndon johnson honored oppenheimer after his security clearance had been revoked and that us secretary of energy jennifer granholm ordered that the 1954 decision to revoke his security clearance be vacated  it left you wondering what happened to oppenheimer   otherwise it was an excellent movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,the acting was superb and the story very riveting and intense  even at 3 hours the movie flowed well and held our attention throughout
Aug 1 2023,positive,very informative and done in very entertaining wayfull of suspense
Aug 1 2023,positive,thought the acting was incredible even the bit parts were very well acted also liked the way there were three storylines loved the story also loved the cinematography    thought it could have been 30 minutes shorter didnt like the gratuitous sex scenes they didnt add anything hated the sound track it was waaaay too loud and distracted from the movie some of the dialogue was hard to hear because of the sound track and it wasnt music it was just noise
Aug 1 2023,positive,a surprising drama that will make you think
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie  superb acting   so much story than just making a big bomb  his was a complicated life   ill go see it again
Aug 1 2023,positive,quality of acting and cinematography was great the sound level in the imax theatre was so loud i thought my ears would bleed the music in the film was sometimes too loud to hear the dialogue
Aug 1 2023,positive,nice piece of history
Aug 1 2023,positive,i soooo wanted to give this movie 5 stars but i cannot for the following reasons the main being the editing in a traditional documentary include all of the nitty gritty details but in cinema we dont want to do this because the run time will be way too long and will take away from the movie experience so many little things could have been edited away and we could have been left with not only an amazing movie but the story arch would still be intact another reason i had to take away a star was the nudity that completely had no place we are all adults we know when there is sex involved in a relationship without having to see every areola why there was no point it didnt add to the experience and in fact it took away from it because in a movie theatre there is no one in their right mind who feels comfortable watching those scenes with strangers or even friends and family less people will go to see this film because of the nudity while others will only see it for that reason but that it for another discussion in all this film could have been the best film of the year if it had just been reigned in in the final cut
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was great history though sadly needed to save many more lives than were lost  told in an engaging way with terrific cinematography
Aug 1 2023,positive,saw oppenheimer in 70mm imax one of the best film experiences of my life total immersion amazing sound great film from christopher nolan
Aug 1 2023,positive,interesting story but a 3 hour movie is hard to sit through
Aug 1 2023,positive,the story was surprisingly accurate to the real history of j  including his infidelity betrayal ego
Aug 1 2023,positive,in this day  age of fantasy  make believe action and adventure and horror and super hero movies there still is room for compelling if not almost shock8ng fact based movies which are rooted in history  actual events  it is said that if we are to better our future we must learn from our past  everyone needs to see this movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,we loved this movie definitely worth seeing on the big screen it was visually stimulating and the acting was spot on
Aug 1 2023,positive,what an experience the performances the visuals the sound the topic everything was epic what a joy to see in the theater
Aug 1 2023,positive,good movie if you are not familiar with the history or wwii era physics it might be helpful to get a surface level knowledge  i think you will enjoyunderstand the movie better great time piece
Aug 1 2023,positive,lived up to the expectations
Aug 1 2023,negative,far too long and unless you are familiar with all the events and people involved its beyond confusing  see it at home when you can digest it in small chunks and get familiar with whats going on  good acting and cinematography
Aug 1 2023,positive,loved everything about this movie chris nolan has done it again
Aug 1 2023,positive,as a study in character it was illuminating to see the depths of oppenheimers heart and mind  as an historical piece we all know what he achieved just not how he did it and why  it will likely earn golden globe and oscar consideration
Aug 1 2023,positive,way to long like sitting through gone with the wind but no intermission great story and acting but expect a marathon
Aug 1 2023,positive,a bit longer than needed but amazing
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie visually great performances
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent  lots of history  will see it again
Aug 1 2023,positive,it had great character development but was too long of a movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,good acting and story but a bit to long
Aug 1 2023,positive,wasnt what we thought it would be  a great character portrayal with historical relevancy and subplots very unexpected  great cast thought provoking backstories real life historical figures with generational references new audiences might not understand  cillian murphy is excellent  robert downey jr awesome in his role as revenge seeking politician  whole cast is superb  backgrounds in new mexico and los alamos very realistic made we want to read the book for more depth  the whole barbieheimer marketing was totally ridiculous since neither audience would ever want to see the other movie in one setting free concessions or not unless avoiding the extreme heat and needing a reason to stay in the ac
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent movie christopher nolan completely blows you away
Aug 1 2023,positive,long movie but exceptional production values and casting will be up for many awards
Aug 1 2023,positive,good movie unfortunately i cant recommend it to others because of the gratuitous nudity i get the idea of it but it certainly wasnt necessary  especially to this extent and cuts out most watchers who need to see it
Aug 1 2023,positive,terrific cast excellent screenplay and outstanding production
Aug 1 2023,positive,amazing story with classic nolan presentation hard to imagine it was 3 hours long
Aug 1 2023,positive,great story great acting
Aug 1 2023,positive,this was one of the best films ive seen in a very long time the acting was superb the costumes authentic the storyline spot on even the music was not distracting it was the shortest three hour movie ive ever seen riveting
Aug 1 2023,positive,absolutely fabulous film cillian murphy should get oscar as best actor and matt damon and robert downey jr should be nominated for best support actor movie should win best picture
Aug 1 2023,neutral,imagine is awful noice level is just below 80 decibels the danger level speakers are not designed for speech so loud but dialogue is not clear
Aug 1 2023,positive,left out too many details about the literal fallout from the tests in nm the actual impact of the exposure of radioactive fallout on us residents i found it focused too much on the technical and not enough on the inner turmoil endured by oppenheimer as a human in my view it was more spectacle than personal visually stunning of course but after all of the hype it left me flat
Aug 1 2023,positive,very engaging movie although too long and had some factual inaccuracies
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie learned a lot
Aug 1 2023,negative,how could watching paint drying have competition  it was long somewhat confusing the sex stuff was totally gratuitous and unnecessary   we spent the money to watch it in imax only to find the bomb scene silent and lame   unsure how so many people liked this
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie if you like history and great story telling and cinema effects no cgi then this is it
Aug 1 2023,positive,too long and too convoluted
Aug 1 2023,positive,amazing from the first scene  it was helpful to know a bit about oppenheimer himself  it would also have been helpful to know years  amazing cast
Aug 1 2023,positive,this generations citizen kane
Aug 1 2023,positive,definite best picture candidate highly recommended there is some graphic nudity and sex which i was not expecting it does fit with the story  which is i think fair in its portrayal of oppenheimer and the times he lived in  but just as a warning to others robert downey jr is amazing as is cillian murphy matt damon emily blunt the entire cast really
Aug 1 2023,positive,experiencing in theaters is a must
Aug 1 2023,positive,fascinating history some of which i was unaware of  incredibly impactful film that most of us will not soon forget
Aug 1 2023,positive,i really enjoyed the movie however i think it is a little overhyped i definitely will be watching it a second time to further gather my thoughts i loved the first two acts of the movie and the ending so good but the third act is where the movie sort of lost me i understand the themes that were being presented in the third act but it wasnt as engaging and didnt keep my interest like the first two acts did if the third act was on par with the first two acts for me this would have been my favorite film of the year unfortunately that wasnt the case for me its a thumbs up but not a double thumbs up
Aug 1 2023,negative,too long and deep for me
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent  i did not know much about this story and it cleared up much for me  the story was riveting  well told and well acted
Aug 1 2023,positive,a riveting step back in history to a moment that was the stepping stone to planets arms race terrific acting and a story line that kept you interested throughout the movie definite must see
Aug 1 2023,positive,the storyline and acting were amazing its a must see
Aug 1 2023,negative,boring after first hour big disappointment    2 
Aug 1 2023,negative,it was too long and the hour in the middle was boring too drawn out
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent movie just a little bit too long
Aug 1 2023,negative,audio was terrible  couldnt understand the dialogue too loud
Aug 1 2023,positive,not lifechanging like some early reviews seemed to purport but maybe because i knew way too much about this time in americas history already great performances sound design editing etc see it in 70mm
Aug 1 2023,positive,this is such a powerful movie its long by todays standard but i was riveted and the story never lagged so that shorter wouldnt have done the story justice    since oppenheimer was stripped of his clearance not long before i was born i had heard of him and his leadership of the manhattan project but never really knew a lot about him so many of the physicists with whom he interacted were names from my physics books
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie was great and historical informative
Aug 1 2023,positive,i loved the movie  fantastic performances by the cast  the movie is long but very detailed   it appears to be less about the building of the bomb and more about the life of oppenheimer and how he went from a national hero to a national target for anticommunists  this movie needs to be seen on a large screen
Aug 1 2023,negative,way too long technical and to much emphasis  on politics boring acting great best part  of movie emily blount and matt damon robert downy jr worst not enough screen time for all these great actors
Aug 1 2023,positive,great cinematography and actors will keep you interested the entire time
Aug 1 2023,positive,movie was very good the first hour was dull but the rest was very good in my opinion i think movie would have done much better if they took 35 minutes off the movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,shave off 2025 minutes or add an intermissionwhich would be cool to do for a bunch of movies to enhance the theater experience
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie was really good it revived all of my knowledge about world war 2 and my favorite scenes were the final testing of the atomic bomb and the sex scenes however the movie got a little boring with the political scenes
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie well worth it
Aug 1 2023,positive,historical understanding new insights intensity
Aug 1 2023,positive,sound affects were too loud  annoying  movie was too long
Aug 1 2023,positive,we couldnt understand what the actors were saying for the first 45 minutes we had to fill in what we thought they were saying after that the words were clear so we thoroughly enjoyed the rest of the movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie good story well acted great direction
Aug 1 2023,positive,beautiful movie a bit long but very good
Aug 1 2023,positive,too long some characters spoke too low compared to the sound so a lot of the dialogue was missed     so many characters that i couldnt keep track f their names oppenheimer would talk about someone but i had no idea who hed be referring to     would have been better at home with subtitles and the ability to pause halfway through
Aug 1 2023,positive,liked it very much very interesting but a little slow at times very enlightening on what our own government will do to its own if he add invented such a thing in this age hed be a billionaire
Aug 1 2023,positive,i liked the fact that nolan portrayed those who thought the bomb was a bad idea as well as those gung ho scientists that wanted to jump right in  i understand a little bit more the terrible debate these scientists had and some of the guilt they may have felt afterwards
Aug 1 2023,positive,very informative and seemed true to the primary character the covert behavior of military and daily life of that era the attention to detail was astonishing the clothes of each character which were representative of their hierarchy in their various businesses the vintage cars and the home decor were spot on  there was difficulty in some of the rapid speech  terminology used to describe the science  technology of the mission closed captioning would have been a great help will probably watch it again at home with the cc turned on
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie from top to bottom 1010   i am a history nerd so i really enjoyed it
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was quite disturbing in regards to everything that goes on with the govts it did not paint a pretty picture of the future  for our grandchildren
Aug 1 2023,positive,cillian murphy was excellent oscarworthy film
Aug 1 2023,positive,i was afraid i couldnt sit for an entire 3 hr moviebut it ended and i couldnt believe 3 hrs had gone by  the acting was good and the special effects just enough
Aug 1 2023,negative,i didnt like it the way i thought its very confusing and fast sometimes you dont know in which moment of time you are because it takes place in three different stages also there are many names of characters that you lose track of it is difficult to know which one they are talking about i expected something different i only liked the linear part when they are building and testing the bomb
Aug 1 2023,positive,one of the best films i have seen in a long time you are so captivated by the show you dont even realize it is 3 hours long
Aug 1 2023,positive,generally i am not a fan of 3hour long films but oppenheimer was paced perfectly the story was welltold and built up as it ought to be cillian murphy personified j robert oppenheimer
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie in every way
Aug 1 2023,positive,never looked at my watchcinematography acting storyfantastic what a cast
Aug 1 2023,positive,imax was excellent   the movie tells you the stories you didnt learn about in school
Aug 1 2023,negative,pretentious confusing too long
Aug 1 2023,positive,liked historical aspect and how cold war started
Aug 1 2023,positive,like good narrative of the career thoughts and feelings of the main character as as the complexities of the manhattan project   dislike too long sometimes it was difficult to hear what he was saying
Aug 1 2023,positive,loved this movie  shame how they tried to railroad him
Aug 1 2023,positive,a story about an amoral science goat who developed a conscious while weaponizing physics that lead to dropping the little boy and fat man in japan kinda cringy watching a sex scene with 300 other people
Aug 1 2023,positive,the best movie i have seen in many years mind boggling star studded but you can hardly tell multiple story lines that are all addressed this is a must see i need to see it again as it is complex
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie was well acted and one of the best i have ever seen it dealt with all of the things that were hidden from public view and illustrated how government manipulated both people and the narrative that was provided to citizens it took the audience back in time and yet showed the parallel of events and actions still going on today it is frightening to know how much is being withheld to cover up the crimes that both elected officials and government employees are committing the weaponization of government agencies being used against those who disagree or who threaten to expose these crimes is no different today than it was during the days of oppenheimer antisemitism is on the rise and our new enemy is china i hope people watch this as well as the sound of freedom
Aug 1 2023,positive,i loved that the movie  was historically fairly accurate the acting was superb the only thing that it did not have was an intermission which i deem necessary for a 3 plus hour movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,absolutely worth the 3 hours
Aug 1 2023,positive,interesting fact based movie with a view into the atomic bomb and the questions it presented
Aug 1 2023,positive,nolan knocked it out of the park yet again
Aug 1 2023,positive,a masterpiece of historical and biographical storytelling the cast the scenery the photography the directing all superb it is a mustsee especially in imax
Aug 1 2023,positive,liked learning more about the history involved with the development of the abomb great acting and variety of actors didnt seem like a 3 hr movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,magnificent and thought provoking   only aspect that i did not like was the sound mixing because it drowned out the dialogue  on a separate note was disappointed that the fall out from communities was not referenced at any point
Aug 1 2023,positive,actually this wasnt my type of movie i just went with my husband  however it was a good movie  at first it moved slowly but i kept watching and enjoyed the backstory about how oppenheimer initially struggled and the complexities surrounding his personal life
Aug 1 2023,positive,oppenheimer the latest offering from the visionary director christopher nolan is a compelling biographical drama that takes viewers on a journey through the life of the esteemed physicist j robert oppenheimer with a strong focus on historical accuracy and stunning visuals the film offers a captivating cinematic experience that will undoubtedly resonate with enthusiasts of scientific history    nolans storytelling prowess shines brightly in oppenheimer the narrative skillfully explores oppenheimers scientific achievements while delving into the profound ethical dilemmas that surrounded his groundbreaking work the directors masterful touch elevates the film delivering a thoughtprovoking and emotionally engaging account of one of the most significant periods in history    the casting in oppenheimer is topnotch with the lead actor delivering an exceptional performance as j robert oppenheimer supported by a talented cast the films characters come to life adding depth and authenticity to the overall story    visually oppenheimer is a feast for the eyes nolans signature cinematography style contributes to the films immersive experience transporting the audience to the era in which the events unfolded the attention to detail in recreating historical settings is commendable and adds an extra layer of authenticity to the story    one aspect to consider is that oppenheimer caters primarily to those with a strong interest in the scientific field the films numerous scientific references and concepts may prove challenging for general viewers to fully grasp and appreciate consequently while it may not have universal appeal it serves as a rewarding experience for those with an inclination towards scientific history and related subject matters    in summary oppenheimer is another noteworthy addition to christopher nolans impressive filmography with its captivating storytelling exceptional performances and breathtaking cinematography the movie offers an engrossing glimpse into the life of a brilliant scientist while it may not resonate equally with all audiences due to its scientific focus it undoubtedly holds its own as a remarkable biographical drama
Aug 1 2023,positive,movie was long and a bit slow at times
Aug 1 2023,positive,bomb jumpscare  jokes aside  great movie go watch it now
Aug 1 2023,positive,great historical movie with a great cast  characters were believable in all aspects  my lady shocked  to find out who played strauss and i was shocked to find out who played truman  i was up to  speed historically and the script was accurate as a hollywood movie could be  the only downside  was the length of the movie at 3 hours but a lot of ground to cover  super movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,overall a good movie with historical relevance but the painting the picture was a bit long
Aug 1 2023,positive,way too long  the bouncing back and forth at times caused confusion and not clarity on this course in history  the first hour could have been done in 10 minutes  seemed to dilute the importance of his on tribute on to our history and future
Aug 1 2023,positive,fabulous writing acting directing  and one of the frightening movies ive ever seen    deducting one star because the dialog is buried i missed 20 of what was being said    i completely understand why movies should be seen in theatres but you do know that on my tv or ipad at home i can turn on captions
Aug 1 2023,negative,too long and hard to follow
Aug 1 2023,positive,very accurate in historical details  fabulous leading man
Aug 1 2023,positive,fascinating  weaves three stories into one  only one of which is about the a bomb taught me about e ents in history of which i was previously unaware
Aug 1 2023,positive,i like the historical vs fictional interpretation
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent acting told the inside story of how oppenheimer was caught between developing a nuclear bomb so the us could defeat japan but wanted its power to be controled
Aug 1 2023,positive,not really any slow parts movie moves quickly and keeps you engaged the whole time
Aug 1 2023,positive,this was a wellacted terrific film about one of the most significant events humanity has ever faced
Aug 1 2023,positive,this movie was well scripted the scientists realization of the enormous change they brought about was not shown until the first explosion at las alamos oppenheimer was forever changed by knowledge of their dreadful creation
Aug 1 2023,positive,good movie had a good pace to it although did get a little confusing to try and figure out who everybody was definitely a long movie but gave a good historical background with good drama in it
Aug 1 2023,positive,i enjoyed the story in spite of the facts that the background sound was too loud relative to the dialog and the special effect noise level was painful
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent portrayal of oppenheimer by cillan murphy of a brilliant but troubled genius accurate depiction of how early actions have consequences years later when the political landscape shifts shows how that being brilliant will bring you the enmity of petty people who cannot accept themselves not being the exceptional
Aug 1 2023,positive,despite being knowledgeable of the manhattan project the story like was very intriguing and kept me interested
Aug 1 2023,positive,solid writing and entertaining
Aug 1 2023,positive,this movie is as amazing   i would almost put it at the top of the list of my favorite christopher nolan films   the script is so engaging and hypnotic you will not want to miss anything and you will be thinking about this film days after you have seen it
Aug 1 2023,positive,im a nerd so laffed at all the brainiac jokes the movie moved along quickly because there was so much detail that was included needed to replay much of it in my head as i looked up things later about the characters and went oh man nolan got that in there this way incredible loved the sinister innocent gotcha saddening parts as well
Aug 1 2023,positive,epic historical fiction movie with an incredible cast and outstanding performances only critique would be to trim some of the prep for the bomb development or if the inquisition to allow for some time to oppenheimers life after the inquisition
Aug 1 2023,positive,great acting story and sets  well directed and excellent background music
Aug 1 2023,positive,loved the special effects and sound a bit long tho
Aug 1 2023,positive,did not expect the movie to be more about the persecution of oppenheimer thought it was the movie was going to be more about the construction of the bombs pleasantly surprised i thought it was great
Aug 1 2023,positive,very detailed excellent acting great cast
Aug 1 2023,positive,exceptional character acting and telling the behind the scenes story of robert oppenheimer the man
Aug 1 2023,positive,phenomenal movie great cast
Aug 1 2023,positive,cinematography was gorgeous and the acting was fantastic but the story was slowmoving and lacked any real emotional or moving moments it could have been just as good if not better had it been shorter the b story took up an unnecessary amount of time and the end seemed to drag on far too long
Aug 1 2023,positive,wonderful some of the time skipping made it slightly difficult to follow but i think for people more familiar with the historical timeline it might be easier beautifully shot and directed and a fascinating story
Aug 1 2023,positive,very slow in the beginning and overall too long acting was great though
Aug 1 2023,positive,i loved it so intense  would have preferred to see it in 3 parts to let all the details soak in  the background music and sound effects were painfully loud in comparison to the dialog
Aug 1 2023,positive,this is the most profound film i have seen until this exact moment in time and space i will never be able to watch it again vastly triggering and evoked such emotions stellar performances around the use of the gita was spectacular the dialogue that was certainly poached from those brains that held suicidal ideation depressive proclivities and anxiety i purchased the score during the closing credits i felt the film inside of my very skull enhanced the sound of arterial blood flow within my ears i became the body electric watching this as it pierces you to the core i was thrilled to find a new film that wasnt full of woke sheepshaped snowflakes i was ecstatic to watch a film that wasnt obsessed with counting ethnicities countries of origin and properly using them in a sentence it was jarring however and for those that shut their ears against personal insight weakness and pain it will come off as too long shallow and pedantic for those that close off their emotions say rub some dirt in it i feel bad that you will most likely miss everything and focus on the irrelevant this film is a seismic shift and flies in the face of necessary inclusivity before this film i always considered there will be blood  to the epitome of all that is filmmaking oppenheimer destroys that
Aug 1 2023,positive,its wonderful ive never seen anything quite like it the cinematography and the sound editing were especially fantastic
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent ever minute held my attention well done we need more movies like this
Aug 1 2023,positive,the first half of movie was confusing and a little boring second half was very good excellent acting performances by cillian murphy matt damon and robert downing jr
Aug 1 2023,positive,since the movie was based on american prometheus it had more of robert oppenheimers relationships social life and political effects people who are not that interested in oppenheimers life would not be that satisfied after the movie i think the tense atmosphere and all the great actors really made the movie rdj did a great job as lewis strauss in the hearing too i hope it showed more of oppenheimers distribution to physics and nuclear engineering but i think it was the best film of the year the action was great and christopher nolans bio pic is a mustsee
Aug 1 2023,positive,a man who had great insight into what he had created not a communist but knew the danger of having only one country with the power to control the world
Aug 1 2023,positive,cilian murphy was brilliant and extraordinary in this role  he deserves the oscar  also robert downey jr was very impressive  this film brought great insight to this time in history
Aug 1 2023,positive,i wear hearing aids the music and background sounds made it hard to catch all the dialogue this caused me to have a disjointed understanding of the video portion  i had many questions for discussion after the viewing
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie was extremely good and did not feel like 3 hours at all the movie was slightly confusing because it was not chronological but every scene felt like an action scene because of the music and exemplary acting ability of the cast
Aug 1 2023,positive,three hours seem to fly by with this riveting story the acting is spectacular and the special effects are awesome
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was an excellent look at his life i feel like people without much knowledge of that period of history and the cold war  red scare specifically may not have been able to really follow what was going on it was probably too long for younger audiences but i believe that i in my midfifties was one of the youngest in the theater so that is probably a moot point 
Aug 1 2023,negative,too much politics not enough about the science of how we developed the bomb
Aug 1 2023,positive,very eye opening the hubris of man never seizes to amaze me
Aug 1 2023,positive,the story was pretty good as we all know kind of hopped around too much i liked fat man and little boy better
Aug 1 2023,positive,loved it  a top 3 nolan film
Aug 1 2023,positive,cillian murphy who played oppenheimer did a fantastic portrayal of the inventor of the atomic bomb and how he dealt with the implications of this deadly bomb the movie is a great history lesson
Aug 1 2023,positive,spectacular filmmaking  stunning performances
Aug 1 2023,positive,my husband and i loved this movie its a must see without children
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was very good very real  unfortunately the imax theater had the audio completely overdriven to the point of clipping so it was difficult to even understand the dialogue  both my wife and i were frustrated by this
Aug 1 2023,positive,really good movie and worth watching to the end
Aug 1 2023,positive,the best movie i have seen in ages the cast is supurb  i love cillian murphy from peaky blinders robert downey jr was excellent however i didnt like matt damons mustache the story line was done excellently chris nolan is amazing
Aug 1 2023,positive,everything about this movie is excellent from the acting to the sound to the cinematography to the pace to the script to the tone seriously everything highly recommended i would watch this again loved the movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,i took two teenagers and we all enjoyed the movie it held our attention it was easy to follow the story line the actors were great and the history was interesting the movie did not seem 3 hours long because it was so creatively done
Aug 1 2023,positive,its long its obnoxiously loud at times but overall its a good movie an interesting perspective into an important time period of history that impacts all of us today i will watch again to pick up small details im sure i missed in the first viewing
Aug 1 2023,positive,very good acting and storytelling of an important historical moment
Aug 1 2023,positive,really enjoyed this historic eventoppenheimer was a super informative movie with great acting  it was very long but no way to cut it shorter
Aug 1 2023,positive,masterpiece acting editing music directingone of the top movies made
Aug 1 2023,positive,not a terrible movie i think it ran a bit long probably could have been a 25 hour movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,as someone who grew up in los alamos i was pleased by the portrayals of the people my parents worked with yes the use of the bomb was awful and yes beating the germans was seen as necessary   i wish the movie had spent even a fifteensecond shot of a room full of women mostly the wives and daughters at rows of adding machines they were the computers whose calculations made the project possible the one throwaway line about some of the wives help out answering phones did the women of los alamos a disservice they deserved to be recognized for their work as much as the physicists who depended on them to do the calculations in the premechanicalelectrical computer world
Aug 1 2023,positive,acting amazing visuals amazing music incredible ive been thinking about this movie for over a week cant wait to see it again
Aug 1 2023,positive,too long an hour could have easily been edited out of the film
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie gave an indepth background into the key persons and their personalities before during and after the development of the atomic bomb excellent script and the performance by the actors was spot on this is a must see
Aug 1 2023,positive,sobering two best actor performances the bedroom scenes should have been removed
Aug 1 2023,positive,slow first 12 hr my husband walked out i stayed got better ad soon as he left my son and grandson had seen it and said the last hour ir so of the ending seemed boring to them i found it just as good as the rest of the movie after the first half hour
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent movie superb acting amazing visually and i learned a whole lot about the manhattan project  i highly recommend it  long movie but i dont see how it could have been done differently
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was great it kept our attention the whole three hours
Aug 1 2023,positive,performances were exceptional
Aug 1 2023,positive,very good but a little long
Aug 1 2023,positive,i felt the movie was excellent technically accurate with regard to the physics robert downey jr was fantastic in a possible academy award nomination     sex scenes were unnecessary point could have been made without gratuitous graphic nude scenes
Aug 1 2023,positive,i totally enjoyed the movie the acting was superb the story was interesting seeing it in an imax theater is a must
Aug 1 2023,positive,too long  overly dramatic soundtrack became distracting at points excellent acting performances
Aug 1 2023,positive,wonderful might be the best move i have ever seen sat there for 3 hours and was afraid to leave my seat for fear of missing something important
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was true to the history and very interesting
Aug 1 2023,positive,great performances  extremely thoughtprovoking
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent story telling however it bounced around a bit and for those who dont know the history it may take two views to understand  i did it just because
Aug 1 2023,positive,love how it makes you use your brain and its not just a mindless watch amazing movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,incredible history based movie very intense and interesting i would ha ve given it 5 stars but the audio was way yo loud
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie acting was terrific some of the score was annoying
Aug 1 2023,positive,the historicity of the movie was very good the main problems were 1 the dialogue was not clear and understandable in many places and 2 while faithful to history the repeated jumps between time periods was confusing
Aug 1 2023,positive,4th time seeing this movie very powerful important film
Aug 1 2023,positive,movie did a poor job of portraying the difference between uranium and plutonium bombs as well as distinguishing the issues among chicago oak ridge and hanford development    and therefore did not define the several clashes between oppenheimer and groves  beyond security matters
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie chris nolan at his best tremendous acting and story a visual and auditory experience
Aug 1 2023,positive,the acting was beyond superb one of the best movies ive ever seen
Aug 1 2023,positive,loved it so informative and the acting was great
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie historically significant will definitely recommend to others
Aug 1 2023,negative,it was trashy totally unnecessary prolonged nudity slow and hard to follow three hours too long
Aug 1 2023,neutral,too long scenes jumped from one era to another hard to follow not enough about the man himself other than his sex life
Aug 1 2023,positive,very interesting  three hours went by very quickly
Aug 1 2023,positive,boring too much politics and too little science
Aug 1 2023,positive,very slow and very long  highly educational but tough to sit through
Aug 1 2023,positive,i liked it a lot to a point that i had seen it twice very interesting how a scientist gets wrapped into politic 
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie  def a must see for anyone interested in this type of movie and seeing how things really happened
Aug 1 2023,positive,terrific cast great acting wonderfully told  depicted true story everyone should see
Aug 1 2023,positive,really well directed i loved how it showed all the scientists unique personalities i expected more about oppenheimers family life being a biopic but his son was only 4 when the a bomb was dropped on japan and it keeps a pretty tight focus around that incident   the movie tries to strike a balance between awe at the scientists achievements and horror at the effects of their creation on the world whether its successful at that or not is up to the viewer   i agree with criticisms that it could have delved more into the effects of nuclear testing at the los alamos site
Aug 1 2023,positive,lead actor and downey both terrific too long
Aug 1 2023,positive,very unsettling but it was real life  loved that they cast was so vast  the storyline was just written beautifully
Aug 1 2023,positive,a very educational movie that shows how are government works to this day  thank goodness for the morals of people that will stand up for what they believe in
Aug 1 2023,positive,very good as to perspective and the logistics but confusing also because hard to follow time linetime period and difficult to keep with all the characters and whether they were friends or foes of oppie
Aug 1 2023,positive,great acting writing and direction
Aug 1 2023,positive,slow in developing jumped around too much sound seemed muffled
Aug 1 2023,positive,very good and educational movie  learned many things i was not aware of as i was born in 1949
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was pretty long to be so technical about the review board  however as a whole it was riveting  ambition was apparently the chief cause for the use of the bomb so its well to consider that just a few mens foibles create enormous chaos
Aug 1 2023,positive,three hours flew by  the editing acting and cinemaphotography were fantastic
Aug 1 2023,positive,amazing cinematic experience  a must see on imax 70mm if you can
Aug 1 2023,positive,intense lesson in history and morality  as resonate today as 1945
Aug 1 2023,positive,powerful storytelling great musical direction that flows perfectly with the mood of the movie incredible acting by so many well known actors typically steady and sound nolan direction three hours flew by loved the intensity in and even uncomfortability of some scenes did not appreciate the sexual content but realize that it was an aspect of oppenheimers life that impacted his character
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was one of the best films i ever seen in a very long time  id rate it up there either gone with the wind australia and some i cant remember
Aug 1 2023,positive,absolutely flawless
Aug 1 2023,positive,amazing excellent acting great cast finally a movie without superhero nonsense
Aug 1 2023,positive,the first two hours were boring and the movie was very slow moving with lots of dialogue the last hour or so was good and finally made it to the action great history lesson loved the last hour but the entire movie was way too long
Aug 1 2023,positive,i took my family to see this epic film by chris nolan and it was fascinating very detailed and it leaves you wanting more  to know more about oppenheimer
Aug 1 2023,positive,amazing well acted and paced for a movie with a lot of dialogue feel this will be in the kid for academy awards on all fronts
Aug 1 2023,positive,boring reading the history was better than the movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,historically i suppose it was very good however to me it dragged on and was boring the lead actor didnt have much of a personality
Aug 1 2023,positive,outstanding movie easily the movie of the year for 2023
Aug 1 2023,neutral,though it had some interesting moments overall it was kind of dark and too long i left feeling bad for watching it
Aug 1 2023,negative,too long and not much happening
Aug 1 2023,positive,just a masterclass in filmmaking 3 hours long and we werent bored for a single moment
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent acting accurate uniforms realistic sets   this film should be see in a big dark theater not at home on a tiny screen
Aug 1 2023,positive,watching this film in 70mm 15perf imax was a treat to behold an absolute full cinematic experience with a mind boggling dilemma
Aug 1 2023,positive,too long would have liked more on how they built the a bomb
Aug 1 2023,positive,great story  acting did not seem like a 3 hour movie very fast paced
Aug 1 2023,positive,sex scene not necessary  3 hours  way to long  could have trimmed an hour off it  i fell asleep because it was moving to slow
Aug 1 2023,positive,this movie was good but i do wish the focus had of been on einstein instead of openwhatever
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was a long movie but definitely  kept your interest  great performances
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was really good not sure how accurate though
Aug 1 2023,positive,a little too long but otherwise good
Aug 1 2023,positive,absolutely fantastic movie  the acting was superb as well as the storyline
Aug 1 2023,negative,3 hours of politicking and oppenheimers sexual exploits made for a very long movie  should have spent more time on the science and development of the abomb  painful to sit through the boredom
Aug 1 2023,positive,gret story not many people know about a little long but worth it
Aug 1 2023,positive,really well filmed and produced you can really experience his thoughts through the visuals and sound production interesting portrayal of his life
Aug 1 2023,positive,too long dragged out too much dialogue not enough to keep audience interested for 3 hours movie was hyped up too much
Aug 1 2023,positive,great review of history proud to be an american
Aug 1 2023,positive,great back story to the creation and dangers of our nuclear weapons age
Aug 1 2023,positive,very thought provoking always interesting to look back in history to try and understand events and their impact on all of us
Aug 1 2023,positive,the acting was great as were the sets costumes etc however flashbacks were not an effective way to tell the story it was extremely choppy and felt like they were trying to make an epic movie rather than telling the interesting story of his life
Aug 1 2023,positive,i dont know about anyone else but was the volume way too loud it was tough to tell because the dialog was way too low like they were whispering the movie was good but it is hard to know what his history is and what is fiction all of the actors were wonderful and the direction was superb the photography was amazing it reminded me a little of memento because it traveled all around in time it helped to what i assume was the mccarthy era in black and white that acted like an anchor to remind you where you had bounced so i really liked it other than feeling like i left a concert from having ringing ears
Aug 1 2023,positive,i really enjoyed the movie even learning a little bit of history  which i did check out   also the atomic explosion was scary and made me think wtf  definitely a good one
Aug 1 2023,positive,powerful directing of fabulous actors  truly one of the best movies ive ever seen
Aug 1 2023,positive,really slow getting started
Aug 1 2023,positive,too long not enough wwii background made him something he was not a communist and made him boring i teach history
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie with a very strong cast
Aug 1 2023,positive,an exceptional film mesmerizing must see  it is good to go in though knowing some of the history about the atom bomb and the key players oppenheimer being the head of the project  definite oscar contender
Aug 1 2023,positive,the acting the actors  were fantastic  the storyline was thought provoking as well i grew up in the era right after ww ii so it was especially poignant for me i shudder when i think or read about how close we came to blowing up our world
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent film that was perfectly paced
Aug 1 2023,positive,reveals the complete untold story  at least i was not aware  however i spent a lot of time trying to understand the use of bw vs color
Aug 1 2023,positive,mesmerizing  felt it was the longest i had sat watching something riveted to the screen for 3 hours  the story was compelling and relevant the emotions palpable  christopher nolan at his best
Aug 1 2023,positive,an important movie to be sure but there are other ways to learn more about the creation of the nuclear bomb and oppenheimer  this director is very selfindulgent the movie is faaaaaarrrr too long and full of unnecessary trickery  cuts all over the place rather than tell a linear story has many many characters you cant keep track of drags in places  robert downey jr saves the movie to a certain extent hes excellent
Aug 1 2023,positive,long and slow to start but finished well
Aug 1 2023,positive,the acting was fantastic the plot drug a little bit but the story telling was phenomenally done the movie could have been done in 25 so i think its 30 minutes to long but great movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was very well done and we enjoyed it at times the dialogue was just a tad too perfect not distractingly so though
Aug 1 2023,positive,it will be nominated for an oscar   a must see in high school
Aug 1 2023,positive,loved the movie could have done without the nudity and really was not needed acting was great all around
Aug 1 2023,positive,fast moving great acting great story and history
Aug 1 2023,positive,riveting start to finish fantastic cast and storyline taking us back to the time between the wars imax must
Aug 1 2023,positive,very nolan the sound the cuts and the effects also very r rated lol
Aug 1 2023,positive,while i really did enjoy all the historical aspects of the movie the cast and acting it really could have done without all the nudity and sex you can get the point across without showing full nudity on screen other than that seeing it in xd was great
Aug 1 2023,positive,this movie was very well done enjoyed it very much
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was bit long but it opened my eyes to a lot of things that are still happening in government
Aug 1 2023,neutral,and just like that 3 hours of my life was stolen     i wanted a sophisticated look at an important and pivotal point in world history instead what i got was three hours of solipsistic talking heads nonstop dialogue literally and walltowall relentless loud sound design all of it in service of christopher nolans attempt to make a controversial oliver stone styled movie he borrowed stones classic use of random black and white scenes jump cuts and disjointed reaction shots which made flms like nixon and natural born killers unique     sadly although nolan delivers a resonable facilily of stones style he lacks stones story telling and dialogue skills most disappontingly there are no new revelations or controversy this is a standard retelling of oppenheimers rise and fall which was told far better in the 1989 film fat man and little boy for a fraction of the budget and half the screen time     if youre thinking of this as one of those movies you just have to see on the big screen save your money with the vast majority of the movie composed of close ups and medium shots this marathon is much better suited to your 65 incher at home drink in one hand and in the other a pause button    i gave it 25 stars for robert downeys performance which was oscar worthy
Aug 1 2023,positive,movie in imax was awesome however the theatre should have standard reclining seats the theatre selected did not have these  the movie is too long to be seated uncomfortably other than that  great movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,love 70mm imax quality sound designscorecamera and light were perfect and not distracting they helped build the story and the actors were incredible really makes one think about the power we hold and how it has been used   cinema is not dead  ill see it again soon
Aug 1 2023,positive,very good  very close to real story
Aug 1 2023,positive,so well done the science is way above my head but the way the movie presents it in a way anyone can relate    the sex scenes were totally unnecessary
Aug 1 2023,positive,long movie 3 hours but kept my attention the entire movie
Aug 1 2023,neutral,all three of us had trouble hearing much of the dialogue the sound was horrible
Aug 1 2023,positive,i liked the drama and the vivid display of oppenheimers intellect however the scenes with gratuitous sex in them were totally unnecessary the movie would have been great regardless    i mean consider the movie mission impossible  dead reckoning there were more nuanced and subtle displays of love and affection without having to resort to gratuitous sex scenes    i mean any cheaply made xrated movie can give you that if thats what youre looking for but perhaps the producers thought that an r rating would draw a wider audience and in todays sexcrazed culture just possibly theyre right
Aug 1 2023,positive,i very much enjoyed the movie it went on for a long time and you really have to be on you a game in remembering who is who what and where i did enjoy the black and white vs color shots to help you know what point of time youre in    lastly would of been awesome if we saw a few more explosions that just the 1
Aug 1 2023,positive,first time at imax wow
Aug 1 2023,positive,there were many aspects of this story i didnt know so i got a nice history lesson in a good movie i was disappointed to see that the main actor was cillian murphy who i think is creepy but as it turned out he did a good job portraying this character when i looked up a photo of oppenheimer he resembled him very well good story informative and thoughtprovoking
Aug 1 2023,positive,nude sex scene dont believe it was needed for the story about their relationship
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was a good story the acting was fabulous the movie could have been a little shorter  too much detail
Aug 1 2023,positive,fantastic depiction of real life events acting superb on every level
Aug 1 2023,positive,i liked the history in the telling of the story of the making of the a bomb  some of oppenheimers visions seemed like he might be on a lsd trip  in the long run it was an entertaining 3 hour movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,christopher nolans oppenheimer should dominate the awards next year clearly his best picture yet
Aug 1 2023,positive,unbelievable the soundtrack the visuals the story the emotion 100 yes favorite movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,this is cinema      the story pacing acting cinematography and directing are all at a premium level this is the type of drama made to be seen in theaters      while my particular experience was sullied by the old annoying couple who wouldnt stop using their mobiles and gave their nonstop commentary throughout the entire 3 hour film this is still a must see go see it in imax as the director intended and youll be doing yourself a huge favor
Aug 1 2023,positive,this movie is complete and utter genius
Aug 1 2023,positive,first rate on all levels the performances the visuals sound design and editing  a 3 hour movie that is engaging throughout truly a major accomplishment
Aug 1 2023,positive,loved it great story great acting want to see it again
Aug 1 2023,positive,nudity was not necessary  great editing
Aug 1 2023,positive,fantastic movie held our attention from start to finish wonderful actors 
Aug 1 2023,negative,im a nolan fan and this was by far my least favorite film from him not even gonna go into allllll of the why after a year of build up and then another 3hrs of whatever that was on top that lets just say this was crazy disappointing especially reading all these misleading rave reviews are we watching the same movie wait til this is on hbomax or somethin
Aug 1 2023,positive,compelling interesting engaging cant take your eyes off the screen
Aug 1 2023,negative,i would give zero stars really boring dull slow
Aug 1 2023,positive,masterful performances by some surprising cast members  cillian murphy emily blunt and robert downey jr are just a few of the best  this littleknow story of j robert oppenheimers involvement in the development of the atomic bomb illuminates a pivotal moment in world history and the moral dilemma confronted by the people involved  it could have done a deeper dive into his internal conflict but maybe the clips that would have done that had to be cut to bring the running time down to only three hours  even at that it would have been nice to have an intermission for those of us with weak bladders
Aug 1 2023,positive,oppenheimer is a masterpiece one of the best films i have seen the acting is superb the visual effects and editing are magnificent even at three hours long it is riveting throughout we saw it the the imax 2d theater which i highly recommend due to how it enhances the experience
Aug 1 2023,positive,interest story and great acting but way too long for my taste
Aug 1 2023,positive,loved it for the story the cast the acting the special effects the sounds songs and everything else    loved it for the history didnt know a whole lot about what exactly transpired the cast was incredible and so believable a whole 3 hours of intense drama not once was i bored
Aug 1 2023,positive,very well made and interesting
Aug 1 2023,negative,too much time focusing on appeal and confirmation hearing would have liked to see more action on making of the a bomb
Aug 1 2023,positive,im sure this is a great movie to those who can keep track of the characters i could not theres not much about the bomb in the movie more about the politics
Aug 1 2023,positive,astonishing an absolute masterpiece of a film
Aug 1 2023,negative,boring period piece centered around a a boring physicist with very little action for a christopher nolan movie  actually that isnt true there was zero action 3 hours of cilian murphy pretending to be some kind of genius when it was clearly a team effort what are you people smoking out there with your perfect reviews i want some
Aug 1 2023,positive,this movie delivers saw this with 3 other people and all 4 of us loved it see it in imax great cast moved well for a 3 hour movie so it didnt seem like it nothing frivolous to be taken out worth it
Aug 1 2023,positive,very long slow movie with several themes running through it yet all tangled up  i actually had to google oppenheimer after the movie to understand what the issues were  the acting was great but the story was too tangled up for me  too bad they just did not do it in chronological order  it would have been a better movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was a thinking persons movievery long
Aug 1 2023,neutral,music louder than dialogue missed several conversations not much about the actual development of atomic energy
Aug 1 2023,positive,was amazing great storytelling and it was all first rate
Aug 1 2023,positive,fascinating story very well directed
Aug 1 2023,positive,very suspenseful and captivating riveting intense
Aug 1 2023,negative,movie covers important history that is really interesting  unfortunately the movie making crews did everything possible to distract and prevent audience from following story  background music was way too loud and consisted mainly of pounding drums  actual music for more tender scenes was still way too loud and overpowered the dialogue between characters    movie was way too long  if youre going to make a movie 3 hours long then have an intermission  for people who sat through theater commercials and then loud previews of coming attractions and then the 3hour movie it was a tough slog
Aug 1 2023,positive,too long with previews but a mesmerizing movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,five star acting and ten star writing
Aug 1 2023,positive,good flick good castingdirection someone long  the final scenes could be shorter mr murphy start looking for a place for your oscar the director mr nolan did excellent job
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie was really good all the emotions could be felt with oppenheimer
Aug 1 2023,positive,awesome movie i learned a lot and im still thinking about it excellent acting and cinematography
Aug 1 2023,positive,great story just a little long
Aug 1 2023,positive,a significant historical film superbly acted
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was a little long but the storytelling was incredible
Aug 1 2023,positive,riveting from start to finishwonderful character developmentintense as it should have been
Aug 1 2023,positive,an incredible achievement of the telling of this important americans life
Aug 1 2023,positive,i saw oppenheimer the next day after i saw barbie oppenheimer is a good movie but a 3 hours you can wait to see it on streaming the movie is basically christopher nolan doing a clever play on words with a major batman dark knight reference all the high caliber actors had played comic book superheroes which elevates the quality of a comic book movie so they can make the money to make riskier art films like this its worth watching but in my opinion barbie is the better movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,very intense and long sexual scenes were unnecessary and distracting way too many cigarettes smoked continuously no wonder oppenheimer died of throat cancer
Aug 1 2023,positive,the soundtrack kept the movie intriguing through the whole movie and acting from the cast members was brilliant
Aug 1 2023,positive,as usual for any movie made in the last 10 years it was too long a case of lousy editing and minimal control over production  however it was a good presentation of the times the creation of the manhattan project mccarthyisms influence the social and moral culture
Aug 1 2023,positive,enjoyed the historical account but storyline was a bit confusing at times
Aug 1 2023,positive,authentic in storyline but a little too  long
Aug 1 2023,negative,the acting was great but the story was disappointing the first two hours covered nothing we didnt learn anything about how they invented and created the bomb the 3rd hour was good with the story of the politics and the hearings nothing has changed our government is just as corrupt as it was back then i would suggest wait until it is streaming and watch it at home at least you can take a stretch break
Aug 1 2023,positive,great picture really makes you think about using the a bomb and the consequences great acting and great cast
Aug 1 2023,positive,perfectly made in every way
Aug 1 2023,positive,very fast paced movie kept my attention constantly didnt seem like a 3 hour movie it refreshed my history of the period with wonderful actors  would encourage anyone to see this great movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,loved this movie a masterpiece
Aug 1 2023,positive,very good movie a bit long but enjoyed the story
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie was well made and thoughtful  however i saw a documentary on oppenheimer a few days before seeing the movie  there was nothing new covered in the movie that wasnt in the documentary  there were a couple of graphic scenes i didnt expect or want to see  i understand the directors intent but the movie would have been more enjoyable without them for me  i also found the movie too long
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent presentation and wonderful direction and cast run time too long
Aug 1 2023,positive,it really didnt need the sex scenes  im not a prudebut they just didnt add to the movie  i did think the scene where oppenheimer is being questioned and appears briefly in the nude revealed how exposed he felt at the time  the emotional dance between oppenheimer and strauss was  interestingshowed the complexity of both men
Aug 1 2023,positive,christopher nolans magnificent film oppenheimer has brought the power of technology and the ethical issues that come with it into the spotlight at an appropriate time as uncertainty and fear of the new power of artificial intelligence rises  both as a powerful and balanced commentary and as a work of art this movie is superb brilliant script  very witty and insightful amazing caste gorgeous cinematography i went to see it twice last week and enjoyed the second time even more  in imax and 70 mm
Aug 1 2023,positive,great american history story great actors and even though the subject matter was regarding war there was not fighting and killing in every scene as most other movies these days
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was slow  hard to follow i just expected more
Aug 1 2023,positive,loved it i didnt know anything about the story just that it was about the man who led the development of the atomic bomb i was blown away by the story pacing and acting very well done
Aug 1 2023,positive,story line was exceptional
Aug 1 2023,positive,very well done great acting with excellent cinematography good historical perspective
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent great acting action sex drama realistic everything you look or in a movie downside a little long
Aug 1 2023,positive,its truly a flawed masterpiece  brilliantly acted directed and written however the sound mixing sucked why did nolan feel the music was more important than the dialogue in about 3 scenes  casual conversations imparting important information did not need any music at all   i have seen a couple of reviews online complaining about this and lo and behold 3 friends had the same complaint  i would love to see more honest reviews by pros and just folks about this  id love to have given oppenheimer all 5 stars but it aint gonna happen
Aug 1 2023,neutral,long movie 1st 30 minutes could have been cut  actors performances were great though
Aug 1 2023,positive,about 45 minutes too long
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was a great biopic and provided insights into the life of jr oppenheimer and the manhattan project  if the movie could have been compressed into less than 3 hours by perhaps removing details or differently representing them that would have been ideal
Aug 1 2023,positive,this was one of the best movies ive seen in a long time all the actors brought their a game it really was well written and extremely well acted
Aug 1 2023,positive,a powerful movie that reinforced the tragedy of war
Aug 1 2023,negative,dark  long and better suited to watch at home when it streams 
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was too long there was inadequate dimension in the story line some unnecessary nudity and the sound mixing team did a mediocre job but cilian murphy was fantastic
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent but sometimes hard to follow with its huge cast of characters and loud musical score that occasionally drowns the dialog
Aug 1 2023,positive,wonderful performances by cillian murphy robert downey jr matt damon and emily blunt tom conti was so good as einstein i didnt recognize him the rest of the cast were excellent as well the story switched back and forth in time but not so much as to lose the continuity of the story the movie was about 3 hours but kept my attention so well i didnt notice the time i found the sex and nudity scenes a bit much but maybe thats just me
Aug 1 2023,positive,epic and overwhelming one of the great works by nolan
Aug 1 2023,positive,first part of the movie was a little boring
Aug 1 2023,positive,best movie of the decade so far
Aug 1 2023,positive,great song directing cinematography needed editing
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was good but not great
Aug 1 2023,positive,meant to addbest of the best is robert downey jr   he owns every single scene he is in tremendously talented actorbest role among many best roles yet
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie that allows kids to understand how science impacts world events cast was great and movie was beautiful i would highly recommend
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie was faithful to the book  the cinematography to fantastic  i saw the imax version but i imagine the other version compare favorably  i love how christopher nolan combines the visual and sound effects so that they really impact you  i have never seen a movie version of a large explosion that matched the real event so well  kudos to everyone involved in making this film
Aug 1 2023,positive,the acting was magnificent i believe the storyline and the characters paid great homage to the historic accuracy of what transpired and allowed more to see the tribulations oppenheimer went through on the political stage  the movie was far too long and the audio effects were extremely frustrating and often downright obnoxious  over all a good movie but really because of the acting and storyline  as far as sfx and audio just because you can doesnt mean you should  the movie would have been much better without that
Aug 1 2023,negative,shooting for a magnum opus more of a magnum itsokayus performances were good but seemed more like a series of vignettes than a cohesive plot on the plus side it did not feel like a three hour movie at all it really kept me interested  and the scenes with florence pugh were worth the ticket price alone for me
Aug 1 2023,positive,great writing acting directing  cinematography
Aug 1 2023,positive,i thought the actors all did a good job the writing was good except for the poison apple scene which seemed a little far out
Aug 1 2023,negative,text matt damon as a fatter version of himself playing a general with jokes totally unconvincing just doesn39t have the gravitas to play a military general miscasting    no sympathetic characters in the entire movie no one that39s really likable except for albert einstein who has may be a total of five minutes of screen time all the other characters are dull one dimensional greedy self interested authoritarian such a bleak view of humanity    the oppenheimer scenes of madness borrowed way too much from a beautiful mind which is a much better movie than this is    the worst part  what was the whole point of this movie three hours of dogmatic professorial authoritarian white people topping each other with their arguments and their insights who cares hat the movie was about oppenheimer losing his security clearance and what a pivotal moment in history that is again who cares it39s simply doesn39t matter and it certainly doesn39t justify three hour movie    also what is the point of all of that grating heightened music and sound effect every moment isn39t climactic yet the music would have you believe something as simple as oppenheimer putting on a hat and picking up his smoking pipe is something to key in on who cares    i learned a few things i can39t trust imdb ratings this was not an 88 movie this is may be a 45 at best there just wasn39t any point to this movie there was no substance and the style was mediocre at best    the other thing that i learned christopher nolan ain39t got it anymore momento was very good the batman trilogy especially part one and two was excellent inception was top notch but that was over 10 years ago i haven39t seen interstellar but it might be the last good movie he39s made his use of the beehive sound effect at the beginning of the dark night was superb but it39s been copied and overdone by just about every action thriller out there and he39s overdone it himself and all of his movies sense i just hate that he needed to use it every other minute during oppenheimer what a piece of garbage what a waste of time could39ve spent at three hours rewatching a classic like das boot or the seven samurai but it is very hot right now and i did get three hours plus of air conditioning at the theater i guess that39s something  summary paying for three hours of air conditioning in a theater
Aug 1 2023,positive,script was clunky in some sections too much explaining in dialogue not enough explaining through action on screen some painful little vignettes between oppenheimer and renowned physicists audio mix was muddy in parts too fing loud overall had a blinding headache afterwards absolutely hated the atmospheric drone underneath almost all the dialogue having said all that some good performances here and the world created by the filmmakers was solid
Aug 1 2023,positive,the actors and acting were superb i lived at the time of the events and remember them well
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was intense but very informative and reminded me of how we used to hide under our desks in school to prepare for an atom bomb attack
Aug 1 2023,positive,an excellent biopic about an amazing man in an amazing time   the actins was great and the scenes were luscious and spectacular
Aug 1 2023,positive,outstanding we were entertained from the beginning to the end and its 3 hours long a mustsee for sure
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was very interesting and opened my eyes to what happened behind the development of the atom bomb  some of our government tactics during that and probably still going on are dreadful
Aug 1 2023,positive,absolutely spectacular return to a true blockbuster movie knowing the ending notwithstanding  every aspect was sublime from the musical score to the cinematography imax is a must through acting rdj damon and all to set design special effects no cgi and the best was by far the story  disclosure i wrote my college thesis on trumans decision and its lasting effects so i am biased  my 23yearold son loved it also and giggled at my emotional reaction to this masterpiecevery spot on historically with only subtle cinematic license issues in my humble opinion
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was a great story but it was too long could have done without the sex scenes to cut it down
Aug 1 2023,positive,totally amazing film outstanding acting my only negative was the constant annoying soundtrack that interfered with the dialog at times
Aug 1 2023,positive,superb in every way
Aug 1 2023,positive,educational and excellent actings
Aug 1 2023,positive,loved it is a long movie but it flies by its such a good movie
Aug 1 2023,negative,very long very slow too much about oppenheimer and not enough about the task at hand the mission or the broader picture way too much narrative at the expense of intense drama surrounding the project it was just long boring and not worth 3 hours of life the entire first hour could be cut without harming the movie acting was slow and never pulled me into any of the characters even oppenheimer i was expecting much more drama and action around a huge global event     theres a prime series on stream now call manhattan that does a much better job of telling this story is riveting and easier to stay awake
Aug 1 2023,positive,an otherwise great movie practically ruined by the overbearing and extremely loud background music and effects  i had to plug my ears several times  some of it drowned out the dialog for effect but i did not enjoy it    they bounced back and forth in time with so many names and faces i will need to watch it twice more to actually learn who did what but never again in a theater where i cant control the volume
Aug 1 2023,positive,great history about the man  what lead up to the dropping of the atom bomb and after when america turned on him  his wife
Aug 1 2023,positive,awesome movie i cant wait to rewatch  i will say it was very long  so much dialogue in the interrogation process names and events to follow  the flashbacks also make it difficult to follow definitely need a rewatch to pick up on some things
Aug 1 2023,positive,very long but it really didnt seem that long great story and kept you on the edge of your seat the entire time highly recommend seeing it in imax
Aug 1 2023,positive,3hrs is too long of a movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,movie was phenomenal
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie everyone should see it
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie saw it in imax continued nolans visual style and finding ways to express abstract concepts  what more abstract than quantum mechanics  while capturing topnotch portrayals of historic figures by following the events after the war it gave perspective and depth to a person that many folks have only seen previously as a caricature in a widebrimmed hat however from a spectacle standpoint it didnt go as fas as id hoped in depicting the energies and force of nuclear explosions also they did not depict the characteristic doubleflash of actual nuclear fission bombs so the imaxness was sort of wasted here
Aug 1 2023,positive,this second part of barbenheimer is definitely more difficult to watch than the first one both for the serious subject matter and the way the story is presented in typical christopher nolan fashion jumping back and forth in time supported by the mixed use of color and bw footage that being said the three hours go by quickly due to supreme film making and acting by the great cast cillian murphy convinces in his first lead role florence pugh is probably largely responsible for the films rrating and an almost unrecognizable robert downey jr is cast as antagonist for a change btw to me the relationship between oppenheimer and strauss aka murphy and downey jr looks a lot like the one between mozart and salieri in 1984s amadeus a final word this movie is clearly aimed at adults so take your kids to watch barbie instead  if you are more interested in the subject matter now there are numerous worthwhile museums and related sites in the southwest namely trinity site near los lunas the national museum of nuclear science  history in abq and the atomic museum in las vegas nv there is also the manhattan tv series which is loosely based on the events at los alamos  a few days later  quick rewatch for the recommended 35mmfilmfeel but honestly give me high quality digital any time   it was nevertheless worth it since certain elements at the beginning of the film made more sense this time around knowing the films ultimate destination i also paid more attention to the visual effects since there currently is a big discussion going on about if christopher nolan really didnt use any cgi to me the effects look great yet classic remember barbarellas psychedelic shots so i believe his claims that he limited himself to regular special effects no cgi does not mean no visual effects after all and vfx is not the same as cgi anyway still a great film for adults
Aug 1 2023,positive,great acting and directing cinematography was great it was also very long 3hrs i feel could have been shaved down
Aug 1 2023,positive,best film i have seen in years
Aug 1 2023,positive,oppenheimer was absolutely riveting it was a long movie   but totally sold out and no one moved for the entire 3 hours absolutely one of the best movies ive ever seen
Aug 1 2023,positive,awesome movie and wonderful actors
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent  it was long heavy and powerful   a movie that needs to be watched more than once to really take it all in
Aug 1 2023,positive,a really strong flaws and all bio pic
Aug 1 2023,positive,absolutely an amazing film it had the perfect mix of actors and amazing picture
Aug 1 2023,positive,very interesting and excellent acting it a go and see
Aug 1 2023,positive,this movie was superb the storytelling the performances were topnotch kudos to christopher and the cast a1 for sure
Aug 1 2023,positive,the fact that this film captured my attention for 3 solid hours speaks volumes fascinating story told in great detail outstanding cast incredibly thoughtprovoking themes
Aug 1 2023,negative,i thought this movie was terrible for an average person who isnt familiar with the history of what happened and who all the characters were they could have identified the date and situation of the different scenes as they were jumping around in time and place too confusing could have been much better
Aug 1 2023,positive,this second part of barbenheimer is definitely more difficult to watch than the first one both for the serious subject matter and the way the story is presented in typical christopher nolan fashion jumping back and forth in time supported by the mixed use of color and bw footage that being said the three hours go by quickly due to supreme film making and acting by the great cast cillian murphy convinces in his first lead role florence pugh is probably largely responsible for the films rrating and an almost unrecognizable robert downey jr is cast as antagonist for a change btw to me the relationship between oppenheimer and strauss aka murphy and downey jr looks a lot like the one between mozart and salieri in 1984s amadeus a final word this movie is clearly aimed at adults so take your kids to watch barbie instead  if you are more interested in the subject matter now there are numerous worthwhile museums and related sites in the southwest namely trinity site near los lunas the national museum of nuclear science  history in abq and the atomic museum in las vegas nv there is also the manhattan tv series which is loosely based on the events at los alamos  a few days later  quick rewatch for the recommended 35mmfilmfeel but honestly give me high quality digital any time   it was nevertheless worth it since certain elements at the beginning of the film made more sense this time around knowing the films ultimate destination i also paid more attention to the visual effects since there currently is a big discussion going on about if christopher nolan really didnt use any cgi to me the effects look great yet classic remember barbarellas psychedelic shots so i believe his claims that he limited himself to regular special effects no cgi does not mean no visual effects after all and vfx is not the same as cgi anyway still a great film for adults
Aug 1 2023,positive,well told and acted story
Aug 1 2023,positive,overuse of flash forwardflash back in storyline  could have been a bit shorter
Aug 1 2023,positive,the acting was phenomenal  the history of the man was great to learn about
Aug 1 2023,positive,a very welldelivered movie based on actual events  love how it exposed the tactics politicians used back then to disarm and silence opposition  im sure similar tactics are still in use today
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie was great  my husband  myself enjoyed it very much
Aug 1 2023,positive,the history and famous names were educational and it was impressive to condense 2030 years in a 3 hour movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie tried to cover too much which resulted in lack of focus  it wandered through but did not nail the political background dr oppenheimer personal weaknesses the science and  collaboration a moral dillema real consequences the us gvmt disdain for all humanity womens influence on dr opp etc    was the depiction of him being a tormented scientist looking for fame accurate also was expecting impressive visuals associated with the historic detonation but none  we left the theater with no more than we knew going into the theater and the question what was the movie supposed to be about
Aug 1 2023,neutral,movie too long  need an intermission
Aug 1 2023,positive,what i liked excellent acting academy worthy   disliked not showing the full human impact of the bomb and how far reaching it was
Aug 1 2023,positive,compelling excellent performance by robert downing jr
Aug 1 2023,positive,didnt need to be as long as it was but overall it was incredible
Aug 1 2023,negative,it really just made me mad at men and the world and the stupidity of bombs and men
Aug 1 2023,positive,3 hour movie but you wouldnt know it
Aug 1 2023,positive,oppenheimer is a movie deserving of its hype it is one of those rare movies that deserve the cinematic scale and sound of a theatrical release christopher nolans direction kept the attention squarely on cillian murphys lead character instead of venturing off on one of many other important historical aspects of the manhattan project because of this some very significant scientific leaders such as vannevar bush are barely shown or mentioned in the film while others such as matt damons general leslie groves were given the typical military caricature treatment despite the generals record and reputation as a man who could always be counted on the complete construction on time  and time was definitely the hidden antagonist putting pressure on every key decision     this singular focus on oppenheimer is actually quite helpful in the pace of the movie and reveals more about the man that unless one had read the book american prometheus few of us would know nolan builds ands and builds until the power of the project becomes greater than all of the brilliant cast including oppenheimer its a weighty moment worth the wait robert downey jr and emily blunt were outstanding and florence pugh deserved more nonnude attention some of the best characters came to life from actors i had not previously seen cillian murphy was as good as any daniel daylewis performance was the movie too long no next up a trip to see it in 70mm imax
Aug 1 2023,positive,i love oppenheimer because the movies history and details are clear and to the point it is highly key as to why we need to continue to educate ourselves and our children on american history and the history of the world
Aug 1 2023,positive,this movie rode on the barbie marketing coattails no reason to watch this movie on imax because 98 of this movie is close ups and dialogue 3 hours of it     superb acting i didnt even realize gary oldman was in this movie until afterwards hes so good cillian was really good too    i left at the 2 hour mark because it was dragging on and i felt like i got what i wanted out of the movie wouldve made a better 4 episode mini series
Aug 1 2023,positive,very good but heavy movie moral issues abound acting is great lots of politics and political back stabbing kinda like now
Aug 1 2023,positive,liked the movie i would prefer that it happen in chronological order goes back  forth in time periods
Aug 1 2023,positive,a work of art  the directing imagery and acting were outstanding
Aug 1 2023,positive,i liked the detail of the film and the complete treatment of his life not just through the manhattan project
Aug 1 2023,positive,definitely will watch again
Aug 1 2023,positive,interesting but i really didnt empathize w any of the characters
Aug 1 2023,positive,the first seminal movie of our current era
Aug 1 2023,positive,great acting and its history
Aug 1 2023,positive,oppenheimer is a masterpiece it is a dialogue heavy fast moving historical drama that is a case study on a man who is a very complex person with a lot of inner demons he is a flawed person who was blessed with a brilliant mind which created a weapon of mass destruction oppenheimer is portrayed fantastically by the amazon cillian murphy it is an oscar worthy performance from cillian and the supporting cast is just as good emily blunt is fantastic matt damon is fantastic and rdj steals the show when he appears on screen as lewis strauss this is a movie everyone should experience in theaters i would highly recommend it for all adults
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent film with wonderful acting sets and costuminghowever i did not see any advantage in seeing it in imax over a traditional screen also it was too long for 65 year olds to see without a potty intermission and exceedingly loudi advised others planning to see oppenheimerin any formatto take ear plugs because it was so obnoxiously loud especially the accompanying music
Aug 1 2023,positive,great acting shows the emotional upheaval by all involved great graphics and sound
Aug 1 2023,positive,incredible storytelling and beautiful cinematography
Aug 1 2023,positive,not as great as all the hype  never have to see that movie again
Aug 1 2023,positive,oh my goddess cillian murphy x christopher nolan is forever a match made in heaven from the cinematography to the sounds that were used and enhanced the theater experience of this movie is not one that you want to miss if this movie doesnt get an oscar nod or at least a nomination it will be a loss for our culture and film
Aug 1 2023,positive,very good movie  no real complaints  just suffered due to the amount of crazy hype that made it almost impossible to live up to
Aug 1 2023,positive,soundtrack was amazing and really added to the movie the actors were perfect seeing the movie in imax made me feel like i was right there
Aug 1 2023,negative,overhyped and terrible it was like they threw something together to try to get people back to the theaters definitely the worst film nolan has done disjointed story flat characters and altogether incredibly disappointing
Aug 1 2023,positive,unfortunately we missed the first ten or fifteen minutes due to a severe accident on the pip on our way to amc palisades overall this movie offers many interesting historical information excellent actors and actresses wed like to see this movie one more time
Aug 1 2023,positive,acting greatinteresting
Aug 1 2023,positive,brilliant a move of rare intelligence for adults i strongly recommend it
Aug 1 2023,positive,very complex  well done
Aug 1 2023,positive,amazing movie had us glued to the screen
Aug 1 2023,negative,if you want to watch a 3 hour trailer this movie is for you
Aug 1 2023,positive,absolutely phenomenal one of christopher nolans best works the acting the visuals and the storytelling were all spot on
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was a long movie but you didnt notice as the story kept moving along  it was not what i expected  it was all about the political infighting of the times and the unfounded personal attacks toward oppenheimer  sure a little about the bomb development just to keep the background of the story in the timeline  i enjoy historically significant movies and this is one of those
Aug 1 2023,positive,liked the storieswithin the story
Aug 1 2023,positive,3 hour long movie absolutely glued the entire time worth every single minute
Aug 1 2023,positive,another christopher nolan masterpiece cillian murphy and robert downey jr steal the show i definitely put this in my top three best christopher nolan movies of all time a close second the dark knight and batman begins 3hr run time flies by as you are consumed by this story must see 9510
Aug 1 2023,positive,based strictly on the acting screenplay and cinematography oppenheimer would have easily been a 5star movie for me  but the director made a very poor choice when he did not believe that his actors and his recreation of this important event in history was dramatic enough to carry the movie he choose to have music playing more than 80 of the time that the actors were speaking he thought it created more drama when it actually was just repetitious and boring  this one decision made it an annoying movie that i will see again nor recommend so sad because it was that close to being 5stars
Aug 1 2023,positive,love it was on the edge of my seat the whole 3 hours and never left   best movie ive seen in a long time loved the different celebrity cameos
Aug 1 2023,positive,amazing movie christopher nolan does not disappoint
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie really well done loved it
Aug 1 2023,positive,outstanding in every way
Aug 1 2023,positive,educational too longshould of had a 5 minute intermission bathroom stretch legsback
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie   the acting writing music and editing are just fantastic   a new classicdestined to win multiple academy awards
Aug 1 2023,positive,another nolan masterpiece
Aug 1 2023,positive,too long  drawn out although the topic was interesting
Aug 1 2023,negative,i really wanted to like this movie but sadly i found it very long and slow moving unlike titanic or midead reckoning where the time flew by this film did not the plot and subplots were basically monotone and many characters showed barely any emotion to anything
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie flows well as a credible biography of an interesting man and moment in history as well as the people with whom robert oppenheimer interacted  it is well acted and attention holding  it is well worth watching  i will say there were several moments when the sound was so loud as to trigger a warning on my apple watch but as one of my sons mentioned it is a movie about developing the abomb
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie  enjoyed the experience  as always c nolan never disappoints  waiting for the sequel to inception c nolan
Aug 1 2023,positive,the sex scenes i did not like  they could have been left out  this is a historical movie  this really took away from the movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,i loved it really suspenseful and i felt really bad for oppenheimer because he had a conscience and realized what he created  for the us  government to ensure our safety and then we punish him for demanding to have rules in place for this bomb he was a good man even though he created a bomb which if he didnt do it first whoever got it done first would have used it against us beautifully done movie the costumes that cillian murphy guy that played oppenheimer was amazing i will look for him in future movies left the theater blown away by the film
Aug 1 2023,positive,nolan needed to let this story be more linear and cut some parts from the movie it could have been 30 min shorter and been fine and made sense
Aug 1 2023,positive,a very well done film acting was superb
Aug 1 2023,positive,confusing and way too long
Aug 1 2023,positive,liked the movie but not the experience  movie started almost 45 minutes late and the theatre was not senior citizen friendly  narrow steps and no rails  almost tripped going down  thank goodness there was young lady who helped me  my husband struggled too  will definitely not be there agai
Aug 1 2023,positive,well acted lots of artsie bits with visuals and sound   3 hours went by fast
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was educational and i learned a lot by seeing the movie  but it was extremely long movie the last full hour should have been only 30 minutes to form the conclusion
Aug 1 2023,positive,there was a lot about the people that built the bomb that i had never heard before so that was very interesting  i thought it was very well done
Aug 1 2023,positive,its a very interesting story i loved the cast good director
Aug 1 2023,positive,yes its a 3 hour movie but it doesnt feel that long great movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,acting and screenplay was good the movie was too long  they could have done away with the sex and nudity
Aug 1 2023,positive,a monumental achievement in directing  nolans best  murphy  robert downey jr are unbelievably spectacular  this should not only win best picture director actor  supporting actor but also visual effects editing and sound  brilliant filmmaking
Aug 1 2023,positive,loved the movie but the imax experience was not so great part of that was due to having to sit close to the screen but as i used to tell my overly dramatic grandchild when she started screaming and crying  you are so loud i cant hear you
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie sound was so loud that often we had to put our hands over our ears
Aug 1 2023,positive,too much needless nudity
Aug 1 2023,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of the film  the imax experience
Aug 1 2023,positive,i love story the way it was presented was awesome this is one of the best movies i have ever seen in my entire life
Aug 1 2023,positive,awesome production value acting pace and for once a movie about physics that doesnt assume the audience is a bunch of idiots must see
Aug 1 2023,positive,one of the best films ive seen in years the acting direction and storyline was excellent
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent acting directing script cinematography a masterful film
Aug 1 2023,positive,loved oppenheimer the exciting story the acting the visuals some history new to me all wonderful  but the sound in the imax theater on west 34th st was very loud very very loud  painfully distractingly dangerously abusively aesthetic distancebreakingly loud    loud loud  loud  i had paper napkins stuffed in my ears and still had to cover my ears frequently sound that loud can damage hearing   we will never see a movie in imax again i am highly unlikely to go back to that theater multiplex again either
Aug 1 2023,positive,way to long to keep my interest
Aug 1 2023,positive,the performances were excellent i do not think it was necessary for the camera to linger on florence pughs bare breasts in two scenes however it was gratuitous and did not do anything to advance the narrative
Aug 1 2023,positive,for the first time in a long while a truly excellent adult movie  the acting was first rate and finally no robots monsters etc  i learned a great deal about the making of the atom bomb
Aug 1 2023,positive,maybe the best movie i have watched in my 76 years on this earth  a marvelously told historical story of profound importance  the actors except harry trumans character  were all very believable and relatable  mr murphy finally landed a role that did justice to his huge talents  the cinematography and special effects were both wonderful  i will probably buy this movie on cd when available  i have only purchased two other movies in my life  wonderful movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,very informative interesting and entertaining
Aug 1 2023,positive,amazing story telling
Aug 1 2023,positive,two thirds of a very good movie  but the last part goes into this extended exposition regarding lewis strauss his vindictiveness towards oppenheimer and lots and lots of hearings  that was tedious and detracted from the powerful thrust of the first part of the film
Aug 1 2023,positive,a cinematic experience one of the best movies ive seen in years great cast brilliant dialogue perfect pacing an unbelievable story kept my interest every minute of the way
Aug 1 2023,positive,great script exceptional performances and amazing special effects  outstanding movie experience  ill be seeing it again

Aug 1 2023,negative,very choppy hard to follow too long and very boring
Aug 1 2023,positive,a solid movie that was well told and crafted
Aug 1 2023,positive,being of a certain age i could relate to the times and the subject matter of the movie i wish more young people could be in the audience to experience how things were  our government hasnt changed much since the mccarthy era however   great movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,liked all the history
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent movie the 3 hours mode quickly  great history lesson
Aug 1 2023,negative,it is way too flashy and lacks depth
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent movie everyone should watch it and learn about this historical event
Aug 1 2023,positive,this is an important and fascinating true story although not done in the form of a documentary great acting   the editing was confusing and some important questions were raised but not answered  what are the consequences of a worldchanging scientific breakthrough like the one that enabled the atom bomb   and how can we prevent it from being misused  very relevant to our world today  definitely go see this movie even with all its faults
Aug 1 2023,positive,blockbuster time a must see movie an american hero with a conscience
Aug 1 2023,positive,great cast with historic accuracy
Aug 1 2023,positive,all the acting was fantastic and even though the movie was 3 hours long it never lost our interest
Aug 1 2023,negative,too long slow first half
Aug 1 2023,positive,well written and compelling screen play
Aug 1 2023,positive,much too long  with 25 minutes of previews before the film we sat for 3 and a half hours  why not an intermission  i was disappointed that the movie focused on oppenheimers postwar fall from power a them interwoven through the entire movie than on the development of the bomb itself which only served as a backdrop to the movie  also the nudity was gratuitous totally unnecessary to the plot  robert downey should win an oscar for his performance
Aug 1 2023,positive,thought movie was great with so much history involved acting was excellent
Aug 1 2023,negative,not much of a story content seemed scattered and the story behind the movie did not flow too many black and white scenes lenghty
Aug 1 2023,positive,all the actors did a brilliant job
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent film great acting and awesome set design
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was an awesome movie and as i have studied a lot of this same history the movie was well written and well protrayed thanks for bringing it to our local theater would actuall go see it again if it comes back
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie  a little too long but a story that definitely needed to be told
Aug 1 2023,positive,very good acting great direction great production didnt feel like three hour movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,great historical movie  a little too long though
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie was too long  the sex scenes were gratuitous and not needed  the role of robert downing was overplayed and historically inaccurate  also while oppenheimers conflicted feelings about the atomic bomb is well documented i seriously doubt if he was having mixed feelings when he spoke to his team after the bomb was dropped on hiroshima
Aug 1 2023,positive,very good history refresher  great actors
Aug 1 2023,positive,i already knew the story but i wanted to see how much the hollywooded it
Aug 1 2023,positive,besides being packed full of some of my favorite stars i was quite pleased about how this story was told granted it may have been a tad too long for most viewers but the acting by cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr and florence pugh was superb
Aug 1 2023,positive,very intellectual fast moving movie very good actors excellent performance
Aug 1 2023,positive,oppenheimer is definitely not a movie for everyone its bio pic drama based on the life of oppenheimer and more than just a film about the atomic bomb the sounds design cinematography and actings are all on point one of the best blockbuster in 2023
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was superbly cast and a little long imax was too loud and ui do not recommend that theater to anyone over 30  the story was grippimg and unsettling for someone who remembers the mccarthy era
Aug 1 2023,positive,one of the top three movies i have seen not a weak character and great actors playing them this is a must see for baby boomers and should be required in our school systems this is what life is really about
Aug 1 2023,positive,i really enjoyed the movie and the narrative it was entertaining  the added nudity was irrelevant to the story line and could have been excluded but it wouldnt stop me from seeing it again
Aug 1 2023,positive,it lived up to the hype imax is completely unnecessary great movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,just technical enough  and it makes you think of the obstacles that we now take for granted
Aug 1 2023,positive,awesome movie my self and my two sons thoroughly enjoyed it
Aug 1 2023,positive,a truly moving and breathtaking experience by the genius nolan with accurate and subtle storytelling and beautiful visuals and an epic soundtrack seeing this in theaters is an ethereal experience nolan masterfully crafts details in the characters narrative a true master of showing not telling as he uses cinematography and camera work to showcase different aspects of the characters underneath it all he also explores deep questions about what it means to be human in this universe and is humanity worth working for and helping weve proven were just self destructive and egotistical another aspect that the movie talked about was how the politicians manipulated the public and oppenheimer himself what makes our life worth living in a dark world and what can we do about it also the physics montages and explanations were so so good and inspiring as heck must see
Aug 1 2023,positive,great performances and history lesson a bit overlong though
Aug 1 2023,positive,i think that reading american prometheus before seeing this film ruined it for me  slow plodding screenplay but the actors were top notch
Aug 1 2023,positive,movie itself was great but the theater we watched in had sound turned up too loud painfully loud at moments possibly the movie distribution company requested such loud sound settings either way subtracting a star for that
Aug 1 2023,positive,its close to the truth of the real oppenheimer story  highly recommend
Aug 1 2023,positive,this was an intense character study done without cgi and brought us back to the reality of life during world war ii
Aug 1 2023,positive,this movie is truly a master class in film making christopher nolans writing and directing is spot on the way he weaves a story forward and backward is brilliant the only puzzling thing for me is why did it take this long to have the story told about a brilliant conflicted self destructive and tormented individual
Aug 1 2023,positive,great story amazing cinematography
Aug 1 2023,positive,this was a great movie i would recommend seeing it
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie but it seemed like there was too much going on at one time
Aug 1 2023,positive,kept me interested  wanting to see what outcome was long movie wouldnt liked a 5 minute intermission
Aug 1 2023,negative,could have done it in 60 minutes
Aug 1 2023,positive,great history flick
Aug 1 2023,positive,was a great look into the man behind the historic event
Aug 1 2023,negative,wow way more information about oppenheimer than i ever wanted to know  the constant back and forth between his early days to older days was not easy to keep track of too many charactersscenes and many scenes could have easily been left out and not hurt story no real i can see to shoot this in imax imho
Aug 1 2023,positive,first 2 hours very fast paced last hour was perfectly timed  lots of characters and names to remember so pay attention  great content and acting
Aug 1 2023,positive,best movie i have seen in years too long for me
Aug 1 2023,positive,imax added nothing disappointed considering all tjrnhype
Aug 1 2023,positive,this is one of nolans best works since memento a beautiful film and amazing story this is why we still need movie theaters
Aug 1 2023,negative,great acting but perhaps they should have hired an editor  2 hour movie for some reason presented as a 3 hour movie  boringaf  skip the first hour you wont miss anything  also absolutely no need to view in imax all just absurd hype
Aug 1 2023,positive,this movie is brilliant and intense it will make you think
Aug 1 2023,positive,a must see profoundly well made
Aug 1 2023,positive,riveting thrilling mind blowing and an excellent tension filled drama

Aug 1 2023,positive,really like the historic information in the movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,the plot the score the visuals everything about this movie was great also love the stacked cast
Aug 1 2023,negative,the movie was racist made by a british director with the animus against indians the movie seems like oppenheimer theorized black holes whereas in reality black holes or first terrorists by chandrashakar and indian scientist the movie also quotes from the hindu holy scripture in hey sex scene which is not how and when oppenheimer actually said the line    moreover most of the movie takes place in a conference room and is not worth filming an imax or 70 mm the story is largely about oppenheimers political trials as opposed to the making of the bomb which was a big letdown
Aug 1 2023,positive,honest portrayal of oppenheimers contribution dilemma and subsequent betrayal by the government
Aug 1 2023,positive,a true masterpiece maybe the most important film ive ever watched

Aug 1 2023,positive,fascinating story but the first half was very disjointed and hard to follow to the point we became confused however once they got to los alamos we were on the edge of our seats
Aug 1 2023,positive,i loved it in every way
Aug 1 2023,positive,well made and the sound editing was incredible the nuditysex scenes were unnecessary im no prude but where theres no romance theres no need for gratuitous sex scenes especially when you consider there were basically only 2 main women characters neither of which were portrayed in any sort of positive way
Aug 1 2023,positive,well acted factual script
Aug 1 2023,positive,knew he was involved with the atomic bomb but was not aware he was treated so badly by politicians afterwards very surprised  acting of lead actor was very good
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie with a ton of star power was a little slow moving at times there were also points in the movie where the score was so overwhelming it was almost uncomfortable overall it was a very well executed movie all around great acting and nolan is an incredible director
Aug 1 2023,positive,the acting was insane  the effects were stunning
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent 3 hours passed quickly love all the actors with great roles great chemistry

Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie was quite powerful in telling the oppenheimer story  however the jumping timeline was distracting and difficult to watch  also the nude sexual scenes were unnecessary  they did not add any redeeming value to the film
Aug 1 2023,positive,this movie was made for theaters oppenheimer is an incredible movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,love historical movies where you learn more about the person and event that are not in history books learn  feel how it felt
Aug 1 2023,positive,amazing movie historical
Aug 1 2023,positive,nolan did an amazing job of dramatizing oppenheimers tumultuous life and the situations he faced this film brings to light the underappreciated importance of j robert oppenheimer and his work
Aug 1 2023,positive,the story and how badly he was treated after wwii
Aug 1 2023,positive,great cinematography  score excellent scripdialogue just a little slow at times

Aug 1 2023,positive,engrossing historical drama about the making of the first atomic bombs j robert oppenheimer was a complex man this movie depicts him with all his human qualities and his human frailties excellent acting by a accomplished ensemble great direction by christopher nolan its 3 hours long but the time flew by

Aug 1 2023,negative,marketing has overhyped this film
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent movie i expected it to be a bit boring but it really held my attention for the full 3 hours  casting was perfect
Aug 1 2023,negative,we arrived at the theater a half hour before the show started but by the time i got a parking spot it was already 45 minutes into the show needless to say i didnt get to see the movie at all
Aug 1 2023,positive,i agree with others  it was a very long movie the story is good the movie is good its just long i could suggest a few scenes  miniature side storylines to cut out very surprised to find out who played lewis strauss  totally didnt recognize him until someone pointed it out afterwards
Aug 1 2023,positive,im not quite sure how to rate this i did go see it in the 11milelong 70mm imax at the chinese theater so its hard to beat a better viewing    im not a big fan of nolans general outlook as i dont think he really provides insight or takes us anywhere useful on the human condition its not that he is dark its that he is pessimistic and offers no solution i dont think he knows how to show human joy or warmth or real love  memento with the elderly couple and the insulin shots might be his best and only real example    what i do respect about oppenheimer is that it is an original blockbuster film all practical effects gets people excited and to the theater to see a movie about history gets people to watch an intellectually dense film about physicists talking about politics and science and leaves people sad  thats quite a feat in 2023    i did leave thinking about the movie and reflecting about growing up tangentally around physicists my best friends dad and his friends excited about solving problems on how the universe works and then how the insane system we live in manipulates that i just wish nolan was capable of tapping into something that leads people to think about potential positive change rather than dwelling and sulking in a grand way im left wondering why put all this energy skill and effort of you arent doing more to fit into and guide the cultural zeitgeist if he could do that the he truly would be epic
Aug 1 2023,positive,would definitely watch again
Aug 1 2023,positive,was a powerful film but too loud
Aug 1 2023,positive,fantastic movie all around the cast is incredible with every pivotal character being played by a well known actor i didnt want the move to end i plan on seeing it one more time while its still in the theaters do yourself a favor and see it on imax or jbx
Aug 1 2023,neutral,just not up to the hype for me
Aug 1 2023,positive,riveting race for science and humanity that turns into thriller
Aug 1 2023,positive,oppenheimer portrayed robert oppenheimers strengths  eg a brilliant mind a compassion for the victims of the atomic bomb a dedication to the united states an encompassing optimism about the manhattan project and his shortcomings eg his inability to steer away from temptations his workaholism his primary focus on theory      it is a movie that i want to see again since there are  many facets of the film that are still unclear to me
Aug 1 2023,negative,not sure what the hype was about this movie definitely could have been condensed instead of a 3 hour movie
Aug 1 2023,negative,pretentious crappy sound crappy format crappy dialogue crappy cuts complete waste of big screen the most overhyped movie of all time we walked and got a refund after essentially suffocating for over an hour
Aug 1 2023,positive,fantastic movie following the trials and tribulations of oppenheimer

Aug 1 2023,positive,started a little slow really like most of the movie then the last 30 minutes got long  very historically accurate encourage people to see it just have patience with the end
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was exciting and very intense to watch it did not seem to be 3 hours long it should be nominated for best picture cillian murphy was excellent and should be nominated for an academy award  the movie was very accurate about the events i would definitely see it again

Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent movie acting was phenomenal
Aug 1 2023,positive,amazing nolan at his best
Aug 1 2023,positive,oppenheimera counterpoint saw this christopher nolan opus a week after everyone else though theaters are still selling out yes it was epic but it would have been so much more engaging if someone else took over the editing and scoring     issues  1 for much of the film an overly melodramatic soundtrack drones on to excess like an opera it often detracts from the scenes and can drown out dialogue the drowningout may have been because of where we satmaybe we were too close to the surround sound speakersi dunno   2 often editingpacing felt off  3 way too much dialogue the visuals should have told more of the story   4 too many charactershard to keep track     there are some riveting scenes example oppenheimer meets  president truman in the oval office another masterful cameo from human chameleon gary oldman no music just good timing pacing camera work and editing the testing of the bomb is also a showstopper     its still worth a look many great performances forsure oscar noms for robert downey jr and emily blunt but too many gimmicks over substance im wondering what someone like mike nichols could have done with all this footage
Aug 1 2023,positive,2nd time i watched it but this time i decided to watch it in a standard movie theater definitely see the difference in sound and image going to watch it this weekend again but in imax
Aug 1 2023,positive,this is an excellent movie  very riveting  the whole three hours went by very fast  will get academy awards nominations
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie for the first 2 hours full of fascinating history and science held my interest  last hour was 100 politics i got a little bored with it
Aug 1 2023,positive,movie story was excellent actors for the most part outstanding in their parts however the music constantly playing drown out the speaking line so unable to hear a lot of the time  also the sex scenes were over played and his communist involvement with this character underplayed as this womanizing and his wife being a dues paying commie seemed to be his downfall  interesting how the government took over instantly when the bomb finally worked and he was no longer needed  he realized he wasnt the big cheese any longer
Aug 1 2023,positive,acting was great but could have focused more on  the need for the weapon and what the world was going through at the time
Aug 1 2023,positive,homerun acting dialogue everything
Aug 1 2023,negative,to long and boring movie felt rushed
Aug 1 2023,positive,oppenheimer is a good representation of robert oppenheimers character personality and motivation such an important aspect of wwii his was a service not only to the allies but the world as wellan important history lesson
Aug 1 2023,positive,it wasnt bad a little too long great acting
Aug 1 2023,positive,great storyline and incredible performances
Aug 1 2023,positive,more than a spectacle film though it does have those elements its more about the thoughts of the man a really great view into the struggle of a man that must come to grips with the world ending power of his own creation
Aug 1 2023,positive,its worth seeing but its super long and i found it to be somewhat confusing unless you know your history jumped around a lot i still enjoyed it though
Aug 1 2023,positive,historically very accurate the visual aesthetics were on point the acting is phenomenal definitely an oscar contender in several categories
Aug 1 2023,positive,did not take my eyes off the screen once during the three hours christopher nolan  cast beautifully told this story 70mm is a must for this film
Aug 1 2023,positive,start to finish an outstanding cast and acting with a screenplay that finally tells the story of what a great patriot oppenheimer was to the world
Aug 1 2023,negative,this movie was boring to watch for most of the runtime  maybe if i knew the historical story behind oppenheimer then it would be more interesting to me but after they tested the bomb the movie went into politics and such which just made it undesirable to watch for another hour the movie seemed to be overhyped for a documentary ps do not get a seat at an end of a row for an imax movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent movie acting was spot on
Aug 1 2023,negative,an uninteresting story poorly told but at least its in imax

Aug 1 2023,positive,this astonishing movie gripped me from the first moment to the last  a visually stunning experience combined with wonderful acting made this a topnotch movie experience
Aug 1 2023,positive,another work of papa nolan once in a while there are some comfortable movies having said that nolan has captured the details of the era before during and after world war ii very well the movie is fun where the events of the past and the present are interchanged elevate tension from gentle to strong pounding its a pity that i dont have the luck to go see imax it will get more emotion
Aug 1 2023,positive,entertaining way to learn history a little long but it kept my attention
Aug 1 2023,positive,i rarely gush about a film but what an incredible piece of art the craft behind this film is breathtaking then there is the cast it has been some time since a films ensemble of actors has been this good  every one of them at the top of their game see it
Aug 1 2023,positive,engrossing multilayered story of a complicated genius who evolved over time
Aug 1 2023,positive,master piece how to take drama to a whole new level with character interactions and the final scene is perfect

Aug 1 2023,positive,kept my attention 3 hours went by in a flash great plot and great acting
Aug 1 2023,negative,overly dramatic trying to hard long and tedious trying to convert a villain into a antihero all this handwringing about his humanity  not his ego and selfishness

Aug 1 2023,positive,outstanding acting and screenplay  story remained consistent with his life events as i understand them to be beautiful cinematography
Aug 1 2023,positive,entertaining and engaging a bit too loud in imax
Aug 1 2023,neutral,first act was hard to follow third act felt unrelated to the rest of the film
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent performances by each actor story one to be understood  painful in many ways changed the world you judge for better or worse  oppenheimer a confused character
Aug 1 2023,positive,the acting is on point for all the alist stars  i had no idea about his story until this movie came out
Aug 1 2023,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed the movie the acting was excellent and the story entertaining patience is required to follow the changes in the timeline but i felt it was well worth it the nudity was unnecessary in my opinion
Aug 1 2023,positive,good film a very montage approach to the first 23 of the film then it takes on an oliver stone aesthetic in the final act the imax music overpowered the film ill enjoy it more at home making the connections to tenet and interstellar a
Aug 1 2023,positive,this 3hour movie devoid of fast paced action flew by  the dialog casting acting directing editing and virtually ever other aspect of this film were superb  best movie ive seen this year
Aug 1 2023,positive,three hours was a bit long without an intermission otherwise a must see
Aug 1 2023,positive,very interesting good acting and storyline however it was too long story could have been told in less time

Aug 1 2023,positive,i thought the film aligns with the all of the elements that make for great cinema i think the length of the film was bit extensive
Aug 1 2023,positive,overall disappointed the editing made the film hard to followtoo much jumping around and i think that robert downing jrs character though well acted was given too much screen time
Aug 1 2023,positive,riveting had no idea the 3 hours could go so quickly
Aug 1 2023,positive,well written and incredible portrayal of a very important piece of american history the acting was excellent by not jus the key players but supporting cast i recommend this movie to everyone
Aug 1 2023,positive,too long and not what i expected
Aug 1 2023,positive,interesting and disturbing very long movie extremely well acted and directed would recommend
Aug 1 2023,positive,an absolute masterpiece a film that will be remembered and shared for generations
Aug 1 2023,positive,amazing movie the only negative is i think they could have easily told the story in less than 3 hours nolan did a great job of keeping a good pace so it didnt feel as long as it actually is but still a very long movie that didnt need to be 3 hours like every 3 hour movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,i didnt particularly like the many flashbacks of his life  it sometimes was confusing  but otherwise the movie was terrific with wonderful acting from all the characters in the movie  definitely an oscar contender
Aug 1 2023,positive,well done and historically relevant
Aug 1 2023,positive,loved it excellent acting
Aug 1 2023,positive,very well done and interesting especially for the older crowd  young audiences may find it a little boring  those of us who lived through that time can appreciate the history detail and insight into the personalities last part of the film events that took place after sept of 1945 explore how o was treated badly and takeaway is that not much has changed regarding political bias and corruption the moral dilemma could have been explored more but a 3 hour movie was enough and i ran out of popcorn
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent casting performances sound and score imagery both fantastic and gritty emotional and brainy
Aug 1 2023,positive,creat acting  very informative   entertaining
Aug 1 2023,negative,it was redundant and boring i did not enjoy it at all
Aug 1 2023,positive,terrific acting  the movie was historically honest
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent story and very entertaining even with its length great acting and very visually appealing and creative a little hard to follow some of the characters motives  allegiances the moral dilemma and feeling responsible for the development of such a weapon is mind bogglingwell presented  as a history buff i really enjoyed this one
Aug 1 2023,positive,the plot is super tight and its played out by some bigname actors who totally knock it out of the park itll get you thinking about war especially the scary nuclear kind and it really shows how human quirks can affect work affair    the music is pretty awesome but man at certain spots it cranks up so much that youre left struggling to catch what the actors are saying a bit of a downer when youre engrossed in the plot  the movies a gem thatll get you thinking and feeling in all the right ways
Aug 1 2023,positive,i loved the accuracy of the story as i understand it though it was a dark time in our history that made me sad and reflective
Aug 1 2023,positive,great performances and a powerful telling of the tremendous scientific development that inspired an equally tremendous conflict between discovery and implementation
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie is very long3 hours the script is very wordythe geniuss speak and you have to listen closely to keep up the academy will love this movie and it will be nominated for many oscars for its history and true story factor not for everyoneit has no action is steady and a chronicle of the facts
Aug 1 2023,positive,very interesting piece of history that i was unaware of  i felt the nuditysex scenes were not necessary  the dialogue could have been done in a different clothed setting  took away from the film in my opinion  other than those scenes the movie was very good  fabulous acting by cillian murphy and robert downey jr 
Aug 1 2023,positive,liked the story and the photography as well as the acting disliked the length of the film as i saw several dialogue scenes that did not add to the storyline and could have been cut
Aug 1 2023,positive,great film but unnecessarily loud
Aug 1 2023,positive,good movie the beginning was a little hard to follow because it goes back and forth between different time periods if you dont know anything about history i recommend watching or reading a short bio about oppenheimer before watching which is what i did
Aug 1 2023,positive,good movie great acting worth seeing
Aug 1 2023,positive,i would have rated it 45 stars if possible the thing that i think the filmmakers did to the detriment of the film was they were too kind to oppenheimer himself i felt like they reached to create too much empathy for a very flawed person who made or had a huge hand in a lot of his problems and who lets face it unleashed hell on earth with his creation
Aug 1 2023,negative,the dialogue was 80 exposition  it felt like i was watching a 3 hour trailer
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie but a bit long a few scene could have been left on the cutting room floor and a few others could have been shortened having said that i would go see it again
Aug 1 2023,positive,well done a good history lesson a number of top movie stars the movies pace is very good
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was interesting but it was too long  the administrative hearing scenes could have been cut or minimized
Aug 1 2023,neutral,fairly usual superficial hollywood treatment reviewed as if its profound tells oppenheimers story during which we are subjected to his makes girlfriend and his fleeting thoughts about the morality of building a nuclear bomb nothing new here
Aug 1 2023,positive,very compelling but the nudity was not really necessary
Aug 1 2023,positive,i enjoyed the duel story telling of the movie however it could have been done with at least 45mins cut out so we could het to the point quicker acting was great just too long
Aug 1 2023,positive,start to finish a masterpiece
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent story and acting academy award contender
Aug 1 2023,negative,the music was very distracting and run time was long and tedious
Aug 1 2023,positive,imax experience and the intensity with moral dilemma
Aug 1 2023,positive,really enjoyed the movie nolan took a book that was a biography and made it into an experience amazing
Aug 1 2023,negative,need subtitles   to long
Aug 1 2023,positive,everything about this movie is fantastic
Aug 1 2023,positive,good movie  lots of details i did not know  the sex scenes are just not needed  i think it took away from the picture
Aug 1 2023,positive,captured the time critical nature of the pursuit and the associated horror of the achievement my sincere appreciation to the director and writers who avoided the need to overwhelm us with the carnage
Aug 1 2023,negative,background music was way way too loud  it was difficult following what the actors were saying several other folks who saw the movie said the same thing  i would like to have seen the movie under normal conditions but would not recommend it because of the loud music
Aug 1 2023,positive,great acting  just 1 hour too long  the last hour was the best  wind up was just too slow for me
Aug 1 2023,positive,intense story  each actors brought to life their particular famous individuals that i only read about in history books cilllian murphy was excellent as oppenheimer  deserves award recognition long but holds your attention
Aug 1 2023,positive,best i have seen agessound was a bit sketchy it at times seemed to fade in and out but do not miss this film it should sweep oscars
Aug 1 2023,positive,overly long overly dramatic and unnecessary nude scenes but entertaining very interesting story and people
Aug 1 2023,positive,i thought it was very well made and the actors were fantastic
Aug 1 2023,positive,very well done with excellent acting long movie on a very difficult time
Aug 1 2023,neutral,its a paradox too broad and too shallow at the same time
Aug 1 2023,positive,accurately represents history of one of the most important events of all time well acted and directed should be the best movie of the year
Aug 1 2023,positive,oppenheimer is a great movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,give this movie alllllllllll the oscars this year it was beautifully done i took my 13 year old and he loved it
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie wouldve been excellent if it had only been about an hour shorter the acting was superb
Aug 1 2023,negative,the sound editing was a little hit and miss the script too fastpaced no time to take in what had just happened and the acting around cillian murphy was questionable i couldnt invest in the characters matt damon and robert downey jr as stanley tucci were playing branagh was brilliant as expected and murphy was good as oppenheimer but he slipped into peaky blinders territory occasionally with his accent which made me think i was watching tommy shelby blows up the world i fear many critics watched this from a viewpoint of it being a chris nolan movie about a very important period in americas history however films about important moments still should be entertaining this was too much like a lecture on oppenheimer and the dangers of nuclear weaponry
Aug 1 2023,positive,exceptionally well done fresh treatment of time frames great script and acting and cinematography and imax sound best role ever for robert downey jr
Aug 1 2023,positive,great watch and such a great story thats told
Aug 1 2023,positive,i was drawn into this film within minutes the cinematography is incredible the story wasnt unnecessarily dramatized murphy downey blunt and damon were brilliant as were all the supporting cast it was especially great to see tom conti the story unfolded flawlessly 2 bombs were dropped one was the trinity test the other rami malek dropped in the court room it was intense
Aug 1 2023,positive,truly one of the best movies i have seen in a very very long time the 3 hour run time might sound intimidating but the movie was so good it really didnt feel that long 1010
Aug 1 2023,positive,near perfect movie the cast and score were brilliant the story was thought provoking and really leaves an impression as you leave the theater
Aug 1 2023,positive,a little too long however cillian murphy was amazing as always
Aug 1 2023,positive,phenomenal movie perfect casting and extremely well directed kept me engrossed the entire time and never got overly complicated cinematography was beautiful as well
Aug 1 2023,positive,great cast in a movie less about the beginning of the atomic age and more about the great and flawed personalities of the times  i did not recognize robert downey jr until halfway through the movie he did such a great job as older lewis straus  i would not be surprised to see downey earn an award for best supporting actor the story line seemed so real and plausible that i wish i had lived through that time so i could compare the movie to personal experience  my only complaint was the ending  oppenheimers motives for a passive approach one could almost say martyrlike approach to the security hearing were never fully explained  and his rehabilitation is glossed over at the very end
Aug 1 2023,positive,best movie glued from start to finish typically not my kind of movie but this was fabulous well done was sad when it was over
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie was fresh music dialog music costume framing setting great casting cutbacks sound dialog made to take in like a blockbuster with every action hitting the right note dialog fresh and moving the action forward great music score fantastic special effects exceptional shooting casting choices and pace i was reeled in and had to see it a second time in imax theatre to get the impact it was meant to have would recommend in several oscar categories and will be reading the novel it was derived from for original content and more fleshed out details absolutely riveting as a film fan and music lover
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie is great the pacing of telling this complex character is what made this movie shine the biggest disappointment to the movie is the non stop music at times its necessary but other scenes the dialogue is hard to hear and downplayed a bit because of it shouldve casted hans zimmer but this movie delivers one of my new favorite classic nolan endings
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was more of a history lesson could have used a little more excitement for a 3 hour movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,the acting was great and the story was intriguing
Aug 1 2023,positive,would have been better on netflix as series
Aug 1 2023,positive,great historical movie  interesting and spell binding
Aug 1 2023,positive,engaging intelligent terrific acting across the board tense wellpaced
Aug 1 2023,positive,i loved it enough to see it twice
Aug 1 2023,positive,movie was long it was entertaining a bit of history that we seem to forget about
Aug 1 2023,positive,absolute must watch
Aug 1 2023,negative,oppenheimer was about 15 hours too long
Aug 1 2023,positive,what is a good movie with a solid story at times it may have felt a bit long well worth watching
Aug 1 2023,positive,the film makes every scene feel as important and intense as the last scene for 3 hours making it work in amazing ways and cillian murphy is phenomenal in the lead
Aug 1 2023,positive,its a wellacted film with a great cast  but it doesnt feel the full history of the situation
Aug 1 2023,positive,absolutely fantastic
Aug 1 2023,positive,a good film with a lot of reasons to like it it was a bit long on the details which held it back from being a great film the beginning jumped around more than it needed to and im not sure helped the story much once it got going the film displayed oppenheimer as the complex and interesting person he was the responsibilities he dealt with are monumental imagine a world where we lost the race for the bomb to the germans  it puts the importance of the manhattan project into a starkly different reality than many of us consider     they could have left out the poison apple for the professor that likely never happened but many will unfortunately remember oppenheimer was a lot of things but nothing ive read suggests any inclinations toward violence
Aug 1 2023,negative,movie jumps back and forth alot without always being clear sound mix was awful had to plug my ears multiple times if i knew that it was going to be another tenet volume movie would not have seen it heard the book follows a linear progression which should have been fine for all the actors that put in great performances
Aug 1 2023,positive,very well written and directed and keeps you engaged the entire movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,movie was great actors and actresses did a fantastic job  only negative its loud
Aug 1 2023,positive,powerful and moving beautifully acted and shot left me with a subtle but deep feeling of uneasiness about the future and the world weve created for ourselves oblivious that we are all now just a few mistakes or misunderstandings away from oblivion and have been for several decades
Aug 1 2023,positive,oppenheimer is a film that has a stacked cast that never goes to waste every performance is a 1010 nolan is at his best and id be surprised if the entire production doesnt yield countless awards fastest 3 hour movie youll see
Aug 1 2023,positive,some of the dream or flashback scenes were strange and didnt add to the story  also the fact that the reason the decision was made to use the bombs to end the war quickly was good to hear the fact that this movie was neither pro or anti of the use of the weapons
Aug 1 2023,positive,i enjoyed it idk how truly historically accurate the movie is but i thought the acting and set were excellent
Aug 1 2023,positive,as near a perfect movie as ive seen a must watch and it never felt too long
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie with a star studded cast
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie  even though its 3 hours long the movie moves along and is very engaging
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was an absolutely magnificent movie that is sure to take away multiple oscars everything about it was top notch including the acting cinematography music etc the story was also fascinating it is an absolute must see
Aug 1 2023,positive,great cast gripping story
Aug 1 2023,positive,a deep look into a very complex man dealing with very complex times a race to beat the nazis in the development of an atomic bomb leaves the us with a working device after germany surrenders one third of this movie deals with oppenheimers education and professorship at the university of california at berkeley one third is devoted to the development of an atomic bomb actually two kinds of bomb the last third deals with the aftermath of using the bomb on japan no summary can encompass all of the complexity of this movie warning if you really want to understand whats going on read up before seeing this movie because christopher nolan is not going to spell it out for you
Aug 1 2023,positive,this movie is beyond amazing
Aug 1 2023,positive,its not a movie for everyone but its fantastically thrilling i didnt even notice the 3 hours
Aug 1 2023,positive,amazing  for a nonaction movie it keeps you in your seat for the whole three hours   you will not want to get up go visit the concession stand or restroom  its that good
Aug 1 2023,positive,superb acting historical costuming fantastic movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,we both really liked it  learned some important info
Aug 1 2023,positive,disliked the moments of extreme volume literally hurt my ears but it was a great movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,believe it was essentially historically accurate liked the tension in the script over the morality of going forward with project
Aug 1 2023,positive,amazing movie  watched it on 70mm and it made the movie even better
Aug 1 2023,positive,good movie but i cant give a full review due to old people not shutting up during the movie  yes that was an atomic bomb going off no need to announce it to everyone  i dealt with that the whole movie  explaining the obvious to themselves  please old people if you cant hear go to a showing that has cc available  if your mind is mush and you dont understand wtf is going on wait until your home shows the movie  seriously other people do exist in your world and we arent npcs
Aug 1 2023,positive,loved the entire experience  it was slightly difficult to follow the plot in some places where they chronologically jumped and keep track of each nuance but thats what made the intellectual stimulation a cut above most movies  the acting was superb
Aug 1 2023,negative,way way way too long  stretched the story out too much  too many close ups of oppenheimers face   not the epic everyone says  hollywood loving hollywood not theater goers
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie was great but the theater experience not so much  the volume was so loud it made it difficult to sit through the movie   unpleasant experience
Aug 1 2023,positive,i thought it was pretty boring and slow and fell asleep  however my husband loved it
Aug 1 2023,positive,star studded cast score was great and cillian murphy is exceptional as always
Aug 1 2023,positive,very long movie but it was good probably a movie i would have waited to see at home acoustics were crazy good though
Aug 1 2023,neutral,watched in in imax and the sound was very loud at times even the music seemed to drown out the dialouge in many scenes scenes jumped around the time line too much for me plotlines went unanswered couldve been better
Aug 1 2023,positive,cilia murphy was a great choice  movie kept me on edge of seat even though i knew what happened  good historical piece
Aug 1 2023,positive,just a couple of spots in the movie where the musicsound effects overwhelmed the dialogue also the theatre had the volume up way too high took away from what would have been a great expeience cant wait until it streams so we can turn on cc
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie was great everything from the acting the sound the music the cinematography the directing the casting and of course the story being told
Aug 1 2023,positive,very good as good as begins and dunkirk not as good as dk and interstellar
Aug 1 2023,positive,great screen play great music great performances   interesting details about interesting people in interesting times
Aug 1 2023,positive,a little too long still a great film
Aug 1 2023,positive,id give 10 stars if i could
Aug 1 2023,positive,well scripted and excellent cast special effects were amazing  not often a 3 hour movie can keep you this captivated came home and researched more on oppenheimer  seems the movie well supported the reality
Aug 1 2023,positive,i had problems at first with the movie going back and forth with time once i figured out how to tell what time the movie was in really enjoyed the movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,i found myself looking at the floor a little too often unnecessarily long and the nonstop music was distracting could use some editing and focus in the storyline otherwise the talent was good within their respective roles
Aug 1 2023,positive,brilliantly acted and directed a long movie but positively worth the concentration needed to understand a bit of the story of one of americas less understood thinkers and activists
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was a long slow movie in uncomfortable chairs they probably could have shaved about an hour off the screen time
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was great mind expanding and it went fast for a longer movie star packed
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent acting story screenplay music nolan does it again never fails
Aug 1 2023,positive,i know its named oppenheimer but i was hoping for a little more detail in the science and the manhattan project and less of a biopic
Aug 1 2023,positive,the music overwhelming the dialogue was very distracting at times  i really enjoyed the unfolding of the story of the 1st a bomb but the whole congressional inquiry could easily have been skipped or an entirely different film
Aug 1 2023,positive,it felt like i was watching the directors cut of a film  it was just too long needed a better edit  i was able to see glimpses of a what couldve been a really good movie but it was dragged down with way to much superfluous bits of story as to make it bland  nice job by all actors especially rob downey jr
Aug 1 2023,positive,spectacular performances and a great script are just part of how good this movie really is  completely relevant in todays time of war and an indifference to death  the movie sheds just a small light on the fact that as human beings we are responsible for the fate of this world and that even though everyone has personal struggles and flaws we have to ensure there is a future for those who come after us
Aug 1 2023,positive,chris nolan doesnt know how to make a bad film truly excellent work
Aug 1 2023,neutral,it was well written but long and tedious also the sex scenes were unnecessary apart from creating a dichotomy from oppenheimers intellectual capacity and primitive state it deemed him there was an eerie silence in the theater during the explosion the movie failed to capture the tribal positions of the time from communism and democracy racism in europe and asia and how the usa lived out their superiority and racism in oppenheimers fear of one country having so much potential power
Aug 1 2023,positive,the actors were simply outstanding  the film was just magnificent and is easily the best movie i have seen in a decade the movie will win multiple academy awards it is a must see if you are even remotely interest in this part of our history the film brings to life a whole different era just great work
Aug 1 2023,negative,the only decent parts of the movie are the ones shown in the trailers there is a 2 hour documentary streaming on peacock right now that is more entertaining and you wont have to pay 35 for 2 tickets to the imax theater
Aug 1 2023,positive,great move starts off a bit confusing but it all becomes clear
Aug 1 2023,positive,wow incredible movie  im still reviewing it my mind a week after i saw it  thought provoking  well done
Aug 1 2023,positive,more than a movie feels like an event with 70mm imax
Aug 1 2023,positive,suspend suspenseful dramatic great acting thick plot intense heartwarming and action packed
Aug 1 2023,negative,all men hard to hear dialogue too long
Aug 1 2023,positive,oppenhemer is one of those moves that keeps you on the edge of your seat even if you already know the whole story
Aug 1 2023,positive,so immersively historical
Aug 1 2023,positive,good historical story
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was a complex story told in an absolutely riveting style
Aug 1 2023,positive,the acting is top notch as well as the music
Aug 1 2023,neutral,painfully slow moving story and a bit self involved most of the story centers around the politics and his own inner demons
Aug 1 2023,positive,good storyline flow
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie awesome acting solid accurate story long movie time but never a dull moment
Aug 1 2023,neutral,hii wanted to love this all the great actor performances and the subject matteri am a history nerd  i thought there were so many good parts but i felt like they put in a blender on puree and the show seemed unnecessarily long  i feel guilty giving this review because there is so much garbage out there you want to reward this content with 5 stars but in the end being honest i could not
Aug 1 2023,positive,astounding movie  script acting cinematography sound musical scoring all perfect   must see in imax  70mm might be even better
Aug 1 2023,positive,very interesting  the film was more about oppenheimer then i expected  we enjoyed the movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,i liked all the suspense of the movie and the surround sound
Aug 1 2023,positive,i enjoyed learning about the trials he endured after the bomb was detonated rather than the focus on the bomb i had no idea he went through that
Aug 1 2023,positive,amazing story telling acting was amazing
Aug 1 2023,positive,this is an accurate movie about oppenheimers evolving views of the atomic bomb and early associations with american communists the first part of the movie is slow the sex scenes add no value and are distracting whats missing is a better telling of his relationship with teller teller had more to do with oppenheimers loss of status as the godfather of atomic research
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie and script the atom bomb going off was a little anticlimatic for me but was still really cool
Aug 1 2023,positive,oppenheimers portrayal didnt shy too far from the book it is a dark film in a lot of respects but shows how far we have come in a nuclear age  unfortunately
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie was everything i expected and more great script great acting across the board the movie was successful at telling a very complex story and left me wanting to know more the ending visual of earth was chilling
Aug 1 2023,positive,fantastic movie held your interest for entire 3 hours historically accurate
Aug 1 2023,positive,good movie very long tho
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was a great bio pic on oppenheimer if youre expecting a movie about the manhattan project exclusively this is not it the movie is about oppenheimer
Aug 1 2023,positive,loved the details in the story
Aug 1 2023,positive,loved it  even better the 2nd time i saw it
Aug 1 2023,positive,i saw this in 70mm not imax at regal kingstowne in alexandria va liked the movie but the quality of the picture and sound in that theater was terrible there was a constant rain of colored streaks from the film down the middle of the screen the entire movie the sound quality was so bad we missed a lot of the dialogue read an article saying that this would be a good format but it would have been better to see in digital or dolby at least at this theater
Aug 1 2023,positive,powerful story in american history that wasnt being taught in schools although the movie seemed somewhat slow with character building and lacked exciting moments even when the bomb was finally tested and used  happy the story was told but could have waited to stream at home
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent story telling about what the movement behind the bombs development was all about
Aug 1 2023,positive,nolan got inside oppenheimers head and showed us what we can only assume was his intense nonstop reality  the fast paced dialogue and music kept this 3 hour masterpiece moving along at a decent clip  weaving together the historical data and drama makes for a stellar cinematic experience  looking forward to many rewatches
Aug 1 2023,positive,a little longer than it had to be     butwonderfully done
Aug 1 2023,positive,kept my interest from beginning to end  even though i knew the history looked forward to seeing how the story would be told
Aug 1 2023,positive,great acting great directing great movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent  fast paced  characters were outstanding  one of the best films of the decade
Aug 1 2023,positive,great story easy to follow filming theater a bit load volume wise
Aug 1 2023,positive,movie was great but volume level in theater was way too high
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent movie stunning acting and incredible cast
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie great acting  maybe a hair too long
Aug 1 2023,neutral,sound volume so loud in theater would hurt your ears content was more about the political stuff than the science part
Aug 1 2023,positive,amazing movie start to finish the weaving of the 3 acts giving us the betrayal twist and the picturesque new mexico backdrops were phenomenal and one of the best movies ever acting performancewise murphy rdj pugh damon malek all amazing a film
Aug 1 2023,negative,too disjointed and long
Aug 1 2023,positive,i thought this was one of the most riveting films ive seen in a very long time cillian murphy was astonishing christopher nolans story telling is superior the camera work a 3 hour movie and i never looked at my watch love it
Aug 1 2023,positive,superb acting and direction held our rapt attention throughout the 3 hours
Aug 1 2023,negative,very hard to understand most of the dialogue volume too high
Aug 1 2023,positive,amazing movie only complain would be the dialogue at times was not super clear with the music in the background
Aug 1 2023,positive,outstanding best film of the year fascinating full of great facts and depictions
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent movie well acted lots of details about oppenheimers history covered here that dont get mentioned anywhere else cinematography was beautiful
Aug 1 2023,positive,i recognize the skill and craftsmanship in this movie  my main complaint is that its actually too much for me i wanted a moment to breathe to get to know the characters things happens so fast  you really need to be dialed in to stay with the film but what it did for me is make me exhausted  it felt a bit like work and less about entertainment  the images are amazing  what i wanted to more of the human element  for example people meet theyre in bed  project is funded its underway  it spends no time letting you know the people    its definitely one of those movies you have to like because of the hype  at least this film makes sense see tenet
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent movie however important parts of his life werent covered and some things were covered too exhaustively  it was then very long and not complete
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was intense and very well done cillian murphy was fantastic stellar cast all performances were top notch
Aug 1 2023,positive,amazing cast and filmed beautifully
Aug 1 2023,positive,i liked the actors in the film i like the historical sense to the movie and the links between the characters the cinematography was amazing
Aug 1 2023,positive,love the sound  visual effects the actor who portrayed oppenheimer looks just like the actual man himself great movie and very accurate too
Aug 1 2023,positive,i think oppenheimer is a movie that has a lot of potential but just falls short a lot the first half of the movie you are introduced to so many characters that you cant keep up the movie had two scenes that kept me glued to my seat the bomb going off and the thank you speech other then that it was a lot to sit through for 3 hours
Aug 1 2023,positive,best acting and directing since the godfather
Aug 1 2023,negative,way too long my friends and i were ready to walk out after 2 hrs but good acting very poor job of depicting his life and accomplishments with an interesting and engaging script  look at the msnbc special on him for a much more entertaining and accurate experience
Aug 1 2023,positive,this was a great movie there were three scenes with nudity and pretty visual lovemaking it is too bad the producers and the director showed this much nudity you can act love scenes with more discression this cuts out many youth being able to watch it hollywood just cant seem to help themselves with stupid calls
Aug 1 2023,positive,loved learning the history   actors were phenomenal
Aug 1 2023,positive,mi ie was great  but it stopped midway and we had to leave due to they could not get film to restart
Aug 1 2023,positive,very well done three hours went fast
Aug 1 2023,positive,there was a lot of history and political culture i hadnt known  especially the role socialism and communism played at the time  late 30s early 40s  the cast of the movie was excellent  you hardly could recognize robert downey jr at first until you recognized that voice  the three hours went by fast  im seeing it again next week  i hadnt known the role los alamos played  learning the history was interesting especially because i went there in the 70s to be with a friend who was part of an experimental nuclear treatment for cancer  i found it all fascinating  and the message of the movie is  we dont know how close we are to selfdestruction
Aug 1 2023,positive,i expect that it will be taught in movie making schools for generations
Aug 1 2023,positive,good acting i had concern if i could stay awake for the whole 3 hours turns out the movie is so intriguing that my eyes are wide open the whole time
Aug 1 2023,positive,three hours of just talking scenes only 5 minutes of action the last hour bored me to tears it is not the movie advertised in the trailer
Aug 1 2023,positive,liked the story but it dragged on a little bit towards the ending
Aug 1 2023,positive,volume too loud  sensational scenes not necessary  couldnt hear dialogue  good acting  could have been better  dont recommend seeing in the theatre
Aug 1 2023,positive,best movie of the year
Aug 1 2023,positive,very good cast plot and historical content
Aug 1 2023,positive,fantastic performances and a really compelling story told against the backdrop of one of the defining events of the 20th century dialogueheavy but when the script is this good thats a benefit
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie was interesting as far as being authentic i think it was a bit long
Aug 1 2023,positive,great job of captivating the audience for those 3 hours showed us the entire process of oppenheimer and his team creating the atom bomb as well as the aftermath of what he was dealing with after just wish it was a little shorter 3 hours is a long time after all
Aug 1 2023,positive,so good  acting was top notch and the movie kept you intrigued the whole time
Aug 1 2023,positive,the acting was superb
Aug 1 2023,positive,complex compelling recounting of a pivotal moment in world history
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was hard to understand what i did understand i enjoyed it very much

Aug 1 2023,positive,very phenomenal film
Aug 1 2023,positive,the acting and cast were incredible the movie was great
Aug 1 2023,positive,for the subject matter to be a very secretive detailed part of history the movie conveyed the message and emotions in a truly entertaining way the cast was a huge superlative of the movie too
Aug 1 2023,positive,one of the best movies ive ever seen probably the best loved the actors and i watched the documentary on oppenheimer everyone played the best role at every level might be the best of all time
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie very intense and exciting one of the best movies ive ever seen
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was great but more of a melodrama about government politics
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie stellar cast i see this winning multiple oscars its a known story but that doesnt stop the engaging tome that this is how does a three hour movie sit well my butt wasnt numb and the last hour is very compelling
Aug 1 2023,positive,too long could have been an hour shorter
Aug 1 2023,positive,great acting and cinematography
Aug 1 2023,positive,one of the best movies ive ever seen great effect and even better acting
Aug 1 2023,positive,its a really good film but not awesome it needed to be a a 2 to 2 and a half hour long film it loses a lot of its impact by cramming in everything about oppenheimers life after the bomb is dropped and not flushing out his relationship with his wife and mistress one mans opinion see for yourself
Aug 1 2023,positive,a fascinating look at a complex man
Aug 1 2023,positive,quite well done with a focus on the interpersonal struggles  we will see this one again
Aug 1 2023,positive,good movie could have used fewer close ups of cillian murphys face tho
Aug 1 2023,positive,the first half was just too long and the entire florence pugh no deference to the actress who was great subplot was unnecessary from the point when they successfully tested the bomb right through the end was excellent
Aug 1 2023,positive,loved the movie very historical i dont mind nude scenes but without it the rating may not have been r so a younger audience could see it as well very educational and enthralling
Aug 1 2023,positive,movie everyone should see history in the making
Aug 1 2023,positive,a good biopic but dont see the advantage of seeing on imax 70mm  could easily watch at home for same effect   only one real bomb scene and its not that impressive  if you liked a beautiful mind youll enjoy this    so for the movie 5 stars for the hype  subtract two stars
Aug 1 2023,positive,way too long and repetitive hearing scene was repetitive
Aug 1 2023,positive,loved it it is a mustsee it is a cinematic masterpiece
Aug 1 2023,positive,a riveting story well told a reminder that the smartest minds are not always the wisest
Aug 1 2023,positive,fantastic acting great story seemed like two movies rolled in to one no doubt there will be academy award nods in its future
Aug 1 2023,positive,i loved this movie its about time they started making movies worth seeing again
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was a movie but fell short of the expected glamour associated with nolan
Aug 1 2023,negative,way too long and very complicated unless you know a lot about the history of the time period
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was a very interesting story but a bit too long imo
Aug 1 2023,positive,would have wished it was imx but lx theater was a good second choice
Aug 1 2023,positive,movie was excellence and well executed
Aug 1 2023,positive,the film is trying to appeal to various demographics and in the process becomes less focused and instead rather meandering
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie overall kept you engaged and even though it was 3 hours it went by quick  all wonderful actors and actresses
Aug 1 2023,positive,amazing amazing amazing it definitely lived up to the hype  the filmography was beautiful and the acting was spectacular
Aug 1 2023,positive,acting was really good the sound varied from good to too loud the image seemed to be bumpyjumping around a bit ion the 70 mm screen we watched
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent  in every aspect  didnt just faithfully retell the book it brought it to life fascinating compelling story gives much food for thought
Aug 1 2023,positive,good pacing good storyline
Aug 1 2023,positive,too slow and too long
Aug 1 2023,positive,great acting and story
Aug 1 2023,negative,painfully loud next to impossible to follow the storyline unless youve read the book
Aug 1 2023,positive,saw it in cinemark xd   good movie  3 hours long but it doesnt feel like it because it moves quickly  great story as well  excellent cast
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was an interesting movie but could have been shorter
Aug 1 2023,positive,great cast interesting coverage of an important historical topic
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent writing great acting cinemaphotography was amazing and the music score outstanding i expect it will receive several oscars
Aug 1 2023,negative,probably the most boring movie ive seen in decades literally 1 minute of any action and 2 hours and 59 minutes of cspan level dialogue i find it hard to believe this was directed by nolan
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie was extremely well written and the actors were really great the one thing i didnt like was the loud sound effects of bombs exploding
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was good and bad im a fan of history so this was informative and i learned things but its like watching a threehourlong movie trailer youre lucky to get more than a few contiguous minutes of a scene before it transitions to another time and place
Aug 1 2023,positive,would have liked the outcome listed after move before credits
Aug 1 2023,positive,gooda little long
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was remarkable acting parts of it were a little hard to follow its a long movie at 3 hours but you almost felt that parts of the story still didnt have time to be told if youre someone who really enjoys a character study movie and getting deep into the impact a person has on history and their interactions with the people in their life you will love this movie if youre someone who enjoys more action and more intrigue then you might not like this movie  as much
Aug 1 2023,positive,thought it was a great movie with a lot of information  there wasnt one actor or actress that played a bad part  it was a little long but i do understand that there was a lot of story to be told  i definitely couldve watched a new episode of this if it were a show every week for numerous weeks to make it even longer and give much more information and background  the soundmusic i think was one of the best parts it made everything so much more suspenseful
Aug 1 2023,positive,learned more about the story of the atomic bomb  well told great acting
Aug 1 2023,negative,extremely slow moving it is a 100 drama not suspense or action as the trailer kinda portrayed they assume you know all the characters as there isnt any character development for you to really understand the characters youre watching unnecessary nudity that didnt make sense they jump through 34 different time periods back and forth which is fine but you must tell the audience as a director what time period the scene is from at least one time he doesnt do that at all its focus for the majority of the 3hrs is about the political drama surrounding it rather than about the actual atomic bomb so you basically need to be a history buff or read an actual book about the events surrounding prior to actually understanding the characters youre watching and all of the dialogue
Aug 1 2023,positive,leading candidate for best picture of the year historically accurate and intriguing the events leading up to the trinity test were intense
Aug 1 2023,positive,great adult movie acting terrific
Aug 1 2023,positive,great acting and direction
Aug 1 2023,negative,it was more of soap opera rather than historical and scientific facts
Aug 1 2023,positive,fantastic story with great cast
Aug 1 2023,negative,too long almost 3 hours and very disjointedwith timeline flipping back and forth so much during the story
Aug 1 2023,positive,kind of slowtoo long

Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie overall however the background music or noises tended to overshadow what the actors were saying
Aug 1 2023,positive,the direction and acting was top tier
Aug 1 2023,positive,too long dragged in the middle if youre not a war history buff it wasnt great husband is im not hence 3 stars too too loud
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie was perfect as perfect as it can get the characters were superb the acting was superb the sound and story were superb the movie was brilliant nolan cillian downey and the film itself better win all the awards
Aug 1 2023,positive,good but not greatcould have been shorter and still been enough  its really more about his life than the actual bomb so set your expectations appropriately
Aug 1 2023,positive,loved it couldnt stop thinkingtalking about it the sound design is unreal  i was tingling for hours afterwards
Aug 1 2023,positive,too long with too much detail
Aug 1 2023,positive,movie was way too long  story was good but could have been cut back some
Aug 1 2023,positive,acting was just outstanding the movie moved along in an a way that was gripping

Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie loved it
Aug 1 2023,positive,bit long but great script excellent castvery thought provokng
Aug 1 2023,positive,oppenheimer is a true instant classic if you enjoy being engrossed in a story that truly pulls you in see it and see it in imax breathtaking acting visuals sound and score story and emotional impact off the charts
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie and definitely one you want to see in theaters
Aug 1 2023,positive,even though you know the outcome theres plenty of suspense the personal relationships and motivation for making the bomb were very interesting
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was excellent the directing and acting was top notch cilian murphy should definitely get an oscar nomination
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent acting  cinematography
Aug 1 2023,positive,a master at the top of his game nolan is running circles around everyone else i was left with the overwhelming sense that i had just seen a film that would be taught in classes marvelous control extremely memorable
Aug 1 2023,positive,an excellent fastpaced movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,was long but fabulous
Aug 1 2023,positive,mind atomically blown
Aug 1 2023,positive,great history especially for those of us who maybe didnt have a interest or knowledge of that time period
Aug 1 2023,negative,so boring left after 12 hour
Aug 1 2023,positive,will be nominated for an oscar
Aug 1 2023,positive,great acting stunning work from every perspective
Aug 1 2023,positive,just bought tickets to watch it again
Aug 1 2023,positive,too much on his fight after the war too little on making the bomb
Aug 1 2023,positive,long but gripping informative and sensational acting a major winner
Aug 1 2023,positive,absolutely amazing movie nolan filming is absolutely amazing and it is a work of art
Aug 1 2023,positive,love it great filmmaking and incredible story it will make you think about our current situation
Aug 1 2023,negative,overrated i knew a little of the back story but the character development and depth was not there for me  for 3 hours i want to come to care and i just didnt i just wanted the movie to wrap up and end
Aug 1 2023,positive,was soo good kept ya on your seat even thought historically we knew what was going to be the outcome still kept you engaged and well done
Aug 1 2023,positive,cillian must win best actor
Aug 1 2023,positive,great historical movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,life changing film asks you all sorts of questions on morality and humanity
Aug 1 2023,positive,this movie is a masterpiece see it in imax it turns into an amazing experience
Aug 1 2023,positive,a thrilling experience in imax 70mm i look forward to seeing it again on regular 70mm i would love to see it on imax 70mm again if i could get a ticket please extend the run
Aug 1 2023,positive,great acting but a lot of this movie could have been cut
Aug 1 2023,positive,academy awards are coming for this picture
Aug 1 2023,positive,whats with the apple  newton turing and now oppenheimer      while there is no doubt about oppenheimers loyalty it would have been good to refer to the extensive list of once very highly regarded scientists whom we now know to have been traitors not three seconds oh this is fuchs the british baddie  the security concerns were not the product of a few peoples jealousy  the director could have acknowledged this if he was set on making a court room drama    it would have been better to dispense with this and just concentrate on the making of the bomb  or dispense with the making of the bomb and concentrate on the court room drama  either way drop the sex scenes    the film tangled the two threads and made a mess  weak direction partially redeemed by good acting      some engagement with the science would have been good  the scene in chicago was skimmed so lightly one would not know had one not read about it elsewhere that this was the worlds first nuclear reactor just how important it was and the serious concerns about a possible runaway    and if dialogue is important please allow us to hear it properly  its not as if the music was that good    the best pr√©cis i have read is man in hat beats nazis to the prize
Aug 1 2023,positive,the cinematography sound and casting are great but it doesnt make up for the poor cut shaped in another way this could have been a hit
Aug 1 2023,positive,overly talky and disappointingly short on the real life drama of the scientific and engineering challenges leading up to the test and the tightest secrecy of wartime it isnt even explained as to how an abomb is supposed to work in theory and in the practical sense i left the theater knowing no more about the bombs than i did going in  much too much about the postwar red scare politics which come as no surprise and more of a yawn the supposedly cathartic meeting with einstein that is returned to for emphasis is another hohum who cares kind of scene that makes large swathes of the movie arrogant preachy in boring ways and lacking gut punch the scene with president truman made him look like an obnoxious tyrant which goes against writings of eyewitnesses and the most respected historians its a shame they had truman come across that way when he was a diplomatic and thoughtful leader during very difficult times not an ogre
Aug 1 2023,positive,oppenheimer is a great film with stunning visuals unlike any i have seen throughout many modern films even in the era of cgis common use however the overall backandforth of timeframes throughout the film makes the pacing and clarity a bit jumbled     those timeframe elements come together at the end but it almost feels as though the film is actually two whole stories with the first just being a footnote in the background to the story of the governments treatment of robert oppenheimer     the performances by emily blunt and cillian murphy are excellent and do alleviate some of the clarity issues by adding suspense and emotional investment to the broad story arc overall oppenheimer demonstrates the aspect of framing and visuals that make christopher nolans films compelling but simply gets dragged down by a lack of focus and pacing
Aug 1 2023,positive,a bit long for my taste but an excellent movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,gorgeous and immersive especially when the bomb test succeeded
Aug 1 2023,positive,exceptional acting story and visuals with a stella cast
Aug 1 2023,positive,beautiful cinamotography the plot felt a bit convulted at times since it kept moving back and forth through different timelines
Aug 1 2023,positive,engaging despite its 3hour length brilliant performances
Aug 1 2023,negative,the sound track was so loud it was hard to hear the dialogue in my view the relentlessly exciting sound track was used because the dialogue and characterisation were insufficiently interesting  lots of people say the film made them think cant imagine why didnt they know american developed the first atom bomb which caused horrible deaths and suffering to two japanese towns surprise surprise oppenheimer is apparently slightly conflicted after the bombs are used
Aug 1 2023,positive,oppenheimer is an aweinspiring cinematic triumph that skillfully delves into the compelling and profound story of the creation of the nuclear bomb directed by the visionary auteur this movie presents an unparalleled narrative of science politics and the moral dilemmas that defined one of the most significant events in human history    the film revolves around the life and work of j robert oppenheimer brilliantly portrayed by an exceptional lead actor who effortlessly brings the complexity of this enigmatic physicist to life from the outset the screenplay captivates viewers by immersing them in oppenheimers intellectual brilliance and his unyielding determination to push the boundaries of scientific discovery    the film strikes a perfect balance between historical accuracy and artistic interpretation ensuring a seamless blend of facts and emotional resonance the captivating visuals and attention to period detail transport the audience to the era of world war ii making it feel like a journey back in time the cinematography is spellbinding capturing the beauty of science and the horror of its consequences with equal prowess    one of the most commendable aspects of oppenheimer is how it explores the complex ethical dilemmas faced by the scientists involved in the manhattan project the movie does not shy away from portraying the moral quandaries that haunted oppenheimer and his colleagues as they realized the immense power they were unlocking this introspective examination elevates the film beyond a mere historical drama and transforms it into a thoughtprovoking masterpiece that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll    the supporting cast deserves accolades for their exceptional performances adding depth to the narrative by portraying the key figures who shaped the events surrounding the creation of the nuclear bomb from government officials to fellow scientists each character is impeccably portrayed making the films ensemble truly outstanding    the films gripping storytelling and emotional depth are further accentuated by a hauntingly beautiful score that underscores the tension and gravity of the events depicted on screen the music heightens the impact of crucial moments and amplifies the emotional connection the audience forms with the characters
Aug 1 2023,positive,a movie that begins with a high note and ends with a high note
Aug 1 2023,positive,greatest film of this year so far
Aug 1 2023,positive,went to watch the movie but instead i got an experience the sound cinematography editing and acting are excellent could be shorter but its brilliant murphy should get best actor
Aug 1 2023,positive,a colossal master work of film making and more big words to describe oppenheimer
Aug 1 2023,positive,every minute of this movie was worth watching one word phenomenal
Aug 1 2023,positive,there is no denying christopher norris he is a great film maker this is a fine piece of film making fine acting nice story telling i would not have wanted to be the film editor in this one worth watching once i kept thinking when it was going to end
Aug 1 2023,positive,i need to watch it again with subtitles to write a detailed review but i do rate it 5 stars
Aug 1 2023,negative,this movie gets a 310 good not great a few miss casts matt damon should not be in this movie   i feel like should of went to someone else like josh brolin or michael ironside    and the same for robert downy jr for a 3 hr long movies it moves pretty fast it does not really talk about what they are doing at all except for 1 scene and if you were in the washroom you missed also they claim they use no cgi but robert downy jr looked to good to not have cgi done on him
Aug 1 2023,positive,a truly great film and considering that the trend tends to be making shit movies and series the witcher 3 barbie i had a great cinema experience worth to watch but if cant concentrate full 3 hours due to tiktok etc i guess this wont be anything for you
Aug 1 2023,negative,very rarely do i think a movie was too long until i watched this one the story is good but to be crushed next to strangers and watch a proceeding for around 1h and 30 mins is utterly unenjoyable the movie couldve been only 2 hrs long but isnt since you are bombarded with details some of which make no difference to the story personally i didnt come for a lecture furthermore the movie in some instances fails to evoke any type of emotion other than discomfort and stress the revelation towards the end was somewhat unsurprising the acting was brilliant regardless and the story still is interesting but if id have known i wouldve never watched this in the cinema but at home where i couldve paused it for a break
Aug 1 2023,positive,i didnt feel an emotional connection to the characters but its still a ok movie because of the nolan factor
Aug 1 2023,negative,way too long and boring  it felt like a long boring 3hour college lecture where we were made to feel stupid  this is basic world war 2 knowledge that hitlers top nazi scientists were in a cataclysmic race with americas scientists to create the atom bomb first  we keep forgetting that the outcome of world war 2 could easily have been much different if a ruthless nazi fascist dictatorship ruled the entire world today  our entire planet would look just like north korea
Aug 1 2023,positive,one of rh b st movies i ever watched oppenheimers doubts sadness and remorse can be not only seen but felt i feel ashamed of humankind and the lack of moral values our society has had for a long long time
Aug 1 2023,positive,i truly do not understand how such a brilliant filmmaker with an exceedingly interesting subject matter could manage to make such a slow meandering tale i thought i would come out with a profound sense of the bomb or our responsibilities as a society and species but i mostly just saw a man dragged through an unfair hearing for three hours really dry the movie should have focused on the bomb the moral quandaries etc well shot and acted
Aug 1 2023,positive,pretty good i like it so much tight plot great actors and the atmosphere of whole film is wellcrafted even though i know nothing about physics
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie is well made with great actores and well put story i admire christopher nolan for making a such good movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,best movie ive watched since interstellar
Aug 1 2023,positive,i loved watching the history of the atomic bombs development on the screen all of the characters were brilliantly cast and very well acted and of course the exploration was incredible to see on a full size imax screen
Aug 1 2023,positive,the transcendent nature of such a sonically stimulating audiovisual immersive experience is as daunting as it is electrifying   our occasionally unecstatic human experience is put to a halt for the seemingly mailable 3 hour cinematic tourdeforce geniusly orchestrated by christopher nolan in what seems to be one of most anticipated movies of the year
Aug 1 2023,negative,terrible maybe some history if its correct slanted left be ready for mental instability issues its bad 
Aug 1 2023,positive,oppenheimer was emotionally intense visually stunning and a force to be reckoned with i expect many academy award nominations and winnings
Aug 1 2023,positive,good and accurate the last act needs a bit of patient to watch but everything else is a masterpiece
Aug 1 2023,positive,the greatthe acting is superb  murphy seems to fixate you with his gaze and pathos  the decentthe story  the problem is it bounces so often back and forth in time its not always easy to follow  the badthe soundtrack  it is so loud and jarring it often drowns out the dialogue  i left reeling with ears ringing as if id gone to a concert
Aug 1 2023,positive,superb acting enlightened all of us about the history that really wasnt ever taught
Aug 1 2023,positive,1010 fantastic movie shows the desperation that spurred the manhattan project into action as well as the regret and gravity of dropping them on japan cillian murphy and robert downey jr deserve oscars for their performances christopher nolans best movie to date
Aug 1 2023,neutral,we dropped a bomb on a defeated country uh no we didnt mr nolan tell that to the 11000 marines that died on iwo jima alone interesting that the british in dunkirk are nothing but noble but the americans in oppenheimer just might be the bad guys does mr nolan really believe the russians wouldve simply stopped pursuing nukes if we did not pursue the hydrogen bomb thatd be naive bordering on stupidity ok historical misgivings about the movie aside its overwrought its a 5part miniseries crammed into a 3hour film the ending drags on though weve already gotten the point mercilessly pounded into us over and over again the acting however is simply incredible and several parts of the dialog are very memorable the explosion scene itself is incredible but this is really two films  one about oppenheimer and one about downeys character mixing the two was a bridge too far
Aug 1 2023,positive,splendid with excellent acting the film moved effortlessly across two time lines with gorgeous cinematography
Aug 1 2023,neutral,way to long the pacing was all over the place and the mixing was awful could barely hear a thing they said     i learned more about oppenheimer from youtube and tik tok videos than i did this movie     the only good thing really was the acting
Aug 1 2023,positive,nolan does it again i was fully engaged in the movie from start to finish every role was so well casted and cillian murphy is outstanding as per usual
Aug 1 2023,positive,rough start but finished nicely enjoyed the sarcastic wit
Aug 1 2023,positive,beautiful soundtrack cinematography acting as expected was kind of hard to understand the dialogue at times
Aug 1 2023,positive,nolan does it again masterpiece
Aug 1 2023,positive,i liked everything about it
Aug 1 2023,positive,it was a wonderful movie great script excellent cast and  better art direction  loved it
Aug 1 2023,positive,love the subjective and objective narrative surrounding oppenheimer that are juxtaposed throughout the film
Aug 1 2023,positive,another incredible work by nolan very well told and dramatized story with great performances by cillian murphy and robert downey jr the film also has a fabulous soundtrack along with a great sound and image experience
Aug 1 2023,positive,cillian murphy may win best actor oscar in this movie learned alot about making these weapons of mass destruction probably saved 200000 allied solders killed or wounded try to invade japan government stabbed him in the back afterwords but got redeemed in 1958
Aug 1 2023,positive,the fire alarm literally went off when my friends and i were watching the movie at the tanger outlets in deer park 
Aug 1 2023,negative,i dont know why but i tried to like this movie and hour and a half in i kept spacing out and was extremely bored besides it being directed by christopher nolan i dont get the hype at all
Aug 1 2023,neutral,now i am become death the destroyer of worlds that is the popular tagline said by j robert oppenheimer its mentioned only twice throughout the entire film and i also repeated it during dinner with my girlfriend after watching the movie she is a big fan of christopher nolan films naturally her somewhat biased standards will deem this threehourlong biopic excellent on the other hand i feel that the film falls far short of the overwhelming hype it received  its way above serviceable but not near outstanding unlike his previous films that are centred on events his recent highlyanticipated venture is a factbased character drama that follows the life of the renowned physicist and the journey of how he became the creator of a weapon so powerful that he bears the guilt of his own achievements for the rest of his life     christopher nolans oppenheimer is not entirely about the atomic bomb or even focused on the manhattan project but rather centres on its titular characters life before during and after the making of the deadly explosive his obsession with making a weapon whose destructiveness is way beyond the comprehension of a regular human is awful and alarming proof that humans are capable of things that are more immeasurable and inexplicable than the complexities of the science of quantum physics i dont understand physics much less the gravity of making a bomb here his life is presented to us in a form similar to that of a documentary but the narrative is so fragmented that it can sometimes be difficult to follow its plot on top of that the film confuses us further by jumping between its two different timelines one in colour the other monochrome the one in colour tells us more about oppenheimer as a prebomb student and shares his romantic relationships with two women it also includes his private interrogation in a small room where he testifies about having his security clearance stripped by the atomic energy commission aec board after he objected to the planning to make an even more destructive weapon the hydrogen bomb in black and white the other timeline follows robert downey jrs lewis strauss as he testifies in front of the senate he is the antagonist and as a member of the aec he is the one who painted oppenheimer as a communist during the red scare in an attempt to bring him down    the lineup that makes up this ensemble cast is impressive almost every minor or supporting role is played by a known star some only appear once or twice but they each try their best to make an impression to not be forgotten by the time the film ends but the film mainly consists of men and the two women on screen arent developed or written well florence pugh appears in the first half as the devout communist whose selfdestructive character drove her to suicide emily blunt plays the erratic and volatile wife with a drinking problem in short this is a long film about men in rooms talking about and making decisions that will affect and change the future and the talking they do sort of requires you to have some knowledge about atomic energy but at its core oppenheimer is about a scientist and his relationship with humanity  and later his role in killing thousands of people with his work    matt damon plays a colonel that is representative of the army and pushes for the development of the bomb by recruiting all the scientists he can get by saying something along the lines of the nazis are making a very powerful bomb we must also make one quicker to beat them and win but then germany surrendered japan doesnt but neither are they making a bomb would it then be fair to use it on an enemy that is certainly illequipped it will still save lives by ending the war they tell him he is in a moral dilemma that keeps him up at night but besides that the film doesnt say anything more than that and its threehours runtime makes it extra and sometimes boring one element that alleviates the boredom is the memorable performance of robert downey jr i cant think of any movies he starred in besides the marvel films as a result ive become attuned to his acting style of being the arrogant tony stark but here he shows us his versatility playing a man driven to madness by his own unfulfilled ambition and its terrific    oppenheimer isnt about the bomb as the hype might suggest rather its a selfportrait of him and his life as a result when the film arrives at the trinity test it isnt as impactful or satisfying as one might expect and is made anticlimatic by the subsequent continuation of the hearings in the end like the spectators watching the atomic bomb explosion i couldnt help but feel both amazed and uncertain about the films greatness but at the same time i could not fully connect with it and felt distant from it just like them watching from afar
Aug 1 2023,positive,i wouldnt say its the best movie by nolan ill always give batman trilogy inception as his best works but the direction dialogue and cast of openheimer is just mind blowing must watch in cinemaimax rdj and cilian slayed it ps its a heaven for physics lover and history lovers
Aug 1 2023,positive,the movie of the century    downright the most stunning graphically and in terms of the soundtrack captivating the story writing in itself was absolutely compelling to the utmost degree
Aug 1 2023,positive,great movie that shows the difference between science and politics
Aug 1 2023,positive,haunting and thrilling one of nolans best must see at the theaters for the best experience
Aug 1 2023,positive,the history was accurate and i believe it was an outstanding representation of oppenheimer the man the additional drama heightened my understanding of all of the characters the supporting cast blew me away with acting that made me feel i was in the room with them robert downeys strauss  is definitely oscar worthy cillians oppenheimer gave an inside view of his tortured soul his eyes are haunting windows to his conflicted sense of loyalty vs his passion for global knowledge everything about this movie screams best picture
Aug 1 2023,positive,absolute artistic brilliance
Aug 1 2023,negative,could have been a lot better and barbie truly overshadowed it by a large margin trinity test was glossed over there was no science the interpersonal conflict was underdeveloped and the women were less then one dimensional
Aug 1 2023,positive,great acting and a great drama one of christopher nolanss best it should get a best picture nomination at least and best actor too great movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,good movie could have been an hr shorter
Aug 1 2023,positive,the best movie ive seen this year great acting and careful storytelling
Aug 1 2023,negative,to me it was a boring movie i fell asleep and left half way through
Aug 1 2023,negative,confusing boring  dont waste your money on it
Aug 1 2023,positive,oppenheimer amazing robert downey jr has to get an award total alist cast
Aug 1 2023,positive,remarkably thrilling for a 3 hour biopic intriguing character study and an incredible performance from murphy
Aug 1 2023,positive,phenomenallong moviebut still phenomenal
Aug 1 2023,neutral,i thought acting did good but it took forever for the movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,i think is a bit overrated
Aug 1 2023,positive,amazing movie and some great visuals
Aug 1 2023,positive,the best movie of the year
Aug 1 2023,positive,incredibly directed acted written and scored  strongly recommend watching in imax 70mm if you can
Aug 1 2023,negative,movie was way to long and much of it overdone and to be honest boring  characters were strong the story line good but to often the scene dialog was confusing and didnt seem revenant    music in many scenes was awful irritating and irrelevant
Aug 1 2023,positive,a very sensible theme with a persperctive im afraid not touching in the problem that really matters it s focus in scientist and polictical view as the title saying from oppenheimer   even going in this way the movie is really interesting the anticommunist hysteria is very well showed history well donne amazing cast
Aug 1 2023,positive,very important film
Aug 1 2023,negative,the good downey jr gives an oscar worthy performance as oppys nemesis strong calculating very complicated character i found myself understanding his weakness his fatal flaw of measuring himself against a man much more intelligent than him being all too real matt damon was impeccable in his role overall the acting was fabulous but  the bad cillian murphy i think captured oppenheimer in his later years perfectly tortured worried about his legacy but that man could have never led the manhattan project historically oppenheimer was selected for his leadership people that tortured cannot lead a project that big i blame nolan for making the character so incredibly depressed which is apparently historically untrue and emotionally false in reality murphy was nonetheless impressive in this manufactured role  the ugly why the choice to shatter the story line into so many fractured vignettes by the end of the 3 hour run time i was just tired 2 timelines would have served the story better coupled with the incessant sound track i enjoyed the movie less and less as it progressed a few moments of silence would have told a quieter side of the story better i love nolan but this is my least favorite film of his sad i waited since the spring
Aug 1 2023,positive,you can draw modernday parallels with artificial intelligence and the inaction of climate change that threatens humanity oppenheimer is brilliant with its fantastic visuals immersive score and pulsating dialogue
Aug 1 2023,positive,the kind of movie that gets better with each viewing originally i saw it in imax 70mm which of course was aweinspiring then i took my dad to see it in standard digital format and it was still awesome while you certainly want to see it in the best format possible the film itself transcends however you watch youre sure to get a thoughtprovoking and moving experience oppenheimer proves you dont need explosions to hold the audience in the palm of its hand great actors writing sound work cinematography etc can all do the trick if youve got the talent to make it happen
Aug 1 2023,positive,this is one great movie wasnt sure about 3 hours of a history based movie working out viewing it in a theater but the time flew by as this movie was so well done great experience
Aug 1 2023,positive,a triumph and cinematic masterpiece i would recommend brushing up on your historical knowledge before seeing this movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,it is very difficult to explain how three hours in a cinema seems like three minutes the film is a masterpiece that using atomic research becomes a masterful reflection on the human soul
Aug 1 2023,positive,loved the movie loved the history   walked away with a new understanding of what the weapons of mass destruction can do to our world
Aug 1 2023,negative,are we delusional this movie is only ok because of the actors the trailer of this movie was the coolest part only 5 minutes was them testing bombs or even talking about the science of it the rest was communist party meetings and the trial who cares about the that it completely lacks the punch or action that you expect from testing a nuclear bomb if you want to watch a 3 hr judge judy case with 5 mins of action then its your movie
Aug 1 2023,negative,was boring made me want to opp out of the movie
Aug 1 2023,negative,boring movie with a controversial topic they could used another approach and explore a different angle in a realistic fashion
Aug 1 2023,negative,one dimensional and self absorbed no subtlety no attention or meaningful care to for the japanese perspective and some of the most awfully drawn female characters from nolan to date hard pass
Aug 1 2023,positive,i learned so much from this movie exciting and awesome
Aug 1 2023,positive,amazing on every level will clean up at the oscars
Jul 31 2023,positive,gripping movie cillian murphy was awesome
Jul 31 2023,positive,i really like it a lot
Jul 31 2023,positive,excellent acting  jumps around a bit so you have to pay attention  cinematography is outstanding
Jul 31 2023,positive,masterpiece from start to finish  so intriguing the more it plays the more youre waiting to find out what happens 3 hours may be long in some peoples minds but for me i was so attached to the screen with the amazing casting choices and how those roles were played furthermore the story just get progressively better and better brilliant
Jul 31 2023,negative,better to watch barbie
Jul 31 2023,negative,if id known it was 3 hours of political perspective id have waited for tv
Jul 31 2023,positive,saw this on a regular screen imax and imax 70mm and the bigger the screen the better it got i seriously would recommend if anyone gets a chance to see it in imax 70mm it felt like i was in the room with cillian murphy 45 stars because i would have liked to see more of the science involved after watching it a bunch of times the points that feel like science should be the main focus communism still is overall the best and most creative movie i have seen in a long time
Jul 31 2023,positive,phenomenal movie probably the movie of the year everything is incredibly entertaining and looks and sounds amazing while never flinching from the beauty or the horror the best cast in years superstars giving their all if you love a light show its that and if you want something powerful to think about its that too
Jul 31 2023,positive,the movie is long at the 3 hours but it doesnt seem that way  cillian murphy looks very much like oppenheimer in this  did you know that he ate only one almond and water for weeks to lose the weight  i worry about actors who do stuff like that  many doctors think it is dangerous  his performance is excellent i am sure that an oscar nomination will be forthcoming  but the highlight for me in acting was robert downey jr as lewis strauss the former head of the atomic energy commision who developed a deep hatred for oppenheimer on a perceived slight at a hearing  and he was suspicious of oppenheimer communist ties  he teamed up with edward teller who was angry with oppenheimer because of oppenheimers opposition to the hbomb to wreck oppenheimers professional life  at least so far this year i think downey is a shooin for a best supporting actor oscar  the movie is filled with many other fine actors including rami malek mr robot who has a relatively small but key role in the hearings on strauss  emily blunt is very good as oppenheimers wife but the highlight from the female acting performance for me is florence pugh as jean tatlock  the movie is filled with half of hollywood it seems including alden ehrenreich dane dehaan and josh hartnett  it is the mustsee movie of the year
Jul 31 2023,positive,the best of the year and possibly the decade cillian murphy was spectacular as the lead role
Jul 31 2023,positive,cancel the oscars oppenheimer wins in all the major categories
Jul 31 2023,positive,this film was a wonderous piece of cinema butyou will leave the theater completely exhausted as you will need to pay complete attention as the story unfolds and a constantly shifting timeline and listen intently to every carefully crafted piece of dialog fantastic performances each one making you want to go home and check out the reallife character which im about to do    adult filmaking at its very best
Jul 31 2023,positive,a good telling of robert oppenheimers life and times i was not familiar his history so the unfolding of events kept my interest i liked that the film presented the complexity of situations rather than trying to sell us on a perspective if the film has a message it is that the creation of the atom bomb put the future of mankind in serious jeopardy a situation that still exists today
Jul 31 2023,positive,a haunting account of probably the most prolific and earthmoving figure of the modern era cillian murphy gives one of the defining performances in recent history and robert downey jr is nothing short of cold and calculating both are destined to win any number of trophies
Jul 31 2023,positive,good movie not great there were some very consequential scenes that elevated the entire production but im feeling challenged to appreciate nolans treatment of historically epic pieces  eg dunkirk i dont feel as though he hits the mark with the precision needed to truly create something that is emotionally stirring he has a tendency to focus on the more trivial with the same weight as he does the essential elements 
Jul 31 2023,positive,oppenheimer was an outstanding work of art although 95 of it was filled with dialogue this movie kept you on the edge of your seat
Jul 31 2023,positive,beautifully shot powerful performances from cast regardless of how little or how much time they had on screen story was interesting and exceptionally well written another banger for nolan
Jul 31 2023,positive,just go watch the film you wont regret it it made me leave the theater feeling inspired and different i cant explain it but it was such an honor to watch christopher nolans film the cast is amazing
Jul 31 2023,positive,amazing story it makes me want to read more about it also sadly it shows just how powerful people can try to destroy good people
Jul 31 2023,negative,boring   will be on tv six months  i do not trust fandango any more
Jul 31 2023,positive,amazing gripping thrilling emotional beautiful horrifying movie nolan does it again
Jul 31 2023,positive,long and complicated plus difficult to hear what they were saying not my cup of tea but appreciate its a masterpiece in acting
Jul 31 2023,positive,the movie is filmed so well and all 3 hours you are engaged to the screen getting trough history and understanding how it works drawing strings from one to other to understand the plot and in the end you see how this historical event have lead world to change
Jul 31 2023,positive,it was an amazing story of a man that changed the world only to wish he never had it could have been shorter and i would like to have seen more about what it took to make the bombs oscars are sure to follow the leading and supporting men from this film
Jul 31 2023,positive,great flic super entertaining awesome acting watch this movie
Jul 31 2023,positive,this movie is honestly one of the best movies ive ever scene i love everything about it from the plot of the movie to even just how amazing the scenes are choreographed 1010 movie
Jul 31 2023,positive,great movie but three hours long
Jul 31 2023,positive,such a great movie everyone was cast so well i had no idea about the after effects that the creators faced and learned a lot
Jul 31 2023,positive,amazing nolans best film to date cillian murphy finally gets his lead actor role and hits it out of the park
Jul 31 2023,positive,i have faith in the movies again
Jul 31 2023,positive,its overall amazing and very interesting i would recommend it
Jul 31 2023,negative,arguably the worst action film i have ever watched i left the theatre mid movie its all wrong historically and there is no story line and the dialogue is emotionally empty the soundtrack does not match the scenes horrible waste of time and money its all just some choppy scenes with intervening weird images showing some physics simulations no coherent narrative at all i am so mad that it was that bad of a movie about such an important event in history i dont like nolan but i thought maybe this time would be good especially that interstellar and inception were not bad i dont know what the heck is his obsession with this non linear story telling stuff i am very very disappointed
Jul 31 2023,positive,visually stunning and filled with performances that engulfed the actors some side plots were a bit unnecessary but still one of the best
Jul 31 2023,positive,this movie was long but i was truly intrigued the entire time such a good story line and overall just a great movie
Jul 31 2023,positive,oppenheimer follows the line of amazing films by the great christopher nolan the film gives us the insight of the team robert assembles for the manhattan project sure many viewers would argue the film being too political but the conflict of communism and fascism brought paranoia to our countrys leaders during ww2 the idea of building an atomic weapon was supposed to be a warning to our enemies to end the war so they could not have their plans exploited which is why they tried to defame oppenheimer for being a communist despite it being false overall the movie was fantastic all the movie lovers that hate on this film need to climb out of the bandwagon this was a part of history
Jul 31 2023,negative,extremely boring they shouldve removed the first 2 hours then the last 45 mins and it wouldve been a solid film
Jul 31 2023,positive,an masterpiece by chris direction non cgi effects and world class actors
Jul 31 2023,positive,a pass over a fascinatingextremely important subject but not a great treatment my issues are  1  the music and sound effects track is way too loud  it often drowned out the dialogue  all i talked to afterwards agreed  2 the timeline is unnecessarily choppy and sometimes quite hard to follow  3 there are many characters of importance historically and to the movie  many are poorly introduced or not introduced at all  in 3 hours fewer visual and noise effects and more attention to the characters would help  it is worth watching once even though your ears hurt and you spend so much time trying figure out when this newunknown but obviously important person is speaking  that is hard to willingly suspend disbelief
Jul 31 2023,positive,great as always oppenheimer and nolan true visionaries
Jul 31 2023,positive,perfect from start to finish
Jul 31 2023,positive,great movie great cast a must see
Jul 31 2023,positive,this movie is truly a masterpiece so complete and   well written all the actors and actresses are incredible in this perfect
Jul 31 2023,positive,oppenheimer exemplifies the best of both christopher nolans work and cillian murphys acting it is as historically accurate as can be but with a interesting screenplay by christopher nolan the story of robert j oppenheimer becomes that much more interesting making the audience anticipate his every move the supporting performances of robert downey jr emily blunt matt damon and tom conti are also a standout of the film but never take away the spotlight from cillian murphy this thriller is truly shocking and surprising opening new perspectives of life and people a true cinematic masterpiece
Jul 31 2023,positive,fantastic cinematography and acting dont come into this expecting it to be all about the bomb not much action but an intriguing and well written film i love how accurate it is to history as well one of the best films ive seen in a long time
Jul 31 2023,positive,a wonderful spectacle that both fuses and fissons ethics science and politics nolan satisfies film buffs by shooting his historical drama in 70mm imax partly in black and white which has never been done before   oppenheimer based on biography american prometheus tells a nonlinear story about the perspective of scientist j robert oppenheimer cillian murphy and partly politician lewis strauss robert downey jr during the development of the first nuclear weapons the film chronicles an impressive clash between a scientist full of conflict over his personal feelings and those of humanity in his role as father of the atomic bomb and the ambitions and personal vendetta of a driven politician the characters work together in the atomic energy commission aec an american advisory body that provides pronouncements on the development of nuclear weapons after world war ii the beginning of the film is mainly concerned with oppenheimers role during the physics developments prior to the manhattan project which is then laid out in the second act however the film erupts after world war ii in the third act where the main characters fight for their credibility and reputation the entire duration of the film equivalent to three hours consists of scintillating dialogue that is fantastically performed by a multitude of impressive actors in particular lead actors robert downey jr and cillian murphy show their best side however supporting actors casey affleck boris pash and jason clarke roger robb perform at a similar if not higher level  the trio of cristopher nolan hoyte van hoytema cinematography and ludwig goransson music masterfully drag viewers into the fire of dialogue the film is visually stunning in 70mm and has a brilliant score nolan through his way of nonlinear storytelling makes intriguing clashes stand out well science versus politics communism versus patriotism but especially selfish ambition versus the common good oppenheimer has all the tools for an absolute film classic but has sloppy editing jennifer larne shots are sometimes interspersed too quickly to follow easily several times characters who speak are not brought into focus also some dialogues are surpassed by the volume of the film music these choices sometimes lead to unclear dialogue making drama less compelling  also the film pace detracts from the impact some setpieces have perhaps a revised longer version as francis ford coppola did for his masterpiece apocalypse now final cut would take the film to an even higher level in any case with this work nolan once again shows himself to be one of the strongest filmmakers of his time a wonderful spectacle that both fuses and fissons ethics science and politics
Jul 31 2023,positive,bloody amazing best actor and best supporting actor have to come out of this movie  this movie has allowed me to hope that hollywood can still make real movies
Jul 31 2023,positive,openheimer  a mesmerizing cinematic journey through the life of physicist j robert oppenheimer stunning visuals powerful storytelling and thoughtprovoking themes create an unforgettable experience mustsee for history and science enthusiasts  from the very start the immersive visuals and surround sound transported me into a world where scientific brilliance and human emotions collided  cillian murphys portrayal of j robert oppenheimer was truly remarkable capturing the essence of the brilliant physicist with finesse his nuanced performance added depth and authenticity to the character making it a standout role  robert downey jr delivered an extraordinary performance as lewis strauss a significant character in the film his portrayal added a new dimension to the role showcasing his exceptional acting abilities combined with cillian murphys stellar portrayal of j robert oppenheimer their performances elevated the movie to a whole new level making it a mustsee cinematic experience
Jul 31 2023,positive,this film felt like a biography on the history channel it didnt feel like a film it was a slowburn kind of movie sad to say but i thought it was boring overall a massive production but i would like to have seen more of the building of the trinity bomb most of the story was focused on oppenheimers relationships with his wife and mistress it was also way too long they could have cut at least an hour from the film overall it would have been interesting to see more of the making of the bomb and the people that lived in the area affected by the project
Jul 31 2023,neutral,three hours music video barely focused on any subject
Jul 31 2023,negative,what unprecedented waste of good actors too simplified for anyone who knows a bit about history too complicated for those who dont a 3hour boring portrait to tell us how bad commies are nothing about the science not much about the actual man pass
Jul 31 2023,positive,masterpiece sound design acting writing and visuals on s tier level one of the most important moments and scientific figures of the last 100 years if you ate glue in art class as a kid or if you are kind of dumb then you should pass i wouldnt want people who dont understand science or theory to watch the movie and write a review that says its too confusing or boring they can just stay home with their coloring books
Jul 31 2023,positive,oppenheimer was the greatest movie ive ever seen i was lucky enough to see it in 70mm 15 perforation film and it was stunning it is a must see and definitely worth going to see in 70mm
Jul 31 2023,positive,the characters moral dilemmas and moral compass expressed in the show are portrayed and builder up extremely well its a heavy thinking movie that shouldnt be watched while half awake 100 recommend and would watch it again
Jul 31 2023,positive,the effect of the atomic bomb could be a little better but apart from that the film was amazing
Jul 31 2023,positive,an unreal cinema experience a great plot nolan is an incredible story teller and everyone from actors to set designers did an incredible job to tell this story so well
Jul 31 2023,positive,the best biographical movies talking about the ii world war 100 recommended for every people if they like the history of ii world war
Jul 31 2023,positive,the quickest 3 hours ever mesmerizing and politics as usual trying to silence someone who gave our country so much because he wouldnt play the right wing agenda 
Jul 31 2023,positive,christopher nolan has done it again it can be the movie of 2023 i can recommend it only truly remarkable 1010
Jul 31 2023,positive,simply amazing i was astounded with the pacing and was surprised at how well the movie did at keeping me engaged for three hours the sympathy i felt for this man was only enforced due to how government treats its own current day incredible depiction of passion and work with people always looking to destroy you
Jul 31 2023,negative,badlousy movie do not go see this movie oppenheimer2023 i went to and saw this movie oppenheimer2023 at 335pmct sunday july 30 2023 in austin texastx i wrote my comments here at 1038amct monday july 31 2023
Jul 31 2023,positive,very intense but very well done did not even feel the 3 hours of movie time also i did not know oppy had to deal with mccarthyism learned a lot
Jul 31 2023,positive,a good movie i really enjoy it but still not sure about why it have a nude scene
Jul 31 2023,positive,definitely love this movie a must watch while in theaters
Jul 31 2023,positive,best movie i have seen in a long while
Jul 31 2023,positive,unless you have an o level in chemistry then the first 90 minutes will go straight over your head like it did mine the acting is excellent but dont go if going for action as its at a bare minimum
Jul 31 2023,positive,as always nolan has done a great job cinematically one of the finest directors around the cast and crew are excellent even if emily blunt takes a bit of time to warm up to her usual standards watched this in imax but some of the dialogue was poorly mixed  and thats during the quieter moments the 3rd act drags no doubt this movie will be oscar nominations galore but i only gave 35 as it didnt have enough heart for me  the 3rd act could have been handled better for me   spoilers ahead    i didnt find myself caring enough about oppenheimers trial which after what hed achieved i feel like i should have cared about him being treated unfairly   i didnt see the point in the incredible florence pugh being pretty much reduced to a naked footnote felt out of place to the rest of the movie   it dragged after the bomb had been dropped i think nolan wanted his usual twist style ending with the bw  colour scenes colliding but didnt really work for me
Jul 31 2023,positive,a brilliant movie that shows the workings of a brilliant yet flawed man the building of the bombs that ended ww2 is a great movie
Jul 31 2023,positive,ironically simple lazy and very very safe definitely not a tribute to its namesake more a tribute to the director the first two hours is a poorly written wikipedia article set to music did no one involved care to understand anything about quantum mechanics hilarious that this is a huge hit 
Jul 31 2023,positive,read other non 5 star reviews i agree interesting great acting but more like a history channel documentary on steroids music was super loud almost deafening love christopher nolan incredible cast did the best portraying oppenheimers life
Jul 31 2023,positive,solid acting especially from murphy he will get best actor awards but nolan couldnt decide whose story he was telling he wasnt telling historys story or oppenheimers storywas it a story about downeys character as dorothy parker famously said first you must kill all your darlings nolan had too many darlings film is 30 minutes too long in my theatre people left early and i had to stand up at the back there was no climax i think the trinity test was supposed to be the climax but it wasnt anchored w dialogue the hearing was too long lacking gravitas bc whathes gonna lose his security clearance so what a lot of messy too many threads mixed w a lot of fabulous but better to shoot for the moon and miss than make another bs empty headed romcom
Jul 31 2023,negative,3 hours of nothingness
Jul 31 2023,positive,movie may be long but the story is perfect nolans use of the music really brings you into the movie
Jul 31 2023,positive,i really wanted to love this movie but seeing it in imax was a sensory overload and not in the best way  the two intertwining stories are not needed and really makes the 3rd act drag on  the sound effects for the practical things like explosions and mass crowds are great but the constant closeups of people shouting at each other drag on and i left the theater with a headache and ringing ears  im a metal fan and for this to happen to me makes me wonder what a cerebral smart person must feel walking out    it looks great and the cast is good but there are too many people to keep track of and i would have liked to have learned more about how they figured out the splitting of the atom and how they discovered it by using cgi to visually show it  nolan is no fan of cgi and it all had to be practical which i think takes away and left me with a sense of what if  the sex scenes were totally unnecessary and most of the female characters came across as a burden to oppy and im not sure how you make emily blunt look terrible but good job you succeeded  maybe ill like it more on a second viewing but it will be awhile until im ready to give another 3 hours of my time
Jul 31 2023,positive,nolan has raised the bar on what a biopic can and should be everything from the visuals soundtrack writing editing and acting is at a level very few films have ever achieved its suspense and gravity grabs you immediately and doesnt let go until the end credits you are left understanding the complicated and brilliant man of oppenheimer you feel the full weight of the potential armageddon he brought to humanitys hands the movie is a triumph
Jul 31 2023,negative,i can describe this movie in 2 words   bore ring  nolan needs to stop making movies longer than they need to be     and maybe ill actually look forward to seeing his movies 
Jul 31 2023,positive,this was an interesting story well told and told in unique fashion  it didnt need a scene featuring florence pughs breasts  it was like going to a peep show during the intermission of hamilton
Jul 31 2023,positive,sure it was a cinematic experience visuals and music were fantastic the cast and their acting was fenomenal i just find some holes in the plot and how some characters are portrayed specially female ones  its not something new in nolans films where females are poorly written or their point of view is always male based which makes them look powerful in males eyes but thats not how it actually is  oppenheimer being a womanizer is common knowledge but i think they couldve done a better job some scenes were kind of unnecessary and left more to talk about than the actual plot the creation of the nuclear bomb  after the big explosion the movie turned dense and boring it felt like it was all about a dispute between two men egos and some kind of american propaganda it would have been a better idea to portrait even more oppenheimer demons and fears and how the world was affected after the explosions the good and the bad  finaly this is something i heard of a lot after the movie came out the time line was a bit messy  and not everyone was capable of understand it at first watch
Jul 31 2023,negative,unless you are a child or have been living under a rock your entire adult life you would already know everything this movie has to say about weapons of mass destruction and the ethical ramifications of their use if you are a history buff you would know more a really boring and trite film void of drama that only offers expensive visuals and a manipulative soundtrack to string the viewer along
Jul 31 2023,positive,exceptional movie  hard to see if anything else scheduled for release this year will top this
Jul 31 2023,positive,an absolute masterpiece christopher nolans best work the performances the score everything made for an stunning film that takes you back to such an impactful moment in time i cant praise this movie enough
Jul 31 2023,negative,awful hugely overhyped disappointment that does nothing to respect the horror of history but reduces it to an comic emotionally vacant an astonishing cast did miracles with dreadful dialog nolan incoherently shouting loudly about something bring back inception prestige memento etc and drop this self important nonsense for goodness sake hire a script writer instead of trying to do it all yourself
Jul 31 2023,negative,monotonous use of cameras mostly face closeups excessive use of disconnected threads that at the end create a chaotic representation of a complex character living in difficult times horrible sound effects unable to leverage the talent of the actors in the movie in summary a a colossal failure sorry i wasted time watching it
Jul 31 2023,negative,fast talking science 3 hour long movie should be the title im not a science enthusiast so it was hard to follow then the timeline pace was confusing color and bw was supposed to help but there was a point where i thought they mixed it up by mistake then the nuditylove scene was so unnecessary to the story the story was so bland i kept thinking ok all this talk and characters are going to build up to something but was bored at the end still
Jul 31 2023,negative,what a complete snorefest 3 hours of my life gone with this cast of murphy damon etc i was expecting more my girlfriend said she kind of liked it because it told of who oppie was it is seriously one of the boringest if thats a word movies i have ever been to save your money and do not go see this
Jul 31 2023,positive,its astonishing nolan made a master piece the photographic and sound effects including the soundtrack makes your immersion greater every minute of the three hours of movie that not tires you in any moment
Jul 31 2023,neutral,touched on the moral dilemas of the protaginist but didnt really spend the time to dwell on it fells like it took a relatively unimportant part of his life and used it as the main plot  also went way too fast for one to ponder on anything that happened  made for people with very short attention span
Jul 31 2023,positive,what a fantastic film everything about the film was spot on the performances music and effects were spectacular  the 3 hours flew by
Jul 31 2023,positive,script acting but most of all the editing is superb only downsides for me were a few strange musical cues it sometimes faded out very amateurishly like it was a last minute decision after the music was already written and recorded and a few cuts where the jaw movements of the actors filmed from behind didnt match the audio take that was used so only technical issues i had i never felt the 3hduration the movie flew by what a deep dive into the man oppenheimer what a tightly written whitty script even funny at times but what an emotional ending a home run imo
Jul 31 2023,positive,those familiar with nolan will recognize his amazing style this movie fantastically captures the complexity of the manhattan project that isnt illuminated in academia oscar performances galore from the main characters all the way down to extras no small parts in this masterpiece
Jul 31 2023,positive,oppenheimer is the greatest movie of all time 1010  if you didnt watch at least go and hear the soundtrack its a masterpiece the soundtrack alone gives the movie extra 5 points  the soundtrack was the best thing alongside acting  the cinematography was more than great   the directing was from another planet  the storytelling is one of the best o all time  the acting was amazing no actor was shit all of them were great  the soundtrack is a masterpiece  the explosion exploded my eyes it was great  if you want to watch it you should go to an imax screen
Jul 31 2023,positive,nolans best work by far while he has never failed to provide both entertainment and thought provoking ideas theyve never been as fully realized as oppenheimer masterful performances incredible fidelity to his subject matter while finding the cracking drama at the heart of it this time brought to life by his nonlinear storytelling rather than being obscured by it     most telling is that somehow after all hes done before he improves his use of audio to carry the emotional tenor physically to the audience from the cacophonic electron dreams that drive the title character to the subtle sounds of a gloved hand clenched in refusal of a handshake this is so much a sensory experience rather than the expected cerebral one dunkirk was a technical masterpiece but i always felt distanced removed from everything it is a fitting historical report but it did not bring about the immersion of oppenheimer where i felt id lived that lifetime    oh and emily blunt has only a little screen time but nobody deserves a supporting roll oscar nod more than her her presence throughout and two key scenes are critical to understanding this story more than oppenheimer himself no knock on murphy and his verylikely oscar winning portrayal
Jul 31 2023,positive,my main issue has nothing to do with the actors and their performances which was stellar  it has to do with how the story was told  some may call it intelligent but i think thats cope for it actually being very confusing and all over the place  character development was virtually nonexistent  there were shining moments main one being the bomb testwhich was spectacularbut overall the feeling of will this movie ever end kept nagging  imho that speaks to subpar storytelling
Jul 31 2023,positive,definitely the best movie i have seen in the last 20 years and probably in my life  this movie deserves to sweep all of the awards  casting was incredible  i was not looking forward to sitting for 3 hours in the theater but it was well worth it especially to see on the big screen
Jul 31 2023,positive,truly one of the best films in recent years the photography and sound design were amazing specially the use of the imax bw film and thats without talking about the writing which is also amazing so engaging and well written that it doesnt fell like a 3 hour film   if you have the opportunity i would definitely recommend that you give it a shot
Jul 31 2023,positive,it was a very good movie well acted  beautifully shot it was a little long though and it didnt pass the bechdel test
Jul 31 2023,positive,as a recovering nuclear engineer i went into the movie prepared to see bad drama and bad science inspite of the critics universal gushing but i found both to be upto snuff to the point were i forgot about the details that didnt matter and focused on the journey of the characters there was a lot to cover in the movie distilling an adult life into three hours and cn did
Jul 31 2023,positive,oppenheimer is one of the most astounding films anyone can see when i saw it in the cinema you slowly start adding up the dots to put the picture together in your head the film speaks a lot about how robert felt while he was developingfiguring out the atomic bomb and how he felt after it was tested at one point you can see were he had regret filled in his eyes as soon as the testing of the atomic bomb went off i 100 recommend anyone to see it but its not the type of film everyone will like after all it is around 8090 dialogue more than interesting actions happening
Jul 31 2023,positive,great movie amazing acting the best directed movie of 2023 so far make sure you go to the bathroom before hand because if you miss a second of the movie you will be confused
Jul 31 2023,positive,interesting and well acted
Jul 31 2023,positive,the narrative of oppenheimers life certainly holds more than ample fascination for even a film with a threehour runtime and the story is treated comprehensively with care and depth
Jul 31 2023,positive,the first nolan film i have ever seen and by far one of the best movies ive seen the movie keeps you captivated from the moment it starts the acting by everyone from murphy to blunt to damon everyone was amazing and really sold the role rdjs acting will win hime an oscar and this movie overall could sweep the oscars because of how great it is the production design the acting sound editing cinematography and more is just amazing this movie leaves you feeling so many emotions all at once and is easily so far the best movie to come out this year you can really tell how everyone on set cares about this movie and the level it need to be at to succeed nolan directed this film perfectly and it really makes you fall in love with his work if you havent already the music is also another massive bonus to such an amazing film the music creates so much tension and friction it hurts to watch but in a good way the music is done by ludwig goransson and he did a fantastic job capturing how to make you feel all in all this is a must watch for everyone and definitely the best film of the year and last few years in memory
Jul 31 2023,positive,oppenheimer is an amazing film its directed extremely well i would say nolan s best film the acting is top notch
Jul 31 2023,positive,mindblowing quite literally
Jul 31 2023,positive,what an experience worth seeing every second
Jul 31 2023,positive,its a good movie i would recommend it but it is not great a lot of great stars but the production shudders through scenes that are sudden and disconnected great starring role for cillian murphy who carries the movie despite the disconnected editing but strong story line standout support were dane dehaan and then matt damon and robert downey jnr why dane first a totally enveloping character in a few short scenes
Jul 31 2023,positive,an incredible story told in such a way that you wont get bored for even a minute
Jul 31 2023,negative,very disappointing      much of the acting was good but the film was disjointed you learned nothing about science the great scientists at the time and their moral struggles or politics other than oppenheimer was linked to communists as were his two wives and many of his friends so of course they were going to investigate him we were supposed to be on his side but realistically i was hoping they would just put him in jail so i could go home even the conclusion of the movie was wrong ironically nuclear weapons ushered in an era of peace between the world powers that hadnt existed before because you know if you press that red button you and everyone you know will die     a failure of screenwriting what should have been a great story was turned into a snoozefest i think the nude scenes were designed to wake people up in the middle of the film a massive missed opportunity on the scale of the farce that was alexander      a lot of the positive reviews here read like they were written by chatgpt
Jul 31 2023,negative,dull and long and dull 
Jul 31 2023,positive,amazing movie  3 hours flew by and didnt want it to end brilliant performances all round
Jul 31 2023,positive,nolan murphy damon blunt downey you cant ask for a better star cast i was going into this film knowing all the actors and actresses of who they are and what they play in this film i couldnt even recognize gary oldman which is what truly shows how good of an actor he is and how impressive the makeup artist was the plot for this is amazing but i am biased because of how much i enjoy learning about history i took my friend to see it who didnt understand the plot much but i felt he did not have much of an open mind to it it was still incredible to be a part of the few people to see this film in 70mm as how nolan intended compared to millions who have seen it in a regular theatre is something i will never forget this was just an incredible film that is in my opinion going to be one of the best movies to have ever been made
Jul 31 2023,positive,a movie about backstabbing  meetings and geniuses see the chessboards on the ceilings
Jul 31 2023,negative,boring asf 3 hours is super long and it was just constant talking feel asleep in the middle
Jul 31 2023,positive,absolutely incredible gripping
Jul 31 2023,positive,the best movie in true imax 
Jul 31 2023,positive,nolan really makes you feel like youre truly witnessing the most important scientific race in history its epic
Jul 31 2023,positive,amazing soundtracks a movie needed to be watched twice to understand and feel the whole vibe of the movie
Jul 31 2023,positive,this was an absolute masterpiece despite it being long and actually feeling the 3 hours length it was truly an experience every performance was brilliant the cinematography was truly beautiful and the dialogue was even better than most films christopher nolan has done it again
Jul 31 2023,positive,oppenheimer is such a great movie a real christopher nolan classic    giving cillian murphy the role of robert j oppenheimer was such a great decision since murphy has experience in playing darker themes like peaky blinders eg    matt damon as general groves is perfect    robert downey jr as lewis strauss was also a great decision and i couldnt think about someone that fits the heisenberg role better than matthias schweigh√∂fer except bryan cranston ofc    jokes aside even the supporting roles were great eg josh peck is in the movie last time i saw him was in drake  josh gave me a feeling of nostalgia    its great to see that christopher nolan has such a great reputation that he gets so many stars to play in his movies    i always think its quite hard to make a movie about historical events since you cant change that much and the end is clear but christopher nolan is such a great director    the film didnt feel like 3 hours total cause most of the time you were sitting there biting your nails     the music made the movie even better giving you the right emotions for each scene same as in interstellar    for me oppenheimer is one of the best movies i ever watched it made me feel every dramatic moment as if i were in it every laugh oppenheimer had i had too when he was shaken by the stuff he did i was shaken too    i apologise for my english since it isnt my first language i hope i could give you all one more reason to watch oppenheimer
Jul 31 2023,positive,this is best picture good not just that but better than this previous best pictures
Jul 31 2023,positive,oppenheimer blew me away it was very well directed and acted i expect it will win academy awards
Jul 31 2023,positive,definitely a bit longer than it needed to be but it will give you the best soundtrack visuals cinematography best lead acting and much much more  christopher nolan and cillian murphy amaze with their level of passion and commitment to detail
Jul 31 2023,negative,the acting was great but such a boring movie i wouldve rather seen it as a documentary but damn it was so hard to stay awake
Jul 31 2023,positive,had a lot of great actors but not that much explosions
Jul 31 2023,positive,oppenheimers reason is cillian murphy and christopher nolan they just have this one in the bag
Jul 31 2023,positive,best acting ive seen in a while every role perfectly casted
Jul 31 2023,negative,the procedural parts should be cut out  so the first hour and the last hour   completely unwatchable except when they are actually at los alamos building the bomb  so disappointed
Jul 31 2023,positive,great movie learned a lot about oppenheimer
Jul 31 2023,positive,enjoyed this movie a lot great imax experience
Jul 31 2023,negative,i dont get the love for this movie the music score was more suited for an action movie even in scenes that were in small rooms of people just sitting talking the booming soundtrack made me think batman was gonna smash thru the wall maybe turning the sound off and reading subtitles would make it better
Jul 31 2023,positive,excellent loved hearing and seeing about the history and the brains involved
Jul 31 2023,positive,this was the best movie i have ever seen every second of this film is captivating and i wanted the movie to continue for another 3 hours when it was done the first time i had ever cried during a movie the characters themselves are so well written and you could feel what every character was felling and oppenheimer felt like you knew him since kindergarten by the end of the movie the music was perfection and the sound work was out of this world and it was the first time sex in a movie didnt fell forced  the bomb was the best cinematic experience of all time better then when the world turns to color in the wizard of oz anybody who doesnt like the movie definitely had a fired attention span from tiktok and think that the best movies known to man are marvel and mission impossible movies truly a philosophical and heavenly experience youre missing out if you wait and watch it on streaming a must see
Jul 31 2023,negative,the movie was somewhat boring
Jul 31 2023,negative,soooo hard to follow and way to long 
Jul 31 2023,positive,with not much idea on the full plot of this movie i was pleasantly surprised i definitely was going for the nolan of it all i saw it in 70mm and wish i had done imax its not a movie id repeat soon but its definitely going to win all the awards the acting is phenomenal and its spectacularly beautiful the sound is piercing and haunting
Jul 31 2023,positive,while it suffers from the same issues as christopher nolans other films do such as audio balancing issues and occasional pacing issues the performances and surprisingly tightly constructed third act elevate this film to greatness
Jul 31 2023,neutral,boring so boring i dont think ive checked my watch so often during a film in the hope that perhaps somehow ive misjudged how much time has passed and can go home soon acting is ok but there is zero story to follow dont bother
Jul 31 2023,positive,nolans oppenheimer once again leaves audience with a memorable 3 hours the amazing performances from cillian murphy and robert downey jr only makes it better arguably one of the most impactful movies in the last decade
Jul 31 2023,positive,one of christopher nolans best films in quite a while after the more underwhelming by his standards anyway dunkirk and especially tenet oppenheimer already has the more straightforward narrative and better sound mixing going for it but what truly makes it amazing is not just the buildup to that scene but also the strong performances dialogue that is never boring to listen to despite the subject matter intense score and a combination of great pacing  good editing to avoid making the threehour runtime feel tedious making for a riveting dramatisation of real events nolan had the difficult task of making a biopic about the father of the atomic bomb appeal to millions of moviegoers who are unlikely to know who he is and i think its safe to say he succeeded big time  edited to add finally nolan won an oscar after years of getting snubbed now i can actually sleep at night
Jul 31 2023,positive,one of the best films i have seen ever its fast paced dialogue wise and if youre bad at remembering names like i am it can be a clusterfk in some spots but i pieced together the parts that confused me and overall loved the film going to the theaters again next weekend to watch it again might even go a third time    absolutely watch this in theaters people the soundtrack was so intense it felt like the movie was grabbing you by the shoulders and shaking you to wake cillian murphy was beyond a doubt the best casting decision ever for oppy the physics is well explained just enough to understand the actual process in developing the atomic bomb and oppy has great emotional depth in this film so much i didnt know about him before each of the star studded cast pulls their weight and does an amazing job too many to name them all     go watch it go watch it now
Jul 31 2023,positive,the realism the cast and the story itself were excellent
Jul 31 2023,positive,great movie  one of the scenes had my heart racing the music was amazing
Jul 31 2023,negative,i didnt like oppenheimer very much and most of the characters in it didnt seem like each other very much  and that made it difficult to watch    there are almost three distinct films here     1  we are bored neartodeath by the filmmakers obsession with oppenheimer and his various friends communist party sympathies  to the point that it bordered on procommunist party propaganda we are introduced to a cast of characters who dont seem to be particularly friendly with each other arent particularly likable though all are quite impressed with one anothers intellectual credentials rank or social status  boring       2 the manhattan project itself leading up to the trinity test the first successful test of an atomic bomb  this was the only part of the film even remotely interesting or engaging and even this section of the film was slow  there were conflicts amongst characters which were poorly explained or hard to follow      3 and the final third bores us near to tears with the story of oppenheimers loyalty hearings concerning his security clearance and a senate hearing where the villain is vanquished though not in a particularly satisfying way     at 3 hours long its simply too long  and the filmmaker or script writer seems enamored of their own voice without any idea how boring time consuming perhaps insufferable his film becomes      virtually every current actor is in this film and all of their performances are first rate  yet the film itself it tedious slow and long sooooooooooo long and boring  though it had moments  but just moments      i want those three hours of my life back  i learned little new information and didnt enjoy any of the characters most of whom didnt seem to like one another  not the least of which none of oppenheimers wives or lovers seemed to like him very much  its difficult to watch a film where there is almost no one to root for and like the other characters in the film you dont like anyone on screen very much  i wrote my review as a warning to others  watch it on 12x speed or higher on netflix when it comes out if you must
Jul 31 2023,negative,the movie is hyped to be watched at imax but has nothing that makes it an imax movie it should have been released as a documentary on netflix there is just conversation among few people in a conference room for most of the time its difficult to understand what people are talking about waste of time and money fell asleep towards the end as its so boring
Jul 31 2023,positive,entertaining and great acting
Jul 31 2023,negative,way too overhyped the movie was bad and really boring
Jul 31 2023,positive,yes is maded for the hands of my minions
Jul 31 2023,positive,christopher nolan at his best the acting storytelling and visuals were all superb my only gripe was the nudity which for me diminished the grandeur of this otherwise flawless masterpiece cheap cinema often needs sex to sell but nolan the greatest filmmaker of our generation doesnt need any help so this felt very much out of place to me
Jul 31 2023,positive,probably the best film i have ever seen it includes einstein feynman fermi heisenberg bors and many many others im going again to see in imax incredible experience dont miss this one in a lifetime film in theaters
Jul 31 2023,positive,as someone with an affinity for history id say this movie is a mustsee easily one of the best movies of the decade and we arent even halfway through yet    the movies storytelling score and direction elevate the experience to a level few films can achieve
Jul 31 2023,negative,bloated overlong confusing the sound was terrible and the score frequently overpowered the dialogue too many characters and too much jumping around in time interesting history but could have been told way more succinctly
Jul 31 2023,positive,the third hour of the movie  post hiroshimanagasaki  was better than the first two hours however this movie did not need to be three hours and i was ready for it to be done the casting and acting was excellent but the script was a bit bloated
Jul 31 2023,positive,an eyeopener masterpiece definetly a mustwatch
Jul 31 2023,positive,wow i hope to make a movie this good and it probably be 3 hours and 21 minutes and 0 seconds long
Jul 31 2023,positive,it was a great movie and great story of robert oppenheimer but they could have left out the sex scenes as they did not at to the story any and the volume couldve been a little lower but overall very good
Jul 31 2023,positive,gripping sobering thoughtprovoking i went home to read more indepth factual information regarding oppenheimers life and work
Jul 31 2023,positive,great drama with excellent visuals characterization and dialogue it dragged on a bit at times but overall the movie was a great experience especially in imax
Jul 31 2023,positive,just with the first scenes oppenheimer gave me goosebumps with the combination of the cinematography and the music what a masterpiece
Jul 31 2023,positive,im completely speechless this film is by far one of the best films ive ever seen just no words
Jul 31 2023,positive,just a masterpiece from the soundtrack to the dialogues three hours feels too short you will always be on the edge of your seat incredible pacing just perfection to its core   that is the definition of a movie
Jul 31 2023,positive,a spectacular tourdeforce movie with brilliant direction acting screenplay casting and effects a powerful true story into the majesty  horror of the atomic bomb the official end of wwii a must see
Jul 31 2023,positive,sound was awful could not hear the complicated dialogue and hence plot was somewhat obscure
Jul 31 2023,positive,awesome movie and story that was told about oppenheimer
Jul 31 2023,negative,if youre interested in seeing the climactic and utterly important devastation an atomic bomb can cause youll be saddened to know that a 90 minute court case takes its place imagine if the 1997 movie titanic didnt show the sinking of the ship thats oppenheimer
Jul 31 2023,positive,awesome what are you doing reading the reviews get up and go see it
Jul 31 2023,positive,an instant classic that future generations will view endlessly
Jul 31 2023,positive,fantastic acting and a potentially great story which took waaaaaay too long to tell and shoved in far too many irrelevant scenes that plus the unexplained delusionspsychosis scenes made it less engaging than it should have been
Jul 31 2023,neutral,i left at just over two hours it wasnt going to improve for me  this is really a biopic of oppenheimer which is visually disappointing considering its imax delivery    there was a lot of talking very few closeups and an ensemble cast which included small parts played by significant actors which i found distracting    re the visuals  nolan commissioned kodak to create a 70mm film stock to work in an imax camera  great i thought this would mean we would see dramatic images in bw like salgado shooting the bombing of hiroshima     instead the opportunity was wasted the scenes shown at least up to 2hrs 10 were just bw scenes no visual drama    sometimes the film would move back in time to earlier years but with no date on screen and then flick to a bw scene and then back to the present day confusing    i dont think nolan has bested the dark knight and i enjoyed the prestige more than oppenheimer   i never really forgot that i was watching a movie a christopher nolan movie    i do recommend the documentary trinity and beyond which really carries the horror of the nuclear arms race     i no longer trust rt reviews my guess is studios are paying review farms to pump up numbers even rt marks films fresh when the text is certainly critical
Jul 31 2023,positive,i couldnt write this review upon watching the film immediately because my brain still didnt recover from the experience ive had with it    i was really excited and so were everyone else before it was released christopher nolan as director the trailers images and everything in production related to the film was huge and especially the casting members    ive never had a feeling in the cinema like the one i had after the ending hit and the credits rolled since maybe the joker back in 2019 emotions were everywhere    this film tackles the story of one of the most important events in our history and the person behind all of it j robert oppenheimer the father of the atomic bomb    its a 3 hour journey full of nonstop and engaging dialogue thatll keep you focused and wondering in some of it trying to decipher what it means a lot of figures of history and character names are mentioned and the interactions and relationships between them unfold    cillian murphy fully deserves the oscar award for best lead actor 100 especially when it comes to the emotions in his eyes you can clearly distinguish between different emotions in his face just by the face and eye shots that christopher nolan likes to do    the soundtrack and music are definitely second main protagonist after cillian murphy they were some of the best ive heard in years the way they blend in with the scenes creating astonishing scenes that give unimaginable feelings and goosebumps it definitely carried the film in many times    the direction choices and editing in most of the scenes are out of this world and amazing    the rest of the cast were really amazing and its hard to list each and everyone of them as they are a lot but they were all up to par and amazing    experiencing this on the biggest imax screen with a 7 star service made it 100 times better    if you ever had any doubt about what cinema is and what it could be this film is it    ive never given a film a full rating before because no piece of entertainment can be perfect but ill be honored to give my first one to oppenheimer as ive seen nothing that would make this film experience less than that and if there were any its very very minor
Jul 31 2023,positive,excellent only nitpick is the editingpacing is a bit frenetic as it tries to tell a lot but its still great imo
Jul 31 2023,negative,this is a very boring movie not needed imax not needes 3 hours it was really a pain
Jul 31 2023,positive,sooooo boring and i love a historical movie my wife fell asleep for like 30 mins and not only did she not need to be caught up but i kind of envied her
Jul 31 2023,positive,imagine a chess match between the greatest players in the world now add an incredible cast in a scenario that recreated the atomic bomb without the use of cgi a masterpiece for those who admire nolans work
Jul 31 2023,positive,still processing  a stunning masterclass of acting from murphy downey and blunt  a cavalcade of star cameos to keep the brisk story moving at a frenetic pace visually stunning you will walk away with a lot to process about government humanity and the consequences of scientific achievement
Jul 31 2023,positive,christopher nolan delivered and i delivered for his moviebravo
Jul 31 2023,positive,hauntingly great film about the costs of integrity in a society where its become increasingly devalued
Jul 31 2023,positive,movie helped make good sense of the how and why the a bomb was built  the movie jumped around a little to much and would cause you to loose focus    the key thing to pay attention to is how our government and the people in power can manipulate the scenario just based on who they put into power
Jul 31 2023,positive,how can you have high suspense music for an entire 3 hours while people are basically standing around talking  absolutely a movie that needed to be made but too laborious  sorry to have to say that about chris nolan who is a genius
Jul 31 2023,positive,not going to jump on the band wagon and say that this film was exceptional brilliant etc  but i will say that it was interesting to see what went into building the atomic bomb seeing it from a different perspective as they have been many movies about the manhattan project the actors the script the pace was great however the only negative i have for this movie is it could have done without the sex scenes i am not a prude in any way but these scenes were totally useless and had no real bearing on the story telling in all honesty it really seemed like just gratuitous sex to just tick a box for an rrated movie but it truly could have done without them other than that i thought it was a really good movie
Jul 31 2023,positive,i am become oppenheimer
Jul 31 2023,positive,brilliant movie and performances  should be sweeping the oscars
Jul 31 2023,positive,an absolute masterpice and the music is phenomenal
Jul 31 2023,positive,instant nolan classic
Jul 31 2023,positive,definitely not for everyone its very dense in content information and characters even rodrick is here but for those who think they might like it or have an interest in history you will love it the performances score visuals cinematography everything
Jul 31 2023,positive,dont be scared by the runtime it is used well plenty of worthless shorter movies out there if you judge filmes solely on their runtimes  must see on the bighest screen you have access to ive been a lifelong nolan fan and this is the first movie he has shown breathtaking shots
Jul 31 2023,positive,excellent movie robert downey jr gives an oscarworthy performance  christopher nolan finally gives us back the great intelligent movie hollywood was lacking for many years now
Jul 31 2023,positive,never in my life have i had the pleasure of watching a master piece unfold before my own eyes nolans adaptation of the book american prometheus is spot on and shows a deep understanding of the mafia behavior dr oppenheimer had to endure through it brings justice to the event that changed humanity for ever and undeniably created a new world order a must see a well done film one without having any knowledge of filming or cinematography after watching this movie the audience knows the dedication and care that went into it everything was on point from casting to costume and set design everything cillian murphy deserves all the appraise he is deserved for his brilliant portrayal of oppenheimer the movie might seem long but it always keeps you engaged you cant wink i recommend to watch it immediately
Jul 31 2023,positive,the movie was overall the best movie ive seen in ages the only thing that i didnt like was that there were 2 extended scenes of completely unnecessary nudity the nudity did not add to the story line they could have gotten the story line across without it but the story was great the acting was amazing the cinematography was astounding
Jul 31 2023,positive,historical masterpiece 
Jul 31 2023,positive,the visuals were so crisp and stunning the sound was powerful and immersive while the movie was 3hrs long it was paced very well never a dull moment
Jul 31 2023,positive,overall an interesting approach to the development of atomic bomb and the us race with the manhattan project the storyline is fairly good although the director seemed to create distrust in the us government response to war and the deep sentiment that americans had against the japanese who were relentless in their attacks in the the pacific there were a lot of truths and half truths raised about oppenheimer and his loyalty to the us and eventually being denied a security clearance  i did not care for the blatant sex scenes and nudity that left nothing to the imagination his relationship could have been brought out without exposing so much nudity it really didnt add anything to the story the ending is  quite dramatic in demonstrating some justice to the political persecution that oppenheimer faced the acting overall and special effects were excellent
Jul 31 2023,positive,phenomenal soundtrack great acting and superb writing just felt it couldve been told in 2hrs instead of 3 and more footage of the devastation
Jul 31 2023,negative,the story was extremely whitewashed doesnt mention any of the indigenous people killed at los alamos in fact it seems like a deliberate attempt to erase their stories to paint oppenheimer with sympathy nolan tries to paint his image with complexity forcing the audience to play judge jury and executionerdeciding whether or not there is any morality behind oppenheimer or the american government however in doing so he doesnt actually show anything from nagasaki or hiroshima not a single japanese actor or person is ever shown in the film of course theres also the common nolan problem where the women are props and just inexplicably crazy without giving them the justice of explanation or depth nolan has this problem where he writes women but not characters     if you want to watch a movie where it makes the deaths of 200000 real people revolve instead around an ego battle between two white men then watch oppenheimer if you want to watch a movie that has a frantic pace yet still manages to be boring through useless dialogue then watch oppenheimer if you want to a watch a movie that forces you to remember useless background characters mentioned once 45 minutes ago then watch oppenheimer if you want to leave the movie feeling bereft and grieving possible potential then watch oppenheimer    oppenheimer couldve been about a man who was so blinded by his own hubris and compulsive need for progress that he disregarded the lives of people he viewed as playthings in some part it was but never enough to be satisfying or make much sense the movie wants you to root for oppenheimer i refuse to
Jul 31 2023,positive,this was an awesome movie   i truly enjoyed it
Jul 31 2023,positive,really well done movie much better than i was expecting and actually taught me a lot i didnt know about his life
Jul 31 2023,positive,excellent energy felt like a 3 act movie and the 3rd act seemed not connected with the themesfocus of the first two acts over worth it see it in the theaters if you can
Jul 31 2023,positive,this is a great movie about one of the foremost geniuses of the last century  epic  this movie is not for anyone with a short attention span
Jul 31 2023,positive,great movie great acting oscar winning
Jul 31 2023,positive,loved the movie im excited to see it again
Jul 31 2023,positive,sad deep and thought provoking
Jul 31 2023,positive,just okay   bad audio made it difficult to hear in many sections timeline was hard to follow and there were way too many characters to keep track of  historical perspective was interesting but in hindsight i wish i had waited to see it at home with closed captioning
Jul 31 2023,positive,an excellent biopic put together in traditional nolan style falls off at times also in traditional nolan style mainly due to some of the overarching subplots that dont necessarily need to be there that said they dont divert the attention from the main events or make the scenes themselves uncompelling to watch they just feel out of place ultimately it is an incredible spectacle that tells a complex story about an even more complex man in ways that make one deeply appreciate the sheer amount of creativity and intuitivness nolan pours into his works
Jul 31 2023,positive,loved the movie overall excellent cinematography only thing i dislike was the sound being too loud
Jul 31 2023,positive,this is one of the best movies probably the best in the past few years while many complain about the lengthy runtime it is necessary for the plot and the beauty of this movie the morals in this movie make you contemplate your own morals
Jul 31 2023,positive,best movie ive seen in many years oscar wins will abound dont let three hours keep you away
Jul 31 2023,positive,im a huge history buff and movie buff combine them both and i am an eager beaver especially with christopher nolan directing it     1920s  1960s dr j robert oppenheimer is a brilliant scientist as he prepares to testify before the us atomic energy commission rear admiral lewis l stauss is a government employee as he prepares to testify before congress in the years of these men meeting each other and preparing their fate before two us government agencies the history of science and politics comes to a head when the specter of the second world war emerges allied physicists begin work on the manhattan project the us atomic weapon program as the multitude of scientists soldiers and policymakers do not just work on a project that affects the war but also the postwar world strauss and oppenheimer butt heads as the successes of the manhattan project incur controversies that end in both men enduring disgrace  this was a phenomenal movie that just screamed success from the moment of the first trailer to the first box office numbers christopher nolans previous successes made it clear that this man is a hardworking talent and this was a guaranteed success i am critical of how he tells the story but the acting and the respect for history were splendid the cast was amazing with murphy downey damon blunt pugh and the rest the effects or i should say the effect was marvelous this is a movie that makes you think but at the same time can enforce your opinions over the controversy that came from the creation of the atomic bomb but this is a great film and worthy of praise
Jul 31 2023,negative,i heavily disliked this movie in the aspect that nolan nitpicked pieces of history to put into the film he completely brushed over the logistics of the trinity testing to an indian burial site when it was actually a whole town of indigenous peoples it was little quips like these and the complete whitewashing of what happened that disappointed me i thought this movie could have had a positive impact on the fact that it could bring light to certain topics that arent brought up in the mainstream media that are important since its such a big film but nolan was not up for the task  although i do understand its supposed to be oppenheimers story the creative freedom nolan directed was distasteful at best and harmful at worst
Jul 31 2023,positive,masterpiece must watch in imax or dolby to get the immersive experience that nolan takes you through
Jul 31 2023,negative,the story was good but all over the place and the sex scenes were so not needed
Jul 31 2023,positive,an important story brilliantly told mesmerizingly acted a must see
Jul 30 2023,positive,acting was superb and the story was very informative
Jul 30 2023,positive,he fucked and made bombs what a time to be alive
Jul 30 2023,positive,absolutely amazing and captivating the entire three hours enough said 
Jul 30 2023,positive,very stunning and memorable experience
Jul 30 2023,positive,the best movie since parasite by a country mile perhaps even better one of the best films of the 21th century and one of the finest pictures i have ever watched everything from the acting screenplay and the visuals were to perfection the filmed juggled so much and yet it all blended in perfectly probably nolans best work in my opinion
Jul 30 2023,negative,way too long boring at times way too much in the story should have stopped several times but kept going very painful to sit though
Jul 30 2023,positive,great movie but the background music crowded out the dialogue earlyon  otherwise a good movie with plot historical significance and meaning
Jul 30 2023,negative,overly wrought poorly paced badly directed and edited the script feels like satire cillian murphy is phenomenal and so are the wardrobe and cinematography but thats it     i am a nolan fan but this was a huge miss zero depth or development just one frantic pace that ends up a boring and exhausting experience i guess even nolan is human after all
Jul 30 2023,positive,oppenheimer has the greatest acting and storytelling i have ever seen oppenheimer is not a movie it is an experience when you sit down to watch oppenheimer it leaves a long lasting impression on you moreover it is one of those things that when you finish watching you feel like an entirely different person if i was to describe oppenheimer i would say it is the most beautiful experiences that your eyes and brain can register needless to say it is a must watch my only problem with oppenheimer is that i wish it was longer
Jul 30 2023,positive,kept my attention all 3 hrs fast paced and will probably go back to see what i missed
Jul 30 2023,positive,a masterful piece of cinema by christopher nolan its a slow burn with a satisfying finish
Jul 30 2023,positive,best movie i have seen in a very long time long time  academy award winning performances
Jul 30 2023,positive,loved it so much that i went online and bought the book american prometheus upon which it was based as soon as i got home from the movie theater
Jul 30 2023,positive,surprisingly the part after the bomb was the most intense
Jul 30 2023,positive,yes its good its not boring and wasnt too long but if there was ever a movie that needed subtitles oh my god this is it the score was so loud at times i wanted to jump in the movie so i could hear what the hell they were saying one scene was worthy of a large screenguess what scene that is this is really not a big screen movie since its 99 smart people with accents talking
Jul 30 2023,positive,acting was outstanding and the story is incredibly compelling
Jul 30 2023,positive,honestly the best movie ive ever seen and you know its not for everybody but still a good movie nonetheless
Jul 30 2023,positive,this is the second time weve seen oppenheimer  the first time was not in imax  the movie itself is obviously amazing because it was our second time  as much as i like the imax theater the sound was 10 decibels too high  this movie is so close to perfect historically perfect that i encourage every american to see this
Jul 30 2023,positive,its exceptional in every respect  direction cinematography acting sound design editing  its historically accurate and scarily anticipates todays world  this is how our nuclear troubles began  its up to us from here on out    cillian murphy gives one of the best lead performances ever  robert downey jr is superb in support  the rest of the cast never strike a false note  the look and feel of the whole endeavor mark a turning point in the making of biopics  nolans steady guidance of the project does indeed make movie history    my review is here 
Jul 30 2023,positive,will probably like this more when i can watch at home  since its just dialogue 95 of the movie it didnt really need to be seen on the big screen was long and couldnt hear what people were saying every once in a while so that took me out of it
Jul 30 2023,positive,so yeah who knew that director christopher nolans newest film oppenheimer was the summer blockbuster we all needed its hands down the best film of the year for me so far like a lot of the directors films it may require multiple viewings a
Jul 30 2023,positive,great movie very entertaining 
Jul 30 2023,positive,its another win for christopher nolan and one not to be missed
Jul 30 2023,positive,powerful and thought provoking with an ensemble cast that enhances each performance like a link in a chain building up to an explosive end  oscar worthy performances in fact i predict lead cillian murphy for best actor robert downey jr best supporting actor florence pugh just edging past emily blunt best supporting actress  i left the theatre feeling much like i had just gotten off a rollercoaster ride thrilled scared excited alive all the while planning to do it again
Jul 30 2023,negative,the editing and pacing for the movie was all over the place the acting was cringeinducing at times looking at you matt damon repetitive and obnoxiously loud
Jul 30 2023,positive,excellent movie felt a tiny bit long but worth it
Jul 30 2023,negative,atrociously written the story is disjointed and suffers a bizarre left turn in the final hour which focuses on characters that the audience has had absolutely no time in which to connect i cant believe that technical filmmaking can blind critics to the most important element of any film  the script
Jul 30 2023,negative,long boring all over the place basically a snooze fest christopher nolan must be paying people for good reviews because no way this should be in the 90s 
Jul 30 2023,positive,excellent movie and cilean murphy is a brilliant actor
Jul 30 2023,negative,thats 3 hours of my life ill never get back the sound was awful i couldnt hear any of the dialogue in the first hour as the actors were mumbling and the music was playing constantly in the background which was driving me mad and strangly making me angry as the film progressed the music got more intense at one point it was someone scratching a repetitive noise on a violin  it was torture several couples walked out of the cinema before the end and i wanted to join them but my other half was enjoying it so i had to ride it out and fight the urge to fall asleep lots of people will love this film and it will probably pick up many awards im sure but for me it was a thumbs down
Jul 30 2023,positive,powerful entertaining aweinspiring best picture best director best actor best supporting actoractress best sound  and the list goes on my audience was actually laughing at the coming attractions because they are on the opposite end of the spectrum from oppenheimer do these idiots at wb disney et al not realize that what theyre producing is total crapola my biggest surprise was robert downey jr i can only imagine what goes through an actors mind when they realize and understand that theyre playing the role of a lifetime emily blunt was spoton and certainly worthy of a nomination chris nolan is a master of filmmaking r j oppenheimer as an everyman is portrayed with thoughtfulness and honesty by cillian murphy if theres only one movie you see this year 
Jul 30 2023,positive,great movie should have had more nuclear blasts tho
Jul 30 2023,positive,it is not for everyone this is not a movie like interstellar or inception not action packed not fastpaced this is a nearly perfect documentary that tells the story of oppenheimer in a way i did not think was possible the ending left me baffled and the soundtrack was one of the bests ive heard so far this movie is not for all but if it is for you i can assure you that you will get out of the theatre get home go to bed and you will still be thinking about what you just experienced 1010
Jul 30 2023,positive,a amazing christopher nolan film that shows the true awesomeness of creation and gives an omen of destruction
Jul 30 2023,positive,the movie was amazing i liked it from start to finish i am a big history fan oppenheimer was a very smart individual
Jul 30 2023,negative,the performances and overall story were great but way to long it could and should have been an hour shorter
Jul 30 2023,positive,loved it i would buy this movie on disc or on my phone masterpiece
Jul 30 2023,positive,thought it was an absolutely fantastic movie with great visuals and excellent cast and acting i do think the 3h runtime is a bit too long and dragged a bit but i thoroughly enjoyed the experience and would recommend it to anyone
Jul 30 2023,positive,liked everything about it the science was class the climax was excellent the terminology was magnificent and of course the effects
Jul 30 2023,positive,the experience was worth the length it keeps you captivated with everything unfolding especially around the bomb it also demonstrates the effects the bomb had on the people who worked on it it was practically perfection with everything connected it serves as a reminder that it was not merely words in history books that the terrible things truly took place and many people suffered and died even with the subject i would watch it again an experience that shouldnt be missed
Jul 30 2023,positive,i want to learn more about oppenheimer after watching this movie i enjoyed it and didnt feel the 3 hours definitely wanted to see more like the construction of the atomic bomb but overall it was great i love how cn did some scenes with two different meanings must see
Jul 30 2023,positive,majestic flow tempo and editing
Jul 30 2023,negative,boring as fuck  if you want to be entertained dont watch this
Jul 30 2023,positive,well acted but some of the scenes in the first part of the movie were hard to understand because of either accents or volume of their voices  didnt think we needed to have those several naked sex scenes and im not a prude but they were unnecessary sidelines in my opinion  last two hours were excellent
Jul 30 2023,positive,amazing performances from robert downey jr and cillian murphy for a three hour drama it seem to go by very quick got confused with some of the characters and also with the plot at times but overall it was an incredible story with brilliant performances although sometimes it got really loud in the theatre
Jul 30 2023,negative,movie was way too long doesnt deserve all the hype most boring movie i have ever seen doesnt need imax 
Jul 30 2023,negative,too boring could easily been told in 2h and not 3h great perfomance specially cillian murphy but that is all not worth going to the movies should have waited for streaming
Jul 30 2023,positive,this movie is exceptional the story the facts the pace its a 3 hour movie so pace yourself
Jul 30 2023,positive,wow  kudos to universal christopher nolan and the entire absolutely excellent cast  this was every bit as good as the powerful films hollywood used to make  thank goodness disney wasnt involvedthey wouldve turned this important moment in history into woke garbage
Jul 30 2023,positive,this is a must see i was going in there wondering if i was going to watch a 3h movie that should have been 2h not at all the story unfolds at a good pace i love the ethical issues raised in the film loved it 1010 would recommend
Jul 30 2023,positive,timely and important spoiler alertoppenheimers reputation was sullied by vindictive individuals who used the political chaos red scare of the time to frame and punish him for his beliefs
Jul 30 2023,positive,long story but very interesting
Jul 30 2023,positive,i loved every second of this movie twists and turns you wouldnt expect and kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time wonderfully made
Jul 30 2023,positive,is it a perfect movie nope does it merit 5 stars yup
Jul 30 2023,negative,very disappointed boring as hell very difficult to hear most of the dialogue because the score was way too loud over the top of it maybe it was just the sound mixing in the particular imax theatre we saw it in fell asleep several times and i wasnt even tired confusing timeline with way too much dull exposition avoid
Jul 30 2023,negative,the terrible audio made it impossible to hear the dialogue at times so i walked out
Jul 30 2023,negative,im a fan of nolan and with all the hype i was excited to see this movie the sound quality was really poor from the start making it difficult to engage with the dialogue the constant score  the always excellent ludwig goransson was too much and yes i get the aim of why he did this again it made it difficult to engage far too long kept falling asleep in the last half hour as for nolans love of giving  kenneth brannagh a part in his films and letting him do accents please make it stop
Jul 30 2023,positive,powerful   emotional   exceptional  genius  what a movie
Jul 30 2023,neutral,too much time spent on politics and back stabbing i would have preferred more info about the lab and the actual challenges
Jul 30 2023,positive,this is a definitive work for our current era of film a blockbuster that uses absolutely fundamental techniques in filmmaking to completely subvert audience conditioning and expectations through structure editing use of imax practical work and thematic focus nolan undos the damage of current blockbuster trends and creates a paramount of the mainstream medium the centerpiece is not the concrete but the abstract and reveals are about philosophical points not plot
Jul 30 2023,positive,been waiting for the story to explain why and how the decision was made to create the atom bomb since i was 14 years old and read hiroshima bombing short stories in high school those stories will haunt you and this film gives the human perspective of the ordeal cillian murphy is brilliant duh and robert downey jrs performance is masterful the cast is impeccable  cant imagine anyone else playing these roles a true must see
Jul 30 2023,positive,solid script and stellar performances
Jul 30 2023,positive,ive never left a movie review before now but i felt compelled after seeing this masterpiece twice and being on the edge of my seat both times this movie deserves all the awards that i hope it gets its a completely fresh new way to show a biopic and told one of the most important stories in the history of the world in a beautiful and gripping way if you wait to stream this later you will regret not seeing it in theaters
Jul 30 2023,positive,this film made feel absolutely terrified of the capabilities of mankind that out of fear we created the means to destroy ourselves i highly recommend it it portrays not the film genre of horror but real life horror
Jul 30 2023,negative,what should have been a very interesting movie about the atomic bomb and the man who made it possible was a very very slow unmemorable story with no clear point to it visually the movie itself is beautiful but the dull nature of the story leaves me wondering why such a star studded cast was needed for it     as it went on i found myself waiting for it to be over and when it finally did i was surprised as the moment seemed like it had been a spontaneous decision as if someone in production said dont you think weve dragged this movie on for a bit too long a good question 3 hours long and what for it is filled with pointless information and extremely long scenes inside interrogation rooms and courts as if nobody has anything better to do there are only a couple of genuinely interesting moments in the movie but that must make up only a very small share of the length    i would not watch this again
Jul 30 2023,positive,an outstanding movie exquisite production and amazing acting performances if this  doesnt have multiple oscar nods in all major categories hollywood deserves to be bankrupt
Jul 30 2023,negative,too long too much talking and not enough about the actual atomic bomb explosion cillian murphy was fantastic though
Jul 30 2023,negative,it was very promising but has a lot of flaws the story isnt very compelling once you get to the second half of the movie there are nudes scenes of course of one of the female actresses that add absolutely nothing to the story arent we past that at this point the dynamics with the senatoroppenheimer arent well explained and become muddy there are barely any female characters and the ones that there are arent portrayed positively definitely not worth the hype and not something id ever watch again meh
Jul 30 2023,positive,a thought provoking epic gut punch of a movie cinema at its best
Jul 30 2023,positive,good movie a bit long but worth seeing
Jul 30 2023,positive,engrossing and challenging stunning visually
Jul 30 2023,positive,loved this movie excellent acting very emotional great story just a little long  but didnt stop my enjoyment
Jul 30 2023,positive,oppenheimer is masterful filmmaking the writing production values casting editing art directioneffects cinematography sound and certainly the directing by christopher nolan i see the reason for the raving from cast members for murphys becoming j robert oppenheimer particularly downey jrs but downey himself gives a tremendous performance as a man embarrassed and haunted by it to the point of a heinous assault on a great mans character  nolans films are events and i am in for all of them its to the point that its almost difficult to be truly objective great actors and crew persons want dream of being asked on to one of his projects   the visual work here from the images flashing across the screen and oppenheimers mind in the opening scene to the trinity test put the viewer in the thoughts of the destroyer of worlds and on the site at las alamos as our world was forever changed the heightened breaths taken at the moment of explosion and reaction was a shrewd touch as it was the most extreme reality laid bare  i found no more than possibly one scene as excessive the control of time and place we see and return to at points in the lives of those involved in this stretch of history is impeccable in the hands of such skilled professionals but nolan most of all   ive seen it twice now and find it is an exceptional addition to the cinematic canon 44 stars
Jul 30 2023,positive,definitely the best movie of the year
Jul 30 2023,positive,loved the sound design and the rhythmpace of the movie definitely doesnt feel like a three hour movie
Jul 30 2023,negative,i normally like chris nolan movies but i do wish this had longer than what seemed to be a 30 second scene in the first oh hour hour and a half of the movie  nothing seemed to be given time to emphasize significant  perhaps because it tried to jam everything in so much but the first real scene that seemed to develop the focus of the movie oppenheimer was the communist party and romance scenes  i think if they hadnt jumped around soooo much in that first half of the movie and just combined 3x30 second scenes into 1 more could have been taken away instead i felt like i got an hour long trailer and a two hour movie about the last half of the manhattan project and a security clearance review with a pinned on political batt
Jul 30 2023,positive,an absolute must see  keeping in mind that is biopic it is long full of events characters ideas science and politics   it is a movies i believe is even more enjoyable if the audience is reasonably aware of the historical period the war the cold war the role of the atomic weapons etc it is nonetheless approachable by everyone  it is a movie that invites the audience to think suggesting questions not easily let alone comfortably answered   it requires time to be digested and like a good wine it leaves a good taste long after having enjoyed it
Jul 30 2023,positive,it was rlly good but not something ill watch again maybe in like a year or two
Jul 30 2023,negative,useless over complexifiction too long disappointed
Jul 30 2023,positive,this movie is a great film for anyone who dont know oppenheimer or his story the leading actors in this film deserve an oscar award such great performances by each of them but the one that stood out the most to me was emily blunt yes such a versatile  well rounded actress she literally can play comedy as well as dramatic roles
Jul 30 2023,negative,ill start off by saying that the movie is beautifully acted and somewhat engaging in the beginning when it made the effort to tell the story but quickly ascends to such a pace that your just flashing from scene to scene so quickly that you lose all understanding of what is going on and why theyre doing it their is no explanation  of the characters motivations the incredibly fascinating science behind what their doing is basically in favor nonsensical images of the quantum world the horror of hiroshima and nagasaki is glanced over the romances have no romance at all they appear to just be around each other despite having no affection for each other despite starting a subplot about not being able to attend on his child its never followed up on the final conflict is just a boring series of meetings with loud intense music that left me wondering why i should care about anything within that whole sequence     in short the whole film missed the entire point of the story the science the romance the moral quandaries the horror of hiroshima and nagasaki the explanation of who the hell oppenheimer was and why we should care in lieu of loud noises surrounding a thoroughly historically unimportant and uninteresting clearance hearing i left feeling like it was a waste of my time
Jul 30 2023,positive,holy shit visually stunning and a viscerally compelling story i had no idea
Jul 30 2023,positive,decent long and too much dialogue to keep up with
Jul 30 2023,positive,one of the best movies i have seen in a long time excellent cast excellent screenplay superb acting and the story line fabulous a must see for any science and politics minded people  academy award material for sure
Jul 30 2023,positive,solid movie but i feel like it is over rated it kept my attention and i did not feel the 3 hour run time i would say unless you want to see it on the big screen or support theaters you could just wait to see this on streaming
Jul 30 2023,negative,definitely felt like 3 hours  nolan really crammed as much information into every scene which lasted about 15 seconds each  also it was less about the bomb and more about the governments attempts to deny him security clearance after the fact  seriously  a movie about security clearance  character development was confusing and fleeting leading to a severe lack of connection to anybody on the screen  if it werent for the incredibly loud buildup and startle audio i would have slept through most of it
Jul 30 2023,positive,i watched it 3 times in a day
Jul 30 2023,positive,i liked the film and thought it was a very good film christopher nolan once again proves his mastery of storytelling and soundtrack creating a thoughtprovoking and visually stunning cinematic experience with a beautiful soundtrack however it is essential to note that this film might not appeal to everyone and is more suited for a specific audience    clocking in at around 3 hours one might expect a daunting experience but surprisingly the time seemed to fly by while my movie theatre fortunately did take a short movie break the films fastpaced nature kept me engrossed throughout and at the right moments the film was at a somewhat slow pace nolan has a unique way of weaving complex narratives that demand attention and concentration making sure the audience is captivated throughout the entire duration    one of the films standout features is its nonchronological order the film jumps between different timelines allowing the audience to piece together the storys puzzle as it unfolds this approach adds an extra layer of intrigue which kept me even more engaged trying to connect the dots between the various events    however no film is without its flaws and oppenheimer has one notable mistake it didnt affect the overall storyline however during a scene in leiden in the netherlands the characters were meant to be speaking dutch but instead they spoke german i am not sure how this is in the end result definitely with a dutch cameraman who filmed this movie who would definitely take notice of this flaw    oppenheimer is a remarkable film that delves into complex themes and historical events making it ideal for history enthusiasts and fans of intellectually stimulating cinema with its mesmerizing storytelling it may not be universally appealing but for those willing to embrace its intricacies it offers an unforgettable and satisfying cinematic experience
Jul 30 2023,positive,great movie  the scenes were top tear and the audio engineering was phenomenal    the story was hard to follow at times  but other than that  1010 
Jul 30 2023,positive,absolutely fantastic three hours long was definitely of concern but truly was not disappointing at all also very glad we saw it in theaters
Jul 30 2023,positive,3 hours passed very quickly
Jul 30 2023,positive,great movie enjoyed all of it
Jul 30 2023,positive,my mind exploded after seeing this movie
Jul 30 2023,positive,massive   well i should warn people that have traumas tho
Jul 30 2023,positive,the best of modern cinema
Jul 30 2023,positive,wonderful directing writing and acting all around nolan did a wonderful job in his storytelling way all the high profile actors did not dominated over one another in their performance but actually complimented each other  i have read book the american prometheus which majority of the information derived from i loved nolan touched on some important parts of the book but there is still important information you can get from the book  nolan proved cgi doesnt make an impactful film in storytelling this movie is a masterpiece towards bring back the traditional methods of filmmaking and storytelling
Jul 30 2023,negative,movies like this is why theres a writers strike because the entire hollywood making movie apparatus is failing this movie shouldve been a crisp two hours the final 60 minutes are an interminable slog of aaron sorkin west wingesque allegedly compelling dialogue that is utterly wooden and uncompelling what on earth was robert downey jrs character and make up why is a congressional hearing the climax of the movie why are there so so many featured characters     i see reviewers running over each other to praise this film and honestly it makes me happy theres an actor and writers strike the many oppenheimeratom bomb documentaries cover the bases here this movie was unnecessary hopefully on the other end of this strike we get more compelling movies that have a greater purpose than providing an opportunity for nolans grandiose purposeless fare
Jul 30 2023,positive,one of the best movie i ever seen the scene between oppenheimer cillian murphy and einstein tom conti are just wow
Jul 30 2023,positive,i have watch the movie three times at time of writing this is very likely nolans greatest achievement i shed tears throughout the movie the mark of a great movie is when you forget that this is not live footage from the time these are talented actors that inhabit the spirit of the individual they are playing the run time is often used as a crutch to wave negatively at the film i my case i never once looked for the time every actor and actress acted their asses off perfection through and through the highlight was the last few minutes of the film thoroughly enjoyable
Jul 30 2023,positive,a great movie only complaint is that the beginning of the story is fastpaced  the wider storyline is difficult to follow  make sense of but everything else more than makes up for it the bomb scene although underwhelming tells a great story and for that deserves 5 stars
Jul 30 2023,positive,a must watch this is a brilliantly made film by christopher nolan who also wrote a terrific script that the talented cast enjoy with excellent performances particular praise goes to cillian murphy who in completely embracing the titular role gives a powerfully evocative insight into an enigmatic individual whose intelligence success and failings provide for an enthralling film elevated by an absorbing audio visual imax experience that rewards the trip to the cinema
Jul 30 2023,positive,i was very impressed by the acting scenes accompanying sound it is the best movie ive watched during the last 20 years roberts experiences are  magistrally rendered perhaps sometimes too hastily
Jul 30 2023,positive,a great watch phenomenal sound and music and most certainly outstanding acting and directing by the cast and director
Jul 30 2023,positive,amazing see it and just go on the ride its as good as you are hearing christopher nolans most mature and well rounded film
Jul 30 2023,positive,the film has a good footprint which leaves viewers immersed in the plot some parts could be removed such as the nude scenes but it did not affect the experience that christopher proposed in the slightest amazing movie
Jul 30 2023,positive,great movie great story i read in the comments that a person gave this movie one star their biggest complaint was that movie was too loud the story is about the creation of the first nuclear bomb what did you except light music or maybe some nice music numbers in it
Jul 30 2023,positive,my son is very interested in history and is a history buff he wanted to see this movie ever since her heard they were making it i decided to take him bc it was the weekend before his birthday and an early birthday present i didnt think i would be that interested in it but i was wrong there might have been slow parts to the movie but i was interested and invested the whole time it was fantastic
Jul 30 2023,positive,if you found the pace uncomfortable i think that was the point the real doctor oppenheimer did as well
Jul 30 2023,positive,seriously unbelievably good film
Jul 30 2023,positive,such an amazing movie it incorporates many historical and scientific facts about oppenheimers life all while balancing many of oppenheimers own guilts the movie is very well paced and has near constant action and is genuinely very enjoyable 
Jul 30 2023,positive,amazing cast awesome and interesting story it can be a little ambiguous at points but i think thats the intent in order to build immersion another gem by nolan though im not quite ready to claim this his magnum opus like some but one of his best efforts indeed
Jul 30 2023,positive,i did a barbenheimer double feature after getting sucked into the trend and found this stunning  so much to think about afterwards so beautifully written and incredibly disturbing despite it being so long i really recommend everyone give it the time and attention it deserves
Jul 30 2023,positive,its just a masterpiece but please watch it in the theatres if you can
Jul 30 2023,positive,magnificent movie you can only watch it once but that one watch is unforgettable
Jul 30 2023,positive,blew me away never has 3 hours disappeared  so quickly nor have i wanted a movie to go on a story told with such a touch of greek tragedy  suspense cinematography and historical cameos  woven amongst some of the greatest minds of the 20th century  what is not to love a masterclass in presenting the difficult the immense the tragic  the nobel the flawed nature of humanity in a single genre
Jul 30 2023,negative,extremely boring 100 dialogue movie and more than half of the dialogue was unnecessary for a three hour film absolutely no emotional ties to the main character to give the movie depth and no character development whatsoever youd think they would delve into oppenheimers dilemmas and personal issues but theyre merely skimmed over for being so upset with the aftermath of his creation he was only distraught for maybe 5 minutes super boring extremely underwhelming cant even tell you some main points in the movie it was that damn boring
Jul 30 2023,positive,not as good as it could have been there are a lot of sequences that were dull although cillian and robert downey were exceptional the other star studded cast faded into the background richard feynmann for example who played a pivotal part in the manhattan project wasnt even mentioned by name once he was just seen playing the bonjo and had 3 lines of dialogue similarly the other great men of the project got referenced once or twice by name without any context of their role in the movie the actual bomb sequence left a lot to be desired and felt anticlimactic
Jul 30 2023,positive,one of the most beautiful films  masterpiece of are time nolan is at his best
Jul 30 2023,negative,seriously 92 approval rating when scrolling through the comments it doesnt see to be over 60 is rotten tomatoes playing with numbers   this movie wasnt so much about oppenheimer as it was about a dark side in americas history mccarthyism although that became a big thing only in the 50ties   it overshadowed the message of the movie had you lived in those days your neighbors could accuse you of being a communist and youd be deported having to proof you were not really amazing this happened but not only oppenheimer was a victim of this or was he many innocents were as well i slept the last hour as my wife seemed to enjoy the movie easily one of the worst movies ive ever seen
Jul 30 2023,positive,it was addictive from the start i recommend it to everyone knew the plot but it was very addictive
Jul 30 2023,negative,the trailer is actually the best part  the movie is slow confusing boring  and way too long started to doze off a few times but i made it through to the end  shouldve slept i love to go to movies in the theatre but if you want to see this one wait till its on a streaming service and not waste your money or time
Jul 30 2023,negative,either 40 min too long or 60 min too short if broken into three acts the first act was awful second was really good and the third was predictable performances are generally amazing and really carry the film moral dilemma of physicists was done well sound was generally bad and i missed a lot of dialogue but nolans portrayal of women is really problematic and i am having difficulty getting past that while i dont think i wasted my time i will not watch it a second time
Jul 30 2023,positive,this movies is well directed with incredible sound design
Jul 30 2023,positive,understand that summer herd mentality has kicked in with oppenheimer driven hard by the popular hype machine everyone who is anyone must see it as its name implies this film is about the man more than it is about the bomb so if your interest is about the technical aspects of oppenheimers masterwork you may feel that this movie bogs down for the last hour in a somewhat convoluted subplot that is harder to follow than its worth this movie could have been 45 minutes shorter given its focus nonetheless it will be nominated for every award hollywood has to offer rest assured
Jul 30 2023,positive,one cannot discuss christopher nolan without marveling at his exceptional use of a wall of sound it immerses us in the world he creates and leaves us spellbound but it is in those heartstopping moments when the sound abruptly disappears and silence takes over that nolan showcases his true mastery the stillness is more deafening than any noise and it leaves us suspended in anticipation
Jul 30 2023,positive,personally one of my favourite movies of all time the film may be 3 hours long but for me there was not a dull moment and everything that happened was done in a way that made it exciting christopher nolan has made yet another great film and seeing cillian murphy in a lead role executed perfectly if not before now has certainly cemented him as one of the all time greats     seeing robert downey jr in something else than a superherocomedy movie was refreshing and again shows his depth as an actor     all of the cast both infront and behind the camera did a tremendous job at telling a story very few know the full context of it is informative and exciting for viewers with little understanding of what role oppenheimer and the rest of the manhattan project had during world war ll     now i am become death the destroyer of worlds
Jul 30 2023,negative,if i could give it a 0 i would i would rather read a history book the movie was boring and hard to follow the actors were mumbling and trying to hard to speak with a accent but it came out as mumble jumbo 
Jul 30 2023,positive,nolans absolute magnum opus  cillian murphys best performance  a masterpiece of film making and non linear story telling encapsulating one of the most difficult and important moments in our history  it is long  but no longer than some other movies these days and it deserves every bit of praise it gets
Jul 30 2023,negative,just to give you a background on myself im a college graduate an rn and im very involved in film and making of film i walked out of this within the first 50 minutes i couldnt take it anymore theres just so much popcorn candy and soda i can have to keep me awake they actually did the story a disservice it was slow and confusing my husband staying until the end and he said he wished he had left when i did
Jul 30 2023,negative,this is a perfect example of a movie being unbelievably overhyped after seeing this i was incredibly disappointed i expected an exciting tale that was full of inspiration and accomplishment fueled with american history i got literally none of that from this movie the movie was 10 about the history of the bomb and 90 about politically charged proceedings that occurred in addition this movie was incredibly confusing with way too much dialogue and little action the only slightly exciting part was the scene of the bomb test and even that was depressingly lacking this movie was also way too long 3 hours of conversations and scenes of court proceedings and attempted accusations is not a good way to make a movie this absolutely a one time see movie i will never take the time to watch this film again 
Jul 30 2023,positive,the greatest film of cristopen nolans career
Jul 30 2023,negative,very disappointing  parts of it werent boring but i almost walked out  theres almost nothing but talking and a hearing about him being a communist for 3 hours  there were hardly any cool bomb visuals or horrifying things that were promised  i didnt mind the florence pugh nudity but it was wholly unnecessary to the story  trust me dont waste your money or 3 hours on this hype
Jul 30 2023,negative,i am ashamed of a film that minimizes the genocidal impact and justifies what happened there was never a moment in memory of the deceased or apologies for the damage how awful misguided american pride
Jul 30 2023,positive,an absolute masterpiece one of the greatest movies i have seen in my lifetime deffinetly watch it if you can
Jul 30 2023,negative,make sure you wear a watch because it is rude to keep checking the time on your phone
Jul 30 2023,positive,all around great film some sneaky spots for some big names that i had no idea would be in it too
Jul 30 2023,negative,disappointing an important part of history that people should know but it seemed as though the directorwriterproducer did not know what they wanted the movie to be inconsistent hard to follow bad dialogue and completely unnecessary sex scenes the sex scenes made the movie unserious and made me question whether any of the historical details were even accurate movie was also way too long if youre curious about this movie wait til you can watch it at home and then you can fast forward it
Jul 30 2023,positive,being one of the most highly anticipated films of the year by the time of writing oppenheimer will have been reviewed by pretty much everyone this review will likely add nothing nuanced or new to the discussion but will serve only as a vessel for this writer to shout from the rooftops about the utter brilliance of this film     as we are all by now aware the film follows the historydefining life of the american physicist j robert oppenheimer his path to create the atomic bomb and the fallout for the world and oppenheimer from its creation this is all set out before us in an impressive run time off three hours there was the chance therefore that oppenheimer could have easily run out steam it is however paced to perfection with you longing for the credits to never start rolling which is a stunning achievement in and of itself but good pacing alone does not make a great film so many aspects feed into building this into the spectacle that it is you could say each being like a marble in a glass bowl    to start with no one drops the ball with incredible performances being delivered across the board cillian murphy immerses himself in the role of oppenheimer to deliver an indepth look at what the weight of creating such a destructive force does to the human mind and conscience the scene in the los alomos gym as well as being emotionally draining for the viewer allows murphy to fully encapsulate the crushing moral weight of his actions in the face of the perceived success of the manhattan project and the winning of the second world war as well as this emily blunt plays the emotional range of kitty oppenheimer to perfection the interview scene between kitty and special counsel roger robb played by jason clarke who needs to be heaped with praise for his role also is the climax to this and is alone an oscar worthy performance thats not to mention robert downey jr who excels at making you loathe the politically deviant and selfabsorbed lewis strauss we will leave it there for individual acting but it is a rarity that such a stacked alist cast gives uniformly brilliant performances as we experience here     the trinity test was the horrifyingly beautiful sight that we all expected it to be and was the peak of some astounding visual effects  to do it all without cgi is a cinematic feat and shows it can be done strikingly well without a reliance on computer generated special effects and could signal a change in attitude towards the level of its use in future films     to go back to the trinity test scene what intensified the tense build is g√∂ranssons accompanying score the score does this incredibly well throughout and peaks with the final exchange between oppenheimer and albert einstein giving the already poignant words a dizzying level of impact     whats missing from oppenheimer does also need to be discussed not once does nolan rely on imagery directly from hiroshima and nagasaki take for instance the scene where oppenheimer is viewing a presentation about the fallout of the dropping of the atomic bombs on japan the camera is pointed directly at oppenheimer and the surrounding audience with the images being completely out of shot the reactions from the audience do enough to portray the abject horror of the events without having to rely on upsetting imagery to bring home the point nolan should be praised for this directorial decision     the set design and settings had the same attention to detail that the rest of the film boasts the blackness of the atomic bomb made you feel like you were looking directly into the heart of darkness itself the stunning new mexico landscape also punctuates the evilness of the events that unfolded within it and offers an interesting juxtaposition as to how something so naturally beautiful could be the birthplace of something so truly ugly its only accentuated by the deployment of 70mm imax film which we know nolan has worked to showcase and bring into more mainstream use     imax is also employed exceptionally to capture prolonged closeup shots that allows the audience to feel they are facetoface with the characters and to drink in the emotion they are exuding this is prominent from the first scene where we are presented with a young and troubled oppenheimer standing in the rain struggling with the boundaries that youth and inexperience bring to untapped genius this is also seen through the wisdom and concern that tom conti is able to portray in his role as albert einstein in the intimate and emotionally deep discussions between his character and oppenheimer         overall oppenheimer is an astoundingly complete cinematic study of morality every single aspect of the film delivers leaving you emotionally drained yet enamoured by what youve witnessed this is without doubt the best film of the year and possibly even the decade others will come close to reaching the dizzying cinematic heights and might have better commercial success but oppenheimer will stand strong as technically the best for the minority who just see this as a film with people talking about an atomic bomb its okay brilliant cinema isnt for everyone
Jul 30 2023,positive,theory will only take you so far
Jul 30 2023,positive,movie is more about the character study of the oppenheimer rather than depiction of war or nuclear bomb blast  how politicians misuse scientists at the time of crisis is indeed shown with so much details and depth  the movie is slow and audience need lot of involvement to fully understand the mental trauma of the oppie  nudity could have been avoided but still it might have been used as a statement  overall i feel it is a good movie it may not be as thrilling or exciting as usual nolan films but this one stands out for its unique treatment  a good watch indeed
Jul 30 2023,negative,3 hours i will never get back  the movie dragged confusing at times  nudity so unnecessary  not sure why i saw this in imaxmostly a movie about inquiries with alot of just talking  out of 3 hours you maybe get 5 min regarding the trinity test and even that is a let downso disappointed  would have loved a movie more about the process of making the atomic bomb with some background on oppenheimer  watching him sit and talk to a naked ladynot my idea of great work  please do not waste your moneytime on this movieits not even a rental  i love history and i know this movie was supposed to be about oppenheimer the manbut it needed to be a documentary or miniseries on tvnot a 3 hour movie in imax
Jul 30 2023,positive,a great movie acting and directing was amazing took off a half star because it could have been edited to be a tad shorter but overall this will sweep next years oscars
Jul 30 2023,negative,it is a documentary with many good actresses and actors that even it would not need because they have never done anything special so boring and extra scenes the whole story could be told in 10 minutes
Jul 30 2023,positive,little slow but interesting movie
Jul 30 2023,positive,amazing must watch for everyone
Jul 30 2023,positive,an epic biographic journey complimented by its ambitious cast and production oppenheimer powers through its 3hour runtime with exceptional pacing earning every minute as it unpacks and examines the multitude of social scientific and political forces that weigh on the titular figure in the roles of husband father scientist and in particular an american the narrative never pontificates any particular view of the man himself and actually invites the audience given a faithful telling of the facts to weight the unprecedented stakes against uncertain morality for themselves albeit in retrospect special note must be taken to appreciate nolans respect for his audience by not imposing on them presenting the life of a historic figure with subtle humanity but never manipulatively as with his love of analogue filmmaking nolan stays loyal to practical effects achieving remarkable results through masterful editing of sight and sound an experience worthy of the cinema
Jul 30 2023,positive,a must see for several reasons use of audio editing filming storytelling in writing and visual edit and acting next the moral dilemmas and ethical conflicts being portrayed oppenheimer is historically 90pct correct switching up certain things a little bit but leaving the message of the true events and ramifications intact  a movie to be experienced in a theatre for sure but if you cant  do watch when it comes out later as well     for me i havent enjoyed watching a movie where you leave theatre and keep thinking about it days later in theatre since joker that much
Jul 30 2023,positive,great movie  nolan  is a  genius
Jul 30 2023,negative,its a good history for us but its not really a good movie to watch i never get boring watching movie  like this before
Jul 30 2023,negative,the internet and the hollywood hype machine soured this movie for me
Jul 30 2023,positive,a beautiful emotional rollercoaster absolute must see
Jul 30 2023,negative,boring and confusing  half of the people were not identified and the film was about oppenheimers trial and the theoretical and testing of the atomic bomb  there was one test explosion and that was the only excitement in this film  the rest of it was mumbling and pained expressions  it could have been a lot better by showing the hiroshima explosion to portray the devastating effects of these scientists bomb to the audience but the scientists heard about hiroshima on the radio  the film goes back and forth from the trial to the building of the bomb but then strauss story is thrown in and this part is filmed in black and white for some bizarre reason  as we walked out people were saying how bad it was and how boring it was  2 hours would have been enough
Jul 30 2023,positive,oppenheimer was a refreshingly indepth exploration of an inherently complex man and an even more complex story  which undoubtedly changed the course of humanity as we know it  for that reason i  and seemingly many others have been willing to sit for three hours in imax theatres to watch the journey of j robert oppenheimer    i will admit that i came into the viewing experience with a working knowledge of oppenheimer the manhattan project and american politics more generally  notably as a nonamerican myself  regardless this hefty movie never felt stale or poorly paced and i appreciated the flexibility of the movie to change scenes spontaneously throughout    the performances matched the cinematography  with so many alist actors working harmoniously to develop the story for cillian murphys oppenheimer  i would personally express my respect for robert downey juniors performance as lewis strauss one of the best supporting performances i have ever seen    as i mentioned above the film is complex quickly paced and requires you to have a working knowledge of the films context  or a very open mind i appreciate this isnt for everyone but this style of film is not released every day  oppenheimer is a rare find in modern cinema and i would highly recommend you view it on the big screen whilst you still can
Jul 30 2023,negative,the acting was great the cast did their very best but the film was boring    the movie is essentially about a trial to reinstate oppenheimers security clearance and goes back in time to when the atomic bomb was built and tested  there is one big bang when they tested it but thats the only action in the film    i appreciate this is a biopic about oppenheimer not an action movie but there wasnt a lot to keep us interested in watching    considering the great critic reviews and hype about this movie we expected a lot more than people mumbling and staring into space    the film was shot in colour and black and white but it didnt seem obvious as to why  it wasnt for a timeline reason but seemed to be just for lewis strauss story  but the film is called oppenheimer not strauss    einstein being played by a man with italian not german heritage was a poor move too  people did leave the cinema before the end   and i completely understand why
Jul 30 2023,positive,typical nolan  intelligent yet accessible movie for grownups  try to see it in a theater with celluloid instead of digital  i saw it in paris on a 70mm print and it was a marvel for the eyes
Jul 30 2023,positive,thought provoking vissually pleasing breathtaking heartbreaking and gut wrenching and depressing in the most positive way
Jul 30 2023,positive,truly mind blowing
Jul 30 2023,negative,def so many fake 5star reviews here the movie was just awful  i wanted to walk out within an hour i kept thinking about how the movie could be made better the depiction of oppenheimer was flat and lacked depth and the storyline very long and and drawn out with very little by way of entertainment or substance the only slightly engaging part of the movie happens during the last 2030 mins but wasnt worth sitting thru to get there
Jul 30 2023,positive,i appreciate all the intelligent things about this and understand its a good movie however my real emotional reaction while watching it was one of disinterest and boredom i stopped paying attention and therefore in the last quarter when i was more interested i couldnt follow it im ok with that
Jul 30 2023,negative,last hour was unnecessary oppenheimers trialrdj was irrelevant
Jul 30 2023,positive,masterpiece best of christopher nolan
Jul 30 2023,positive,wow ive been waiting for a movie like this forever nolan knows best
Jul 30 2023,positive,christopher nolan did it again
Jul 30 2023,positive,never knew the details behind the manhattan project scientists have been and will always be slaves to the military so oppenheimers demise was not a surprise on the other hand it is a matter of survival as long as there are hitlers and putins better them than us
Jul 30 2023,positive,such an amazing film it was so intense and immersive i was on the edge my seat the whole movie the scenery and soundtrack were phenomenal the actors were spectacular definitely a must see one of my favorite movies of 2023
Jul 30 2023,negative,difficult to follow too much terminology couldnt hear some of what is said diction is not clear enough the action parts of it the actual testing wasnt until 23 of the way into it i imagined that they would test along the way but wasnt the case disappointed to be honest it may suit others but not all
Jul 30 2023,negative,i guess i prefer a movie that can pass the bechdel test over one that is 2 hours and 55 minutes of old white men talking about an explosion that either will happen or already happened
Jul 30 2023,positive,i didnt know what to expect from this film i am a huge christopher nolan fan and was waiting for this movie for well over 2 years and as such avoided most of the trailers to try and avoid giving anything away after watching it though holy cow i loved everything about this movie  the cast acting cinematography sound sfx my one and only critique about this film after my first viewing was the story i know its based off a book cant remember its title however i found it odd that this entire masterpieces climax rests on the security clearance hearings of oppenheimer and the imo juvenile grudge held by strauss even though rdj absolutely crushed that role all in all i will definitely add this to the chris nolan hits catalogue and i recommend you give it a watch especially in imax
Jul 30 2023,positive,a masterpiece but not for everyoneu need patience
Jul 30 2023,negative,if theres one thing i learned about this movie experience its to not believe the hollywood hype machine i will never trust rotten tomatoes ever again this is easily one of the worst movies i have ever seen
Jul 30 2023,negative,boo i felt oppenheimer was directionless emotionless and a poorly structured mess it was about as emotionally engaging as a quantum physics audiobook at 3x speed while the benny hill theme plays to a revolving door of characters in congressional hearings characters especially the women sketched like stick figures nolan you lost me for good
Jul 30 2023,positive,great picture while it had moments of confusion going back and forth in time it told the story in a manner that was interesting and at time quite riveting
Jul 30 2023,positive,as devastating as it is formally stunningits gonna make ur eyes ablaze after seeing this beautiful movie magnificent  scorecinematographyacting and nolan
Jul 30 2023,negative,all the hype i was having just to see a boring conclusion when the bomb scene finally came up it was so anticlimactic which is what made this such a bad movie
Jul 30 2023,positive,this movie chilled me to the bones in the best way possible the juxtaposition of scientists with this almost childlike curiosity of this new toy they could explore the workings of and the realisation of the absolute horror of their creation dawning upon them extremely fast paced fantastically layered and just an amazing experience to watch the biggest names of the scientific world in action weve read about these people and their work but to see them portrayed as something beyond just text in a book was breathtaking nolan portrayed it all so masterfully as always       i intend to watch this in the theatre again take all my money nolan you ingenious bastard
Jul 30 2023,positive,amazing its a 3 hour long movie in which you are captivated the whole way movie made to perfection incredible dont waste your time and go watch it
Jul 30 2023,positive,great movie without the forced representation 
Jul 30 2023,positive,if you like christopher nolan or historical movies then this is a great movie for you 1010
Jul 30 2023,negative,i was extremely disappointed that i had to sit through nudity several times  the same point could have been made without it
Jul 30 2023,positive,nolan does it again engaging and factual
Jul 30 2023,positive,some parts of the movie drags a little bit but other then that was great
Jul 30 2023,positive,is it possible to find a movie brilliant but not really be all that crazy about it that is how i feel about this film it presses all the right buttons i know  bad pun but not a film that hits all the right notes
Jul 30 2023,negative,genuinely confused by all of the perfect score reviews here this movie was 3 hours of straight dialogue most of which was very confusing almost entirely allegorical was it intellectual sure does that make for a edgeofyourseat thrilling theater experience like this marketed itself to be absolutely not oppenheimer himself as a protestors is hard to get behind because all in all hes not a very likeable and while the movie does a good job demonstrating his guilt about contributing to the demise of humankind the movie didnt know where to go from there it ended so anticlimactically especially for a movie that drew on and on and on with 3 hours of nonstop politicaldriven dialogue that i honestly lost interest in about halfway through sorry but this movie wasnt worth the ticket prices my partner and i both left wishing wed waited to rent it 
Jul 30 2023,positive,one of those movies you have to watch if you like true cinema meaningful movies and if youre interested in the deeper understanding of the human race you have have to watch this movie simply amazing
Jul 30 2023,positive,very interesting and entertaining
Jul 30 2023,positive,the sound was terrible movie is very good nevertheless
Jul 30 2023,positive,well directed snd acted but the sound mixing was terrible making the dialogue impossible to hear at several points throughout the film  still recommend it though
Jul 30 2023,positive,9510 incredible very few flaws master class from murphy with that being said i can see ppl not liking it if youre not into the topic or if youre not into more cinema type movies no action comedy etc it might not be your cup of tea 
Jul 30 2023,positive,this is a movie you cant afford to miss if you can see it and imax do it this is another christopher nolan masterpiece it just happens to be historical and very relevant
Jul 30 2023,negative,started great then the middle dragged and ending was okay not what i expected great acting but story could be more exciting i didnt know it was going to be a trial movie
Jul 30 2023,negative,a movie about meetings and inquiries with a very few moments at the trinity site acting was good enough but the story line dragged cutting it to two hours would have been a relief
Jul 30 2023,negative,horrible i hated everything i even had to walk before it ended i couldnt even watch it it was not good at all i cant belive they played in the theater its a disgrace it came out on the same day barbie will never a movie by this director again
Jul 30 2023,positive,great movie many topics about that controversial time from 1929 to 1955 western side always blame communism and soviet union
Jul 30 2023,positive,a movie for the ages an all time christopher nolan classic and a star studded cast
Jul 30 2023,positive,epic intriguing and morally contemplative
Jul 30 2023,positive,well done movie i need to read more about him and find out how accurate the history is
Jul 30 2023,positive,history was well told the cast was incredible and the story of dr oppenheimer was one that needed christopher nolan to tell
Jul 30 2023,positive,christopher nolan does it again all star cast lived up to their names and i genuinely enjoyed this thought provoking film
Jul 30 2023,neutral,acting was superb however the timeline was convoluted and the running time was way too long i appreciate the ambitious efforts but it just didnt work for me as well as i had hoped
Jul 30 2023,negative,horrible writing is this what hollywood thinks is the story  shallow word salad
Jul 30 2023,positive,i was expecting the protagonist to face more consequences but the final act turned the stakes to his clearance and not to the fact that hed created a weapon that murdered a hundred thousand lives
Jul 30 2023,negative,this was so boring i slept my brother slept my sister was trying not to sleep there were at least 2 other people in the theater loudly snoring at a certain point we were just making jokes this movie is boring
Jul 30 2023,positive,visual feast thought provoking storylinewell written imo rdj is going for that oscar next year emily blount fantastic female lead cillian murphy best supporting cast filled with alisters
Jul 30 2023,positive,somewhat of a snoozer and hard to stay awake acting was 5 and carried the movie the history component was interesting but unnecessarily long
Jul 30 2023,positive,absolutely incredible but a little hard to decipher the timeline
Jul 30 2023,positive,one of then best movie in years  compelling and extremely well acted
Jul 30 2023,positive,first time in a cinema for a few years  not to diminish the quality acting and production values but frankly it turned into a snorefest could easily have been a 2 hour watch not enough tension to sustain the seemingly endless and arid mccarthyist style inquiry and his betrayal by lewis strauss  it did do a good job of exploring the attractions of communism to intellectuals elites and idealists who were unlikely to suffer its negative effects  same then as it is now  though still a worthwhile watch and almost as good as fat man and little boy  1989
Jul 30 2023,positive,excellent production story telling music cinematography and acting were all incredible
Jul 30 2023,positive,problem was i saw it in imax and it was way too loud it would have done better in a normal theater
Jul 30 2023,negative,poor script l too long way to long
Jul 30 2023,positive,couldnt wait to see oppenheimer totally shocked by the sex scenes totally unnecessary and out of place the movie didnt need the x rated addition hence my 3 stars
Jul 30 2023,positive,literally blockbuster try to grab a seat in center of mid rows so you can also feel the waves of explosion  
Jul 30 2023,positive,for a 3 hour movie and it not being an action movie it keeps moving along and is very interesting didnt know a lot about the man before going to by the book to find out more
Jul 30 2023,negative,overrated whoever likes this movie is a sheep following the media herd awful movie that was so boring dont believe the hype
Jul 30 2023,positive,i havent seen a movie this good in years  the story line was great the acting was great the pacing was great the filmography was great the meaningfulness was profound  i walked away from the experience feeling deeply moved as only a handful of movies in my lifetime have done
Jul 30 2023,positive,thought provoking look at the father of the atomic bomb left the theater shaken
Jul 30 2023,positive,could have been about 20 minutes shorter 
Jul 30 2023,positive,i never thought i would like a 3 hour long biopic as i have done with oppenheimer nolans storytelling and direction at its finest the cast was so stellar and every actor gave such a strong performance i cant wait to watch it again
Jul 30 2023,positive,very interesting and exciting going to buy the book
Jul 30 2023,neutral,confusing  hard to follow as it jumps around to different time frames  gratuitous sex scenes and unnecessary nudity
Jul 29 2023,positive,cillian murphy really deserves the oscar for his performance the whole movie was amazing
Jul 29 2023,negative,a three hour long boring social media hype i did not like neither the idea nor its execution the plot was too much focused on the process to oppenheimer and disregarded any detail on the actual scientific challenges linked to the realisation of the bomb the filming style was confusing to say the least with a very thin story line and too many scenes flashing around in time     it was such a torture to watch that i cannot understand the positive reviews have been people been brainwashed by marketing
Jul 29 2023,negative,too loud too long and very slow could have been more exciting
Jul 29 2023,positive,really good but long nudity was unnecessary
Jul 29 2023,positive,amazing emotional well acted a movie for our time  a spectacular masterpiece
Jul 29 2023,positive,very good strong performances from all thought the nude scenes were unnecessary 
Jul 29 2023,positive,the movie was great and brilliant the actors were amazing especially the main ones and the story was interesting one of the best movies of the year its worth seeing 
Jul 29 2023,positive,christopher nolan sure knows how to make a movie about a conflicting character  morality is so grey life isnt as simplistic as that  people are contradictory and hypocritical thats what makes it compelling
Jul 29 2023,positive,nolans masterpiece  rdj will be nominated for best supporting actor  cillian was great
Jul 29 2023,positive,incredible movie  definitely something worth experiencing at the theater  i havent loved all of christopher nolans films but this is one of his best
Jul 29 2023,positive,great but deeply depressing why do no reviewers pick up on the most deeply depressing core of the film was that the senator wanted to destroy oppenheimer for some imagined slight even though he risked and ended up destroying himself in process
Jul 29 2023,positive,this is a big film taking on a big topic and the fact that it doesnt preach or patronise the audience is commendable many directors would have dished out some finger wagging   every performance is accomplished and its those performances that g iet this film across the line without them i dont think there would be enough here to hold our attention for such a long film   i think id have liked to hear a little more about the moral dilemmas facing the allies who daily were losing thousands of civilians andor soldiers it must have been desperate times   this is worth watching and is an important film it was just a little drawn out for me
Jul 29 2023,negative,naaaah the trailer looks a must watch but the action whaaa wait no action     but dont let my comment put you off do like i did pay to watch it     ah by the way most of the comments here are the lengthy as the movie and will make you sleep
Jul 29 2023,positive,a thoroughly enjoyable film with great performances sound editing and cinematography it is a bit too longselfindulgent and nolan hasnt improved on his issues developingportraying women characters it isnt nolans best but it is really good
Jul 29 2023,positive,a classic  overpowering visuals a gripping story and a oscarworthy performances by cillian murphy and rdj
Jul 29 2023,negative,three hours of pure torture main character was completely flat no emotion no feeling just staring into the camera score was like listening to cats fighting for 3 hours dull boring waste of time
Jul 29 2023,negative,felt more like a lecture than entertainment great acting but boring movie
Jul 29 2023,positive,i really like it the story the acting and the way the actor for oppenheimer looked so sad
Jul 29 2023,positive,went to see this in imax and wow it was brilliant every actor and actress in this movie was brilliant cillian murphy was fantastic
Jul 29 2023,positive,an amazing movie shining light on a piece of american history i never knew about and never really understood
Jul 29 2023,positive,an excellent movie in all regards stunning and thoughtful in its presentaton of such an amazing story oppenheimer was clearly a deep and conflicted man in troubling times he is one of the greatest ameicans of any generation no matter how you feel about the project a complex man for a very complex time in america no one would have wanted to make such decisions excellenty casting for everyone
Jul 29 2023,positive,a good movie about the ramifications of our actions
Jul 29 2023,negative,same as his last movie christopher nolan put me to sleep within the first hour  but this time i walked out after 80 minutes of my time being wasted      im a fairly intelligent man as is my wife  its not that we couldnt follow what was being said we just didnt care  i didnt care for a single character in that movie  i dont see how this movie got high reviews both audience and critics      if you didnt like tenet you wont like this film
Jul 29 2023,positive,you must see this movie it one of the best story line of the world war 2 movies ever love house they made the atomic boom in this movie 100 must see and they did good job on making it and show it works
Jul 29 2023,positive,if you have the chance to imax it do it i was mentally dialed in and felt like a fly on the wall has everything a motion picture needs oscar nods in this sucker for sure robert downey jr was magnificent  sit back and enjoy this masterpiece bathroom break before you go in 
Jul 29 2023,negative,i was hoping to see a movie all about the race against time to build the bomb and how the awful tradegy in japan changed things instead it was like watching a really really long courtroom drama with bits about the bomb thrown in there was no need for it to be 3 hours long genuinely gutted as i was looking forward to it it was so boring
Jul 29 2023,positive,its a testament to nolans skills as a filmmaker that a three hour film comprising men talking is powerfully engaging nolan is known for scale and spectacle and while the subject matter offers ample opportunity for this nolan instead focuses on the human element of the creation of the atomic bomb not the explosions one is enough to make its point not the grim reality of its results although these are discussed and referenced lightly through symbolic dream sequences nolan is at his most filmic here most symbolic perhaps more so than inceptions totem moment murphy is excellent as the lead whose inner workings and humanity are barely touched upon like his legacy the film focuses more on his scientific discovery than the people in his life but perhaps thats the point oppenheimer wasnt exactly the best husband and father and that they are given short shrift amid his scientific adventures or selfish gratification and dark consequences operates effectively as a narrative tool what little blunt has to do is wonderful owning the screen in the third act robert downey jr reminds the audience why after being mostly iron man for 15 years he is regarded so highly with a multifaceted performance gary oldman has one scene and thats all he needs as truman and plays the president like a mean spirited crimelord setting the tone for witch trial against oppenheimer when he dared suggest that this technology these doomsday weapons should be regulated properly the final moments are a tad on the nose but certainly powerful stuff there is no focus on the impact of the bomb no gratuitous explosions or city destruction this is not an action movie not a story of victory over oppressors it is the story of science triumphing and then being used to hold the world to ransom little is made of what communism is though it is apparently the antithesis of america which if the film were to have one is as a political institution at least the villain of this powerful almost playlike piece of cinema
Jul 29 2023,positive,fantastic story cilliam murphy was so convincing as robert oppenheimer and the cameos were surprising
Jul 29 2023,positive,a masterpiece in every aspect  screenplay acting visual and direction  3 hours of magnificent dialogue  cant wait for the oscars  america you must see this movie 
Jul 29 2023,positive,incredible movie from start to finish the cast was perfect and the story was so captivating christopher nolan could make an 8 hr movie and id see it over and over cillian murphy as always commands the screen love love loved it cant wait to see it again
Jul 29 2023,positive,it was genuinely amazing and it had some of the best writing acting and music to date from a nolan film
Jul 29 2023,negative,ive only ever walked out of the cinema twice once at anchor man 2  now oppenheimer genuinely the most painfully boring film ive ever had to endure walked out of the film around half an hour from the end wishing i hadnt wasted the money or the 2 12 hours of my life world war 2 historians would have struggled to keep their eyes open during this film i knew it wasnt going to be that exciting but dear dear mr nolan what were you thinking  all i could think about leaving the cinema was i bet even barbie wasnt as painful to watch
Jul 29 2023,positive,very tense excellent cast after all of the emotional turmoil of this story i am only comforted that we have managed not to repeat that moment in history so far
Jul 29 2023,positive,oppenheimer is one of nolans best visual masterpieces combining oscarworthy acting and carefully aligned scenes to create something that coalesces in the final scene leaving you stunned it forces you to confront the brutal nature of mankind which is not only destructive on a mass scale but also personally vindictive towards specific individuals im still astounded cannot recommend enough
Jul 29 2023,positive,absolutely breathtaking didnt feel like 3 hours at all cillian murphy is breathtaking and deserves every possible allocate rdj and emily blunt also deserve oscars
Jul 29 2023,positive,starting with the bias i loved this movie always being a fan of science and specifically physics and quantum mechanics and add up that is a war movie it was just a perfect match    now nolans style is present all around the movie telling the story out of order and using filters to indicate the different perspectives and a the world stood still moment in the story climax the audience also gets all round great performances while they get blasted by an inspiring and amazing soundtrack would watch again
Jul 29 2023,positive,really good movie but became confusing towards the end too many people with too many agendas and couldnt keep it straight also what was the point of showing nudity completely unnecessary and lessened the seriousness of the movie
Jul 29 2023,positive,i wish they had focused more on the war the struggles with building the bomb and the difficult decision to actually use it they divert into the sexual life of oppenheimer which had almost nothing to do with the story the movie was telling also i think actual video and photos of the destruction that the bomb caused and real life news pictures and aftermath of having used the bomb not once but twice would have made the movie better than the gratuitous sex scenes that didnt add to the movie real life photos etc would have brought home the struggles that all who spent time creating the bomb would have felt finally fortunately i watched a short documentary on the manhattan project two weeks before i saw this movie i was confused for about 2 hours of the movie but the documentary i previously watched helped me understand what was going on way too many names that are very important to the plot but barely appear in the movie were very hard to keep straight also the movies isnt about the manhattan project or really even about oppenheimer no spoilers its a good movie but in my opinion should have chosen one direction to focus on especially for a three hour movie id recommend watching it at home with subtitles there were so many times when a single sentence that a character said that was apparently extremely impactful but if you missed a word or two you didnt know the importance of it to me they touched in too many areas and had way too many characters to keep track of plus they never try delved into oppenheimers true feelings about the project or aftermath if youre going to show a touch of it they should have really gotten into it and gotten rid of gratuitous sex scenes that werent relevant to the story being told pick a lane and seriously show the real pictures news clippings etc of what those bombs did that would really have brought the movie home instead its glossed over which is a travesty given what really happened
Jul 29 2023,negative,a heady topic presented in the most disorganized fashion in recent movie history  the story was told somewhat in the last hour
Jul 29 2023,positive,this movie made me have goosebumps from the story line to the audio it was perfect if you have the mental capacity to watch the whole 3 hours its incredible
Jul 29 2023,negative,the five star reviews must be fake dont waste 35 hours of your life on this boring film about the guy being reamed by the us government about being a supposed communist so boring barely anything about los alamos or the bombs themselves nothing like the previews
Jul 29 2023,positive,this movie is another of christopher nolans artworks a masterpiece fulfilled by cillian murphy crushing the role as oppenheimer an absolute masterpiece that must be watched at all costs
Jul 29 2023,positive,overall music and imagery were top notch but b story was way too long
Jul 29 2023,positive,really done wished they covered more of the reasons so many said this was justified and many who said it was not  otherwise very well done
Jul 29 2023,positive,loved the movie 1010   i believe the film is basically telling us what mankind can do and possibly destroy the very world we live in if we set our minds to something that we 100 believe in
Jul 29 2023,positive,this is one of the most thought provoking movies ive seen in ages days later i am still thinking about it
Jul 29 2023,positive,nolan returns to form with this deeply introspective and cerebral epic taking the most stacked cast possibly ever assembled to tell the story of the american prometheus the man who gave man the power to destroy themselves the acting is top notch the soundtrack delivers and it is shot masterfully i will say the movie has a few flaws in that it does not grip you the whole way however while you are watching this it is hard not to think that you are watching a master execute his craft
Jul 29 2023,positive,this is cinema for me this is nolans most impactful masterpiece it is without a doubt the best adaptation of a book i have ever seen the story is portrayed in an incredible tense and dynamic way i like the fact that it is dynamic because it manages to hold the viewer well even in moments that would be calmer or even a little boring in other stories but here everything is done very well for you to hold one thing that helps to keep you hooked is the incredible interpretation of the actors giving life and high realism to their characters and i especially highlight cillian murphy who is the soul of oppenheimer the film manages to convey the feeling of the scene very well especially seconds before the explosion making us feel in the protagonists shoes and what helps is the fact that nolan has not used any cgi the whole film so it makes us anxious for the result as well as oppenheimer and his coworkers
Jul 29 2023,positive,there is a lot of insightful things that happen during that time and we didnt know went on which makes a lot of sense now
Jul 29 2023,positive,amazing movie it really puts you in that time five stars all around
Jul 29 2023,positive,phenomenal movie the only reason that i did not give 5 stars was histrionic pace of the movie that seemed at times very exhausting nolans absolute dedication to the history left little choice but to cut in as much story as possible by showing us snippets of that history nolan ties everything together in a way that provides the audience the proper intuition but as we see the histrionic hallucinations through oppenheimers eyes the audience should be forewarned that what jro saw was the consummate line from the hindu text now i am become death destroyer of worlds
Jul 29 2023,positive,matt damon is underrated  rdj best performance  cillian murphy best performance  christopher nolan a genius
Jul 29 2023,positive,oppenheimer is something else im convinced that if there was a movie during the last 10 or so years that one had to see in theatres  its this one wow i was speechless afterwards tbh
Jul 29 2023,negative,overlong overblown overhyped i was glad when it was over wanted to feel something but just felt detached and bored with it too much going on convoluted storytelling with heavy dialogue
Jul 29 2023,positive,best movie ive seen in a long time although it almost seems like they are trying to get you to be open to communism which is a big hell no for me 
Jul 29 2023,positive,wow speechless 3 hours of wow
Jul 29 2023,positive,barbenheimer my vote goes to oppie excellent storytelling and acting best movie of 2023 so far
Jul 29 2023,positive,very powerful all around
Jul 29 2023,positive,loved it at times it was a hit hard to hear the conversations and there was a lot of info given that at times i felt a bit lost but at the end it all concluded in such a way that it made sense in some of the scenes at the start of the film
Jul 29 2023,positive,a bit slow but interesting
Jul 29 2023,positive,watched it once in imax loved it booked it again in 70mm imax and drove 3 hours to watch it again incredible acting incredible story telling very engaging and very bold the shots are incredible and the soundtrack is impeccable probably my new favorite movie out of the hundreds i have seen it is a must see
Jul 29 2023,positive,a performance for the ages by cillian murphy
Jul 29 2023,positive,not as dramatic as i thought it would be would have appreciated more narrative around the actual project and less around his extended personal life also like almost every film since covid should have been trimmed
Jul 29 2023,positive,three storylines are interwoven in a complex narrativehis personal life and loves his communist party affiliation which wrecks his security clearance and occasions a fullon committe hearing about his loyalty during the mccarthy era and the cold war filmed in black and white but most compellingly his stewardship of the manhattan project and the creation of the hbomb knowing he has ripped away the curtain separating man and god literally stolen his way into the mind of the creator which posits consequences the likes of which are mythic for his hubris in giving man fire prometheus was chained forever to a rock only to get his liver poked at daily by vultures restored by night to go thru it all over again the next daytorture hunhwith that fire mankind is capable of great genius and selfdestructive lunacy in its pursuit of dominance and sovereignty oppenheimer scientific brother to bohr einstein heisenberg fermi et al is poised to end the war with japan by dropping a nuclear holocaust on nagasaki and hiroshima and in the process killing maiming and altering genetics of millions horns of a dilemma kinda thing theoretical physics when coopted by military and political factions becomes reality the likes of which are almost primeval primordial in nature the atom is the primary unit of all matter and these 20th century physicists have outsmarted themselves and usyes we now know what god knows now what do we do with it the fruit of the tree of good and evila bittersweet piece of fruit what price genius    technically the optics are brilliant as is the audio particularly the spectacular countdown to ground zero when they launch a test run of the bomb in a new mexico desert the hearings postwar are filmed in black and white pitting oppenheimer against aec commission chair strauss who appointed him head of the manhattan project the rides on horseback in the same desert delineating his romances are ironic artistic counterpoint but what is fascinating are the exchanges among physicists who hope for responsible control and discipline over this revolutionary discovery the question remains have these guys  brave shortsighted brilliant foolhardy intoxicated by their compounding discoveries so like swashbucklers on the high seas of scientific revolution  did they do us any favors or did they doom us all to the end days the final apocalypse
Jul 29 2023,positive,longest movie of 2023 right behind john wick 4 a solid 1010 lots of science in the movie and probably the number one movie of 2023
Jul 29 2023,positive,this is a masterpiece of film work acting cinematography sound definitely a must see
Jul 29 2023,positive,another masterpiece from nolan must see in imax to enjoy it to full extent
Jul 29 2023,positive,brilliant movie i highly recommend i plan to learn more about oppenheimer now also excellent cast of well known actors
Jul 29 2023,positive,all around terrific movie with captivating acting performances and beautiful cinematography likely the best film of 2023
Jul 29 2023,positive,greatest film ever made for me i watched two times second time in imax its just unbelievable must see
Jul 29 2023,positive,loved it great biography film never felt bored or tired of the movie if you enjoy learning some history with some added drama its fantastic
Jul 29 2023,positive,absolutely brilliant
Jul 29 2023,positive,nolan does it again great movie teaching you of the everlasting fear of the cold war
Jul 29 2023,positive,the mist mesmerizing well acted film ive ever seen 
Jul 29 2023,positive,oppenheimer was a fantastic excellent and visually compelling piece of cinematic art i saw it in imax it was aweinspiring in that format was very visual loud and realistic it was really loud and really visually stunning i had to sight in the front row where it felt like you were really getting hit by an atomic it was great but i would recommend sitting in a middle row the film overall had excellent performances from its cast especially cillian murphy matt damon and robert downey jr all of them were fantastic and the imax experience really heightened it since it was how the film was intended to be seen instead of a lower quality digital version
Jul 29 2023,positive,one of nolans best work absolutely beautiful shots and amazing way of telling such a complicated story
Jul 29 2023,positive,two things  great job of showing the horror of a nuclear blast without audience fleeing for the exits and first time in years where robert downey did not mumble his lines
Jul 29 2023,positive,a truly amazing experience i havent been let down by any christopher nolan film ive seen yet and this film continues that streak the story and direction by nolan based of course on the true story is expansive and endlessly interesting filling the films threehour runtime and never making it feel overly long though honestly no film feels long to me anymore    the cast especially cillian murphy as oppenheimer emily blunt as katherine oppenheimer matt damon as leslie groves robert downey jr as lewis strauss and florence pugh as jean tatlock among many many more amazing actors and performances and including some surprising appearances deliver continuously and keep making themselves more and more interesting the longer they are onscreen    the visuals are amazing and the fact there is no cgi in the entire film at least according to christopher nolan is an amazing fact that astounds me even further especially during scenes like the trinity test the cinematography by hoyte van hoytema compliments this with onlocation shooting delivering beautiful aweinspiring shots    finally the score by ludwig g√∂ransson is a combination of many different emotions and descriptions like beautiful aweinspiring tensionfilling and just amazing without the music i feel many of the scenes would not have been able to deliver quite as well with their emotion among other things once again g√∂ransson delivers and after his previous great compositions for nolans last film tenet im not surprised    in conclusion this film is epic and amazing and i hope to see it again in theaters nolan continues his streak of amazing and surprising me and im very excited to see what film hell think of directing next without a doubt the only rating i can give this film is a ten out of ten or on rotten tomatoes five out of five
Jul 29 2023,positive,top notch acting and writing visuals and music were great too very talky but i was never bored definitely in the top five christopher nolan films
Jul 29 2023,positive,without a doubt the best film of the year
Jul 29 2023,positive,if it werent three hours long it would get five stars 
Jul 29 2023,positive,the narrative was exciting and wellacted  truly a pivotal time in history
Jul 29 2023,positive,its been a few hours since i watched oppenheimer and i still cant stop thinking about it everything about that movie is nothing but perfect  if theres one single person on this planet who knows how to end movies and has the ability to make his viewers think about it for a long ass time then it has to be christopher fucking nolan  literally couldnt breathe the last 60 minutes of the movie has to be the greatest of all time it was just flawless the editing the acting and most importantly that gut wrenching music  the trinity sequence is so fucking terrifying and only nolan can do something like that and i can easily say that its his best scene this movie will be remembered for decades gawd  and cillian will definitely receive an oscar nomination and i wouldnt be surprised if he won it overall its a masterfuckingpiece and that is how you make cinema
Jul 29 2023,positive,impressive exciting and dramatic
Jul 29 2023,positive,very deep movie about important subject filming visuals was great might have to watch again to get everything love history so enjoyed it
Jul 29 2023,negative,every scene had a background music too much information was given too fast cinematic seens were put just to put them
Jul 29 2023,positive,70mm is a sight to behold large format is king
Jul 29 2023,positive,oppenheimer is undoubtedly the best movie of the year 2023 and one of the best movies of this decade so far its a real masterpiece which is a must watch one for all the brilliant movie lovers     the people who got disappointed after the movie might have expected a movie about bomb or war or something but its the movie which tells the story of robert j oppenheimer the man who is known as the father of the atomic bomb its the story of his life how he developed the historic world changing invention but its not an action or fantasy movie people who watch it with the expectations of a fantasy adventure movie may get disappointed but for the people who knows the real sense of this movie will surely enjoy this its a real true masterpiece 
Jul 29 2023,positive,brilliant powerful educational
Jul 29 2023,positive,beautifully written masterpiece that is well worth the investment
Jul 29 2023,positive,such a powerful movie nolan out did himself the casting was perfect im delighted to see cinema at its greatest again with oppenheimer
Jul 29 2023,positive,we its an inspiring story with wonderful direction
Jul 29 2023,positive,absolutely a must watch film it really demystifies oppenheimer and at no given time did it feel like it was a drag to watch
Jul 29 2023,positive,what an incredible film definitely oscar worthy this is what cinema is about great movie great story and completely amazing
Jul 29 2023,negative,christopher nolans latest entry is long  theres a lot of random time jumps so be prepared and the unnecessary sex scenes could have been avoided  visually nolans work never disappoints but a 3 hour biopic was a stretch  the plot of the movies is more or less is oppenheimer on trial for being a communist
Jul 29 2023,positive,it could have a hour removed and it would be a better movie it had things that were distracted from the story and i felt were unnecessary
Jul 29 2023,positive,probably the best nolan movie so far and one of the best ive seen in recent years stellar cast incredible score by ludwig goransson and a very deep exploration of humanity and its drive for selfdestruction
Jul 29 2023,positive,powerful movie about the invention of the atomic bomb
Jul 29 2023,positive,excellent film thrilling narrative from start to end nolan at its best
Jul 29 2023,positive,no one other than nolan can dream of venturing into something like this and deliver something so amazing its not the typical nolan movie in terms of complexity visuals and cinematic grandeur but its a whole new feat on its own its deep intense intellectual and engrossing taking us back to the times of dr oppenheimer its a deep dive into the great scientists mind as far as performances are concerned cillian murphy deserves an oscar for this career best performance robert jr emily matt damon etc have all lived their characters and delivered brilliant performances on the negative side it could have been a bit shorter and could have shown us more on oppenheimers relation with his wife and how it evolved into what it was towards the end    ps those who expect fireworks explosive action and other such stuff will be in for a huge disappointment appreciate the movie for what it is or better dont go to the cinemas and torture yourself
Jul 29 2023,positive,great movie probably the best this year i loved the music
Jul 29 2023,positive,pretty incredible movie very engaging and the films score played a huge part of the movie as it was composed to play a very psychological element with the audience and it worked in some ways i was psychologically shaken after watching this our showing was a 645 pm and got out after 10 pm packed theater audience was people from probably all walks each generation all left visibly affected or in deep pondering of some kind its not a jovial movie its deep so be ready for that in just 10 years well be up to 100 years since the beginning parts of some of this movie watching this movie though puts a persons mind into when all of this unfolded and the decisions that were made i agree with denzel washingtons character in crimson tide more now than ever the purpose of war is to serve a political end but the true nature of war is to serve itself
Jul 29 2023,positive,i am not a christopher nolan fan with that being said this is the first time that i watched a movie of him without getting bored cillians performance was phenomenal acting was overall very satisfying but cillians torturednuanced performance as oppenheimer will remain on my mind
Jul 29 2023,positive,amazing cinematography performances set design and color grading but extremely hard to follow  no dates are displayed on screen to distiguish between present and past and many events are jumbled together  would have been better as a linear storyline instead of nonlinear  it is a three hour film that i believe could be a two hour film if unneeded information was excluded
Jul 29 2023,positive,this movie reminds me of why i love movies everything was perfect acting sound  etc  especially felt that the music was telling the story and it kept interested in finding out whats happening next though i know oppenheimers story
Jul 29 2023,positive,oppenheimer actually had the most obvious correct criticism of when the right goes too far mccarthyism was placed on full display as people with heartfelt convictions towards political communism were unfairly treated the rightwing cancel culture from the 20s to the 60s despite many within the us government leaking details on nuclear fission for the invention of nuclear arms in the soviet union their treatment was wrong not everyone canceled and pushed out of polite society for merely having communist convictions acted upon those convictions they were of no threat and also had no idea of the genocide happening behind the brick wall of the soviet union that was half the film and the other half was absolutely amazing
Jul 29 2023,positive,one of the very best i have ever seen kudos to the entire cast who worked hard for this masterpiece
Jul 29 2023,positive,70mm imax from tape bump up one tier
Jul 29 2023,positive,this is a very good movie  maybe not great in that you want to see it again and again but worth seeing once no question
Jul 29 2023,positive,the movie is very long but time passes quickly  the acting is brilliant  saw it on imax  musical score and cinematography nulli secondus    i do believe one of the roles was miscast  i will let you be the judge to determine who i am talking about
Jul 29 2023,positive,if i want to summarize the entire movie in two sentences i would say  a person without moral virtues is his own greatest enemy  and the second sentence  lets appreciate those who made a positive difference in our lives and not betray them
Jul 29 2023,positive,tremendous film a thinkingmans epic for those without a science background the important thing is not so much understanding the science itself but rather understanding the problems that the science poses for these men and women the film is as much about the solving of a scientific problem as the moral responsibility that comes when that solution is implemented in practice brilliantly acted and brilliantly directed the filmmaking  especially the editing and sound or lack of it virtually become characters in and of themselves in terms of their contributions to the film
Jul 29 2023,positive,any negative reviews regarding this movie are clearly people who were expecting a blow em up action movie you simply cant walk away from this film without being riveted by the historical account and the outstanding performances by all actors involved oppenheimer will be read from the podium many times at the academy awards a must see for anyone who truly appreciates masterpiece film making
Jul 29 2023,positive,it never ceases to amaze me how many people seem to think the end of the cold war meant the end of the threat of nuclear war nothing can be further from the truth     oppenheimer is a brilliant film its engrossing the three hours fly by its also deeply disturbing and frightening ive never seen a full cinema of people so sombre and quiet at films end and it needs to be frightening the threat is far from over     were now at the fourth generation who have grown up under the shadow of the bomb
Jul 29 2023,positive,this movie is amazing the plot is very good
Jul 29 2023,positive,good story good visually good acting but it was all spoiled by the incessancy of the sound track this being musical sound effects without a melody or score it was often unnecessary and often drowned out dialogue which resulted in the movie making a bit less sense than it deserved and at the volume the movie was played at in the cinema in which i viewed it it all amounted to an assault
Jul 29 2023,positive,well acted but i found it tedious and i didnt really care about the outcome for his character too long and boring fell asleep 3 times could be my age history was interesting
Jul 29 2023,negative,this was really terrible   it felt like an action movie when it was anything but an action movie  in terms of emotional levels the movie starts at a 9 and goes to 10  theres no build its all just loud fast and confusing   too many characters to keep track of too many short scenes too much editing that is not needed jumping back and forth in time  it felt like nolan was saying look how smart i am  look at what i can do the whole time which is what a lot of his movies feel like   instead of finding a good story to tell and telling it without bombarding the audience with fast editing overblown music and showoff technique that isnt needed   its a mess   the movie is 180 minutes long and there are probably 178 minutes of music   chris nolan is a very insecure director  he cant let a dialogue scene play without music he doesnt trust his actors   he has a 12 yearolds sense of emotion   no subtlely  nothing that isnt bombastic or trite  i had a headache after it  and felt like i learned nothing about the truth of what happened because i dont trust nolan  for all of the reasons above  cillian murphy was terrific its too bad the movie he is in is awful
Jul 29 2023,positive,oppenheimer blew me away with mesmerizing performances sensational visuals and an earthshattering score all leading to one of the greatest films i have ever seen
Jul 29 2023,positive,one of nolans best if not the best
Jul 29 2023,positive,cinematic masterpiece the plot is amazing the characters are in depth and real 1010
Jul 29 2023,positive,this was a masterpiece except the length the balsting scene which was without cgiit was marvellous
Jul 29 2023,positive,the 3 hours are the closest thing to running a marathon what cannot be denied is that the story of the father of the atomic bomb is quite invasive when one delves into the personal and political connotations as well as the consequences of that fateful discovery one of the ones that will make a lot of noise this year
Jul 29 2023,positive,this is easily the most engaged ive been watching a 3 hour movie of people predominantly talking this was the first film id seen in 70mm too and its really beautiful i didnt know much about oppenheimer beyond what i learned in school about the arms race during wwii but i appreciate how thorough the movie was explaining the history while still being very entertaining the editing is very well done they were able to create action scenes from what otherwise would have been somewhat mundane discussion i definitely plan to read american prometheus because i believe thats where my h of the films reference material came from
Jul 29 2023,negative,this film was one of the biggest letdowns ive ever experienced in theaters we bought our tickets for this two months in advance and couldnt stop talking about it the day of     the film was essentially a bunch of men walking around with their lips moving the entire film but nothing coming out of their mouths because the soundtrack was blaring so loud in addition there were a handful of entirely unnecessary nude scenes that made you feel like you were watching porn in public i looked down our row and in front of us when these scenes came on and women were cringing and covering their eyes makes you wonder who they had previewing the film before it was released to the public    overall the film was so long and done so poorly that theres not much more to say other than itll leave you feeling like you just wasted 3 hours of your life and lost 15
Jul 29 2023,positive,its the best movie of 2023 the bgm and the cinematography is fabulous all cast was doing their job perfectly cillian murphy as robert oppenheimer and robert downey jr as lwiss straws is one of the best casting
Jul 29 2023,negative,music score was overdone to the point that it interfered the dialogue of the characters making it difficult to understand key statements and follow the storyline it felt 45 min too long despite and uneven pace 
Jul 29 2023,positive,an epic thought provoking charecter study with mind blowing visuals and a breath taking soundtrack which lacked a bit of varitey in story
Jul 29 2023,positive,although the film started slow it adhered to the old adageits not how you start its how you finish this movie is anchored by a phenomenal stacked cast where everyone gives it their all the symbolism was great cilian murthy and rdjs performances should and will be applauded well done film
Jul 29 2023,positive,i felt the movie is overrated little historical content many many characters who are often not identified the only test they show was trinity no fat man or little boy explosions editing was sloppy in the beginning
Jul 29 2023,positive,oppenheimer is a complex and challenging film but it is also a rewarding one nolans direction is masterful and he creates a visually stunning film that is both epic in scope and intimate in its portrait of oppenheimer the performances are all excellent with murphy giving a tourdeforce performance as oppenheimer    the film is not without its flaws the pacing can be slow at times and the films philosophical themes can be a bit heavyhanded however these flaws are minor compared to the films many strengths    overall oppenheimer is a powerful and important film that is sure to be remembered for years to come it is a film that will challenge you to think about the nature of science war and power i highly recommend it
Jul 29 2023,negative,3  hours lost  the trailer was promising but sitting through this 3 hour nolan indulgence was frustrating and overdone   needs 45 minutes removed the drama attempts too much gets lost in overrepeative details and in the process fails to entertain very disappointing
Jul 29 2023,positive,i know some people who think this is a film about the atomic bomb and oppenheimers part in making that happen this is a biopic with only the middle act really dealing with that part of his life  its 3 hours its a biopic and follows oppenheimer through his life i learned a lot through this film not knowing where he came from and how he was treated thereafter  the film is an eye opener great performances from a cast too star studded to mention the sound and visuals right from the off give a feeling of seriousness to the matter at hand the atomic bomb and the thoughts at play within oppenheimers mind  the juxtaposition of the elation of winning a war but unleashing hell on earth and the chance for humanity to destroy itself are felt keenly in the celebratory scene  which youll know when you see it  its long  3 hours so be prepared to concentrate to understand the nuances of what happened before during and after the bombs were dropped  all in all a great film a good history lesson and a poignant place to consider all of our future actions  that said  absolute power corrupts absolutely so im sure the film will impact the viewing audience however the powers in the world today that have this power at their fingertips  will it matter  lets hope so    poignant enlightening and powerful
Jul 29 2023,positive,i dont know what was more captivating the sound or the cinematography  every scene was completely well thought out
Jul 29 2023,positive,an amazing movie thats packed with love physics and the power of politics over scientists a mustsee thanks to the amazong performance of the cast
Jul 29 2023,negative,geez poor edited movie what a mess only good thing is cillian murphy the rest of the cast was not good dissapointing
Jul 29 2023,positive,oppenheimer is by far best film of 2023 i have seen so far as it just spectacularly ginormous in every aspect as christopher nolan has done a thrilling job
Jul 29 2023,positive,a superb film  the three hours flew by  cillian murphy deserves a best actor oscar  i especially enjoyed that the film confronts difficult issues without sliding into preachiness  this is a film for adults who think
Jul 29 2023,positive,christopher nolan has created his master piece in my opinion oppenheimer is a deep study of the creator of the atomic bomb and all that he went through before during and after the acting is nothing but a plus across the board this might be nolans best sound mix since you can hear everything theyre saying and the cinematography is just the best weve seen i got to watch it in its 70mm glory and wow check this out in the biggest screen possible worth every second
Jul 29 2023,neutral,i realize im in the minority here but i found this movie to be exhausting to watch nonstop talking heads so much dialogue i dont think ive ever seen a movie with this much dialogue and different characters in it it felt selfimportant  with all the celebrity cameos between the cameos and smart dialogue the movie felt to be in love with itself acting was good but no way that i will ever sit through this movie again
Jul 29 2023,positive,really solid film if i had to critique id say it would have benefited from being a miniseries as there so much packed in this film but even still it was an enjoyable screening
Jul 29 2023,positive,wow  this movie just knocked me out  so many parts of the movie were just excellent i think i need a little time to fully process everything but i left the theater just in awe of the movie  acting script cinematography directing score sound and visuals were all just amazing  nolan really knows how to make a really powerful film  it leaves you asking questions about war and how the atomic bomb really changed things  i only had a few small issues with the film  it does sort of peak about 23 of the way through the film  at least in terms of actions of the film  then it asks questions about what happens after you invent and use an atomic bomb  really powerful stuff and it kept me interested the whole time  i loved seeing it in imax with the powerful sound especially  although if you only get to see it in a regular theater that is ok too  but in a theater is the best way to see it for sure  really awesome and its such an inventive and powerful movie
Jul 29 2023,positive,great analog visuals and sound
Jul 29 2023,positive,absolute masterpiece it isnt just a movie its an experience 
Jul 29 2023,positive,very good moviegenerally i do not like a movie that are not shown in chronilogical order but this one worked well  outstanding performances by a starstudded cast  4 stars
Jul 29 2023,positive,definitely one of the top 10 best movies ever made an absolute masterpiece in imax stunning use of sound and silence characters totally envelop you and the explosion scene  wow    every single shot is intentional and needed its long and intense and exhausting but pure excellence in movie making
Jul 29 2023,negative,movie is painfully overrated in classic christopher nolan form the script was bad but sound and visual effects saved the movie never felt more unconnected to a character 3hr biography cillian murphy was great but script limited his relatability would not be as harsh if it didnt have a 94 you should watch it but based off rotten tomatoes rankings id give it 65 never will watch it twice
Jul 29 2023,positive,its been a long time since ive been as captivated by a film as i was by this one
Jul 29 2023,positive,terrific true story i think i was fortunate in being old enough to have lived through this terrifying period as the film is challenging for younger viewers who my struggle with the intellectual nuances of the plot   i am sure it will engage younger audiences will to stay with it because the issues are even more relevant in today mad world   personally i found the score and audible presentation just too overwhelming and it made conversations difficult to hear at times  well done christopher nolan and the team on a great movie 
Jul 29 2023,positive,phenomenal masterpiece
Jul 29 2023,positive,cillian murphy stared at least once in this movie
Jul 29 2023,positive,great movie with a heartbreaking and inspiring story oppenheimer doesnt allow you to feel one way for too long you will explore many emotions throughout this film and it keeps you on the edge of your seat at least until your arse gets sore because thats how long this film is cut this film down to 2 25 hours max and youve got yourself some perfect cinema
Jul 29 2023,positive,very very good such a big subject to tacklewell done all
Jul 29 2023,positive,this movie was stunning and probably the best movie ive watched in recent years the cinematography in this film is incredible as christopher nolan never fails at the score is one of the best of any movie in my opinion and the attention to detail on set is immaculate this really is a must see in theaters for it is the best movie that has released recently
Jul 29 2023,positive,at times it doesnt really feel like a christopher nolan movie yet the best movie of 2023 after across the spiderverse
Jul 29 2023,positive,a brilliant film in terms of visuals it will not be an exaggeration to call it an art brilliant music that makes you fall into the chair even though its not an action movie the movie itself is gripping and keeps you in suspense and gives you a lot to think about and reflect on finally i would like to add that this film must be seen in the cinema
Jul 29 2023,negative,dont waste your time or money on this movie if you are expecting any sort of action regarding the actual bombyou will walk out of this train wreck of a movie three hours of my life wasted
Jul 29 2023,positive,one of the best movies ive seen in a long time so glad i got to see it in imax everything from the acting the visuals and especially the score had me hooked i look forward to owning this movie and watching it many more times
Jul 29 2023,positive,great acting great cast great pacing
Jul 29 2023,positive,oscars all around a terrific movie about an important person told by the combined talents of writers directors actors and other supporting artists
Jul 29 2023,positive,must watch must see movie the emotions sound cinematography acting are all too amazing christopher nolan nailss it
Jul 29 2023,positive,1010 movie no other words just 1010
Jul 29 2023,positive,an authentic masterpiece of production and execution outstaing cast selection impecable cast performance this movie is art in its max top notch movie
Jul 29 2023,positive,sound and cinematic masterpiece however difficult to find a sense of grounding why choose o for the project we only hear hes brilliant without seeing proof why so dedicated to his alcoholic wife we take his word for it again no scenes or moments that ground the audience or ally us to its characters
Jul 29 2023,positive,this movie was so good
Jul 29 2023,positive,super entertaining constantly engaging 3hrs that you wont feel you just want more
Jul 29 2023,positive,i enjoyed it its a long movie but i wasnt exhausted at the end
Jul 29 2023,positive,one of the best movies of nolan the sound and all about the atomic bomb the perspective everything its how it should be
Jul 29 2023,positive,fabulous film definitely one to see on the big screen the acting screenplay and direction were phenomenal
Jul 29 2023,positive,although a little long its absolutely one of the best films of the yr what a score and cillian murphys performance was phenomenal
Jul 29 2023,positive,amazing direction by christopher nolan like always incredible cinematography killer timing of audio and powerful storytelling creates a movie that was a masterpiece to enjoy in the theaters highly recommend to all
Jul 29 2023,positive,one of cinemas greatest works and one of cillian murphys greates acting achievements   this movie absolutely blew me away  if your a cinema fan this is a must watch
Jul 29 2023,positive,i sat in thought through the credits after an immensely riveting 3rd act what an experience
Jul 29 2023,positive,overall it was great but not without some issues pughs character and how women were treated scriptwise was very narrow  its about oppenheimer so keep it that way cillian and rdj were fantastic as lead and supporting actors the sound engineer  kudos to you for creating literally ground shaking experiences throughout like i said some snags but enough greatness going on to carry through
Jul 29 2023,positive,its the best film of the year nolans directing is absolutely masterful amazing performances across the board the must see movie of the year
Jul 29 2023,positive,excellent movie 3 hours well invested planning to go for a second time this weekend christopher nolan is on another level
Jul 29 2023,negative,blah artistic director garbage i love history but hate history turned into art even the atomic explosion was artsy no mushroom cloud might as well been a fireplace flame
Jul 29 2023,positive,a movie that i had high expectations for and they were easily met a movie oddly carried by constant dialogue and characters with very little action made me curious to learn more about the history of his life and the manhattan project
Jul 29 2023,positive,one of my favorite movies of the year so well made builds as you watch super intense and some of the best acting ive seen in a long time some of the actors play so well you forget they are actors
Jul 29 2023,positive,everything about this movie is perfect the direction cast cinematography every thing one of the few movies which actually left me feeling goosebumps
Jul 29 2023,negative,this movie is overhyped garbage cant believe its rated so high worst movie ive seen in a long time the fast paced conversations are hard to follow and insufferable there is no character development its just 3 hours of confusing conversations wanted to walk out truly cant understand the hype for this movie
Jul 29 2023,positive,definitely a mustsee though the writing is uneven the first third was choppy like a soap opera the movie really shined though after that acting was superb all around as were the costumes and settings
Jul 29 2023,positive,i liked the move however it is not for everyone to really understand the movie youll need a pretty good base line knowledge of wwii and the cold war many people will come to see the detonation and the trinity test but its really just a small part of the film it is a in depth look at the life of dr oppenheimer and the personal struggles that came with the aftermath of building the atomic bomb great movie not for everyone
Jul 29 2023,negative,lights went out due to weather and we didnt get any refund
Jul 29 2023,positive,this is one great movie so far in 2023
Jul 29 2023,positive,even though it might be a bit hard to followup and keep on with the story having a little context makes you feel some hype to understand the background and thinking behind the actual creation of a weapon that could cause such damage to our planet and the people in it things become more clear as the movie goes on and it strikes you with a reveal lately that leaves the morale of oppenheimer up to the spectator to judge amazing film for a patient and interested public can also be enjoyed by everyone but might be harsh to enjoy it fully
Jul 29 2023,positive,incredible cinematography   engaging script  phenomenal cast   stunning visuals  thrilling storyline  topic  a true cinematic masterpiece
Jul 29 2023,positive,good movie if you like historical based on reallife  shows kind of fascinating watching history on the big screen
Jul 29 2023,positive,this movie is absolutely amazing this is christopher nolan at his finest i feel like if a less ambitious director made this film it could have been really boring but nolan pulled through   the dialogue is great the acting is great and the music is awesome i just cant get enough of this film and i learned soooo much  i started researching the real life history of it and i learned a lot   i highly recommend this movie  now this movie may not be for everyone but if you sit down and pay attention theres a very good chance youll enjoy it especially if you appreciate good history
Jul 29 2023,positive,the greatest movie of our time it had a very powerful message the actors were amazing and the music score pulled you in to experience this thrilling masterpiece
Jul 29 2023,negative,very long boring movie should have been cut down to 15 hours save your time and money
Jul 29 2023,negative,im definitely in the minority here but first of all imax adds nothing to the experience unless you like to be deafened constant loud loud music though it is interrupted by numerous loud loud explosions thunder foot stomping  you name it if its loud the director put it in and in and inforever way way too long too many confusing jumps back and forth in time now in addition to the story of oppenheimer and the development of the atom bomb you want to learn why strauss did or did not get into the cabinet this is the movie for you director obviously is full of himself and being a bit of a star no one tells him enough pass
Jul 29 2023,positive,the movie was truly outstanding finally something uniquely great in the theaters the pacing the score the acting the visual effects man i loved it they told a great story and for a 3hr run time it didnt feel very long
Jul 29 2023,positive,its hard to encapsulate this movie as its bombastic plot is contrasted with an intimate character study of the man in question it takes an allstar cast gives them the proper script to deliver fantastic dialogue and edits it perfectly to capture the events and internal struggles of everyone involved
Jul 29 2023,positive,i wont even describe the screen because it is a freaking christopher nolan movie the movie is really good it story accurately portrays the becoming of a genius physicist to the inventor of mankinds deadliest weapon the film is a smooth mix of drama history and politics the only thing you need to keep in mind before watching the movie is that you need complete knowledge of world war 2 and oppenheimers life else a few scenes might not be suitable for the audience
Jul 29 2023,positive,wow just wow for me it is easily the best christopher nolan film he truly knocks it out of the park it is a true masterpiece from start to finish the cinematography is amazing the writing is amazing and the acting is the best out of any nolan film i will be shocked if it does not win best picture at the oscars on top of that cillian murphy has basically guaranteed his oscar nomination for best actor he is truly spectacular despite a towering 3hour runtime you find yourself immediately invested in the story and while it definitely feels like 3 hours you are never bored or waiting for something to happen the fact that nolan is able to capture the sheer magnitude of the atomic bomb once they test it using no cgi is almost unfathomable even after the testing of the bomb you see oppenheimers perspective change he feels responsible and for speaking his opinion he is attacked by governmental figures robert downy jr has proved and reminded that he is much more than just tony stark best supporting actor at the oscars for sure the score as in any nolan film is spectacular and helps you feel the magnitude of some scenes ludwig g√∂ransson composes something truly amazing to wrap up oppenheimer is a true cinematic masterpiece from start to finish please go see this movie
Jul 29 2023,positive,one of the best movies of this decade and more
Jul 29 2023,positive,the acting in this film was phenomenal by everybodythe camera work amazing but the only part was the other characters were not given enough character building
Jul 29 2023,positive,is an incredible movie it explores every single part of the sentimentality historical context academic success and more i got stuck in the timeline created in the movie from beginning to end it was a mix of indescribable feelings
Jul 29 2023,positive,cillian murphy for best actor and downey jr for supporting actor
Jul 29 2023,positive,one of the best films ive seen in awhile that really has no flaws  the story telling was precisely done and each character was well paced and defined  despite this being a 3 hour non action movie the character work kept you pulled in and with your full attention  not many movies can tell a historically acute story while keeping my attention
Jul 29 2023,positive,great movie with great actors three intensive hours with an great impact absolute must see and an important movie in every time
Jul 29 2023,positive,it was going along ok until one of the characters said nukeular you would think a movie and actors of this caliber would get that word right
Jul 29 2023,positive,gets better with every watch
Jul 29 2023,positive,well written great acting great suspense throughout
Jul 29 2023,positive,beautiful intellectual and political drama with breathtaking scenes incredible cast elaborate storytelling and a long awaited lead role of cillian murphy in a nolan film
Jul 29 2023,positive,oppenheimer is an intellectual eyeopening and explosive historical drama that highlights one of historys most important events supported by a great cast
Jul 29 2023,positive,i think the first half of the movie should absolutely be watched in imax the second half is story and sometimes lacking or slow
Jul 29 2023,negative,awful  slow boring no special acting  i am 100 mind blown on why the movie is well received  the recently made tv show about the manhattan project was 10x more interesting yet cancelled  this should have never made it to theaters and the only reason its so successful it either due to lack of content or group think  of everyone i know who saw it in theaters only one enjoyed it  i dont understand the critics on this  its not even wait for rental material  its a hard pass
Jul 29 2023,negative,i have been to the movies several times in my life  and have seen very wide range of movies this was the first time ive actually ever considered walking out of a movie because it was so boring
Jul 29 2023,positive,excellent cast excellent acting oscar nod to cillian murphy
Jul 29 2023,positive,long movie hard to follow but the acting was great
Jul 29 2023,negative,terrible waste of 3 hours
Jul 29 2023,positive,more than a movie we can consider it a documentary about the atomic bomb the performances are first rate masterful direction the excellent script three hours where a true educational informative and very interesting story is told highly recommended
Jul 29 2023,positive,oh my god ive never seen anything like this before one of the best movies ever made
Jul 29 2023,positive,oppenheimer isnt a bad movie its a good movie its just difficult to know just how good it is since the dialogue is constantly interrupted either by over the top sound effects or a self important and intrusive soundtrack by ludwig g√∂ransson it isnt that christopher nolan thinks hes michael bay theres only one explosion but it is a big one its just that he might as well have been michael bay exchanging explosions on the screen for an explosive soundtrack i dont know if ludwig g√∂ransson thinks hes the new vangelis or the next hans zimmer but he is neither they must have a great sound system in the studios mixing room its just too bad the average cineplex cant quite match it    i think he would have been better served if he had brought zimmer onboard to do the soundtrack he brought other people from the batman movies gary oldman is almost unrecognizable as president harry truman and tom conti is totally unrecognizable as professor albert einstein there are other hollywood heavyweights in other cameos as well but theyre all overshadowed by the intrusive overbearing soundtrack    if only christopher nolan had more respect for the audiences intelligence he might have given the dialogue a more prominent place in his film quantum mechanics and nuclear physics are difficult enough subjects to tackle when you can hear and understand every word being said clearly and distinctly but when you have music that is trying to create a sense of urgency and tension even in scenes where there is none its a bit like the snow he inserts into scenes where it isnt cold enough to see the actors breath obviously he is foreshadowing nuclear winter and fallout but again its as intrusive as the persistent soundtrack and more than a little hamhanded muck like the inserted nudity and sex scene trying to allude to oppenheimers life being laid bare before his detractors     cillian murphys performance is excellent had this film been made a decade or two ago his part might well have gone to peter weller he would have fit right in as the doctor buckaroo banzai of the 1940s especially when naked lunch like sexual and atomic hallucination intrude into the story almost as much as that bombastic soundtrack     perhaps all the blasts of music sound effects and shocking imagery are to keep the audience awake since you cant always hear the dialogue or maybe he thought the dialogue itself would put people to sleep especially after the bomb is made and shipped off to japan and the movie is only a little more than half over and the film degenerates into a courtroom drama against oppenheimer by a robert downey jrs bitter character since its filled enough science and political science to put the audience to sleep even with the intrusive music and hallucinations its hard to say for certain since i couldnt hear a lot of it    so i hope when the dvd comes out there will be instead of a directors cut a viewers cut complete with options like a soundtrack that can be turned down at least there will be closed captions hopefully accurate ones and not like the ones that seem be written for the deaf by the deaf no good ones where you can read whats actually being said only then will i be able to determine just how good this good movie really was it was certainly better than the theaters sound system as it struggled to keep up perhaps they should resurrect the of sensurround system from the 1970s that they used for movies like earthquake and midway with enough cervwinvega speakers for a grateful dead concert maybe that would allow the audience to hear the dialogue above the intrusive score and atomic blasts otherwise its like trying to watch a combination of a dramatic broadway play with the entire new york philharmonic on stage with the actors punctuating their every line with fanfares and flourishes    does this review seem overly long and monotonous well then oppenheimer probably isnt your cup of tea the courtroom stuff makes the math stuff seem interesting by comparison it seems that christopher nolan wanted to give us an epic its certainly long enough to be one but most of the film isnt imax worthy even if the soundtrack requires their sound system this could have been a smart movie but i think nolan made it just smart enough for intellectually challenged pretentious people to think it is or maybe im wrong and its just me but if i were you id wait for the dvd or stream it that way you can rewind missed dialogue and take breaks as needed in order to find out
Jul 29 2023,positive,this movie does a spectacular job at involving complicated subjects that arent hard for the audience to grasp all while making the film easy to watch the fast pace makes the 3hr fly by one of nolans best films in my opinion 
Jul 29 2023,positive,acting was great story kept me engaged the whole length of the movie
Jul 29 2023,positive,incredibly put together movie that felt both unending in a good way but also shorter than its three hour runtime excellent performances loses half a star in my view for issues with the sound mixing where hearing what was being said on several occasions was difficult
Jul 29 2023,positive,best movie of the decade makes the last few years of movies look like home productions
Jul 29 2023,positive,deep and meaningful  christopher nolan gives a masterclass on how to tell the complex story of a complex  man in americas history  a stellar cast  and excellent visual storytelling
Jul 29 2023,neutral,i am aware that i am in the minority here  i thought the movie was fine  there were a plethora of fantastic actors love jason clarke  the pace of the movie was slow and at times confusing as nolan goes back and forth between time lines  if you are a fan of science and physics perhaps you would enjoy the plot more
Jul 29 2023,positive,anmanother nolan masterpiece
Jul 29 2023,positive,excellent movie kept us on the edge of our seats the entire 3 hours
Jul 29 2023,positive,was an interesting movie   not sure whether to recommend catching it in the theater or not    this is a biopic about oppenheimer   even though the trailers make it look like another manhattan project movie thats only a small slice of what we see    a lot of biopics suffer the same problem  what story will you actually tell about a persons life   some do it well   most end up just all over the place   this one leans a tad bit on the all over the place side    the first half hour comes off as a mess   jumps in time between different scenes in his life   way too much time spent on his life as a young adult       the middle of the film does focus on trinity but mostly on opps life  some more flashbacks  not so much a focus on the bomb development but on the politics of trinity and between the physicists  by now we know opps is a womanizer  full of himself but not always standing up for himself   and we see the beginnings of him realizing the what of they are doing   the basic tenet of can they do it vs should they do it    the last part of the movie is postbomb   ops hopes to use the bomb to negotiate an armistice with russia but learns that once developed the politicians will do what they want with atomic weapons build bigger bombs as we know   here we focus on hearings mainly the one where they revoked opps clearance and the slighted politician who is out to get him   but opps pursuit of peace and his indecisiveness come back to haunt him  this section brings together most of the flashbacks we saw at the front of the movie  but while it ties things together its less about opps and more about who is politically maneuvering who       so with this movie you learn more about the man than about the bomb   that makes it a good movie about opps but not the most exciting movie    the one thing that surprise me was the number of stars in this movie  up to you if the cinematography is worth catching on the big screen or wait to catch it at home
Jul 29 2023,positive,providing a dark contrast to the upbeat humanist themes of interstellar oppenheimer asks important philosophical questions about the price of a weapon and the toll it takes on the person who introduces it im happy nolan has truly mastered his nonlinear storytelling and put it to use in a movie with lots of talking great stuff
Jul 29 2023,positive,fantastic film multiple oscar possibilities loved it
Jul 29 2023,positive,best war history film of 2023
Jul 28 2023,positive,as someone who has studied the subject director nolan gets most of his history right with some artistic liberties such as completely unnecessary nudity and sex scenes my main complaint is that in three hours 180 minutes in a biographical film about the father of the atomic bomb director nolan does not use even one minute or even a few seconds to show the result of the atomic bombs at hiroshima and nagasaki
Jul 28 2023,positive,very impactful i was engrossed throughout the whole movie
Jul 28 2023,positive,happily matt damons role was bigger than i anticipated but that man always called himself bill not leslie  i hated all the sound from the music to the effects hated every bit of it except the explosion which in its entirety was spectacular  good honest but for all its length was not very detailed except for the appeal  that was the detail around which the movie weaved itself
Jul 28 2023,positive,its a well acted film i dont believe its an imax draw as advertised
Jul 28 2023,positive,this is a good rainy sunday type of movie not something you need to see in theaters the story is well paced acting is fantastic but something about the whole movie felt flat
Jul 28 2023,positive,worth seeing once acting is amazing story is haunting and keeps you guessing but once youve seen it you dont have the desire to rewatch it
Jul 28 2023,positive,just got back from the movie was not what i expected but was fascinating with one brutally emotional scene  made even more emotional by the lack of onscreen emotion just dont go thinking the movie is like a linear story  it is very dense with dialogue ive heard it referred to as a monster movie and in some ways it is just that  where we hardly see the monster and when we do the monster isnt what might have been expected looking at reviews seems audience either loves it or hates it  very few middle of the road reviews the sound and score are powerful but unlike other nolan movies where i went back to the theater 4 or 5 more times i think this is a one and done movie for me to see
Jul 28 2023,positive,amazing storytelling by christopher nolan he made a three hour movie consistantly intruiging most of the reviews talking of the movie being boring refer more to the lack of action than lack of an interesting plot but no one said this was an action movie nolan also does an amazing job focusing on oppenheimers life as a whole not just the bomb stellar performances from everyone
Jul 28 2023,negative,even robert downey jr couldnt save this yawn although he played his dull written character to perfection  three hours of chemist chat i was lulled to sleep for a short bit only waking in hopes the agony was over it was not bad bad bad
Jul 28 2023,positive,a very well done movie from all aspects
Jul 28 2023,positive,brilliant acting brilliant visuals brilliant everything
Jul 28 2023,negative,director indulgent the score played over the dialog and was distracting too loud unless it was the theaters fault too much hype and not enough deliverance
Jul 28 2023,positive,a once in a lifetime experience and a mustsee film for anyone who hasnt seen it yet its an historical thriller drama and biopic that keeps you on the edge of your seat and all thanks to christopher nolans writing  directing all of the incredible cast with of course cillian murphys stellar performance as the j robert opennheimer carrying the entire film on his shoulder completely humanizing the character as well a robert downey jr as the villanous lewis strauss and everyone who was part of the production of this film overall an impecable film that leaves an important message for the post ww2 21st century nuclear world we live in and a call for more imax 70mm theatres couldnt see the film in that format but if you can and a have a theater proyecting it near you please see it in the biggest format possible as the director intended
Jul 28 2023,positive,this movie hit all the right feels its damming how dr op was used and treated after helping end world war ii you really have to watch this in a different perspective christopher nolan did it again excellent
Jul 28 2023,negative,overlong tedious in places and disappointing handling of material that could have been hugely engaging and informative   murphy was excellent and a few others worked hard but with many underdeveloped actors that we were not invited to care about much less understand  much of the plotline was not properly explained either and the action sequences of the bomb itself were very short  massive let down after all the wild hype  a story worth telling and one that demands the screening of a few frames at least of the real aftermath of hiroshima and nagasaki but which didnt happen  to me that was gutless  wait to stream dont waste your money
Jul 28 2023,positive,the acting was excellent and the production amazing
Jul 28 2023,positive,now i am become death the destroyer of worlds   we agree that this is one of the greatest films that we will mention in the coming years integrated in all respects   first directing nolan presented us with wonderful scenes using an imax camera   secondly the acting cillian murphy was fabulous in this movie i really felt that oppenheimers character was made for him he was acting with his eyes his looks at the camera were alone enough to know what he feelthe oscar will be for best actor  as for robert downey you will really forget that he played the character of iron man it was a masterpiece for me this is the best performance in his career also he deserves the oscar for best supporting actor   thirdly music and sound if you are not interested in sound or music then this movie is completely different it was the best experience anyone could go through in any movie and for me it was the best thing in the movie   fourth the scenario to say the least it was complex and woven in a wonderful way we were moving from untidy timelines going back to the past then going to the present and also going to the future some scenes were in colors that indicate something and were narrated from a persons perspective while others were in black and white and it indicates something else and the way he wrote oppenheimers character and analyzed his feelings and feelings of happiness sadness or tension i think that the film was able to present a biographical film in an unconventional way   the defect in this movie are two things the first is the speed of the events in the first hour of the movie as it was moving between times quickly making this viewer in a state of incomprehensibility with the large number of characters this may make some viewers upset but it was not an important thing if you focused on the movie the other defect and i think it is not important is the lack of focus on oppenheimers emotions towards his relationship with his exgirlfriend and his wife he did not give us enough time to get to know his character or even get attached to the character but this is not important because the movie is not romantic   this is a firstclass dialogue movie if you are willing to watch a threehour movie full of wonderful events politics feelings tension fear and anxiety then this movie is for you advice before you watch the movie try to know some information about the life of the scientist oppenhaper and about the events which was going on in the war so that you are sufficiently aware of what is happening in the film and focus on the film well this is not written by any ordinary director this is written by the genius christopher nolan
Jul 28 2023,positive,i actually worked with 3 physicists from the manhatten project in the 1970s80s one of their names is very briefly mentioned in the movie and i had a great respect for them  they would have been less happy with the taut dramatic aspects of the movie but more happy with its pictoral rendering and the kind of thought and psychological tension that the movie brought to these folks  the oppenheimer actor was superb as were the supporting actors and the facial closeups showed excellent character development  president truman was the only flub  highly recommended for anyone seeking answers as to the first bomb development in the us and to how the us government can pillory those in its service
Jul 28 2023,negative,sex scenesporn was completely unnecessary the film should of focused more on how the bomb was put together 
Jul 28 2023,positive,this is without a doubt the best nolan in around a decade it has elements of all his films combined to make a very masterful movie seeing this on the biggest screen possible is the best way to get the best experience the film builds the tension throughout the movie that only nolan knows how to cast is just icing on the cake with the amount of excellent performances not one weak note when it comes to acting only complaint would be the runtime however every minute is earned which begs to question what if anything should he have cut out cillian without a doubt steals the show and really shows just how great of an actor he is hes already proven how good he can be but this role is one he was destined to play which allows for him to flourish i still believe his best film to date is interstellar this film gives that movie a run for its money nolan without a doubt deserves the award for best director its really a shame when you look back at how many times hes really been nominated for big awards in the directing category which has only been once which wasnt until dunkirk no one quite captures an audience like nolan does nolan should not only be nominated but should win for directing otherwise this would really question how credible the oscars are this is without a doubt one of nolans best written and directed movies of his whole career when less talented directors have been nominated for a whole lot less
Jul 28 2023,positive,i loved it educational
Jul 28 2023,positive,one of my all time favourites if you love nolan then watch this film asap because it is about as nolan as nolan gets a visual and audible spectacle every actor plays their part to perfection and if your name isnt christopher nolan cillian murphy robert downey jr or emily blunt then dont show up to the award shows
Jul 28 2023,positive,exceptional many great performances emily blunts josh hartnetts rdjs matt damon all do extremely great but cillian is just off the charts in this one it is frankly incredible very well written the 3h go by very fast not to mention the incredible score
Jul 28 2023,negative,this movie is not movie theater price worthy more like a streaming from home too long and boring not sure what all the hype was about
Jul 28 2023,positive,amazing movie really opens your eyes to the emotional baggage that comes with a world destroying invention and shows that there is not diffident right or wrong in the world just a less wrong and a very wrong
Jul 28 2023,positive,best movie ive ever watched perfectly played by the actors and perfectly directed very unique with an amazing ending
Jul 28 2023,positive,riveting superb acting music and cinematography
Jul 28 2023,positive,one of nolans best films a true masterpiece
Jul 28 2023,positive,i went into this thinking that it would just be a retelling of a story that ive seen on the history channel for over 30 years now but its not this is quality cinema absolutely loved it
Jul 28 2023,positive,for the intellectual its a masterpiece but i think some might struggle to follow and should maybe stick to barbie brilliant film
Jul 28 2023,positive,i thought it was excellent  but would have been better without the scenes involving florence pugh  added absolutely nothing to the story
Jul 28 2023,negative,pretentious and boring maybe just maybe if it was 90 minutes long but still chock full of self absorption in the characters as well as director and the cinematography  esp the hand held camera scenes was distracting the final denouement degrades robert downing jrs character into a two dimensional bond villain just to achieve unrealistic imo closure on oppenheimer who has always been and always will be an enigma
Jul 28 2023,positive,i just got back from watching oppenheimer in imax and wow just wow this movie is simply incredible and is most certainly christopher nolans magnum opus both cillian murphy and nolan deserve oscars for this masterpiece murphys performance as oppenheimer was excellent from start to finish and he portrayed every aspect of the character incredibly oppenheimer is easily the best movie i have ever seen hands down
Jul 28 2023,positive,oppenheimer is christopher nolans best film and its the best film of year so far
Jul 28 2023,negative,like so many others i am a huge admirer of christopher nolan and judging from the ratings of critics as well as the audience i was expecting it to be one of his best but every scene just seemed to be good actingsmart script turn page good actingsmart script turn page which may seem like a recipe for a terrific film but this is a movie not a picture book the film never really drew me in and fully engaged me the way a great film usually does i honestly became so tired of it that i walked out after about 25 the way through i understand from a critic who had the same experience that i did echo chamberlain on youtube that the los alamos hour did rise to the occasion but he said the he could have skipped about 2 hours of the rest i honestly dont understand how it can be as highly rated as it apparently is but at least i know there is one other nolan fan who feels the same as i do
Jul 28 2023,positive,one of the best movies ive seen in cinema
Jul 28 2023,negative,confused noisy chaotic superficial no character development historically dodgy lacking humour politically onesided far too selfreverential    oh and einstein was definitely not some sort of wise sage but a deeply flawed person who was also a maths genius  professional film critics yet again seem to have collectively lost their way
Jul 28 2023,negative,too long the last hour just droned on
Jul 28 2023,positive,its a bit too long but at no point boring rarely did i ever see a movie where after going out of the cinema i had to take a deep breath bombastic smart and breathtaking
Jul 28 2023,positive,overall content and how it linked together
Jul 28 2023,positive,oppenheimer was one of the best movies i have ever seen the visuals where out of my mind the bass was so intense and powerfull i literally cannot describe it oppenheimer has had a pretty dramatic and how the us president called oppenheimer a cry baby i could feel his emotions christopher nolan did an absolute banger putting this as my second favourite movie going to see the movie again in full imax     great job chris i wait to see what other fab work you will makeshow in the upcoming years
Jul 28 2023,positive,great movie yes three hours long but it keeps you hungry for more the entire time definitely need to watch in imax subtitles are preferred because of how fast everyone talks and the accents introduced in the movie great dialogue amazing acting robert downey jrs character will blow you away on top of cillian murphys emotional roller coasters he goes through 1010
Jul 28 2023,positive,nolan strikes again all of this mans movies have had some impact although i have seen many ground breaking movies from nolan this might very well be his best at the end of the movie you will contemplate life consequences of having the power to take it and also the faith of revolutionary scientists they just dont make movies like this anymore
Jul 28 2023,positive,careful exposition of very complex ideas of geopolitics science and morality very well done
Jul 28 2023,negative,i went to this theater specifically to see oppenheimer in 70mm the soda machines didnt have ice many flavors missing the seats wouldnt recline the arm rest wouldnt fully raise seats were sticky    but the worst part was we missed the beginning of the movieit started and stopped a few times out of focus before they fixed so im not sure what happened the first few minutes and since house lights are on a timer they came one before the film finished    wont be back
Jul 28 2023,negative,just not my movie it dragged on and on and could have been shortened with no impact to the plot
Jul 28 2023,positive,went in knowing that there wasnt quite as much action as other recent movies but the dialogue acting and filming was great very enjoyable movie
Jul 28 2023,positive,informative and in depth
Jul 28 2023,positive,masterpiece from the sound acting cinematography and visuals must see in 70mm
Jul 28 2023,positive,an epic look into the hypercomplicated personality of the father of the atomic bomb who often failed to balance his twin demons of the pursuit of scientific knowledge with with his boundless ambition and thirst for acclaim my one complaint echoed by others is the muffled audio in much of the dialogue but exceptional 
Jul 28 2023,negative,lets admit it some of us got suckered into watching this in the barbenheimer combo and theres good reason to believe it wouldve failed like tenet hadnt leeched off the success of barbie in this social media memedriven combo this is a really long boring and dour movie the soundtrack blasting throughout the movie nonstop doesnt help you stay awake either in fact the lack of silence gaps makes the experience anesthetizing theres also a lot of filler that i think doesnt help the movie it couldve been a lot shorter and leaner youre better off watching a documentary series on the subject rather than watching this movie at least you could pause it and view it at your own pace and youre likely to come out better informed in the end it really isnt good material for a movie but it wouldve been great for a docudrama series  also imax is completely overkill for this its not worth it and i cant believe it got bumped over the newest mission impossible in imax theatres smh  the fact they blew a huge portion of their budget on blowing up a real bomb has got to be the most michael bay thing ever your auterism has to be put in check if no one points out how stupid that is
Jul 28 2023,negative,very poor story telling and all over the place does not tell 1 cohesive story i had a lot of detail about the history and facts around that manhattan project and oppenheimers life but this movie does a horrendous job in portraying that story and if you are a layman without the historical context forget it you wont get anything from it my friend who accompanied me to the movie basically couldnt even summarize what the story was about after he spent 3 hours figuring it out the cinematography that works for the dark night and other batmaninception type movies works well  for action and the dark theme chris nolan genre but made no sense for this slow documentary style film really bad job c nolan one size doesnt fit all    oh yea i watched it in imax this movie absolutely doesnt belong on the big screen this is a small screen film with subtitles dont waste your money for imax youll see when you watch it
Jul 28 2023,positive,leading up to the test at los alamos  3 stars after the test there one star the movie was about an hour too long and after the bomb was detonated which was in itself a cinematic dud it was disappointing because of the confusing interrogations and congressional hearings after the war
Jul 28 2023,positive,my favorite movie ive ever seen but im a science head so maybe im not the right person to ask 
Jul 28 2023,negative,all these rave reviews are nuts fat man little boy is a much better picture this is nothing like that much too long hard to follow very odd use of visuals as well not worth a ticket to the theater and imax wasnt anything to write home about either wait for streaming
Jul 28 2023,positive,absolutely wonderful movie so many strong performances
Jul 28 2023,positive,i loved it it was amazing down to the last min
Jul 28 2023,positive,fantastic movie long but held my attention  the entire 3 hu  ours
Jul 28 2023,negative,based off all the glowing reviews and christopher nolans history of amazing videos i went in expecting to see a great movie but the movie was extremely disappointing     the movie has entirely way too much dialogue i wouodnt be surprised if its the record holder for most words spoken during a movie yet somehow the story is so unclear of whats actually happening in all honesty during 75 of the movie i was completely confused and left wondering wtf is happening
Jul 28 2023,positive,christopher nolan cranks out yet another masterpiece spellbinding utterly riveting and simply unmissable
Jul 28 2023,neutral,hard to follow barely entertaining and lacking a strong comment on a hugely influential man
Jul 28 2023,positive,not as good as the book this review is from the perspective of having read kai birds excellent biography years ago christopher nolan seems like an odd choice for this project there was a relentless level of drama from start to finish and senate hearing scenes were done in black  white even though it was the actors in the scene so it seemed odd oppenheimer was portrayed very well i think the trinity test could have been done more clearly  effectively  i kept looking for any visual hint of white sands which is literally next door to the testing site all in all though very good effort in putting on screen even in just 3 hours a complex story about a complex man in a complex and changing political situation id like to see what people who didnt read the book think of the movie
Jul 28 2023,negative,boring action and way to long this was a waste of money
Jul 28 2023,positive,i liked how the movie presented the problems with making the atomic bomb quickly i appreciated how they presented oppenheimer as a complex and flawed man i did not appreciate the gratuitous sex scenes and parts of the movie dragged this could have been a twohour movie and been better for it
Jul 28 2023,positive,amazing film quite hard to understand but the emotional message is accessible to everyone a definite rewatch for me
Jul 28 2023,positive,loved the story and presentation
Jul 28 2023,positive,an absolute masterpiece  yes its long but the pacing was deliberate thorough and never boring
Jul 28 2023,positive,thank you nolan my shining star and his twink cillian 
Jul 28 2023,positive,history nerd here so i was not going to miss this movie  it did not disappoint  must see
Jul 28 2023,negative,this is one of those movies that makes me think these rotten tomatoes audience reviews are bogus its not a good movie its too long its too hard to follow its boring and its not appropriate for children skip it
Jul 28 2023,positive,it is spectacular the visuals and sound effects are amazing i have watched it in imax
Jul 28 2023,neutral,epic storytelling and great acting by everyone involved but the story is hard to follow and the key scenes are quick flashbacks that dont really provide the important info or at least i didnt pick up on it i really wanted to like it but i didnt  oh and the sex scenes are awkwardcreepy 
Jul 28 2023,positive,everything i would say has been said so i will keep it short oppenheimer is a masterpiece    regarding the criticisms  if you are looking for a film about the ethics of the development testing and use of the bomb or the ensuing arms race this is not that film nor was it or the book intended to be  as someone who is very sensitive about how women are used in film i thought blunt portrayed the frustration and anger of educated bright talented women stuck in the roles of wives and mothers women i knew growing up brilliantly while pugh was passionately idealistic and emotionally fragile  in her smaller role   that said the film is a character study on one person oppenheimer  with a strong secondary role for his antagonist strauss a large cast of excellent actors makes beautiful miniatures in their supporting roles  and yes it is a long film without action sequences so dont expect it to be we were all mesmerized the whole time and didnt notice the long sit and i hate sitting in fact i am going to see it again next week
Jul 28 2023,positive,truly  some of nolans best work its not going down as one of my favorite films but i think nolan could retire and be happy after this film seeing as how it truly is a masterwork within his specific craft i hope he doesnt retire though
Jul 28 2023,positive,so much more than explosions and nazis great movie really went in depth showing the humanity in brilliant people
Jul 28 2023,positive,amazing a visual masterpiece combined with an iconic cast
Jul 28 2023,positive,i loved the film cinematography story and acting a great film for such an important part of history
Jul 28 2023,positive,the movie was a bit too long and the nude scenes were totally unnecessary  sometimes the dialogue was hard to understand  it was interesting though
Jul 28 2023,positive,probably one of the best if not the best movie in 2023 an amazing experience and the trinity test scene is one of the most amazing experiences i have ever had in a movie theater
Jul 28 2023,positive,it like every nolan movie ever  a masterpiecethe pacing is great realtive to the span of the film and also the dialogue was excellentthe depiction of ophenheimers life and his emotions were right on
Jul 28 2023,positive,nolan is back with a breathtaking and awsome movie with so good storytelling this is nolans magnum opus
Jul 28 2023,negative,this movie could have been more aptly titled the oppenheimerlewis strauss interminable feud at 3 hours i had hoped for an in depth depiction of the manhattan project with a bit of physics and mechanical engineering dumbed down for a movie crowd but willing to suck up some of the seedier details of oppenheimers life as part and parcel of the deal as is the movie shifts back and forth in time between the personal vendetta of strauss vs oppenheimer and the effort to revoke his security clearance alternating with scantily fleshed out manhattan project would rather have seen lawrences cyclotron work at u235 separation and seaborgs discovery of plutonium than wallowing in 1930s berkeley feeble academic communists thrashing and physicists hand wringing about dropping the bomb at 3 hours at least 80 minutes were endless yammering it was like 12 angry men meets the manhattan project  saw it in imax and sound effectsmusic overwhelmed the dialogue it was very unpleasant and felt like i needed closed captions for some parts the trinity test shock wave blast was the only appropriate use of the imax sound system   good acting was unable to save this loser   not a movie i would ever want to watch a second time
Jul 28 2023,positive,finished watching oppenheimer a very long but incredibly well made film about one of the most important events in history a stellar cast led wonderful by cillian murphy this truly took us to the mind of oppenheimer and it was amazing to see 810
Jul 28 2023,positive,it was ok i can see where people like it its definitely well made and well written that being said it just wasnt for me it was way to long and really drug through most of the movie
Jul 28 2023,positive,wow every second of the 3 hours was needed and overall great movie
Jul 28 2023,positive,great movie long and slower in some spots but a great movie nontheless
Jul 28 2023,positive,amazing movie nearly perfect
Jul 28 2023,positive,hands down the best movie in theaters and the best movie to ever be shown in theaters oppenheimer certainly hits home the fact that times are intense and common sense must prevail  the ending of oppenheime whoa
Jul 28 2023,positive,this time nolans obsession with multiple timelines works perfectly fabulous movie worth seeing on the big screen with a really tricky yet totally cohesive script  well done to the writers  superb acting with robert downey standing out amongst giants mr oppenheimer himself remains an ambiguous character a hugely capable manbut hard to decipher his true motives  that is left for the audience to post rationalise gripping despite we all know what happened and with borderline perfect direction and script  you wont feel the 3 hours as long at all brilliant period reconstruction of 40 years of madness ingenuity and politics
Jul 28 2023,positive,oppenheimer is an extraordinary biographical film about the life of julius robert oppenheimer an american physicist responsible for the development of the atomic bomb during the manhattan project   the movie contextualizes his life in the turbulent times between the world wars and machartism   based on the book american prometheus the film portrays not only historical events but also delves into the physicists personal and political struggles   directed and written by christopher nolan the film showcases brilliant performances from cillian murphy and robert downey jr  the practical effects and cinematography especially the use of imax add to the immersive experience while the soundtrack by ludwig g√∂ransson enhances the emotional impact   although the film features a vast array of characters it delivers an engaging narrative that captivates the audience throughout its approximately threehour runtime   oppenheimer is a cinematic masterpiece that surpasses expectations and is a mustwatch experience in theaters
Jul 28 2023,positive,phenomenal film captivating every cast member delivered stellar performances nolan is a true artist in filmmaking
Jul 28 2023,positive,nolan works his magic yet again a very intelligent and engrossing movie
Jul 28 2023,positive,fabulous amazing must watch
Jul 28 2023,positive,another piece of art from christopher nolan a true cinematic experience that leaves you thinking truly well made down to every small detail
Jul 28 2023,positive,this movie is over hyped more than any piece of media ive seen in the last decade it is not a bad film by any means but in my opinion it fails to even be a truly special nolan film let alone the savior of hollywood
Jul 28 2023,positive,the movie is great the best movie i have seen in my life the effects are just so perfect as well the visual and dialogue specially i like the ost its just perfection i really recommend you to see it you wont regret trust me
Jul 28 2023,positive,3 hours of movie and still felt too much smashed together it still good but not the best nolan work
Jul 28 2023,positive,first and foremost  the acting by every actor was truly absolutely stellar and makes the movie well worth watching  and there were many small intelligent clues to relatedness smoothly interjected  as an example works by picasso as influence upon oppenheimers thinking and subtle reveals of his eidetic memory some critics have described sweeping cinematography though i did not find it all that sweeping  indeed yes there were several beautiful scenes of southwestern open skies and color palette among its ruggedly gorgeous arid hills and buttes  yet there were missed opportunities to better depict the scope impact and object of oppenheimers explosive work  in the end the ugliness of academic jealousies played out tellingly in the kangaroo courts of mccarthyism as well as the compromising effects of human failings weakness and selfjustification yet i and those with me found it too frequently difficult to recognize where we were in the timeline despite using the advancing grayness of oppenheimers hair as one useful cue muddying the complex interwoven lines of relationship and emotional causation  a film well worth seeing but ill not contend its flawless
Jul 28 2023,positive,the length seems justified by the gravity of the issues at stake the breadth of characters was possibly too large to get the depth right on each but this was handled without becoming dull or too superficial not sure the pornographic scenes added to the experience but they were brief the movie is carried by outstanding acting which has to be career best for several of them very good story telling of an epic and consequential tale the tragic hero is neither canonized nor vilified hes was an amazing human with unparalleled genius but with all the human failures well done
Jul 28 2023,negative,very slow moving   unless youre really into physics or the history of the subject id pass on it
Jul 28 2023,positive,this film was the best biopic ive ever seen christopher nolan always delivers bangers and this was no exception he was so clever with the storys narrative having a non linear manner of storytelling and the use of flashbacks like memento he used colour and black and white to distinguish scenes between subjective view of oppenheimer and and objective view which was in black and white lets talk about the actors every single cast member ate and left no crumbs cillian murphy delivered a captivating performance as oppenheimer and his co stars such as rdj matt damon and emily blunt were brilliant as supporting actors in the film the score for film fit so well it allowed the viewers a to fully immerse ourselves in the film the storyline was perfection the build up to the trinity test and the following legal battle faced by robert j oppenheimer was told in way that was so appealing and engaging for the audience to watch i am definitely going to watch this film again in the near future lets hope it wins some well deserved oscars
Jul 28 2023,neutral,i had high hopes for this movie but it was a bit disappointing it should have been shorter and some money spent on special effects it needed less jumping between time and more of the bomb
Jul 28 2023,positive,1010 one of the best movies of the 21st century
Jul 28 2023,negative,there should be an oscar for marketing this movie is overhyped most of the casts are excellent but the movie itself tried to cramp too many stories in it so nothing is truly meaningful cilian murphy carried all the weight by himself the soundtracks are  often do not match with the scenes and in some cases are too loud
Jul 28 2023,negative,hard to give it 2 stars and agree to say it meh it passed the time its way too long an boring in parts
Jul 28 2023,positive,amazing movie fabulous acting i learned so much that i didnt know and what i had forgotten highly recommend that you read about him and refresh your memories before seeing the movie a 3 hour movie that never felt too long
Jul 28 2023,positive,for once the hype is accurate beautifully made beautifully acted and beautifully written an incredible film
Jul 28 2023,positive,this is the best movie in years great acting and directing one doesnt notice the 3 hours length amazing work
Jul 28 2023,positive,best film of the year finally a film for adults with brains
Jul 28 2023,positive,is the best movie in my life easy to understand
Jul 28 2023,positive,christopher nolans 12th film delivers an entrancing experience exposing the humanity behind the epochal decisions that not only brought world war ii to a definitive end but also set in motion the relentless ticking of the doomsday clock     the visual brilliance brought to life by cinematographer hoyte van hoytema is nothing short of a symphony for the eyes hoytema skillfully captures the essence of the characters and the gravity of their choices transporting us back in time and allowing us to witness the weight and human cost of scientific breakthrough     throughout the film g√∂ranssons emotionally charged score engulfs the audience in a contemplative dread that mirrors the very essence of oppenheimers frozen blue gaze the music pulsates with every beat of our hearts underscoring the moral paradox faced by oppenheimer and the few men in power who grapple with the consequences of their actions    nolan showcases his ability to entangle historical events with an important and profound examination of human nature the film serves as a poignant reminder of the decisions that shaped the course of history and the lasting impact they have on the world as we know it nolans deft storytelling paints the vulnerabilities insecurities fears and ambitions of powerhungry men leaving the audience with haunting reflections about those currently in control     oppenheimer is a mustsee film that reaffirms nolans place among the finest filmmakers of our time
Jul 28 2023,positive,even though 3 hours didnt feel that long had a nice pace to it learned things about oppenheimer i hadnt known before i will say that i dont think its a requirement to see this movie in imax or other laser equivalents imax is best for bold action movies and this doesnt qualify except for the scene where they test explode the first device in new mexico and even that was sort of subdued there wasnt any bold action more into the personalities associated with the manhattan project and dr oppenhiemer i happened to see the movie in a standard theater and it was just fine
Jul 28 2023,negative,christopher nolan is an incredible film director who like oppenheimer coordinates a talented team to achieve excellence he is a gifted storyteller capable of weaving an intricate narrative however in his latest film he cynically assumes that audiences lack the sophistication to understand the math or physics behind the development of the atomic bomb and the geopolitical forces at play in addition there are only passing references to the brutal battles taking place on land at sea and in the skies nolan offers no depiction of the plight of jews in europe or even mentions the jewish refugees turned away at the border while others are sought to develop a weapon of unimaginable destruction     once the mania subsides film lovers are sure to agree that oppenheimer papered over an important historical figure and monumental events worthy of more time and consideration dont mistake duration for substance
Jul 28 2023,positive,this movie isheavy to sum it up in one word although that would not do it justice oppenheimer was a name i never even heard of until seeing this movie the manhattan project was also something i barely understood aside from the fact that it was a top secret project that was responsible for creating the atomic bomb this movie opened my eyes to what really happened in that new mexico desert and who was behind all of it it is safe to say this movie really blew me away no pun intended the film portrays oppenheimers complex personality contradicting beliefs and subsequent downfall very emotionally one can only imagine the psyche of someone deemed the father of the atomic bomb
Jul 28 2023,positive,best movie in a long time so well done and the acting is superb its long but worth it id sit through it again
Jul 28 2023,negative,3 hours of pure jibberish   hard to follow poor ending and underwhelming
Jul 28 2023,negative,though the acting in this film is phenomenal and will likely result in numerous awards i question the directors choice to tell this story in such a cold distant way the timeline hops that nolan so loves to use didnt allow me time to get attached to any of the characters enough to care about their outcome and there were so many characters that were introduced with little background information or character development that it was difficult keeping track of them all it also felt way too long and could easily have been cut to well below the current runtime without any loss to the story the sound mixing also turned me off a bit i sat in an imax theater which has optimal sound and there were still scenes where the dialogue was a bit garbled however the explosions and rafter pounding were deafening i get that the director was trying to use the sound level to increase tension but he went a little overboard there i was bored through most of the middle and kept looking at my watch to see how much longer before i could leave however the last 15 minutes were interesting overall the way the subject matter was presented distanced me from the story so much that i felt nothing and i couldnt help but wonder how this subject matter would have felt in the hands of another director who has the ability to elicit human emotion
Jul 28 2023,positive,absolutely fantastic film and the film that cinema was needing wonderful 
Jul 28 2023,positive,in my top 3 for best christopher nolan films of all time cillian murphy delivers an oscar worthy performance
Jul 28 2023,positive,a quality movie that hollywood used to make but hadnt in many years  the kind of film actually deserving of a best picture oscar   loved it
Jul 28 2023,positive,fantastic filming cinematography sound etc but the chronology was difficult to follow the bomb development was nearly ignored and the movie was overly focused on the actions of the antagonist played excellently by r downey  i left feeling disappointed feeling the fun could have been so much more
Jul 28 2023,positive,am i the only that enjoyed the last hour just as much as the first two hours of the movie im a sucker for welldone courtroom dramas and the level of intensity jason clarke robert downey jr emily blunt and cillian murphy bring to the table is outstanding brilliantly directed excellent pace visuals out of this world and audio thats more than definitely awardwinning are just some of the reasons you should watch this one i already got my tickets for a second screening
Jul 28 2023,positive,went into the movie thinking it will be action movie but it was more like imitation game movie it has slow setup but i liked the last 2 hours nice variety from nolan after tenet may be the runtime can be reduced by 2030 mins the actors murphy and rdj were good overall satisfied with the movie
Jul 28 2023,positive,this movie put the wiring of this entire world on us a deep meaningful movie visuals and the sound design is yet again the best
Jul 28 2023,positive,before the movie i highly suggest drinking a solid shot of double espresso you will need to be alert and all your facilities sharp we all know the story the leading up to building the bomb and how oppenheimer was chosen for the project and the team he assembled and the success of the project comprised the first half very interesting and detailed but a bit slow in the pacing      now the 2nd half was something else pure drama which involves the trial of oppenheimer as he fights to clear his name of any communist tendencies of course according to the movie lewis strauss who was on the committee to push for a hbomb felt slighted by oppenheimer and thus started a personal vendetta against him basically stating he was an in the closet communist here is my biggest concern how real was this slight and how much for dramatic effect especially the conversation between oppenheimer and einstein which strauss felt like he was being talked about behind his back i tend to think that was nonexistent   in real life but who knows      my one big technical complaint is the mixing of the voices and music which tends to be director christopher nolans style very annoying when there are important conversations happening and the music is overpowering the talking      aside from that great historical flick which everybody could learn from
Jul 28 2023,positive,i expected something totally different than the movie delivered i did like the plot but after the experiment it ran on  it was difficult to hear the voices over the sound fx perhaps it couldve been balanced better as i was actually thinking they should turn on closed captioning overall 3 star from me
Jul 28 2023,negative,in a good way einsteins cospoor from the movie oppenheimer didnt convince me horrible and with stupid expression more like an angry grandma trash other than that the einstein in the film should have appeared more and that they showed einstein reluctantly writing a famous letter to roosevelt for the us to make the atomic bomb before hitler to show the stress on lise meitner and aotto hann under pressure from the nazis and the film itself should have ended by showing the hiroshima and nagasaki explosions they didnt show it and yet a weak trinity detonation in alamogordo new mexico was very badly done they also reduced richard feynmann to a beater instead of showing how was expressive his participation in the manhattan project from the middle to the end of the film they took an unnecessary stretch of the spying court case that oppenheimer endured
Jul 28 2023,positive,oppenheimer is an aweinspiring masterpiece that exemplifies christopher nolans unparalleled brilliance as a filmmaker rarely does a film possess such profoundness that it leaves me utterly speechless cillian murphys portrayal of oppenheimer is nothing short of extraordinary capturing the complexities of the character with sheer brilliance the entire ensemble cast delivers exceptional performances elevating the film to greater heights    nolans directing prowess shines through every frame weaving a gripping narrative that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish the editing is seamless effortlessly transitioning between timelines and character perspectives adding layers of depth to the storytelling ludwig goranssons haunting score complements the films emotional depth enhancing every scene with a perfect blend of intensity and poignancy the cinematography is breathtaking capturing the essence of each era with stunning visual eleganceoppenheimer reaffirms nolans reputation as a visionary storyteller masterfully blending history science and human drama into a profound cinematic experience it is a thoughtprovoking exploration of the moral dilemmas surrounding scientific advancements and their farreaching consequences    in conclusion oppenheimer stands as one of christopher nolans finest works an exquisitely crafted symphony of storytelling that resonated deeply with me it is a true testament to the power of cinema and a mustwatch for anyone seeking an intellectually stimulating and emotionally resonant cinematic journey
Jul 28 2023,positive,a tour de force of a film expansive engrossing and challenging in equal measure the narrative is both complex in its layering and timeshifting and yet as direct as an arrow just one of the many and profound paradoxes which it puts before you to consider it works on every level the actors are superb cillian murphy and his icyblue eyes hold you throughout while a galaxy of characters fill out the screen it is hugely authentic with no obvious cgi and few overdramatised hysterics despite the momentuous of the subject like the final apocalyptic images leaking into oppemheimers own brain it will linger long in your head
Jul 28 2023,positive,great movie the pacing is somewhat slow but any issues regarding this are compensated by the extreme quality of this films sound design the film follows two timelines and although its somewhat confusing they are clearly separated by having one of them in black and white making it more digestible great start and specially the ending which for me made me forget about the last hour of the movie which is not as good as the two previous ones go oppie
Jul 28 2023,negative,slow long overhyped and hard to follow i was really looking forward to this movie but it was a disappointment
Jul 28 2023,positive,the most amazing performances this should win some major academy awards 
Jul 28 2023,negative,movie should have been 2 hours long the last hour was so boring and i couldnt understand what everyone was so upset about feels like they put nudity in the movie just to make it more interesting   if you must watch this movie wait till its on netflix that way you can not feel so guilty about falling asleep watching it or better yet just turn it off
Jul 28 2023,positive,amazing movie the only way to watch it is in imax christopher nolan is a great director
Jul 28 2023,positive,we learned so much history in this movie acting and scenery were wonderful so much nudity was unnecessary however
Jul 28 2023,positive,a brilliant biopic that is like an immersive chemical reaction in the way scenes and sound are fused together to create one immense experience that is also educational and thought provoking
Jul 28 2023,positive,absolute masterpiece christopher nolan is one of the greatest directors of our time
Jul 28 2023,positive,an absolutely must see perfect scenes rythym and a flawless performance by cilian murphy
Jul 28 2023,positive,amazing movie just understand that this is a movie about oppenheimer the man not about the bomb fantastic score
Jul 28 2023,positive,this nuke could have been about an hour shorter slow first hour that was subject to bad editing got better as it moved into the second hour good acting about an enormous military event my biggest complaint is about the background music that obscured the dialogue  in the end still an entertaining film experience
Jul 28 2023,positive,absolutely amazing all of the cast all of them really delivered the moments of tension negotiations are so well delivered incredible
Jul 28 2023,positive,the sound build up throughout the film felt like a rollercoaster waiting to drop unreal
Jul 28 2023,positive,excellent cast portrayals storyline brilliant just ran a tad too long but worth it
Jul 28 2023,positive,enjoyed the presentation of the history but the movie and plot felt a little disjointed  there was not enough about the actual nuts and bolts of making the bomb and too much repetitive politics across 3 or 4 time lines  also some of the dialog was hard to hear and understand  entire sentences felt mumbled whispered or lost in the soundtrack  it was entertaining but felt long and honestly the bomb itself was a little underwhelming
Jul 28 2023,positive,its hard to articulate all the thoughts but yall remember when we used to be kids and watched batman and lived the character for a few days cillian murphy had a similar impact on me ludwig g√∂ranssons score was perfect and will not let you miss hans zimmer screenwriting is something christopher nolan has mastered since memento can we call oppenheimer nolans best work id say no but this will be considered a film that is unique from the other films he has made can we call it cillian murphys best role a big yes because of the superhero movies we often forget how great an actor robert downey is as lewis strauss he blew everyones mind magnificent actors incredible storytelling and engaging music a simple 810 the only complaint is the run time i felt like 15 mins from the court room drama can be trimmed
Jul 28 2023,negative,dialogues and rhythm are like in a law  order episode everything is said in a hurry everything is a memorable clich√© taken from a quotations website everything is said just for the sake of the plot chekhovs gun taken to the limit characters are mere caricatures einstein is someone whose hat flies off science is approached through worn out corny metaphors science investigations are carried at the pace and with the elegance of law  order crime investigations there is the mandatory erotic scene etc
Jul 28 2023,positive,all around spectacular movie
Jul 28 2023,negative,had it not been for the trashy nudity the film would have been amazing  so extremely disappointing
Jul 28 2023,positive,one of the best nolan movies
Jul 28 2023,positive,this movie is filled with great scenes and sound effects the large cast all did great acting the plot fell flat for me at the end i was expecting most of the movie to concentrate on the building of the atomic bomb that was only the first half the rest of the movie involved a political smear campaign over a government security clearance
Jul 28 2023,positive,a wonderful film about a man haunted by his successes in the world of physics dramatically brilliant and balanced with a thrill that perfectly blends with it
Jul 28 2023,positive,the movie was well made and beautifully shot however it is being extremely overhyped it is a true biopic that spends too much time focusing on the question of patriotic loyalty i would have liked to have seen more effort spent on the science behind the creation of the atom bomb and execution of the trinity test scene that being said great acting and score there is no need to see the film in imax as it is 95 percent dialogue
Jul 28 2023,positive,its an exceptional experiencing this masterpiece cillian performance is out of this world nolans best movies and doesnt come close to this movie
Jul 28 2023,negative,a totally boring bio pic i dont get the hype
Jul 28 2023,negative,it is great for insomnia
Jul 28 2023,positive,overall the movie was really good in my opinion the movie was way too long which led to some boring parts occasionally the movie however was very well acted and directed
Jul 28 2023,negative,absolutely bored to tears talk and talk
Jul 28 2023,positive,brilliant historical engaging   must watch in imax70mm
Jul 28 2023,positive,oppenheimer an illustrious physicist who was embroiled in dirty politics from the get go to see his life be displayed with such nuance and elegance left me breathless in my seat ive watched every single movie of christopher nolan but this is easily the one of the best and to see cillian murphy manifest his thespianism is nothing but a delight all in all one of the greatest biopics ive ever seen even better than the aviator i say
Jul 28 2023,negative,honestly with all the hype about this film and the long await this had to be the most dysfunctional chaotic and disappointing film ive watched in a long time yes its a biographical film and a lot of interesting characters included along the way including einstein but overrated by miles the sound effects and crazy demos were a little bit ott at times with an attempt at trying to make you get excited but that never happens i slept 23 of the film much too uncharacteristic and boring for me  the scene switch between colour and greyscale order of events the speed of speech and the over complicated language at times will find the viewing difficult for many 3 hours too long
Jul 28 2023,positive,very good movie you can see all 3 different timelines of j robert oppenheimer amazing movie to watch with friends if you are intressted in history and physics you should give it a go 
Jul 28 2023,positive,occasionally we get a story that is not only important but presented at such a high bar and quality that it restores your faith in cinema
Jul 28 2023,positive,an absolute gutwrenching and compelling masterpiece about one of mankinds most important subjects in history the allstar cast delivered 300 on this a lot of oscar de deserving performances the journey that nolan takes you on left me breath taken  this is a must watch and obviously on the biggest screen you can find to enjoy technical prowess of a 3h long imax movie and finally the sound the score the practical effects this might just be my new favorite movie 
Jul 28 2023,positive,it was okay but way too long got some things incorrect and definitely wrote women out of the story i like that they didnt give the gratification of the bomb though
Jul 28 2023,positive,best picture of the year a tourdeforce for cillian murphy and a possible win for best actor at next years oscars this is definitely the greatest of all nolans films and another surefire nomination for him as well   superlatively produced directed written acted and filmed one of the greatest of all time
Jul 28 2023,positive,absolutely one of the best movies ive ever seen the music the actors the director and the fact that none of the movie had special effects is incredible
Jul 28 2023,neutral,are you a fan of 3 hour long movie trailers  do you think women are histrionic and always an obstacle in the way of progress  are you angry and want to get them for it  do you enjoy emotions being pushed down the throat with the help of music
Jul 28 2023,positive,good but too long could be a big oscar winner
Jul 28 2023,positive,incredible mix of intimate details and grand scale perfect subject at the perfect time showing the inconsistency of every man
Jul 28 2023,positive,what a masterpiece the acting all the characters were transformative especially cillian murphy and emily blunt go and see this movie
Jul 28 2023,neutral,too long  3 hrs too loud  oppenheimers relationships both personal and professional were hard to follow  most important the dialogue was hard to understand i tried really hard to read lips as often as i could see lips onscreen but the audio mix somehow obscured the whispering dialogue  here is another film where the celebrity cast and their faces on screen time overshadowed critical expository factsharing   this film assumes the viewer has a strong grasp of ww2 history i am a pretty smart 58yearold and i know about hitler russia and japan but not in the sort of detail the filmmakers expect of me  my wife and 17yearold were bored to tears by the overly political aspects of the film  the movie trailer in retrospect felt deceitful as it showed large landscapes and wide open scenery which was really only about 10 of the film the rest was talking heads in classrooms or deposition offices so this film did not warrant the extra 7 per ticket for the imax experience  i suggest streaming this at home later with subtitles on after watching a documentary about ww2    i did love watching robert downey jr my alltime favorite actor wow he looked great in such a mature role   matt damon was good too looked like either he or his character are struggling with alcohol a puffy face and eyes   ok see it but at home with subtitles
Jul 28 2023,negative,3 hours of talking painful
Jul 28 2023,positive,great movie  time switches were difficult to grasp chronologically speaking but the movie was thought provoking and disturbing in so many ways  it was probably about 30 minutes too long
Jul 28 2023,positive,this movie is perfect my all time favorite film of all time to be honest this movie is a masterpiece the way they told oppenheimers story was amazing go see this film in imax 70mm
Jul 28 2023,positive,wow can i just say wow this was a great movie with never a dull moment
Jul 28 2023,positive,the movie was a brilliant showcase of the emotions and the turmoil surrounding oppenheimer where to a point you felt that you are in fact oppenheimer you feel immersed in the trials troubled and in the split second you want him vilified for his actions and again wonder if its enough a well made fast paced biography
Jul 28 2023,positive,really interesting and good movie its just very long
Jul 28 2023,positive,sooooo good  but i felt like florences nudity was so unnecessary  actually took from the plot  made the movie less enjoyable
Jul 28 2023,positive,in a word fantastic but that might be cutting it short probably one of the best drama biopics of all time provides a great microcosm of what americanism means displays the potential dangers of scientific evolution and the cutthroatedness of many government figures
Jul 28 2023,negative,this film has to be the worst christopher nolan film ever the majority of the film consists of men walking or sitting and talking with dramatic music in the background always with one person sitting on the sofa the scenes felt very repetitive lacking any iconic moments moreover there was only one explosion which was just okay    additionally the film lacked substance in exploring the psychological aspects of oppenheimer the portrayal of women in this film was utterly and horrifically regressive most scenes involving women and children showing them in tears and when not crying women were portrayed in a sexualized and pornographic manner rather than a genuine portrayal of love women were often interrupted by men throughout the film    furthermore the word communism was thrown into the scenes frequently like receiving notifications on your phone to the point that it lost its meaning in the context of the film the constant glorification of men talking nonstop in various settings exhibited a sense of emptiness and lacked the film magic one would expect
Jul 28 2023,positive,come back at a later date 
Jul 28 2023,positive,moviebwas amazing specially the direction i never realised that i am wating a 3hr plus movie actting was on another level
Jul 28 2023,positive,all these negative reviews are just coming from people who only watch marvel movies they think every movie needs some huge cgi battle in it oppenheimer is a cinematic masterpiece that must be seen on the big screen go watch oppenheimer now
Jul 28 2023,negative,so hard to follow the story line was good audio was terrible and could barely understand what they were saying
Jul 28 2023,positive,oppenheimer was a remarkable historical film and watching it on the big screen made for an unforgettable experience the moment the trinity test detonated was undoubtedly the greatest scene in cinematic history as christopher nolans decision to not rely on cgi and only rely on practical effects brought an unmatched authenticity to the first atomic bomb explosions recreation
Jul 28 2023,positive,intelligent thoughtful extraordinarily acted and directed  visually riveting  like many id argue that it could lose at least half and hour  having said that its an exceptional film
Jul 28 2023,positive,the production quality and special effects of this movie alone is worth watching the special effects team managed to create a very real experience for the audience without the use of cgi the heaviness of this movie will stick with you long after the 3 hour run time an incredibly well done historical piece that leaves the audience wanting to go learn more about oppenheimer and his work at least me a must see and a 2023 best movie top contender in my book
Jul 28 2023,positive,best movie ever made hands down the greatest film of the year maybe the century
Jul 28 2023,negative,nolan neglected to lay any foundation that would help todays audiences understand the political climate  dark influences of communism oppenheimers sexual escapades were so unnecessary  why the one saving grace is robert downey jr who gives an absolutely stellar performance as kraise
Jul 28 2023,negative,very very not like anything of christopher nolan  very disappointing  movie about and endless interrogation process and internal spiritual struggle of the main hero  nothing at all  very disappointed
Jul 28 2023,negative,really boring movie i went into thinking i was going to like it too
Jul 28 2023,positive,the movie kept your attention even though there was no action or fighting it was so intense that you could not turn away from watching it
Jul 28 2023,positive,quite simply one of the best films ive ever seen
Jul 28 2023,positive,great story  great acting
Jul 28 2023,positive,awesome and quite informative just didnt need so much noiseear damaging sound in imax theater the movie was captivating although a couple of places were a bit maniacal
Jul 28 2023,positive,outstanding nolans directing craftsmanship as usual
Jul 28 2023,positive,this is my second time watching this moviethis is a fantastic film and shows that nolan it is one of the best directors of all time

Jul 28 2023,positive,slow but quite enjoyable bad movie coming from nolan since many great movies like tenet or even batman trilogy
Jul 28 2023,positive,mind bending explosive in your face movie the best nolan movie so far
Jul 28 2023,positive,oppenheimer delivers such a grounded film i was at a loss of words on how to describe after finishing watching it i was actually pretty happy to see that the film focused a lot on the aftermath of the end of the war and cillian murphy did a great job as oppenheimer if there is one film to see this year oppenheimer is that movie
Jul 28 2023,positive,i was blown away
Jul 28 2023,positive,this movie captures both the overwhelming triumph and the infamous downfall of j robert oppenheimer christopher nolan beautifully crafts this genius story with the use of sound elements throughout the movie and fantastically choreographed scenes nolans lack of cgi use also amazes me
Jul 28 2023,positive,this movie is absolutely spectacular first of all to understand the context of the movie you have to have somewhat of an understanding in physics mathematics world relations etc i feel like being older should be required just to simply understand what is going on at all times in the movie past that the visual production writing music sound production basically everything were extremely high quality the pace of the movie starts out slower but picks up as it goes on and creates more excitement overall i went through a wide range of emotions watching this movie and i enjoyed it so much it is definitely worth watching many times
Jul 28 2023,positive,im not gonna lie i fell asleep for a little while its too long and the second half is only people talking so i got lost between all those names and characters well it was a great film kinda boring but in a good way in a oscarwinningmovie way
Jul 28 2023,positive,what a movie i didnt expect it to be that good  cilian murphy deserves an oscar
Jul 28 2023,positive,nolan doesnt keep his ego in check and goes almost an hour over what the oppenheimer length should be nolans cinematography saves the movie from absolute failure
Jul 28 2023,positive,topflight acting imaginative storytelling getting inside the head of the characters
Jul 28 2023,positive,a cinematic master piece murphy is simply superb  best actor winner robert downey jr best supporting actor the story is told very well and the ensemble cast is definitively unique and well cast go see this film
Jul 28 2023,positive,amazing movie definitely one of the best films ive ever seen i really want to see it again
Jul 28 2023,positive,what a oscar worthy performance by cillian murphy rdjr and emily blunt nolan should polished his acceptance speech for best director and best picture
Jul 28 2023,negative,i was really excited to see this movie especially because i lived in japan for a few years and have been to nagasaki   it was not worth the hype it could have been condensed to 2 hours easily   i kept waiting for the movie to get going and then it was over   all it was was really loud i found oppenheimer to be spineless and very disappointing
Jul 28 2023,positive,the best movie that i see in 2023 must win all the oscars
Jul 28 2023,positive,masterpiece a docudramatic film experience of history
Jul 28 2023,positive,and my wife didnt even fall asleep i might have for 5 minutes
Jul 28 2023,positive,the words excellent and masterpiece come to mind
Jul 28 2023,positive,overlong and at times boring political drama with an exciting build to the famous frightening events
Jul 28 2023,negative,slow boring good cast but could have been a 45 minute movie murphy mumbles for half the movie and couldnt understand him most of the movie repeated dialogue for the last hourfirst hour and actual bomb story was 25 minutes with absolutely no action mission impossible was miles better and even indiana jones was better dont understand the great reviews dont waste 35 hours of your time and money
Jul 28 2023,positive,long yes but every scene is well deserved the acting cinematography directing and music is amazing do i wish it showed more of the actual bomb yes but i understand why nolan didnt show the bomb more because its a movie about oppenheimer not the bomb nolan is an expert in weaving back and forth between different times then bringing it all together in the end
Jul 28 2023,positive,absolutely loved the movie the only movie that i have watched that i am going to watch it again
Jul 28 2023,negative,this movie was an hour and a half longer than it needed to be and still managed to accomplish almost nothing it was like sitting in a college lecture where the teacher is reading a wikipedia page
Jul 28 2023,neutral,the r rating took away from the story
Jul 28 2023,positive,an incredibly well done story of the father of the atomic bomb an electrifying score by ludwig gorannson and tremendous acting done by a well selected and talented cast cillian murphy delivers one of if not the best acting performances of the 2020s a one of a kind experience that is a must see in imax to truly see the scale of a film directed by the always terrific christopher nolan
Jul 28 2023,positive,gritty and tough to digest but sensational you can see a fantastic cinematographic upgrade from nolans previous works where the acting the pacing and the scenes convey to make of oppenheimer a mustsee to everyone as consistent as cillian murphy is on portraying dark but captivating characters its not surprising he puts on a clinic but we cannot look overlook the longplayed performances of rdj damon and blunt and the short but well versed appearances of florence pugh rami malek and gary oldman
Jul 28 2023,positive,incredible with 70mm
Jul 28 2023,positive,honestly one of the best movies i have ever seen ive seen it twice now and it gets better
Jul 28 2023,positive,3 hours of peak cinema nolans greatest work yet
Jul 28 2023,positive,while the visuals in the movie are great when the explosion and other action scenes happen i would say about 8090 of the movie is bureaucratic and very boring at times
Jul 28 2023,positive,wow intense three hours movie be warned that it can be loud and has a couple nude sex scenes
Jul 28 2023,positive,a film where you leave the theatre and look around differently it really makes you think about how something this extraordinary is true and happened
Jul 28 2023,positive,it was a masterpiece the beginning to the end had me in absolute shock i got so so quiet because i couldnt even express myself
Jul 28 2023,positive,the only drawback is it is long the movie is top notch and what a cast
Jul 28 2023,positive,its a good movie and its worth your buck that being said its a commitment and i think nolan bit off a bit more than he could chew here the framing devices go a long way to stretch the enormity of the subject matter from one edge of the screen to the other but the stress lines show in the score and the casting and the tired portrayal of a onenote tortured genius     as an example during the buildup to the trinity test bomb you see the anxiety well portrayed on the faces of the characters as a countdown proceeds music swelling and shots getting tighter on the characters faces afraid of the potentially world annihilating moment that is about to happen well done but as an audience member this overload of sound  goes on for too long becomes almost painful and then the moment happens and it is not the moment it is the start of a 20 minute countdown very funny mrnolan you got me but it was not fun it was not enjoyable and the gravity of what you are talking about is not respected you want us to respect the enormity of this creation yet you use levity at these moments like we are dimwits you give very little respect to those actually annihilated by the contraption or whatever euphemism you used while painting a simplistic portrait of the nommeduquestierr     the portrayal of the test was incredible though i have only scene archival footage in black and white that does not capture the reality when i saw the world become an unavoidable wall of flame that encompasses everything i saw my darkest dreams rushing at me i dont know if it is good to portray such things that inspire such nightmares but you did it well    the score was awesome but it felt at times like a crutch its too loud i was thankful when silence came during the film not because it informed the scene but i can finally evacuate myself     in conclusion i liked your film mister nolan but i have some major nitpicks that i would be less than happy to discuss with you i could carry on but the baby needs changing much like your film i feel
Jul 28 2023,neutral,felt like a 3 hour long trailer the use of sound was not well thought out building up suspense during random scenes with talking in a room did not work in its favor and this was done constantly i am become death was said too many times which ruined its meaning if you want to watch oppenheimer the documentary is much more enlightening and entertaining without over the top theatrics
Jul 28 2023,positive,i loved it i think it will be a real oscar contender the bad its a little too long
Jul 28 2023,positive,nice tone a little slow and long worth watching dont need to see again 
Jul 28 2023,positive,i did the barbenheimer weekend and this by far was the better film great acting and practical effects this movie is for the adults and barbie is for the woke gen z crowd that wouldnt know history unless it involves tik tok and being an entitled and privileged unemployed wuss oppenheimer is going to clean up at the academy awards
Jul 28 2023,positive,5 stars no bs i loved it
Jul 28 2023,positive,some scenes were a bit slow but entertaining
Jul 28 2023,negative,it was just okay too long too boring
Jul 28 2023,positive,amazing collection of actors very powerful movie loved it 
Jul 28 2023,positive,brilliance the score the social and moral dilemmas the sets the emotion
Jul 28 2023,positive,i did not feel that the movie was entertaining as such but i really felt it was brilliantly directed produced and acted  from researching it was without doubt a very credible and accurate version based on biographical and historical details available  i would recommend seeing this movie  one thing that really helped in understanding the movie was recognizing that the black and white parts of the movie were seen through the perspective of the role that robert downey jrs part whereas the color through predominantly the role of j robert oppenheimer  you can make your own decision about how you feel about the movie but i enjoyed it and will see it again and will definitely purchase it when it is released generally to the public  my only criticism is that i did not feel that the sex scenes really added to the story and to me detracted from the movie otherwise it was incredible
Jul 28 2023,negative,very slow felt like a 6 hour movie not well done at all skip it
Jul 28 2023,positive,oppenheimer is a very good movie starring cillian murphy as robert j oppenheimer the father of the atomic bomb the film is rated r for nudity and sexual themes so many women are walking out of the theater for what they perceive to be patriarchal oppression though that part didnt personally bother me christopher nolan couldve deleted those scenes to get a pg13 rating so the film couldve grossed more money anyway oppenheimers runtime is 3 hours 15 minutes    now i really think oppenheimer would be difficult for nonamerican audiences to fully appreciate and nonnative englishspeaking audiences to catch all the dialogue the film is very dialogue heavy and the beat in the background is loud enough that youll have to strain your ears the film in general is difficult to fully grasp because of the huge cast of characters and the fractured narrative of the script lots of times the film is in black and white nolan is also fixated on the historicity of the script such as when a general said i dont want to drop the bomb on kyoto because of its huge cultural significance and because my wife and i honeymooned there or when oppenheimer said now that weve finished our work at los alamos i plan to give the land back to the indians anyone not familiar with the history of the manhattan project would probably miss those lines of reallife lore    what really impressed me was how the film was basically broken up into three parts the first part was about oppenheimers personal and academic life and how he theorized the atom bomb thanks to albert einsteins work in the field the second part was when the general matt damon built a town in the new mexico desert at los alamos so oppenheimer could make and test the bomb the third part was about the government interrogation of oppenheimers ties to communism and the bad guy named strauss robert downey jr who wanted to be appointed to a presidential cabinet position and gain bureaucratic powers setting oppenheimer up for failure thus the movies themes and subplots wove together like an elegant tapestry my only problem is that the film is so dialogue heavy you cant lose focus for a single scene cillian murphy who i enjoyed as thomas shelby from peaky blinders stole the show
Jul 28 2023,positive,amazzing sound actors e and history
Jul 28 2023,positive,3 hours was a little to long but story is great
Jul 28 2023,positive,id probably give it 5 stars if i had managed to hear more of what they said unfortunately with the classic nolan audio i only managed to catch roughly 70 of the conversation   still a masterpiece though even if i had hoped to see more about them making the bomb
Jul 28 2023,positive,nolan delivers an immersive and captivating biopic that is thought provoking and fascinating
Jul 28 2023,positive,i have become death the destroyer of worlds  line which comes from the hindu sacred text bhagavadgita    oppenheimer is without a doubt a masterpiece and more so in imax it may not be the kind of cinema that appeals to the masses but its cinema for people like me  the cinematography the soundtrack the dialogue the performances i cant choose between cillian murphys performance robert downey jrs matt damons emily blunts even tom contis performance as albert einstein who despite being so fleeting is a real treat and i would have wanted him to be on screen more if this film doesnt sweep the oscars it would be a real injustice but we already know that currently in hollywood and the academy there is an epidemic of mentally retarded people who put aside quality and now measure a film by its level of inclusivity  the imax room was packed they had to delay the movie because of the line to buy food i think everyone was getting ready to applaud at the end but the last sentence that oppenheimer says to albert einstein had an impact effect transforming the final reaction into collective terror and stopped the ovation  sublime
Jul 28 2023,positive,very educational an easy to follow
Jul 28 2023,positive,finally a movie for adults  and one that will stick with you long after the three hours on the screen
Jul 28 2023,positive,brilliant and beautiful very documentaryoriented rather than focusing on the atomic bomb dialogue plot and story was very well written and kept me wanting more by the end of the 3rd hour mark
Jul 28 2023,positive,honestly for years i viewed many movies there were no movies like oppenheimer it was amazing enough to blow my mind with imax visuals and sounds i read the american prometheus in the past the film was so superb true story about famous scientists who worked on project y christopher nolan did an outstanding job along with the actors the bottom line i do not doubt that they will get an oscar award next year
Jul 28 2023,positive,the picture of the year
Jul 28 2023,positive,superb i dont know what else to say
Jul 28 2023,positive,oppenheimer was amazing and the score worked its way through my bones see it in imax
Jul 28 2023,neutral,theres not a single moment without background score except for the bomb explosion it always bothers me when a film requires background music for everything even quiet conversations that nothing is good enough to survive without musical support  also bleach bypassing imax seems a real waste  why use a lab process that increases grain and reduces contract ratio on the highest resolution film medium available it all feels pretty one note style over substance dry given nolans limitless resources it should be much more rounded i didnt care about anyone or even really get to know anyone including oppenheimer overall really disappointing and all the glowing reviews to me feel like everyone has drunk the kool aid the emperor has no clothes not sure how much im influenced by having read the biography its based on dr george miller used to say that a film should feel like a great piece of music with highs lows quiet crescendos pacing this feels like one very long chorus and not a great one at that
Jul 28 2023,positive,cillian murphy is a god supporting cast gives fantastic performances all around so fast paced doesnt feel like 3hrs
Jul 27 2023,negative,the worse sound design ever there is nothing neither creative nor original in constant overwhelming music on the background that undervalues the plot and all the dialogues and to take such an important and such a horrible event in a human history as creation of a nuclear weapon and to turn in into a squabble between a politician and a scientist is just an offense to tragedy of hiroshima and nagasaki but even as a political drama the film is boring and confusing i wish i watched it with a remote control  i would skip 23 of it for sure but sound design  its just brutal on your ears
Jul 27 2023,positive,one of the best movies ive seen all year
Jul 27 2023,positive,cillians intensity is mind blowing nolans screenplay  directing is literally out of this world all of the supporting cast are truly incredible but downey wins oscar for supporting actor editing oscar for jennifer lame for deftly integrating this masterpiece
Jul 27 2023,positive,such a masterpiece really powerful movie on a topic i previously knew little about christopher nolan has done it again
Jul 27 2023,positive,christopher nolans newest film in an imax cinemas last night would highly recommend if youre interested in the history of oppenheimer as this is more a documentary than a movie which is expected because its based on a true story
Jul 27 2023,positive,rocket science needed to understand the particulars and to appreciate the politics and underhandedness of the investigators  couldnt keep up with the pace of this  ive forgotten now  was oppie a harmless pinko or a superwellmeaning communist hung on saving the world from his own inventiveness   and what was with einsteins hat blowing off in every one of his scenes 
Jul 27 2023,positive,a masterpiece of a film i watched in imax today and am now buying the book the film is based on because the film is just 1010
Jul 27 2023,positive,this movie was astounding everyone was on their a game the non linear story format kept me drawn in and riveted the acting score cinematography editing was perfection this is a movie for the adults in the room
Jul 27 2023,positive,this is by far the movie ive ever watched in a cinema just an amazing experience
Jul 27 2023,positive,one of the best movies ive ever seen the raw intensity of the visual design and sound designs left me flabbergasted that mixed with nolans masterclass and an incredible ensemble of actors made this movie
Jul 27 2023,positive,one of the best nolan films in terms of pacing and performances  saw it in imax 1570mm at amc lincolnsquare  loved this movie ive already seen it twice
Jul 27 2023,negative,very boring after all the hype it was so disappointing the first hour all i wanted to do was go home and kick myself for wasting my time
Jul 27 2023,positive,too long and not all that compelling
Jul 27 2023,positive,this movie was excellent at no point did it feel to draw on and be too long like some other 3 hour films it was a very intelligent and interesting story that needed to be told
Jul 27 2023,positive,amazing film  one of the best ive seen acting was impeccable from all the cast and the story was told amazingly
Jul 27 2023,positive,there is no action so it seems real long very loud sometimes must keep attention closely to understand how it all went down back then
Jul 27 2023,positive,great cinematography wonderful acting
Jul 27 2023,positive,this film is brilliant  i usually would go into an indepth review for a cinematic masterpiece as this will eventually be of that stature but when reading a long and erudite review of a film one tends to disjoint themselves from the actual film  instead of a thriving and creating a thwarting unit as a whole  the reviewer seems to dissect the film and add too many nuances that should be determined by the viewer  and loses the initial blast of selfrealization as you watch the story unfold  all i really want to say at this point i have viewed it three times already as i tend to return and explore different facets of the cinematic art work is that the old adage of no good deed goes unpunished and for every genius in our mortal world there will be a denier  in this case  the horrific huac that did more than just eradicate truths in their trials to flesh out socalled communists but destroyed lives and careers  if one really seeks to find out more about the huac please read relevant works written at the time of those mccarthy trials such as the crucible by arthur miller it was not about salem  but the witch hunts of the huac  also see high noon the film where a man stands alone to fight off his determined killers while the townspeople he helped now hide away and offer no support  yes oppenheimer had to stand alone and deal with the distrust after he literally saved this nation  only a true human can bear up to the real forces of evil  this is a must see and possibly see again to understand the real impact of this tortured soul and those who assume that he needs to be tortured by them  do not miss this film especially the performance of robert downey jr as straussboth he and cillian murphy are beyond stellar thank you christopher nolan for making this film in a world of cgis action heroes and comic book filmsthis is the real cinematic experience
Jul 27 2023,positive,first two hoursriveting last hourzzzzzzz
Jul 27 2023,negative,just a weird movie it feels like a 3hour trailer
Jul 27 2023,positive,a persons credibility is on the line yet explores the phantasm between ones genius and character highly recommend left me chilled with its final scene and what it could mean
Jul 27 2023,positive,incredible performances all around phenomenal writing that never had a dull moment the score was well executed that masterfully paralleled the films tension hats off to nolan for bringing yet another masterpiece in this word for audiences to experience on the big screen
Jul 27 2023,negative,sorry but not a film buff just a genuine individual who very occasionally goes to the movies based on professional verbal reviews made by the media  totally lost on me bored from start to finish couldnt wait for it to finish  im sure the acting was top quality with deep meaning  if you want to go and watch a load of blokes talking in a room this is the one for you
Jul 27 2023,neutral,if you dont love science and like history this movie is not for you having studied physics i did not have any problems keeping up that is the beginning of the movie    this movie could have been 1 hour shorter i would have mainly missed the sexnudity scenes and the cheatingif i had taken a nap     the ending was really good     just know the whole movie is a recreation of the nuclear board and senate hearings can be very dull at times     and i loved einstein in the moviethe end was priceless 
Jul 27 2023,positive,absolutely amazing historically accurate minus the use of the wrong american flag the film was beautiful directed the storytelling was magical magnificent i highly recommend it
Jul 27 2023,positive,really great movie christopher nolans best work by far   it also got nearly everything about j robert oppenheimer and the making of the atomic bomb correct
Jul 27 2023,positive,some of the best sound design
Jul 27 2023,positive,christopher nolans greatest film bar none a must watch for anyone whether you know anything about oppenheimer the person or not
Jul 27 2023,positive,i didnt know how many christopher nolan movies i actually liked memento insomnia newer ones like dark knight    thats why i was very excited about this one the excitement died a little when oppenheimer began and 30mins in my first thought about the movie was sorkin could have written this better     was it a good script meh exposition much i get it hes adapting a monstrous book but he is no sorkin to adapt a story like this     the directing was perfection however not his best dark knight had much better directing     great acting great cinematography     still theres something about the film overall i can fully love yet ill give it another chance soon
Jul 27 2023,negative,this movie jumped around too much the sound was very loud to the point of distortion and im talking the background music not the explosion the sex scene and nude seen seamed out of place i saw parents take their kids to see this movie i felt the film makers tried to fill this movie with artsy nonsense instead of telling the story of oppenheimer
Jul 27 2023,positive,saw it in imax digital  awesome
Jul 27 2023,positive,thought provoking casting was superb the amount of close ups were a little much for me  robert downey jr and emily blunt had some great moments if you like history and are open minded to hearing all sides of an issue  a great ride
Jul 27 2023,positive,this movie is something everyone should seeit is one of those movies that leaves something in you after you watch ityou will be questioning a lot of things but in a good way1010 recommend
Jul 27 2023,positive,dialogue heavy strong emphasis placed on each characters doesnt feel like a 3 hour movie nolan doesnt miss
Jul 27 2023,positive,this felt like a true cinematic experience every actor gave it their all and it shows in the end result this movie was masterfully made and touched on more than just history but also drama and horror cillian murphy gave the performance of a lifetime and robert downey jr and emily blunt are the perfect supporting actors i cannot recommend seeing this movie enough
Jul 27 2023,positive,i adore christopher nolan and everything he makes  but unfortunately this one like tenet before it  feels like he tried to pack too much into the runtime and i got lost in the shuffle a lot there were a number of times id find characters having a conversation about another character by name and id be sitting there think who was that what was their role and then theyd show a clip of that person and sometimes i didnt even recognize their face  but even when i did id struggle to remember where they slotted in    its visually amazing artistic as hell and the acting is superb  but had it been a 5 hour miniseries instead of a 3hour movie i think it could have been easier to follow and thus more enjoyable but still very much worth seeing
Jul 27 2023,positive,just wow  amazing movie as i never saw something like that
Jul 27 2023,positive,too much explicit nudity not necessarily at all in the movie
Jul 27 2023,positive,it is without a doubt one of the greatest experiences ive ever had in a theatre
Jul 27 2023,positive,dont have to be a scientist to enjoy but since i am i loved it  1010 soundtrack
Jul 27 2023,positive,due to its nature oppenheimer may not become one of nolans best films its slowburn storytelling and relatively less action might play a role in that nevertheless the tale it tells focuses on historys most crucial invention that jeopardizes our existence nolan crafts a narrative by dividing the story into three parts keeping the excitement alive the film is an enthralling journey that includes notable figures like einstein and enrico fermi although not entirely factual the films message particularly conveyed through president harry truman illustrates what nolan intends to portray thank you nolan
Jul 27 2023,positive,much too long nonstop 3 hrs of dialogue and too many flashbacks music not suitable and too loud for a drama
Jul 27 2023,positive,first half was a slow painfully at times buildup for the second half the dialogue and the sequencing was difficult to make out at times however does provide some thought provoking moments between war morality and politics best seen if you have a bit background knowledge about physicswarbombshistory
Jul 27 2023,positive,loved it in awe at cillians transformative performance just incredible everyone is at the top of their game here the breakneck pacing makes it fly by in the best way
Jul 27 2023,negative,boring movie  almost everything was procedural things not any action and barely any personal life
Jul 27 2023,positive,super intresting movie very good very worth a watch
Jul 27 2023,positive,cillian murphy is one of the greatest actors ive seen rdj as a bad guy was some of his best work i cannot recommend this movie enough
Jul 27 2023,neutral,i just went to an imax dome cinema with 4k laser projection to see this and i have to say that theater was an amazing work of art and science that i would still not recommend to almost anyone i know at least not without perfect seats and not for a long film sadly thats also a perfect simile to the movie i saw on the screen i know thats a hot take to say amidst the buzz about this movie all the trailers and featurettes leading up to release were great and i dont deny after watching the film that it is a masterpiece of montage and cinematography it had good dialogue and an excellent cast who gave their best effort in every scene the production design was flawless and there were some very engaging scenes so you might think that perhaps the theater experience influenced my perception of the film but i was told to see it on the biggest screen possible even though at some point the size of a screen becomes somewhat impractical not unlike the runtime of this movie im not saying it didnt make me feel things im not saying it wasnt an artistic chievement it didnt even feel quite as long as it was but it was still long it felt long and because of that and in large part because of the editing style i just didnt much enjoy it it was an unnecessary ordeal to sit through like emily blunt said its more of an experience than a film it didnt tell a story so much as it conveyed a vibe through a rapid fire series of short nonlinear events and the same point could have been made in much less time or in a slightly more linear and less confusing fashion i left that cinema feverish from heat from a projector and 500 people building up over the extended time in the cinema bleary eyed from a screen encapsulating my field of view for 3 hours and with a severe migraine from the breakneck pacing and constant time jumps probably one every few minutes on average florence pughs acting talents were wasted instead spending most of her very limited screen time naked and frowning in deeply unsettling somewhat perverse and fundamentally aromantic sex scenes the rest of the film was mostly just as cold and heady and heartless the dialogue was often nearly drowned out by sound design which has been common of nolan in recent years i only even knew what was happening because i already had a lot of context on the story of oppenheimer and the bomb ill consider seeing it on a smaller screen and maybe my opinions will shift some but i cant imagine ever rating it as more than a 7510 even with a better viewing experience but its 94 fresh on rotten tomatoes half of hollywood starred in it all giving their blessings one of the greatest filmmakers of our time had complete control over this film i hear you saying to which i say i knowthats why im considering it
Jul 27 2023,positive,great movie interesting story kept me interested
Jul 27 2023,positive,outstanding movie outstanding cast academy award contender for sure amazing history lesson
Jul 27 2023,positive,this movie was absolutely amazing the imax was spectacular and nolan really delivers here all the performances were amazing with standouts being cillian murphy and robert downey jr this movie is a must see
Jul 27 2023,positive,so much information so little time
Jul 27 2023,positive,a masterpiece nolans magnum opus a reminder that cinema is not dead and still thriving 70mm imax brought the film to life stunning cinematography score acting and diaglouge
Jul 27 2023,negative,boring af   storyline is like jacks jumping beands explosion was not worth it movie was too long
Jul 27 2023,positive,this movie is a work of art like no other but you have to go in with the right expectations dont expect action dont expect the whole movie to be about the abomb and dont expect the movie to be sappy and emotional the movie is about j robert oppenheimer not the bomb if you go in with the wrong expectations this movie will be mediocre and boring    first i have to note that the pacing is quite fast even with the 3 hour runtime you need to be able to keep up with it or you will lose track of the stuff going on do not turn your brain off and enjoy it you need to think think about what all of the characters are doing why theyre doing it look into their eyes and at their face and get into their head especially oppenheimer     most of the emotion in this movie is through expressions and undertones not ultra sappy scenes or dialogue and the actors do an amazing job at conveying all of it to truly understand the emotion in this movie you need to dig deep into the layers of every scene    additionally the use of bw film really brings out the true colors of every scene with strauss it adds so much to the film and puts a line between strauss and oppenheimer as people from the beginning of the movie with a younger oppenheimer to the amazing end of the movie you can feel everything oppenheimer and company is thinking and feeling    overall the movie does a superb job at telling oppenheimers story i dont expect everyone to rate this movie a 55 as i am a bit of a history and physics nerd but you should recognize the masterpiece it is
Jul 27 2023,positive,oppenheimer is a movie  as i see it  divided  up into 3 parts  the personal life of the man but centering mostly around his womanizing as later  remarked in the movie and his 2 most serious relationships     the 2nd part which is the development   and detonation of the bomb  and the 3rd part  which comes off as a heavily dramatic court scene in persecuting poppy as he is nicknamed for possible breaches of loyalty  to america and worst with possible ties to the  support of communism and the soviet union  which if any of these accusations were true would of course have grave consequences as the us would not want to get in an arms race  with any other country much less the soviet union  as a matter of fact the truman administration  who has become so panicky and paranoid of the possibility that they will  pull out the proverbial microscope for finding the  very remotest partical of danming evidence to  virtually clobber oppenheimer into submission     the second and third parts of this movie   were extraordinarily entertaining and informing  and the acting was i thought was par excellance    incidentally cillian murphy is one of my favorite actors and it was as much of him that  i came to see the movie as it was opoenheimer    and i make mention of this because if anyone  would enthusiactingly wade out this first part i would be on that list    its not that i dont like romance sequences   and movies  the movies  notebook the object of my affection were great movies   and cloie with amanda siefred liam nieson  and julianne moore is among my alltime favorite  but with the movie oppenheimer i came to see a movie    about oppenheimer  what inspired this guy to achieve what he accomplished   the obstacles he faced and how he overcame them what motivated him to commit to the drive he chose  i wanted to learn as much about him as possible      but instead i had to be dragged through  about an hour of romantic drudgery  that incidentally wasnt really so far different from other relationships in the real world  if this  had a direct bearing or influence on his work it  would have been more forgiving  but as it turned out that wasnt the case  at least not  significantly so    i suppose about 15 to 20 minutes or so  i would have found to be more palatable  i mean a synopsis of his relationship misgivings  would allow me to say   i get it    so there you have it  i wanted to espouse  alot about the 3rd part of this movie  regarding  the courtlike security meeting which came off to me as a mccarthy era  salem witchhunt inquisitional mindset that the board couldnt  obsessionally get off to save their own lives  it was very simply abigdoabout nothing  they came off to me as the gang of fools  propagating just a bunch of sillyness and nonsense  they were the mudrakers clear and simple trying to nitpick someone and his great  accomplishment of saving the live of thousands  of allied military lives simply out of a delusional  sense of crossing the trivia line and for that they were out to castigate this poor man to no end  oppy seemed to sit helplessly at one end of the room mentally crippled with the affliction  of not only developing a bomb that killed thousands of japanese lives but creating something that could devastate the world as well  it was almost like he was in catatonic freezei wanted to jump through the screen and say  enough already how dare you  and give them a piece of my mind and say you people will be responsible for what happens to the world now      not oppenheimer    to end this review let me please quote from the renown psychologist murray banks its not lifes blows that destroy   its what you do in face of the blow                                               review by                                                         doug obujen
Jul 27 2023,positive,a must see in theaters
Jul 27 2023,negative,story line was good but why must there be two nude seems movie could have been made without them i am passing the word that this movie is not worth it
Jul 27 2023,positive,the movie sketches a clear character of oppenheimer as well as the complexities of the choices he faces the movie does not tell you whether oppenheimer made the correct choices but instead shows you all his flaws all his mistakes and also his successes so that you may judge for yourself
Jul 27 2023,positive,everything about this movie was awesome and so well done
Jul 27 2023,negative,sound was awful could hardly hear anything wish i knew this wasnt a movie to see with family because there are multiple nude scenes also pacing was slow and the man sitting beside me fell asleep halfway
Jul 27 2023,positive,found the movie disappointing and far from a masterpiece as others consider it nolan makes the main character dull and repetitive and not much of an antihero the movie is more about how oppenheimer was treated after the bomb and not nearly enough about the bomb itself which was the most puzzling part  it was like 80 people talking in a small room in a hearing also how do you do such a shitty job of the trinity explosion and not show the bombs dropping on hiroshima and nagasaki the only standout thing for me was rdjs performance
Jul 27 2023,negative,this film while beautifully orchestrated and constructed had no business being as long and dry as it did

Jul 27 2023,negative,only science student has to go there  such a boring movie  we all are sleeping in movie time  dont waste money in theatres wait and watch online  only science student has understand it  thankuou
Jul 27 2023,negative,left early sound quality is awful most of the time the actors are drowned out by a warbling tone movie looked great and paced really well im sure the storyline is excellent im in my 30s with excellent hearing ability the sound quality was just terrible
Jul 27 2023,positive,i thought the acting the story telling was absolutely superb
Jul 27 2023,positive,riveting  a masterful performance by not just cillian murphy but by all  murphy is key to the movies perfection revealing so many emotions and sides of j robert oppenheimer  the direction and editing deserves special acclimation as well  i saw in in standard projection first then in imax  imax was notably better because it brings one into the movie and the sound is improved
Jul 27 2023,positive,youll see lots of nolan in the movie great casting acting and use of sound even for a long movie you cant stop watching science cant be separated from politics and human relations will determine what end is science use for the story of the development of the atomic bomb shows how a brilliant human creation turned into a weapon of mass destruction it starts with the development of science of innovation and seeking advancement power becomes aware of this and politics come into play what use should you give to the advancement of science the development or the end of humanity oppenheimers trial provides the political view of the development of the atomic bomb and provides a film with the encompassing view of the world science and power
Jul 27 2023,positive,astonishing and thoughtprovoking this film left me in awe after 3 hours i needed another 3 hours of reflection simply to process its profound impact     cillian murphy showed out and i expected nothing less   the relatable protagonist grapples with eternitylong consequences navigating betrayal while upholding a deeprooted desire to safeguard his family his jewish culture and nation a universal and relatable sentiment they made the creation of the atomic bomb an understandable and at times admirable mission   we must create the bomb before the nazis do  wow       though the scientific jargon was overwhelming and i was over it at times  the explanation of splitting atoms gravity and light carried power and came with breathtaking imagery  the musical score elevated the experience to extraordinary heights while the stellar cast made the film     cillian emily florence and robert you deserve nothing less than a standing ovation i would throw roses at your feet for the art you delivered to the screen
Jul 27 2023,positive,if movie have language
Jul 27 2023,positive,it was a long movie but kept me engaged didnt leave the theater for a moment every actor and actress was so well cast cant wait to watch it again at home so i can pause it and do some research during the movie
Jul 27 2023,negative,oppenheimer    or how to make an atomic bomb movie bomb    movies about famous scientists are difficult     the most obvious problem is that most people dont understand science and many are actively hostile remembering those numbing lectures in school and being forced to memorize things like the periodic table     thats why hollywood mostly avoided movies about science and gave people something easier  science fiction in scifi you dont have to understand anything you just have to see it the explanation of warp speed is the visual of the enterprise zooming away into the distance    when hollywood has tackled bios about scientists it has concentrated on the personal story a la the imitation game the formula for this kind of movie dates back to the story of louis pasteur 1936 the scientist struggles to get people to understand how amazing his discovery is and spends most of the movie in sisyphusmode struggling to push that boulder his discovery up the hill and into the light    chris nolans oppenheimer takes a different path fractured and polychromatic he tries to immerse the viewer in the inner world of j robert oppenheimer the father of the atomic bomb while three hours long the movie provides information on its subject in small packets  oppenheimer the student at cambridge clumsily failing to perform an experiment in a lab is punished by his teacher and in revenge he prepares a poison apple for his teacher   oppenheimer meeting a young woman at a party taking her to bed and reading sanskrit poetry to her as they have sex  oppenheimer riding a horse in the wild countryside of new mexico  oppenheimer giving a physics lecture in german after learning the language in only six weeks    after the first hour of this fractured story the movie settles down to tell two interwoven main stories  the making of the first atomic bomb and the government hearing to strip oppenheimer of his security clearance nine years later    the centerpiece of the first story is trinity the name oppenheimer gave to the test of the first atomic bomb exploded on earth nolan attempts to make the audience experience the event by showing us the bomb explode in silence as its first viewers did since light travels faster than sound then the sound thunders through the theater and finally we see the blast knock down people two miles from the explosion its the best sequence in the movie    most of the characters in the movie are mere names  einstein bohr lawrence truman that is because nolan doesnt care about characters  just as in his previous movie dunkirk nolan has little interest in the humans in this story see my review of dunkirk here cilian murphy plays the title character with the same wideeyed semisurprised look throughout the movie while it was universally agreed that oppenheimer was one of the most charming of men and had affairs with many women you would never know it by this performance yes nolan has someone say that he was a womanizer but why people both men and women adored him is never shown nolan makes the audience experience the first atomic bomb but nothing of the personality of his title character    the other main character is lewis strauss pronounced straws played by robert downey jr strauss was a very complicated man  financial wizard adviser to four presidents philanthropist original member of the atomic energy commission and a man who was one of the few in government trying to allow more jews into the us during the nazi reign yet in oppenheimer nolan portrays him as a simple villain a foil to the title characters goodhearted innocence the source of strauss hatred of oppenheimer according to nolan is a foolish misunderstanding really while this may even be true it is a slim thread to hold up a three hour movie about americas most controversial scientist and the beginning of the atomic age you dont end hamlet with the revelation that he was wrong all along and claudius didnt kill his father mere misunderstandings do not make for great drama    the other characters are more like line drawings some with great makeup emily blunt is the drunken bitter wife of oppenheimer florence pugh is his unbalanced sexy mistress matt damon is the tough no nonsense general in charge of the project lots of others are there for a scene or two mere dots on a ten foot pointillist painting of dread and despair     stories like this one  about huge important figures and events are better served by the new medium of limited series television told over several one or two hour episodes characters and events can be given the time and depth needed to tell such monumental stories in fact tv has already done that with oppenheimer a 1980 bbc masterpiece theatre seven part series with sam waterson as opeenhimer did a much better job in telling the story  with none of the pyrotechnics of modern movies     if oppenheimer turns out to be a box office success it will have more to do with the lack of current movies appealing to adult sensibilities than its own merits hollywood is desperate for great movies that are also big hits i wish i could like this movie  i too would like to see a great movie thats a great hit too
Jul 27 2023,neutral,i get the feeling this is going to be a lonely review but it just didnt do it for me     for starters i am simply done with the justplainbad ways that nolan always seems to be mixing his audio hes been making his own dialogue indecipherable as a result since that early teaser of the dark knight rises and hes done it yet again here having to endure this for three hours in an imax theater felt like a sonic assault that literally left me shaking and not in the good way    in terms of plot i dont really know why this was the way it was it rushed along in the beginning jumped around randomly and seemed eager to check off as many historical fact boxes as possible before giving us a courtroom procedural with an entirely unnecessary and outofplace visual metaphor and youll definitely know it when you see it and caps things off with a quick reminder at the end that nuclear missiles are really bad    ultimately it all just felt over baked    theres some good here and that audio i disparaged earlier does in fact work to effect during the  yknow  nuke parts loved damon in this and some other cameos but id say this is one to watch at home
Jul 27 2023,positive,parts of history i never knew all of it was portrayed very well and was informative the actorsactresses did an exceptional job  i would even see it again as it moved so fast there were details i know id be able to ponder better seeing it the second time
Jul 27 2023,positive,masterpiece oscar for cillian murphy and rdjr
Jul 27 2023,positive,it ws pretty boring highly over rated not better than the 1989 fat man and little boy movie which you should see
Jul 27 2023,positive,very good and with good performances
Jul 27 2023,positive,a well crafted and engaging biopic of a complex person that reminded me of citizen kane
Jul 27 2023,positive,this was such a quick 3 hours and it was fascinating to watch the build up was intense and had me catching my breathe a few times i thought the black and white and color scenes helped differentiate the povs and the timeline albert einstein is awesome     the acting is awesome you forget that theyre reading a script and you just fall in love with every scene that educates while also telling a detailed story it was a quick 3 hours and i left wanting more a true test if a movie was good is if you think about it multiple times the day of and after questioning scenes and reliving the experience   heartbreak feels good in a place like this no sorry nicole but i do think my imax experience for oppenheimer was the best ive felt since avengers endgame
Jul 27 2023,positive,absolute perfection of a film amazing wellwritten script focused on betrayal and the horrors of nuclearscale war impressive cinematography and a captivating score which grips you throughout the whole movie especially the climatic scenes although personally it could have done with less interrogation scenes the whole film was presented in an impressively gripping pace considering the depth of the story is condensed in 3 hours all in all this masterpiece is surely to leave you speechless after the final scene expected nothing less from the directorial genius that is christopher nolan
Jul 27 2023,positive,this is a great new perspective on the movie christopher nolan is a masterful director and this movie once again proves that is a fact cillian murphy has you completely convinced that he is oppenheimer and leaves you wondering
Jul 27 2023,positive,incredible is the best way to rate this film  from direction from the written story the performances of murphy downey and the rest of the cast nominations for oscars will be all over this film  it draws you in places you the audience into a the world that oppenheimer needs to save yet creates an instrument that could ultimately destroy it  three hours in length goes by quickly in telling the story  you walk out of the theater with a feeling of awe and respect yet mad as hell what this man went through what this man attained and what this man went through in the end  great movie
Jul 27 2023,positive,sometimes the movie version of a book is a total disappoint  this is not the case here  i found it suspenseful even though the outcome is well known  i found the story riveting and well told  kudos to christopher nolan the entire cast and everyone involved in the making of this film  i hope theyre well rewarded at oscar season
Jul 27 2023,negative,a loooooooot of talking and very little to no action my date apologized for picking this movie and confessed she thought of leaving with me midway through the movie great actors but it was nothing short of a soup opera i was over the talking after the first 2 hours could have gotten to the point in about 20 minutes
Jul 27 2023,positive,great acting and some awesome visualssound but overall the movie was too long with very few climaticcaptivating scenes 
Jul 27 2023,positive,surely one of the best movies ever made i learned so much the performances were incredible i just could have done without the nudityit really did nothing to advance the plot
Jul 27 2023,negative,a movie about how awful a bomb is that killed millions of japanese but not got a japanese person in
Jul 27 2023,positive,a cinematic marvel and a treat for our eyes after a long time a movie worth watching in theaters
Jul 27 2023,positive,this movie was amazing everyone working on this showed amazing levels of genius to make a movie this gripping that is essentially a 3 hour retelling of a historical figures life
Jul 27 2023,neutral,it was exactly what i expected to see everything about this movie is done to perfection it was visually stunning the writing was beautiful the effects were mind blowing and the acting was impeccable everything was so good that nothing stood out i cannot quote anything from this movie or tell you about any one scene  except for the bomb going off if you want to watch it then do so but if youre on the fence about it or don want to then dont waste your time its going to win a million oscars
Jul 27 2023,positive,incredible performances and somehow the best direction and writing from christopher nolan yet even considering some of his extensive resume the focus on the small story influencing the larger concepts and making the feeling of this intimate and arresting was an amazing turn for the writerdirector my biggest issue with his most recent work tenet was it didnt have much emanation to me oppenheimer swings the total opposite direction of that and hits home in many different fronts murphy and rdj gave some of their best performances ever also it was fantastic in imax
Jul 27 2023,positive,a sensational accomplishment in cinema every moment of this movie builds towards something deeper with cillian murphy locking up the academy award for best actor by the time the bomb goes off the closing hour of this film is one of the truly great hours ive seen as a movie watcher a mustsee for all who love cinema
Jul 27 2023,negative,christopher nolan is my all time favorite director but sadly this was my least favorite film of his to date it felt like a series of quick tik tok videos flung together  and while i usually prefer nonlinear story telling this was just too scattered and confusing made tenet seem pretty straightforward by comparison the film looked great and downey and damon were terrific other than that it was a spastic slog for me 
Jul 27 2023,positive,very fastpaced in a good way constantly keeping your attention on the screen very entertaining for a historical piece
Jul 27 2023,negative,damn i waited all year for this movie to come out i was saying to myself finally hollywood  is giving us a real movie i wasnt expecting it to have any sort of action i was anticipating it to be very cerebral and documental but it was neither it was more about politics and petty feuds
Jul 27 2023,positive,this was a very will done movie  if you know nothing about oppenheimer you will learn a lot  the performances were top notch and it had some very memorable scenes  however the 3 hour run time did feel a bit long i feel they could have cut about 20 minutes and it would have been an even better movie
Jul 27 2023,positive,loved it acting and writing were terrific saw it on an imax screen as far as im concerned thats the only way to do it
Jul 27 2023,positive,gorgeous cinematography and an open take on the life of a scientist i went in expecting the movie to be more about the bomb but it was just as the title suggests about the life and career of oppenheimer i enjoyed the honesty of it worth the 3 hours watch
Jul 27 2023,positive,absolutely incredible movie and one i know i will come back to time a time again a total masterpiece
Jul 27 2023,negative,i think christopher noland needs to take a step back and refresh his approach to storytelling its great to be unorthodox and come up with new ways of dressing up a narrative or story arch but this was not one of his best executions     for me the first 20 minutes of the film were a string of incoherent blasts of color and noise without context the context came in the final half of the film and reflecting on the opening sequence just left me feeling like it was a wasted portion of time i could see someone recutting the film and removing the first 30 minutes to an hour of the film and keep only a couple scenes and it would be a far better story on screen    i heard noland went all in on the trinity test reenactment and the footage they got was indistinguishable from that used in any number of films from the 70s and 80     the drama aspects were honestly pretty good just a shame they kept getting interrupted by bright lights and turning every scene of consequence to whiteout     acting and delivery by everyone was good the lines that they were delivering were okay the last half of the movie had great sequences and lines while the first half was honestly cringe     its got flashy lights to keep the audience looking at the screen and its got naked ladies in it so its going to do okay i probably will click next if it comes up in my movie binge feed in 10 years
Jul 27 2023,positive,great movie but i left feeling like i didnt get enough explosions and overall destruction  i went home and watched youtube videos of the actual bomb test but overall well written great cinematography and an enjoyable movie experience
Jul 27 2023,positive,everything was great but the sex scenes were not good it just seemed off it had no meaning to the movie at all only if you count that they had to tell you the sx scenes because there was an interrogation and they had to see who told the russian everything about the bomb but other than that the sex scenes seemed off
Jul 27 2023,positive,it was a very dense film with lots of names and conversations to keep track of and i really enjoyed it while learning things at the same time definitely going to see it again
Jul 27 2023,positive,i though the first 34 was brilliant the actors did a fine job and the story was interesting however in the last 14 of the movie i felt pummelled by the noise that the director felt might give the copious dialogue more punch to keep us interested that didnt work for me
Jul 27 2023,positive,great movie i absolutely love the time it takes for the plot to build up to the climax enjoyed the whole thing however if you are more of an extreme action movie fan then dont go in expecting them to be dropping a bomb every 10 minutes its about oppenheimer not the bomb
Jul 27 2023,positive,amazing visuals music audio set cast and beautifully told story the way only christopher nolan can do
Jul 27 2023,positive,i couldnt understand the dialogue over the soundtrack which was much to loud the actors mumbled a lot plus the accents made it more difficult i was lost a lot of the time i hated the rumble seats and the volume of the sound in general i will have to wait for netflix to understand what was going on as ill use the close captioning     are there theaters that dont have the excessive volume sigh
Jul 27 2023,positive,might be one of the best movies ive ever seen great acting compelling story
Jul 27 2023,positive,i know nolan chose not to show anything of the actual destruction of 200000 japanese people and their cities i guess to me that choice seemed like a copout it could have been very powerful to see that juxtaposed with the rara of the american flag waving to gloss over the terrible destruction seemed lame to me also can we just admit it was way too long cillian murphy is a genius and should get the oscar no question but who cares about that dumb trial
Jul 27 2023,negative,very boring no character connection at all the story telling was done very poorly it could have been much much better you really cant bond with the main character and you dont really know who he really is it kind of seemed rushed in the beginning as well
Jul 27 2023,negative,dialogue diction and sound was difficult to understand a very long and tedious film
Jul 27 2023,positive,the cast storyline film and sound were out of this world cant wait to watch it again
Jul 27 2023,positive,a shoe in for best picture best actor best supporting actor best director an extraordinarily perfect film
Jul 27 2023,positive,if you dont see this movie in imax youre doing yourself a disservice  the run time is a bit lengthy but overall it is a must see  riveting and astounding
Jul 27 2023,positive,something was lacking female characters felt shoehorned in for the sake of it without a real and deep story line first 23rd i enjoyed final 13rd was and hour that could have been 15 minutes droned on and was really flat
Jul 27 2023,negative,horribly dull the womens plot lines were weak at best and far too long for nothing very interesting
Jul 27 2023,positive,a haunting movie with a starstudded cast a soundtrack that magnifies each moment of emotion and action and a visually stunning depiction of an eerie story about human motivation bit long though
Jul 27 2023,positive,an amazing film nolan has done it again
Jul 27 2023,positive,this is cinematic masterpiece of christopher nolan the magnum opus that we all deserved cillian murphy gives career defining performanceman his eyes  its horrifying at some moments in a very very good way the music by ludwig g√∂ransson is absolutely gut wrenching although it feels a bit lengthy and the dialogues are a bit too fast at time which maybe a problem for few people nevertheless this is chriss best work for me and it deserves all the praises in the world also rdj is phenomenal and also all the supporting cast absolutely gut wrenching tense movie 
Jul 27 2023,negative,was longing for another movie from christopher nolan i thought it would be another breakthrough after tenet but turned out  it was just 3 hours of disappointment
Jul 27 2023,positive,always been a fan of christopher nolan and waiting for this one just a one word review of this film is outstandingthe biography had given me immense pleasure with the deep performance from cillian murphywith a huge star cast theres a chance to fall but nolan has successfully made this movie as his career bestmost probably rdj and cillian murphy both are going to be nominated for oscarsthe screenplay isnt for everyone while the first half was a little bit slow for the sake of the story developmentit showcases oppenheimers early life howeverthe second half of the movie was nail biting and absolutely outstandingtwo things i should mention about this movie which made the movie outstandingone has to be the osti thought not bringing hans zimmer was suicidal but ludwig was at his best and the second thing is cinematographyi just loved those scenes where they showcased oppenheimers trauma scenesthey were absolutely mindblowingi would say watch it on theater its a must watch
Jul 27 2023,positive,the best oppenheimer film of the year
Jul 27 2023,negative,the good  i saw it at imax and the sound system was amazing  there are scenes apocalyptic in nature and the sound system delivered the experience  this was the best part of going and seeing the movie in a theatre  there was several scenes where the cinematic creativity and camera usage was very good  the bad   the scenes jump around and there isnt any real character development its like watching preview after preview you never connect with the main character  the story is complicated and best told in a documentary style and having said that they dont succeed in telling this story well  there are so many details and characters and because they jump around you are always struggling to keep up  the only reason i understood what was going on is that im currently  reading the book einstein  the explosion of the first bomb doesnt seem to be the size of a nuclear bomb  i was actually thinking that the nuke part of the blast had failed then everyone is cheering and only then you realize that it was a success  very anticlimactic in my opinion  there is nudity and it does nothing for the movie just grutuitous  if youre there with your wife its embarrassing  overall the hype doesnt deliver  this is a movie best watched at home where you can rewind and fast forward though your surround sound should be up to the task to get the best effect
Jul 27 2023,neutral,tldr a workman like ron howard could have made this i thought i was going to a nolan film    because i loved dunkirk i had been expecting something similarly epic in scale but also tight and narratively cohesive this sprawled like an uncontrolled reaction i expected big visuals because of the suggestion to see it on imax but aside from a few panoramas and the swift explosion it was mostly guys in rooms     i was expecting interesting visuals like the school buses of dark knight the small town dystopia of interstellar or the halflit halfdestroyed buildings of dunkirk instead we got cheesy 1980s nova type representations of nuclei and the occasional globe on fire that reminded me of the climate change visuals that it is no doubt riffing on these were as lame as the disappointing black hole from interstellar in an rrated film oppenheimers bomb hallucinations could have been way more frightening if they were meant to be emotionally meaningful    as a cold war baby i should have been terrified rather than bored by this film i was in my 30s when i first saw an icbm in a museum and it seriously scared me we do get a very brief clip of an icbm but even stock or archival footage could have been used to evoke the genuine terror of nuclear war just show us the daisy ad or bert the turtle if you cant come up with better the younguns wont have seen them    there are a million great stories from los alamos left untouched here cut down the endless strauss subplot and give us more of that wonderful weirdo feynman as the senate aide said maybe einstein and oppenheimer were talking about something more important
Jul 27 2023,positive,the film has an overall very good balance between incredibly tense moments and few slower more melachonic momenes the political discussions can get a bit conusing at times because it is told in very small steps and the victims of the attacks on hiroshima and nagasaki dont get acknowledged nearly enough
Jul 27 2023,positive,good historical film but long film and could have been cut to two hours long starting with oppenheimers collage life and how he then moved to the us to discover the atomic bomb in a race against the nazis 
Jul 27 2023,neutral,well acted and i was certainly interested in the subject matter but about an hour too long with too many characters introduced throughout with extended stretches of dialogue interrupted by a loud sound to wake you up
Jul 27 2023,positive,technically brilliant and expertly crafted oppenheimer is also a dialogueheavy behemoth of a political drama with a monstrous runtime
Jul 27 2023,positive,instead of the titties and sex i would have rather the movie delve deeper into his life during the aftermath of the bombs or his political beliefs
Jul 27 2023,negative,boring just a biography that was absolutely not advertised as one the trailer that was shown in theaters was stunning and gave me the impression that this movie would be an interesting story about the development of the atomic bomb and the challenges and moral dilemma that the scientists faced i didnt have much knowledge of the details of the manhattan project so when they showed that they built a village in the middle of nowhere to make the scientists build the bomb i immediately imagined all the different scenarios that could happen maybe a scientist tries to escape because he doesnt want to build a weapon of mass destruction anymore maybe theres a spy maybe something goes terribly wrong i sort of imagined a thrilling story about the beginning of the cold war instead its a 100 accurate retelling of oppenheimers life and its 110 only about him and only from his perspective this is the movie where they just tell and dont show they mentioned some incidents in their village but never show them they also barely show how they built the bomb the process the dangers the challenges nothing its also so terribly paced it jumps from present to future so quickly that its hard to even conceive what is happening and when all the characters are barely introduced to the viewer they just appear out of nowhere it feels like you are expected to have already watched a full documentary about oppenheimer before even watching this movie they made good job showing the emotions of oppenheimer though and i liked how realistically it was shown how he spaced out and thought about the damage he has done while he conducted his speech after the bombs were used that and the development and testing of the bomb were the peak of the movie and also only 13 of it the first third of the movie is all about his life prior to the manhattan project and the last third is all about strauss accusing oppenheimer of being a soviet spy interesting right seriously if i wouldve been watching this movie alone i would walk out before finishing the last third of the movie
Jul 27 2023,positive,a deep and vast storyline which covers not just the man but also the relationships he had his friends colleagues family lovers bosses all interconnected between the creation of the atomic bomb the burgeoning arms rate and the literal paranoia of communism ideals in america it brings forward intellectual topics such as the effects of political movements in the classroom the scientists moral dilemma when it comes to nuclear weapons the compromise people have to make when it comes to doing things for your country and many others     christopher nolan uses clever cinematography to help you feel the torture taking place inside oppenheimers head at times quite intense but it gets the point across that this man is deeply troubled at the way the gadget has been handled    it is also a story of power and how the power of nations politicians the military and even the scientists themselves can wield it with devastating affect    there are no heroes to this story not even oppenheimer himself the story reveals him to be a bright flawed man with a love of quantum physics thrust into arguably the most important event in the 20th century    i saw it on an imax screen and i would recommend everyone doing the same
Jul 27 2023,negative,poor casting except lead weak plot special effects kind of simplistic not good in imax  mostly 3 hour dialog played way too loud
Jul 27 2023,positive,incroyable du christopher nolan pur
Jul 27 2023,positive,everything about this movie was amazing from the acting to the script to the audio however the atomic explosion the movie builds up to was a let down preferred if it was bigger
Jul 27 2023,positive,very good some parts of the story could have been left out so it didnt have to be so long but honestly prevails as usual and the bad guy didnt go unnoticed
Jul 27 2023,positive,amazing cinematography amazing acting
Jul 27 2023,positive,great film amazing acting  plotted well
Jul 27 2023,positive,experienced the movie at mall of georgia imax in 1570 on opening weekend movie was delayed an hour but thankfully no issues once it begun notice that i said i experienced this film i dreamt of this movie after watching it the sound the immersion i really dont know what else to say other than if you can see it in 1570 it is worth it watch it in the best theater you are able to sound design is top notch and i plan on seeing the movie at least 2 more times at lesser imax everyones performance was superb and this really is nolans best
Jul 27 2023,positive,a truly masterful display of nolans storytelling which is only elevated by some of the best performances of the year from murphy and downey oppenheimer manages to keep audiences on the edges of there seat the entire film despite the runtime of 3 hours oppenheimer tells the story of the most brilliant men whos tortured by his own creations lasting effect oppenheimer is complimented by a fantastic score composed by ludwig g√∂ransson     if you plan on seeing just one movie this year in theaters make it oppenheimer
Jul 27 2023,positive,for me its not my favorite nolan film in terms of instant awe that would be interstellar or was interstellar i watched that many times and am now sick of it but over time i think oppenheimer will endure as the movie i could return to in 20 years and watch again with no qualms unlike interstellar nolans best achievement here is in setting a subtle mood and bringing the intensity with the subject matter itself rather than toying with too much subjectivity and abstraction    i had no real issue with the length i was engaged in the content  the editing felt a little off i would have preferred it to be a little more cohesive in moving from scene to scene it wasnt the time scaping just that i was pulled out of the experience a little with so many different scenes to clip through and with not enough glue to bond the scenes together if that makes sense but thats a style choice really in the end  its a biographic after all    the acting is superb unlike other more negative critiques on the heart of the movie i was surprised at the human element from the performances and even though i think i would have disliked oppenheimer as as person and am unconvinced he deserves such positive spin put on his role at los alamos overall i could still sympathise with him emily blunt and cillian murphy were standouts for me all the performances were great i was surprised at how i liked hartnetts character  the cast selection for fermi heisenberg and einstein etc were great i felt that they made a genuine effort to pick actors that could not only act but looked like the physicists they portrayed just as with the lead role  a masterful stroke by nolan rdj was very good but i feel a lot of praise for him is unfiltered by how he benefitted from the black  white scenes it really was a nice tool to put him in a unique context a nice touch    the sex scenes for me felt as if intended to illustrate in an obscure manner a metaphor for oppenheimer getting into bed with communism as well as the relationship itself it was a little too obscure for me but i get it the musical score is beautiful and not overused for me as others have suggested i thought the abandonment of special effects completely was unwarranted in only one scene  the atomic weapon scene would have only needed a minute tops of an overlay of special effects on top of a practical explosion and would have added to the overall experience so over 3 hours it was missing maybe 1 minute of special effects instead of zero but that was never the main draw for me in the first place     the sound design overall was great in spite of others having minor qualms with it it was a little muted in the heavy weather scene for example but this worked masterfully for me you couldnt quite here exactly what was said and why should you    oppenheimer is a triumph overall due to its subtle biographic nature spectacle storytelling and lack of over the top effects and distortions it has practically infinite rewatch potential     had to take off half a star  needed an extra minute for editing glue could have lost an extra minute for the sex scenes needed a bit more gloss for the visuals of the explosion but these are minor things for me overall    ps you dont need imax for this thats not how i saw it movie buffs are movie buffs and will tell you otherwise the movie has solid fundamentals direction sound visuals score and performances and editing almost the leads portrayal as well as emotion conveyed in breathing posture and facial expressions dont demand the sweat pore and follicle closeup others claim great movies dont need such a crutch 1080p or even 720p would still captivate you
Jul 27 2023,positive,this movie was a masterpiece as always with christopher nolan movie you can get lost in the intricacies of the timeline jumps and the many characters across those but the quality of the acting and the historical accuracy are of the highest tier it is a rarity to see a combination of historical accuracy and entertaining plot lines i cannot wait to watch it again
Jul 27 2023,positive,music and sounds were too loud
Jul 27 2023,positive,it is nolans best film besides the dark knight the movie juxtaposes three timelines two timelines from j robert oppenheimers cillian murphy perspective color sequences and one timeline from lewis strausss robert downey jr perspective black  white sequences this film is not just a realistic biography of j robert oppenheimer it expresses oppenheimers inner feelings and conflicts visually  auditorily and even though its a 3hour dialoguedriven movie its breathtaking with its nonlinear storytelling fastpaced editing ludwig g√∂ranssons masterful score and excellent performances i hope cillian murphy gets an oscar for his performance   review by ahmed naga
Jul 27 2023,positive,a cinematic masterpiece nolans best work to date and oh god the soundtrack transported me to another dimension must see
Jul 27 2023,positive,im so glad that this was so good there were maybe too much stuff for one movie feeled little bit rushed in some points still very good movie
Jul 27 2023,positive,wow just wow    the pacing was incredible i was extremely worried there would be lulls and it would feel drawn out being a 3hr long film but nolan captivated me for the full duration    the tension that builds throughout the film really gives the viewer a thrill    going into the film i had assumed the test explosion would be the climax of the film however the political and moral themes came through as a much more tense battle in the latter half of the film seeing so many conflicting views and moral dillemas it turns into one of the best trials i have personally witnessed on film    it was so well directed and told i immediately went into researching the historical accuracy of the political side of the film and to my surprise and absolute delight i found that it was accurate to a degree of which i was blown away    watching this in imax is an absolute must not even because of the visual experience but the audio experience is just mind blowingly incredible nolan uses sounds from the explosions to highlight and build tension around the true climactic internal battles dr oppenheimer faces and the first time this happened i thought ah no its gonna be overused but when i grasped how intentional he was with this to exaggerate certain moments i was utterly impressed      i feel as if though this review is a bit of a ramble i just have so many thoughts and praises about this masterpiece absolutely incredible
Jul 27 2023,positive,i like history and what better history to see 
Jul 27 2023,positive,superb acting by the entire cast and visually beautiful scene after scene this movie had me on the edge of my seat and the audio and special effects wo the entire production is a
Jul 27 2023,positive,no time to blink something is happening all the time a bit confusing if you dont know the story and not focus all the time and one of the best experiences in a movie
Jul 27 2023,positive,one of the best movies i have ever seen in a theater all on this smells like oscar  i simply love the way how oppenheimer gets you involved in the world war 2 an all the tension of the run to the atomic bomb   another christopher nolan masterclass but very different from the above because the story of the movie is completely real the way nolan play between the past on a colorful scenes and the futurepresent in a non live darkness screens is genius  of course take of my hat to the best cillian murphy unbelievable performance he doesnt need to talk to talk with the public   best movie and best actor for the oscar for sure at least
Jul 27 2023,positive,a movie that leaves you still thinking long after leaving the cinema  a mix of history human failings bound by talent loyalty ego eccentricity selfish desire and control politics v science v human trials
Jul 27 2023,positive,i am of two minds about oppenheimer  on one level i was transfixed  on another level i was totally pissed and wanted to kill whomever did the sound  the soundtrack was way too omnipresent too loud and they needed to turn the bass down  though not a physicist i know enough about the science that i wanted to and could have followed the dialogue  my friend pat and another woman in the bathroom made the same comment  i needed subtitles  i opined at the end to the two guys next to us  pat thought the problem particularly muddy sound was the old as she put it 70mm imax theater we were in apparently the largest screen in california at the metreon in sf  the two guys said no thats christopher nolan  he does that  tenant was like that  i didnt see that one but did see the prestige interstellar and dunkirk and i dont remember that problem  the other problem was that we were way too close and low in row d and had to strain our necks by keeping looking up because the seats did not recline  we plan to test pats hypothesis by seeing it again at just a regular cinema in suburban pleasant hill and the seats recline
Jul 27 2023,positive,flawless story line and amazing sound effects just want to critise a bit at the end it seems like nolan starts the conversation on discussing how the society would treat oppenheimer and what kind of humanities showed underline however this interesting and meaningful conversation did not go deep and i felt lile there is a sudden end
Jul 27 2023,positive,awesome cast powerful music great biopic  best to see this movie in imax theaters
Jul 27 2023,positive,the structure of this film is amazing i am not a history buff but the film did a good job not making me lost one in a life time experience
Jul 27 2023,positive,amazing soundtrack and acting i had chills for the whole 3 hours
Jul 27 2023,positive,wow i dont know what to write so it will be brief breathtaking in every way a mustsee on the big screen excellent acting great shots superb sets and practical effects sounds effects and soundtrack complex detailed dialog driven multilayered story but sadly after explosion of trinity excellent the movie becomes tedious and loses both dramatic and moral focus
Jul 27 2023,negative,confusing monotonous with no one to like the film felt long and overly ponderous
Jul 27 2023,positive,i could watch cilian murphy stare at the camera for ever he had a montgomery clift vibe that i appreciate   very interesting story main themes of ethics and life decisions in the front of a historical event   loved the cast in whole except maybe for josh peck who was the most random choice for that role   although it was 3 hours long it passed quite smoothly
Jul 27 2023,positive,bang up my street an intense character study of a variety of intense people people talk about best actor oscar but for me its the writers and the screenplay every character is allowed to reveal themselves for who they are and of course the never ending battle for ultimate power leaves you sad about who we share our planet with
Jul 27 2023,positive,christopher nolan is the best storyteller in the world cillian murphy and rdj both delivered an oscarwinning performance amazing cast with spectacular script to me is the best nolan movie
Jul 27 2023,positive,this is a great movie even at 3 hours  it does get a little confusing because there are so many people in so many different stages of oppenheimers life  i read the book first so it was easier to understand  its a very powerful movie  i highly recommend it and the book
Jul 27 2023,positive,an extraordinary film
Jul 27 2023,positive,confusing at points the movie seemed a bit too long but was a cool historic film
Jul 27 2023,positive,just a spectacular and spine chilling movie to be honest they way the story was told and the acting from the top notch actors were just amazing one of the scene surely felt like a horrific experience but then deep down then best movie of all time  note this movie is mostly for the ppl who have an interest in physics and other aspects if u looking for a action or anything else such as comedy or blockbusterish this movie is not for you   but would give it a 1110
Jul 27 2023,positive,a nolan masterpiece  superb acting from the entire cast absolute must see
Jul 27 2023,positive,very intense and strong movie  fills in the gaps that history class didnt teach us especially about oppenheimers communist ties and how he was almost blackballed after the war  the movie was long but well worth it
Jul 27 2023,positive,oppenheimer will go down as one the greatest films of all time instead of relying on heavy action and special effects nolan instead tells the story of a mans moral struggle and when the special effects are needed he once again changes our perception of whats possible in one of the greatest sequences you will ever see
Jul 27 2023,positive,an absolute masterpiece and necessary for the education of the world he recommend this movie in any language in anywhere
Jul 27 2023,positive,the sacramento california imax was a huge disappointment i know the current style is to blast movies because dialog does not matter however it is impossible to determine if we couldnt make out the dialog because of the distortion of extra loud volume or because the soundtrack was nolans typical booming style or both the acting is fabulous but the characterization of oppenheimer papered over his spiritual explorations he was no angel but nolans screenplay does not show what must have been key moments in oppenheimers trajectory the r scenes are a distraction it would have been enough to know that he was unfaithful i do like the way nolan demonstrates oppenheimers naivete someone who does not know details of this story will absolutely not follow what is going on at many points it was not necessary or valuable to jumble the timeline as the story is quite detailed and understanding that detail is crucial we do not see how oppie put together the team for the manhattan project i think nolan is a great director but this film has been over praised as someone who saw the original production of in the matter of j robert oppenheimer on broadway in 69 and has watched several miniseries this film should have done much more this film could have been as important as citizen kane could have been
Jul 27 2023,positive,one of the greates movies ive seen in a long time christopher nolan has outdone himself with this movie  everything felt so real and was explained pretty well along with the storie so the viewer knows whats going on the cast was a great choice we can see that even with characters like rami malek and emily blunt with a small supporter roll that just overshadows some of the main cast  it was overwhelming and a must see
Jul 27 2023,neutral,ummm did i miss something here a strange film with three uncohesive acts mostly loads its eponymous character with listliss dialogue only to be interrupted with gimmicky jumpcuts of constellations firebombs nudity etc ludwig g√∂ranssons obnoxious musical intrusions during the third act also indicate that the overly long interrogation scene is going bust hey audience  this is serious stuff oppenheimers about to lose his security clearance i was waiting for spike lees double dolly shot to be dragged out at one point to be fair when the testing of the bomb kicks in during the second act the film takes off with an apollo 13 style race against the clock tempo unfortunately that is short lived and really not the films main focus simply put nolans portrait of oppenheimer the man just isnt that interesting as his impact quite a feat when that man is the father of the abomb
Jul 27 2023,negative,holy shit is this terrible boring and very poorly put together literally gave zero shits about any of the characters couldnt tell you the names of any of them so many pointless scenes just awful will never watch a second of this again
Jul 27 2023,positive,i think the movie was a masterpiece but it was too long in my opinion some parts were a bit boring like the trial at the end but overall with the cinematography effects and great actors this movie was amazing
Jul 27 2023,positive,amazing with the combination of incredible acting shots music and sound design i got full body chills like 3 times
Jul 27 2023,positive,the 3 hours went by quickly id like to see it again to watch some of the characters better since it wasnt all in logical order
Jul 27 2023,positive,the way the man plays into who has the biggest ego and power no matter of humanitys extinction distressing from beginning to end cillian murphy ate the film deserves an oscar emily blunt swept as a supporting actress deserves an oscar and robert downey jr shone as antagonist deserves an oscar if with barbie i came out crying with oppenheimer i came out with a lot of tension and anxiety both have similarities despite having different stories and generes in both films dissociates strongly
Jul 27 2023,positive,highly recommended especially if you can see it in imax it was amazing
Jul 27 2023,positive,cillian murphy was born to play this role  definitely go see the all star cast great historical piece well told and wonderfully acted   no spoiler but will say read up just a bit on oppenheimers life story to help bring some of the movie facets out  the history of the bomb and his creator are something worthy of school teaching  leave the slavery is good garbage out of class and put actual science in the classroom
Jul 27 2023,positive,movie is out of the question but the thing is that the selection of cast was very good seeing robert downerly jr doing a role never done by him before in any of his movie and with everything he has got made me feel the tension
Jul 27 2023,positive,i really really enjoyed this wellwritten and acted not to mention the cinematography was stunning didnt feel bored at all in the 3 hours i need to rewatch to catch all the details my only criticism is that a few more wellplaced scenes with rami maleks character were needed in the movie to give more context about who he was and how he was able to gather the conviction and evidence to defend oppenheimer
Jul 27 2023,positive,honestly just a well delivered masterclass to the cast to the plot to everything
Jul 27 2023,positive,excellent drama but no way is it necessary to see this in imax 99 drama with one scene of the bomb going off and it was mostly silent im glad i didnt waste my time trying to find an imax viewing i went on a sunday afternoon to a regular screen and it was just great sounded great too and i wasnt crammed in like a sardine in a half filled theater
Jul 27 2023,positive,i had to rewatch first time i saw it i thought it was convoluted with ludwig g√∂ransson and the sound design as its saving grace still felt the same on my rewatch even on imax although with a better understanding of its dense jargonheavy storyline better worship of the sound design and g√∂ransson ultimately cemented his oscar nod and his name in my core memory    this is more of a me problem oppenheimer in itself is a great filmmaking achievement with an ensemble so sublime from minor to lead roles and two scenes that made me want to scream i love cinema    this ken after all still needs subtitles
Jul 27 2023,positive,amazing movie one of the best this year
Jul 27 2023,positive,brilliantly made as usual everything was perfect watched this movie two times i was that much impressed i dont remember watching a movie more than once in theaters
Jul 27 2023,negative,couldnt have been more disappointed this should have been a great story with great actors but it was confusing trying to keep up with the characters and the plot was plodding in our theater the sound track was so loud that it was actually very uncomfortable throughout the movie the movie dragged to over 3 hours i dont understand the great reviews of this save your money
Jul 27 2023,positive,amazing job showing the history of the actual event rdj and cillian murphy were  phenomenal if you dont like history this may not be the movie for you
Jul 27 2023,positive,cillian murphy has an epic performance and pulls the audience in to the mind of a tormented genius the casting is amazing robert downey does an epic job as well matt damon has a career high and emily blunt was fabulous as well the music the emotions and the way that it is filmed makes it a masterpiece i would suggest everyone watch it even just for the historical peek a boo of a war driven time that none of us ever knew well worth seeing and the three hours although long worth it
Jul 27 2023,positive,decent movie gratuitous sexual scenes that didnt need to be there according to history books when the bomb exploded there were people who cried were solemn and some who celebrated wasnt portrayed well in the movie some scenes of hiroshima or nagasaki or the pilots reaction enola gay would have helped
Jul 27 2023,positive,by far christopher nolans best film to date right up there with amadeus and schindlers list as one of the best biopics of all time
Jul 27 2023,positive,a very well done movie gr√©√¢t acting and gr√©√¢t director
Jul 27 2023,positive,oppenheimer is a phenomenal film and that goes without saying every acting performance is superb the score is masterful the direction is outstanding everything in this movie is top notch the script set design sound editing everything as everyone knows by now this movie tells the story of robert oppenheimers story on his path to creating the atomic bomb all the way to his life after creating it something we unexpectedly follow is lewis strauss journey to ripping apart oppenheimers credibility and reputation i dont even want to explain too much of the plot because this is a movie you should go see and then see again cillian murphy deserves an oscar for his performance from start to finish youre encapsulated in oppenheimers world mostly in due part to cillians performance its immersive however christopher nolans direction is also stupidly immersive his ability to make an atmosphere feel alive is special we cut to other points in time and feel the same atmosphere or were immersed into a completely new atmosphere in a split second either way its a stunning feeling whenever youre able to feel that way about a film nolan may bring home best director for this film and itd be wholeheartedly deserved robert downey jr gives a great performance maybe not as oscar worthy as people are suggesting but its a strong performance that really comes together in the end of the movie when the charade is up and we see how many strings hes pulled and why hes pulled them matt damon is fine which fine for matt damon is going to be a great performance not as strong as his role in air earlier this year or even in another long screen time supporting actor role like the departed but again its a fine performance emily blunt may have to win an oscar too her back and forth with jason clarkes roger robb hot damn one of the best scenes in the film also jason clarke what a performance his ability to memorize these long sentences with fancy lingo and badger away at people whether it be robert kitty edward and so on and to make it all feel so real wow rami malek is given one monologue in this movie and thats it but man does he leave a lasting impact josh hartnett gives the best performance of his career dane dehaan gives a sleeper performance as nichols however the one performance that has stuck with me the most alden ehrenreich he mightve gave my favourite performance of anything ive watched this year as we come into the movie hes a naive aide chomping at the bit to assist strauss in anyway by the end hes a hardened soul whos putting strauss in his place him and downey play off each other brilliantly i could talk all day about the performances but i wont i just want to give josh peck tom conti gary oldman benny safdie and florence pugh their flowers for also leaving a lasting impact on me with their performances okay lets talk score ludwig g√∂ransson knocks it out of the fing park he has his second oscar on the way his score is the driving engine of this film the touch that immerses you in this world from start to finish i havent seen a movie so well made and cared for like this movie in a long time overall you need to go see this film its an instant classic and cultural phenomenon itll be a cornerstone of modern filmmaking and already may be go see this damn film
Jul 27 2023,positive,wow i am definitely recommending this movie to many 20 of what we think we know  80 of plot suspense fantastic cinematography acting pulling of emotions story telling so much more the movie didnt feel like 3 hrs either which means so much considering how long it had to keep an audience engaged the entire time i was very pleased with this movie i will be watching again
Jul 27 2023,negative,5 stars youve got to be kidding theres no way boring and way too long
Jul 27 2023,negative,if you have read the making of the atomic bomb by pulitzerprize winner richard rhodes or day of trinity by lansing lamont the movie is just a basic retelling of part of the story of those times and people  it never really got interesting for me  well except the naked lady  she was cute
Jul 27 2023,positive,im a student of the oppenheimer story  it was lacking in important facts details and events that would have made it more interesting  also im getting tired of these writers and directors jumping around in the story as much as they do these days  i take intelligent people to movies with me to movies like this and still have to explain many things to them after the movie  they get lost in the back and forth
Jul 27 2023,positive,the plot was incredible top performance by emily blunt and cillian murphy the score was the icing on the cake thrilling see in theaters if you can
Jul 27 2023,positive,eye candy ear candy stunning and smart
Jul 27 2023,positive,moved pretty fast for 3 hourshard to understand in places but great story
Jul 27 2023,positive,great movie could have probably trimmed an hour in the editing room other than that solid flick
Jul 27 2023,positive,the most brilliant movie i have ever seen
Jul 27 2023,positive,i am quite biased as i have a personal connection to oppenheimer and christopher nolan is one of my favorite writersdirectors but this movie is a masterpiece there is good reason behind rdj saying that this is the best movie he has been in and cillian and matt have shared similar beliefs between the cinematography use of black and white and impeccable attention to detail and style this film seems to be the culmination of the last 25 years of cinematic evolution
Jul 27 2023,positive,interesting but starts off slow
Jul 27 2023,positive,im still trying to catch by breath  tense material heavy and cinematic ecstasy  nolan has set the standard high not only for his directing career but for the entire ensemble represented  plot points can become overload with everything happening at once still nolan has made a welldeserved play towards the oscars
Jul 27 2023,positive,98    what a movie cillian murphy kills it his facial expressions to his mannerisms are perfect at creating a character who is truly feeling confliction which i feel heavily attached to due to my future as an engineer with the potential to design things that can cause so much harm
Jul 27 2023,positive,dont wait to to see oppenheimer  you will be deeply moved challenged and changed a different person walks out of the theatre  seeing it once wont be enough  so get going   this film goes on the best films ever made list prepare to be dazzeled
Jul 27 2023,positive,its a great movie biography you have to be concentrated otherwise youll loose the track of the story my problem really goes to the script  it could have been summed up or the direction should have taken out some parts that end up being anecdotal
Jul 27 2023,positive,a very smart movie with moments of laughter didnt feel like i was watching a 3hr movie amazing acting throughout the film
Jul 27 2023,positive,one of the best movies ive seen in years a must watch
Jul 27 2023,positive,by a long stretch the most satisfying film of 2023 christopher nolan did not let me down at all with his latest piece of cinema cillian murphy played a wonderful oppenheimer matt damon was absolute perfection as ltd leslie groves tom contis role was also perfection for its limited screen presence the narrative while one of nolans meatiest and definitely requiring of a few rewatches flows so well that you can go with the gist of it even on initial viewing watching it in imax did not disappoint either the sound design was phenomenal the build up to the detonation kept me on the edge of my seat with the actual display and reactions hitting harder and more emotionally than one would expect and even the third act following the detonation was very compelling exceptional soundtrack exceptional cinematography exceptional casting exceptional acting especially exceptional direction for the most exceptional film i have seen this year nolan knows what hes doing in cinema right now please let him save it again
Jul 27 2023,positive,nolan is a great filmmaker i feel like many directors could have tried to make an oppenheimer movie but it would not be as gripping as this was the editing was a highlight if all historical movies were made with this much attention to the film making and not just then then i would be happy with that
Jul 27 2023,positive,the acting is seriously outofthisworld its some of the best performances in any movie ive ever seen murphy is a marvel only furthering my love for his talent rdj gives one of if not his best performance and basically every actor thats involved just gives a stellar performance    the score is absolutely beautiful at times it does drown out some dialogue but imo its not nearly as bad as in tenet the way the music builds up over multiple minutes at a time just keeps you on the edge of your seat    this movie is full of dialogue and exposition if you dont like this style of film i can easily see how youd be bored and disinterested however if you do like this style its the best of its kind the script is just fantastic    in classic nolan style its of course a nonlinear storyline not really difficult to follow though if you pay attention you shouldnt have a hard time knowing what happens when i love the contrast in storytelling between the incolor and the black and white scenes    i loved the build up for the actual highlight of the movie which was of course the trinity test maaaaan they did such a phenomenal job making it feel like it was a dire and heavy moment and then when it finally happens it wasnt what i was expecting but it was still stunning    just a heads up there are about 3 spearate scenes of sexnudity it doesnt add anything to the story and i dont think you need to have sex in a movie to make it good although i can admit that one of these scenes was trying to convey how emily blunts character was feeling so it kind of made sense    to me it felt like it was exactly 3 hrs didnt feel any longer or shorter
Jul 27 2023,positive,a great story great acting
Jul 27 2023,positive,i swear i couldnt blink during this movie
Jul 27 2023,positive,a lot to digest but worth every minute 
Jul 27 2023,negative,it was okay but long and mildly boring
Jul 27 2023,positive,it is on of the best movies i have seen in long time
Jul 27 2023,positive,a very well done historical biopic with multiple messages both intended and not while the horror of potential atomic war is a theme throughout and the use for revelation of personal beliefs for oppression blackmail is on full display the true warning of the lengths petty people will go to for power and prestige is also a major part
Jul 27 2023,positive,truly riveting oppenheimer is a great watch that pulls you back in time to experience history being made
Jul 27 2023,positive,every time josh hartnett appeared on screen i was whisked out of the movie kicking my feet and twirling my hair
Jul 27 2023,positive,oppenheimer is a masterpiece excellent direction by christopher nolan  the score gave me chill bumps   the performances from all the actors were impeccable watch it in imax  highly recommended
Jul 27 2023,positive,great movie very dramatic and very long but tells an incredibly powerful story of a very important person
Jul 27 2023,positive,the quality of this movie is above par the acting visuals and pace are as expected a beautifully filmed the story is fast paced and intense at times so it wont hurt to do a little research on the subject of the manhattan project and oppenheimer in order to make it easier to follow along before seeing this movie i recommend watching this movie in imax especially for the scenes leading up to the bomb test
Jul 27 2023,positive,felt like 3 different movies in one build up was great but the apex left a lot to be desired dont be afraid of some cgi cant recreate an atomic bomb with practical effects
Jul 27 2023,positive,best movie ever christopher nolan can take my virginity oh wait its already taken
Jul 27 2023,positive,a genuine masterclass that understands where cinematography needs to be heading its like a breath of fresh air that sets itself a part from all the cheap money grabing movies of these days
Jul 27 2023,positive,as a christopher nolan fan this is by far his best film yet went in to watch about a bomb but instead got an amazing history lesson that i didnt even know about the acting was phenomenal from every actoractress that was on set the music as always was amazing and to top it off the cinematography christopher nolan is the reason why i want to become a director and i hope one day i get to work with him he is a mastermind a genius and one of a kind
Jul 27 2023,positive,its perfect deserves the hype now definitely one of my top 3 movies of all time
Jul 27 2023,positive,very well done and compelling throughout the only negative i have to say is the nude scene was completely out of place
Jul 27 2023,positive,necessary informative and different christopher nolan did an amazing job this is a must watch know however that its not exactly a happy moviebut for good reasons
Jul 27 2023,positive,excellent story incredible acting and script we were engrossed for the entire movie the cinematography and musical score were superb and really added to the pace of the film and the storyline
Jul 27 2023,positive,totally riveting  cant believe i didnt look at my watch in a 3 hour movie
Jul 27 2023,positive,masterful film making i will definitely see this again bravo to all involved
Jul 27 2023,negative,a boring movie about politics in the 1940s i dont understand what all the hype is about the trailer is deliberately misleading 2 out of the 3 explosions in the movie war frustratingly anticlimatic i could literally make a bigger explosion with supplies from home depot do not pay extra money to see this movie in imax it is not worth it 
Jul 27 2023,positive,i honestly thought the movie was not your typical nolan cinema  the hype about seeing it in imax wasnt really a necessity  my advice is lower your expectations when it comes to the bomb drop because you will be disappointed over all the acting was phenomenal but the movie was a sleeper especially for a 3hr run time flick
Jul 27 2023,positive,oscar status acting by cillian murphy  robert downey jr  3 hours flew by  riveting film
Jul 27 2023,positive,an absolute treat from christopher nolen his best to date cillian murphey gave 100 justice to his role equally complimented by rdj as lewis strauss matt demon florence pugh and emily blunt are just fabulous a must watch on imax screens 
Jul 27 2023,positive,classic epic biopic that hits every note you would hope it would considering the subject matter
Jul 27 2023,positive,a masterpiece nothing else
Jul 27 2023,negative,this review may seem petty to most but in my opinion nolanheimer dropped a pornographic atomic bomb himself in the name of humanistic achievement  the scenes with nudity and sexual content did nothing to advance the plot and in my opinion were more shocking to the audience than to the characters in the movie itself   i went into this movie wanting to like it because of nolans reputation for quality movies and filmmaking however the inclusion of these scenes into the final cut or at all make me question nolan  pornography is the nuclear bomb of human sexuality and nolanheimer dropped it on an unsuspecting audience
Jul 27 2023,positive,fantastic loved every moment of it eye opening dramatic and fascinating
Jul 27 2023,positive,impressive cinematic construction a new gem on nolans resum√©
Jul 27 2023,positive,intense but great
Jul 27 2023,positive,i like the amount of details about oppenheimer the man he was part of history and he paid a huge price in terms of attacks and jealousy
Jul 27 2023,positive,an incredible multi dimensional experience
Jul 27 2023,positive,my major issue was the mixing the speaking was too quiet and fast maybe theaters need subtitles    nolan didnt stay on scenes for long enough for you to really orient yourself in the first half    i didnt feel ops post bomb misery enough wish there was more dumbing down of the science i didnt care about his original lover felt halfhearted  it was just too much crammed into one movie daunting subject to capture i understand    finally can we please stop the flashbacks and flashforwarding in films for a year or two it didnt help build up any emotion so that when we got to his hearings after 2 hours of movie i didnt really care about the outcome     too ambitious
Jul 27 2023,positive,found it tedious and overly long seems like a tv movie with special effects
Jul 27 2023,neutral,there were some great performances but overall this movie is one big pretentious yawn ill never see it againdont board the hype train like i did
Jul 27 2023,positive,incredible movie  every actorcharacter is oscar worthy  read up on the story to follow names s little better
Jul 27 2023,positive,this movie was great everything about it from the bomb scene to robert downey jrs scenes and basically everything else were perfection the only critiques i had were sometimes the music was louder than the dialogue and the florence pugh and cilian murphy scenes got a little out of hand especially during the deposition sequence but everything else was practically perfect
Jul 27 2023,positive,its such a great historical movie and a great performances from the cast crew
Jul 27 2023,positive,simply just go see it
Jul 27 2023,positive,best biopic ever not usually a fan of the genre but this movie transcends that genre
Jul 27 2023,positive,christopher nolan is the greatest writerdirector of our time  he is not only a great storyteller hes also a cinematic genius  i love that man cillian murphy will win the oscar  the first time murphy and damon meet is best dialogue of the movie
Jul 27 2023,negative,weird when you see a movie very well acted be so bad 3 hours of nothing just talk no action no drama no comedy no anything how do you make it 3 hours without substance
Jul 27 2023,positive,if this doesnt sweep the oscars for best actor best supporting actors and best film and possibly cinematography music and costumes then i dont know what will this film was stunning in its telling of a man a genius a historical event that shaped the world i am a loss for superlatives
Jul 27 2023,positive,oppenheimer penned and directed by the visionary cristopher nolan is a captivating cinematic masterpiece that shines in various aspects making it a mustwatch one of the films greatest strengths is its mesmerizing ambiance which skillfully immerses the audience in the historical backdrop and intensifies the emotional impact of the narrative    the production design in oppenheimer is truly exceptional every aspect of the sets and locations is meticulously crafted transporting viewers to the world war ii era with astonishing authenticity with one exception being the number of stars in the american flag in one scenethe keen attention to historical accuracy enhances the films overall realism and brings the past to life in a visually stunning manner    the cinematography captured using imax film cameras by hoyte van hoytema is an aweinspiring triumph in oppenheimer the grand visuals displayed on the imax screen create an immersive experience showcasing cristopher nolans and hoyte van hoytemas masterful command of the cinematic craft the breathtaking shots and expansive vistas add grandeur to the storytelling leaving a lasting impression on the audience    the films editing is seamless and skillfully weaves together multiple timelines allowing the narrative to unfold in a gripping and coherent way cristopher nolans trademark nonlinear storytelling keeps viewers engaged and invested while the precise cuts and transitions heighten the tension and emotional depth of the plot    oppenheimers sound design is another standout feature that deserves accolades the meticulous attention to detail in crafting a rich and immersive audio landscape adds depth and intensity to pivotal moments in the film the sound effects and ambient noises blend harmoniously with the visuals elevating the overall cinematic experience needed for the themes and sequences portrayed     the films musical score composed by returning composer ludwig goransson complements the visuals and narrative impeccably the evocative and powerful music amplifies the emotional resonance of the film creating an unforgettable and haunting cinematic journey    the acting performances in oppenheimer are exceptional with the cast delivering compelling and nuanced portrayals with cillian murphy being the stand out the ensemble cast breathes life into their respective characters making them relatable and engaging throughout the narrative cristopher nolans skillful direction shines through in the actors performances elevating the film to extraordinary heights    the practical special effects in oppenheimer are a testament to the dedication and ingenuity of the films production team the seamless incorporation of practical effects enhances the authenticity of the film adding realism to the war and scientific sequences without relying on excessive cgi    however it is important to address a couple of drawbacks in the film i encountered sound mixing dissonances in certain scenes where dialogue is overpowered by sound effects and the films intense score this minor issue can occasionally distract from an otherwise immersive experience    additionally i was taken aback by scenes that included nudity in the film which seemed out of place and detracted from the central focus of the narrative while artistic choices are subjective its essential to acknowledge that these instances did take me out of the film     in conclusion oppenheimer is an ambitious and mesmerizing film that showcases cristopher nolans and his teams unparalleled talent as filmmakers its remarkable ambiance production design cinematography editing sound design musical score acting and practical special effects make it a standout cinematic achievement despite minor concerns about sound mixing and gratuitous nudity oppenheimer remains a compelling and thoughtprovoking cinematic masterpiece that demands to be experienced on the big screen    55
Jul 27 2023,positive,luved this movie
Jul 27 2023,positive,amazing film from the acting to the science to the music no complaints on anything
Jul 27 2023,negative,if you want to sit through a 3 hours courtroom drama then this movie is for you  i was hoping for more exploding bombs but the one in new mexico that they were focus on was a dud
Jul 27 2023,positive,acting cinematography story and direction were all spectacular   only disliked the scene where florence pugh was totally naked in the chair  unnecessary to have her exposed in that way
Jul 27 2023,positive,im gonna watched this 5 more times go watch it dawgs best movie of the year 1010
Jul 27 2023,positive,my new favorite movie by far ive read so much on ww1 ww2 the vietnamese war as well as the atrocities of nanking seeing a point of view like this was so eye opening compared to the things ive read abt ww2 ive read things that usually glorify the use of fat man and little boy or show it as the only way to stop the war these books also presented the us as a great nation this was so much different and so enlightening on both the us government and the atomic bombs themselves
Jul 27 2023,positive,christopher nolan knows how to shoot a movie it is a movie that has a lot of moving parts different perspectives as well it shows the beauty of how great minds can come together to create something that is unimaginable also how those great minds dont see what unimaginable things it can do great performances the female characters could have been a bit better i enjoyed the movie it is a slow burn if you dont mind that then youll enjoy it
Jul 27 2023,positive,as a babyboomer who lived through the cold war i was very interested in learning more about oppenheimer as a person and as the leader of the creation of the atom bomb  this movie certainly provided a lot of background on both  however it was a long movie with lots of stylistic special effects trying to depict what might have been going on in his mind  which i found distracting and silly  i guess they were needed to enable movie theaters to crank up the volume and make my seat vibrate as explosions were depicted on screen  i also found the frequent flashbacks and flashforwards confusing particularly the imagined sex scene in the hearing room for oppenheimers security clearance      the movie could easily have been 3040 minutes shorter with no loss of dramatic appeal and still allowed more time to understand more of the main villain of the story  strauss
Jul 27 2023,positive,too long score is over dialog and annoying too much reliance on special effects
Jul 27 2023,positive,the best movie of the year lots of oscars all around
Jul 27 2023,positive,nobody does it better than nolan
Jul 27 2023,positive,the three hours went fast and was enthralling  i strongly recommend this for teens and above  as for quibbles would have liked a little more back story on the mccarthy era and the red scare  some of the time jumps were jarring and could have been avoided with a caption
Jul 26 2023,positive,it is going to win 3 oscars for sure  best movie  best actor  and best supporting actor the question is will matt damon or robert downey jr win it
Jul 26 2023,positive,absolutely stunning
Jul 26 2023,positive,the best movie i ever saw excellent in every aspect
Jul 26 2023,positive,extremely well told and educational cillian murphy and robert downey jr kept me totally engaged for minute of the 3 hours
Jul 26 2023,positive,complex intelligent and extremely thoughtprovoking christopher nolans made a unbelievable summer blockbuster that will make you think how you see life after walking out of the theater a definite mustsee
Jul 26 2023,positive,an exceptional film it manages to build the story very well and convey reliable sensations to the situation  the tension established in the film makes you feel immersed and apprehensive every second  a masterpiece of cinema
Jul 26 2023,positive,now i am become video killer of radio star
Jul 26 2023,positive,i never leave reviews but felt compelled to in this case  what an absolutely incredible film from start to finish cillian is just beyond words one of the greatest actors around today i think amazing cast amazing cinematography and just gripping right until the end nolan has smashed it once again
Jul 26 2023,positive,acting from all cast is sublime
Jul 26 2023,positive,certainly nolans master work yes its overlong but this is a complex story to say the least murphy and downey are at the top of their craft there isnt a weak performance in sight and nice to see some of my favorite that guy and gal actors fill in critical minor characters well worth the threehour investment
Jul 26 2023,positive,while born in 1948 i had no idea of the extent of the persecution oppenheimer went through kind of reminds me of what the republican party is doing now
Jul 26 2023,negative,did not like scrambled up scenes  did not include any details on actual construction of the bomb  did not like the congressional hearings  boring  the flow of the screenplay was not so good  focus on his womanizing traits didnt fit what the audience was looking for
Jul 26 2023,positive,a movie that has you on the edge of your seat by the halfway point and doesnt let you leane back into it until the end credits supported by a godly soundtrack and otherwordly performances from the actors with visuals that dont dissapointintense enjoyable and satisfying 1010
Jul 26 2023,neutral,the making of the first atomic bomb and the man behind it should be one of the most important stories of our time its too bad nolan didnt make that film instead oppenheimer is far more concerned with mccarthyism and a few sordid moments in robert oppenheimers past than it is with the actual manhattan project  the editing was distractingly avantgarde and the noteworthy moments where it worked well were too few to save a storyline that you already dont care about yes the performances are great but in the end its just not the story we came to see
Jul 26 2023,negative,lovely acting but the story was trapped which created not a lot of room for the narrative to thrive murphy does wonders with his part but all his character development is stuck in a history we already know ps oldmans truman was hilarious god bless that man and his talent
Jul 26 2023,positive,nolans best yet im going to see it again tomorrow its that good
Jul 26 2023,positive,very captivating movie
Jul 26 2023,positive,great movie with great actors  you gotta watch it 
Jul 26 2023,positive,amazing story sound visuals and actors
Jul 26 2023,positive,this is not a biography this is horror and cinema this is a master piece no words from this movie its just the best movie that i ever seen
Jul 26 2023,positive,i enjoyed this movie but found it lacking in places at times the storyline dragged on and i was more invested in both jean tatlock and kitty oppenheimer than robert oppenheimer himself his grief could be better investigated in the film rdj deliveres an award worthy performance
Jul 26 2023,positive,sensational oscars all round
Jul 26 2023,positive,one of his best films
Jul 26 2023,positive,thank you nolan for this
Jul 26 2023,neutral,christopher nolans flirtation with greatness but its practically ruined by far too many sequences littered with outrageously overused overmixed and overbearing music  the actors performances and much of their dialogue is barely allowed to breath without being drowned by the music  easily should have removed at least 50 of the score the score on its own is often mesmerizing and exciting and brilliantly accompanies several scenes several being the key word
Jul 26 2023,positive,great movie long movie but absolute 1010 down to the last minute
Jul 26 2023,positive,absolute masterpiece thank you christopher nolan for telling us his biopics in this way 1010
Jul 26 2023,positive,there are two words to describe oppenheimer cinematic masterpiece none of the achievements of this film could be done without writerdirector christopher nolan the script is absolutely phenomenal its a dialogue heavy threehour film but the tension and master class writing created by nolan keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time the score by ludwig goransson is fantastic as it also helps build tension in almost every scene the film jumps before after and during the testing of the atomic bomb but it is surprisingly not too difficult to follow and it is kept extremely interesting throughout another thing to note is the absence of cgi in the film which is mindblowing to think about after youve seen it there are tons of shots showing close ups of the explosion atoms neutrons etc which you would think nolan would use cgi for but he doesnt and all of these shots are visually stunning it is just such an amazing accomplishment another key factor in this movie is the incredible acting from everyone involved there are tons of alist actors sprinkled throughout some even just having one scene and they all give great performances one in particular is tom conti as albert einstein einstein is in a scene at the beginning middle and end but the impact he has on the film is really memorable and impressive cillian murphy as oppenheimer just needs to win best actor his performance summed up in one word is haunting he haunts with his eyes the way he delivers his lines and the way he just stares he really shows the audience how depressed and miserable oppenheimer was particularly after hiroshima and nagasaki robert downey jr also shows how he isnt just tony stark but an incredible actor with a wide range everyone involved absolutely deserves an award the film is that great nolans biopic oppenheimer proves he is one of the great directors of all time
Jul 26 2023,positive,best movie sube seen in years
Jul 26 2023,positive,great story great acting kept my attention
Jul 26 2023,positive,i love movies that you think about long after you leave the theater
Jul 26 2023,positive,really looked forward to this movie way to long to tell the story  acting was great
Jul 26 2023,positive,from a scientific point of view this movie was not what i was expecting    if you are more interested in the oppenheimer political scene then  this may interest you    was disappointed from the aspects of the acknowledgement of what the damage was done to the japanese and really that using the a bomb on a mainly civilian landscape will go down in history the way should    in the end it was good to see oppenheimer with some sort of recognition     in the oppenheimer was responsible for the physics behind the atom bomb but not the moral question of whether something like this shouldve been used     also the scenes of the atomic bomb at los alamos had a noncgi type explosion with a lot of   lacklustre paper fall out without a proper mushroom cloud    science took the back burner on this one which was a complete disappointment to myself
Jul 26 2023,positive,this movie is nothing short of a masterpiece there isnt a slow point and it doesnt feel anywhere close to 3 hours this is a must watch movie
Jul 26 2023,negative,not a great movie far too long could have been shorter periods of loud explosions throughout movie very weird and frustrating not too sure why it was done running forward and backward in time at times hard too follow best bits are in the final part of movie
Jul 26 2023,positive,this should have been a longer movie
Jul 26 2023,positive,3 hour movie and neither my wife nor i got bored with it we actually researched after the movie to see how accurate it was we thought it was done well
Jul 26 2023,positive,the nonstop dialogue for the first 90 minutes was exhausting by the end i still felt no emotional connection to any of the characters i just didnt care and ive liked every other christopher nolan film ive seen but this one just didnt do it for me
Jul 26 2023,positive,best movie i have seen in a long time
Jul 26 2023,positive,i saw oppenheimer it was meh too long too muddled and it had a distractingly nude florence pugh robert downey jr looked like giancarlo esposito rami malek and emily blunt were severely underused and the  exposition dump in the third act that took me right out of the story was it biography on the bomb the manhattan project or on oppenheimer  it could have featured more about the life of oppenheimer and his inner thinking that lead to the main conflict of the movie     i almost left twice out if boredom i wish cillian murphy could have gotten more to do they should have really delved into the tortured genius story like a beautiful mind and the imagination game because it was clear oppenheimer had demons but the story only skimmed the surface
Jul 26 2023,positive,very good movie  learned a lot more about oppenheimer following his life from his college days to heading  the events that took place at los alamos
Jul 26 2023,positive,oppenheimer is a must see for everyone who likes to enjoy cinema at its best the visuals and the acting were on point the topic is still very important and invites you to think about it although the film lost me for 1 or 2 moments though to very long screentime 45 stars
Jul 26 2023,positive,good story but way too long  should have been able to fit it in 2hrs nudity  gratuitous sex were completely unnecessary to the plot and a vulgar stain on the movie  i wish they would have shown what the bombs did to the japanese and shown the long term affects
Jul 26 2023,positive,this is one of the best movies ive ever seen i think this is on par with lawrence of arabia amadeus raging bull goodfellas and the aviator for one of the best biopics ever made the music is out of this world
Jul 26 2023,negative,this movie was entirely too long the first 15 hours were a slog i kept looking at my watch and thats never a good sign while watching a movie would not recommend this overhyped movie
Jul 26 2023,positive,fantastic movie  compelling story
Jul 26 2023,positive,visually stunning practical effects topnotch acting and the moral controversies the people involved in the manhattan project struggled with were beautifully portrayed
Jul 26 2023,positive,important story incredible acting stunning cinematography i cant remember the last time i looked forward to a cinematic release so much and it was absolutely worth it nolan is a master of his craft rdjs performance ought to land an oscar nomination i thought i would miss him as tony stark but portrayals like that of admiral strauss only reveal how much more talent and character range he has to give
Jul 26 2023,positive,omg so good boob scenes not really necessary but the whole movie overall was so good we were on the edge of our seats the whole time great storytelling full of suspense
Jul 26 2023,positive,absolutely phenomenal movie that was definitely made for imax  i paid a matinee price but this one is worth a prime time price
Jul 26 2023,positive,absolute perfection
Jul 26 2023,positive,felt like i was really there
Jul 26 2023,positive,it was okay im absolutely in awe of cillians portrayal of oppenheimer
Jul 26 2023,positive,date and location references were not overlaid when scenes shifted credits did not include what actor played which character could have used a few more edits to cut down on time and biggest issue was the volume was way too loud i wear  hearing aids and had to turn them off and it was still dangerously loud
Jul 26 2023,positive,very good movie plenty of action
Jul 26 2023,positive,im stunned to speak just wow the best movie i have seen in a long time
Jul 26 2023,positive,longintense complicated but very good
Jul 26 2023,positive,too much hype raised my expectations it simply was not great it could have been much shorter
Jul 26 2023,positive,see it on the biggest screen possible it was so worth it
Jul 26 2023,positive,i wish they would of gotten more into the building of the bomb and all that went into it but it was still a decent movie
Jul 26 2023,positive,we love true stories and the history in this movie was so interesting  the acting and photography were terrific
Jul 26 2023,positive,excellent acting cinematography casting and soundtrack  great story well told
Jul 26 2023,positive,classic chrostpher nolan sytle
Jul 26 2023,positive,great acting dynamite cast but movie was tooo long
Jul 26 2023,positive,some of it was too technical at times and i though they could have told the story in less than 3 hours because it was slow in parts
Jul 26 2023,positive,very boring  i would say this movie is not for entertainment its more of an artistic historical documentary its very interesting of course because its part of pivotal human history but the dialog is hard to follow at times i needed my netflix subtitles and robert downey jr mumbled a lot like he always does to make him seem important but i loved the scenes of new mexico and how oppenheimers guilt came through didnt seem like 3 hours too i was proud of myself for not taking a popcorn break
Jul 26 2023,negative,special effects were terrible film was more like an documentary  highly disappointed
Jul 26 2023,positive,the content and story line took an hour to build up beyond that the movie was amazing
Jul 26 2023,negative,painfully long and extremely boringi understand the historical importancebut this easily could  should have been summarised in 90 minutes  if you watch chernobyl mini seriesyou realise how weak oppenheimers pacing was
Jul 26 2023,positive,great dialogue action scenes great actors fascinating history
Jul 26 2023,positive,very good movie highly recommended  having studied some of this history i feel several scenesinteractions were significantly exaggerated still a damn good movie
Jul 26 2023,positive,robert downeys role as admiral strauss was the highest point of the movie  having been at los alamos and alamogordo the settings were authentic the physics range true and the acting was admirable
Jul 26 2023,positive,absolutely amazing cinematography and sound effects   christopher nolan made you feel like you literally experienced the power of science and the bomb  beyond worthy of several oscar nominations
Jul 26 2023,positive,brilliant and breathtaking
Jul 26 2023,positive,the movie jumps around in time its hard to get a sense of how things happened or how much time passes eg when the project was started to when it was finished  there were 3 types of bombs mentioned but i was confused over why they only showed two bombs sent off to deliver to japan   and lastly  i found the sex scenes to be completely useless  pointless detracted from the movie exploited the actress embarrassed female audience members i will not recommend this movie to my elderly parents or anyone with younger children  no value just stuck in there for what  movie would have been much better if these scenes were left on the cutting room floor  speak up people let producers know this is trash
Jul 26 2023,positive,the best movie ive ever watched  stunning visuals intelligent storylines excellent acting by an ensemble cast more starstudded than the milky way and quite possibly the magnum opus of nolans career thus far     id recommend it to anyone willing to actually sit down and engage with a movie
Jul 26 2023,positive,it was a powerful 3 hour movie that left me wanting to know more about it and about the characters specially about the title character  beautifully acted by an accomplished cast beautifully told and harrowing through all the ups and downs of life  the twists and turns in the last 30minutes were very satisfying yet somehow wanting to know more  that is the power of great storytelling saw it at imax and well worth it but not necessary
Jul 26 2023,positive,i read american prometheus and this was an excellent synoptic persepctive by nolan   the acting was superb by blunt damon and downey cillian murphy gave a stunning performance as the lead and has emerged as one of the most brilliant actors in our time i dont really care about the oscars but this humble irishman gentleman deserves one
Jul 26 2023,negative,long boring film mostly about the kangaroo court   wish i stayed at home
Jul 26 2023,positive,this is blast from direction to cinematography to acting nolans best work hats off to the team
Jul 26 2023,positive,absolutely one of the best movies ive watched i had trouble pinpointing a favorite movie so far but the minute i stepped out of the theater for oppenheimer i knew it was the one im still staned i cant believe the masterpiece they created best work from everyone
Jul 26 2023,neutral,it was ok historical anecdotes were good but his personal life brought up all the time
Jul 26 2023,positive,for starters its too long  this story could have been told in less than two hours  the final hour was the whole piece and the first two were just too talky and obtuse for most  i like nolan and most of his films but this needed trimming by someone not personally involved in the making of it
Jul 26 2023,positive,great acting and cast
Jul 26 2023,positive,i thought this was an excellent film  the acting script and cinematography were all firstrate  despite the movies threehour length i remained immersed in the story    the only reason i didnt give it five stars is that i am not sure what would constitute a perfect film
Jul 26 2023,positive,unless you have a detailed knowledge of mid20th century us politics a lot of the themes will stump most people having said that it is wonderfully shot with great performances from cillian murphy emily blunt and robert downey jr
Jul 26 2023,positive,first this did not feel like a 3 hour movie at no point did i feel this was boring or dragging second admittedly i do not know much about the actual oppenheimer and the politics at that point in time however i did not need to to understand that this was a compellingly complex and multifaceted look at who he was and what he went through as well as the harsh reality of effects of the bombswar in general without going into more i will say this was one of the best movies i have ever seen and on par with the way movies used to be done
Jul 26 2023,positive,fascinating origin of the atomic bomb im glad i watched it however if you dont go to the theater often and youre debating what you should see sound of freedom is a much more impactful and necessary movie than this but if you love the theater then definitely check out oppenheimer
Jul 26 2023,positive,must see in a theater  the emotion and supporting sounds are incredibly moving and you dont realize it has been 3 hours  i was in a trance
Jul 26 2023,positive,it was entirely too long at 3 hours   i was looking for a little more in depth discussion and conversation of the development of the nuclear bomb   this move is more of a documentary of the life of oppenheimer and a great deal of that is very boring  i also thought the 3 or 4 scenes of nudity was not necessary and probably what got the film the r rating
Jul 26 2023,positive,true to history high production quality well acted and directed
Jul 26 2023,positive,i wasnt sure i could sit still for three hours but im glad i experienced this the acting story writing and direction was really good all the way across a very compelling story was told about a man that i was aware of but this is a deep and fascinating dive into his personal and professional life as well as a look at how our government operated under the stresses of war     im removing a star from my review for two reasons first i saw it in imax and im just not sure that it wouldnt have been just as enjoyable in a standard movie theater the other big negative for me was the sound mix and the music i think they meant to layer the music under the dialogue and not beat you to death with it and in this theater they had the volume cranked to maximum i had to take a paper napkin and make some primitive ear plugs just to take the edge off i knew i couldnt sit there for 35 hours the commercials and previews were at least 30 minutes without damping down the volume
Jul 26 2023,positive,well written film just not enough action definitely not for kids under 17  lol
Jul 26 2023,positive,i knew very little about oppenheimer before this movie i think its a must see for the younger generation wish they wouldve left out the nudity but besides that it was a great movie
Jul 26 2023,positive,riveting intense and allowing for a little dramatic license incredibly detailed and historically accurate
Jul 26 2023,neutral,this hugely important and highly anticipated story was brought to the screen in an overlong confusing bloated mess the first hour could have been condensed into twenty minutes much of it was minimally related to the core elements of the story they used the miniseries approach to storytelling in one film the music and sound effects seemed to have been designed for the audiences that enjoy superhero films  at times i felt as if i were listening to an adaptation of the jaws theme i am an educated intelligent filmgoer but i found it difficult to keep track of the comings and goings of the huge cast of characters for the most part the acting was strong especially matt damon emily blunt and rami malek but cillian murphy overplayed the actors trick of not blinking so we would know how intense he was and as we approached the end robert downey jr gave a credible impersonation of norma desmond the most interesting moments were the last oppenheimers imagined conversation with einstein i was so very disappointed as were my companions but i am looking forward to reading the book
Jul 26 2023,positive,saw movie in 70 mm imax amazing story characters and acting thoroughly enjoyed
Jul 26 2023,positive,a very thoughtprovoking film that beautifully explores the concept of science for the greater good the ethics of science and the political landscape during and after world war ii  all the while being able to seamlessly jump between narratives to show the rise and fall of oppenheimer
Jul 26 2023,positive,really expertly made movie as always
Jul 26 2023,positive,the historical part of the movie was good the sexnudes scenes were totally unnecessary and completely took so much away from the movie i wouldnt recommend anyone paying to see it
Jul 26 2023,positive,gripping cillian is spectacular you are immersed into the story
Jul 26 2023,negative,unpopular opinion i believe this movie was disappointing the visuals sounds and beautiful direction could only be thinned out fondant on a crooked cake i wish nolan had spent more time flushing out the character development and molding the film to match the mix of tones moving through it to me the script was messy the plot incoherent and the ending dull i personally believe it was one note i believe in show instead of tell in films if i wanted to read the novel on which this film is based i would have done that instead there seems to be a disconnect in what the script tried to accomplish and the finished product as i watched it some scenes felt completely out of place and would take the audience out of the raw gravity of a scene prior there was no need for pugh and her cgid boobs albeit she is a great actress no need for the womanizer comment from matt damon because in the 1930s most men were doing exactly what oppenheimer did he literally wooed what 2 women and his wife also rdj does not expand his reach as an actor enough once the real side of his character is exposed its for nothing the film is so muted that it isnt an exciting shift he has one little hissy fit and hes back to meh energy after he is such a genuinely good actor but his moments lacked depth and dimension outside of some lip biting cillian murphys sacrifice is how he kept his eyes bulging out of his head for three hours his american accent is great but besides bulging his eyes out more and pacing theres no dimensional shifts in his character the dynamics are rushed and the heartache you want to feel is masked by brown noise i love films with exposition and thought out premises but its not fully realized in this movie im unsure how this films script was not ripped apart by critics for emphasizing the obvious nature of the abomb 10 million times instead of showing those affected ie natives to new mexico whose land was seized and were displaced by the project after effects of testing around nuclear energy to any of those involved or even japanese people who faced the bomb this film takes the humanity out of the crisis of stopping nuclear energy dependence and expansion by raking in numbers and a depressed man who went too far i understand how smart oppenheimer is not from the level work shown but by how many people kept repeating just how amazing and revolutionary he was im not convinced the only way that i can ease my anger at why those who felt the ripple of his work were not shown is because maybe oppenheimer did not have access to the empathy needed to address those topics they rushed through it all and went straight into oppenheimers altruistic and political endeavors thereafter nolans main point is to bring the audience out of their naivete i hated when the guy from beautiful creatures said this line around nuclear weapons i get it i understand the message of the film but the heart is lost diamonds in the rough couldnt even bring the film up to me overall amazed by emily blunts performance as kitty she was dynamic in her short onscreen bursts for me she stole the whole movie with her final scenes coherent loud and with a range that josh peck wish he had when he shook his arm to press that big ol red button rami malek also does a great job of easing into the best character development shown hits a home run and he was in it  3 minutes the actor behind albert einstein phenomenal im disappointed after all of nolans movies that some say this is his greatest lifes work it is not this feels incomplete and rushed not to mention a reunion of white guys who peaked in 2007    cinematography is still gorgeous as always this is a movie you can probably only watch once to say you did but i doubt anyone will be picking it up to watch a second time
Jul 26 2023,positive,one of the greatest cinema experiences of all time
Jul 26 2023,positive,it was a good movie but couldve been cut down to 2 hrs all the actors in it was good though
Jul 26 2023,negative,the story of oppenheimer and the bomb is without doubt one of the most important in human history unfortunately nolan made a complete mess out of articulating the tale to his audience the plot is jumbled confusing and key information isnt introduced properly the marketing and technological fanfare are a disguise for a mediocre flick
Jul 26 2023,positive,amazing history of the time and story of the inventor very good
Jul 26 2023,positive,all the scenes are there for this to be a great movie but the attempts to include as much as possible gets in the way of storytelling     the modern desire for movies to involve multiple timelines is getting in the way of clarity to the point of creating confusion in the narrative     additionally even though the marketing wants to ensure you know it was shot in 70mm see it in a theatre that has enhanced sound features as thats a far more important component of the film
Jul 26 2023,positive,i thought it too long on the plus side psychologically it had some nice touches robert downey jr was the star for me
Jul 26 2023,positive,visually stunning learned alot about the history of him
Jul 26 2023,positive,its been so long since i could give a 5 star review that it is a wonderful reminder some actual cinema is being created i loved barbie growing up but i couldnt even finish that filmthis on the other hand i plan on seeing it again cillian is a shooin for an oscar
Jul 26 2023,positive,a tour de force just excellent cinema i doesnt stop and keeps on coming i loved it
Jul 26 2023,positive,the film seems to me to be one of the best of the year without a doubt the explosion scenes steal the film and improve it a lot the only downside i have is that it can be heavy but for the rest its amazing
Jul 26 2023,neutral,the story was long and could have been reduced down
Jul 26 2023,positive,brilliant movie so good to see rdj back in a role with some grit and cillian murphy is so good in everything he does he truly embodied oppenheimer do yourself a favor and see this on the big screen
Jul 26 2023,positive,the 15 rating is unfortunate probably because of the unnecessary sex scenes and personal life of oppenheimer every young person should watch this movie to see how this madness came about and how the spectre of nuclear weapons still hangs over them  a very well made movie except the aforementioned and too long at 3 hours
Jul 26 2023,positive,the drama was great as was the acting
Jul 26 2023,positive,one of the best movies i have ever seen if not the best
Jul 26 2023,positive,there was a lot going on in this movie and in reality this could have gone on for 5 hours and i would have been up for it there was the build up for the bomb but ultimately the focus was on oppenheimer in every scenario which i believe was the correct call for this character piece
Jul 26 2023,negative,i made it about 90 minutes into this film before deciding id had enough the story is convoluted confusing and the continuous use of flashbacks was more than i could take i am no prude but the sex scenes were certainly unneccesary i am quite amazed that so many people have rated this stinker so highly i thought it to be one of the worst movies ive seen in years
Jul 26 2023,positive,an exceptional film  so wellconceived beautifully acted and filmed
Jul 26 2023,positive,the story is great but the dialogue is stilted and c murphy uses the same tone for every statement the significance of the security clearance review committee was not elucidated well the movie made it feel like there were legal implications in addition to security or political implications read the book instead
Jul 26 2023,negative,allinall an underwhelming film that felt like a speedrun of 2 seasons of a nonexistent tv show that told a much better story i say speedrun because the scenes are hardly scenes but instead are quick moments that build one large montage and hurdles the movie forward similar to a movie trailer or music video where its a mish mash of images that evoke a feeling rather than images that actually tell a story or expand on any characters    this style is something he did a lot since inception but here its turned up to the maximum and it made all the characters feel hollow it made moments that shouldve been big feel like mere footnotes like a passing thought it only hit the highlights the good stuff the sparknotesleaving the heart of the characters and all the breathing room on the cutting room floor and when the characters only feel like meaningless smears on a screen it leaves me feeling nothing    visually i have no idea why this was promoted for imax visually its shot extremely ordinary and lackluster they made it seem like this was going to be a visual feast like blade runner or even dunkirk but it most definitely wasnt if you really want to see a bunch of scientists in rooms discussing bomb building then ok but for me it wasnt worth the extra cost
Jul 26 2023,positive,this movie was captivating throughout and absolutely enthralling a beautiful collision of politics science love and purpose describes this instant classic of a film christopher nolan has added another masterpiece to his body of work
Jul 26 2023,positive,christopher nolans oppenheimer is an excellent movie on all fronts except two  there wasnt enough content on the leads motivation to keep his highlevel security clearance and the overly loud and intense music that was pretending that this work was more actionadventure vs what it is an intellectual talkingheads film thereby stealing the impact of the actual drama by overshadowing the actors performances
Jul 26 2023,positive,clearly the best film of the year maybe of the this decade up until now
Jul 26 2023,positive,i loved the movies special effects and how the viewers were taken inside the head of the main character the only thing that we all that were in my party found off was the sound it was extremely loud im not sure if this was how the movie was made or if it was the sound level the theater set i wore ear plugs during the movie and the sound was still too loud at times other than that it is one of the best movies ive seen in a long time it was original well made complex and thought provoking
Jul 26 2023,positive,one of nolans best work to date the movie is incredibly wellacted wellwritten thought provoking cinematically gorgeous all with an amazing score the technical aspects of this movie is unparalleled compared to nolans other works this movie is fairly straightforward but it still requires the viewers full attention although keep in mind this is a 3 hour long drama mostly just dialogue so it is not going to be for everyone dont expect a thrill but i will say the final act of this movie might be the most thrill you can possibly get from a nonthriller movie
Jul 26 2023,positive,cillian murphy and christopher nolan doing an incredible job with this as always interstellar has been my favorite movie for such a long time and i was thrilled to see this movie the cinematography was incredible and its score was amazing there were some incredible creative decisions in this movie and i would watch it 100 times over
Jul 26 2023,negative,confusing too long super boring
Jul 26 2023,positive,its a good movie if you wanna know how was atomic bomb made and its not a movie with like too much fighting or action but its i would say best movie in 2023 might even win oscar
Jul 26 2023,positive,this movie was amazing it is a movie that left you speechless and is a movie i will never forget the cinematography and practical effects were phenomenal highly recommend
Jul 26 2023,positive,i thought the movie was well done but would have enjoyed it more had i read up on oppenheimer to refresh my memory i had some difficulty following it in parts
Jul 26 2023,positive,fantastic story telling as usual fantastic character development great performance from all involved nolans filming and close ups phenomenal as usual  the only drawback is the excessive use of music i watched the film in a dolby cinema the dialogue sometimes drowned in the music
Jul 26 2023,positive,the plot was complex nonchronological and disjointed in classic christopher nolan fashion  if thats a good thing for you then this movie is that x1000  the subject matter is fascinating and the cinematography is captivating and takes full advantage of the large format it was designed for in my humble opinion oppenheimer is for now nolans magnum opus
Jul 26 2023,positive,excellent movie stunning visuals and music  a tad long but a command performance by murphy likely an oscar nominee if not winner
Jul 26 2023,positive,second best film i have ever seen interstellar 1 changed me and i absolutely love the ending
Jul 26 2023,positive,brilliant storytelling on par with nolans best sound and picture were breathtaking as well
Jul 26 2023,positive,absolutely loved it  the theater was horrible snack bar severely understaffed ac was not running in the theater everyone was drenched by the end of the movie
Jul 26 2023,positive,this movie kept me intrigued from start to finish the acting directing and cinematography was amazing i hope this movie gets highly recognized during award season
Jul 26 2023,positive,phenomenal cast perfect writing out of this world soundtrack and practical effects
Jul 26 2023,positive,oppenheimer     i am not a fan of longdrawnout biopics they usually bore me to tears its not that i dont appreciate a good drama or a history lesson to me many biopics are dry     oppenheimer was stunning everything from the intense audio mixing the pacing the acting the makeup and the score was perfect the three hours zoomed by it is easily one of nolans best directing i cant express the audio enough i am not just talking about the quality of the sound but the sounds used and when emotions are perfectly balanced with visuals acting and sound i was pulled in and could feel what the characters were feeling    now the negative    i am not one to racebait everything suppose this was a piece about 8thcentury sweden with an alleuropean cast makes sense     but seriously  where are all the black people     african american ronald auguste played j ernest wilkins in a blinkandyouwillmiss role thats it  ernest wilkins was a prominent member of the manhattan project     at least 19 of the scientists were black thousands of black americans worked lowwage jobs in project facilities and faced jim crow segregation the project was unique for bringing together colored and white christian and jew i understand that 19 is much smaller than the over 400 white scientists and technicians however william jacob knox jr samuel proctor massie and carolyn parker were among the handful of black scientists who worked on the manhattan project in such a highprofile movie filled with forgettable side characters indeed there was room to have a more prominent role for some of the vital african american members of the project in the movie for example  william jacob knox jr was a physical chemist joined columbia in 1943 and was promoted to the head of the corrosion section of the nuclear research team knox held an unprecedented position at columbia university serving as the only africanamerican supervisor on the manhattan project however he was nowhere to be seen in the movie    this was nolans chance to showcase a piece of history however he continued the trend of burying african american contribution in the sciences
Jul 26 2023,positive,great cinematography i love the suspenseful music during most of the scenes the quote at the beginning of the movie the character personalities and they chose the right people to cast
Jul 26 2023,positive,i loved it the fastest 3hour movie i have ever sat through  the acting was wonderful  it was a heavy movie but it was fantastic i wish there were more great movies being made
Jul 26 2023,negative,film was going great until sex scenes came in thought it was totally unnecessary for this film and quite vulgar and distasteful who wants to see someone naked and committing lewd acts 
Jul 26 2023,positive,this film is made for people who enjoy the movie going experience as a whole  had an opportunity to seeing the movie in 70 mm imax and the experience was just awesome  a heavy dialogue film still keeps the audience attention because of a plus acting and great directing by christopher nolan  this film is about intensity and with a fantastic score by ludwig goransson the film simply does not let up this my favorite non batman related christopher nolan film
Jul 26 2023,positive,believable portrayal of the man who lead the team of scientists who created the atomic bomb there is so much more to this story and it couldve ran as a 10part series but its a nicely condensed version to pique the viewers interest to learning more
Jul 26 2023,positive,excellent acting music
Jul 26 2023,negative,the first half of the movie is good then it just goes on with a long trial of a security clearance that overstays its welcome
Jul 26 2023,positive,too much frivolous nudity that added zero to the movie and not enough historical facts
Jul 26 2023,positive,not much action is going on the whole movie was just talking entertaining up to a certain point but goes on and on the movie did a good job as in it didnt feel like 3 hours long but i was ready for a change of pace about half way through
Jul 26 2023,positive,great movie great story and great acting it was just incredibly loud like i thought my eardrums were going to explode which could have totally been the theaters fault
Jul 26 2023,positive,nolan at his best beautiful executed
Jul 26 2023,positive,great story great visuals storytelling was great and it is a movie that makes you angry sad and it makes you think it also shows you how evil the human race can be
Jul 26 2023,positive,its on of best films i seen ever
Jul 26 2023,positive,thoroughly enjoyed the 4 piece script and storytelling the cuts in the timelines are seamless and welltransitioned making it not at all difficult to keep track and be engrossed the sound design visuals and acting was at its absolute best definitely the one of the best if not the best biopics ive ever seen or will see in my opinion 2023s best
Jul 26 2023,positive,a great nolan movie with a bunch of drama when the movie bores you it surprises you though those naked scenes were a bit too long
Jul 26 2023,negative,far too long noisy music drowns dialogue confusing flipping between time and place much of the latter part is of tedious formal hearings which are disjointed and boring i thought it would never end
Jul 26 2023,positive,i literally cant stop thinking about this movie
Jul 26 2023,negative,not one likable character in the entire movie boring plot line boring scientists mixed with super disfunctional women awkward sex scenes for no plot outcomesvery odd cant understand how this got such a high rotten tomatoes score maybe trying to take away audience from sound of freedom war is bad nuclear weapons come with great responsibility like we didnt already know that
Jul 26 2023,positive,it was alright acting and script writing was subpar wish they had focused more on the science behind it
Jul 26 2023,positive,and the oscar goes to
Jul 26 2023,negative,i have a ba in history and a bs in engineering and i still hated this movie slow boring and anticlimactic i was expecting so much more and felt let down i have no idea where all these great reviews are coming from
Jul 26 2023,positive,outstanding acting and great visual effects a must see
Jul 26 2023,positive,very insightful and interesting to see how history was changed forever with the creation of the abomb
Jul 26 2023,negative,if you like congressional hearings and security clearance interrogations this movie is for you  if you are interested in the manhatten project physics or science this movie is not for you
Jul 26 2023,positive,great movie never got bored the music perfectly reflects the atmosphere 3 hours spent in suspense nolan once again showed his skills this movie is not just a movie but an experience and it is very possible that i will choose to watch it again the actors did their best 1010
Jul 26 2023,positive,powerful movie beautifully produced this is genuinely one of the best films i have ever seen
Jul 26 2023,positive,a cinematic masterpiece from the mastermind christopher nolan oppenheimer is an emotional psychological movie that delves into the life and mind of dr oppenheimer with some of the most visually striking cinematography tormenting music and the most beautiful explosion in all of film oppenheimer leaves the viewer with the same imprints that the movie visualises in his head leaving us wanting more    the movie is made that much better when viewed in 70mm imax adding age and character to the film itself whilst showing us how nolan intended for us to view the movie if you can see oppenheimer see it in 70mm imax
Jul 26 2023,positive,very exciting at times  great job of creating the dilemma in oppenheimers mind about the real possibility of annilation of mankind
Jul 26 2023,positive,it was way to long the actors played good part they left some information out but that is hollywood
Jul 26 2023,positive,watched it in theatres and went in with high expectations on the visual and physically immersive experience i was surprised to see myself still being blown away by the extra attention paid to give the viewer the feeling of being there themself often times in cinema youre the person looking at the story but here it really felt as if you were there on the site of the detonations as for the story i can see why people found it hard to keep track of what was going on yes you had to pay extra attention to understand the environment and the plot but it rewarded you brilliantly i remember being in awe at the ending and feeling so satisfied that i managed to get the full experience my advice is for people to try to focus on it as much as you can because when you do youll find yourself enjoying it a lot more truly an oscar worthy film
Jul 26 2023,positive,oppenheimer is in my opinion peak cinema its themes and revelations are some of the most urgent and profound of any film i have had the pleasure of watching the weight of humanitys burden of atomic weapons and its impact on the 20th century and beyond give this film the distinct position of being the retrospective of the century if i had to give an alien species a single film to explain the 20th century i would pick this one that aside i was entirely shocked at how well the more personal character conflict arc of the story played out and how the juxtaposition of the triumph of succeeding the weight of guilt and the fallout from the trial show a unique character study the soundtrack is also phenomenal one thing i was a little concerned about heading in since despite ludwig gorannson having some standouts not all of his works are bangers like hz ive listened to can you hear the music and destroyer of worlds on repeat since seeing the movie cillian murphy obviously stole the show but i was very impressed by robert downey jr since this is the first role i can say i have seen him play a character that wasnt driven by a characteristic performance to have personality and stage presence the runtime was a hot button for some but this is one of the first movies ive seen in years that i actually felt satiated from it towed a balance between development and payoff in a risky yet nolanesque pace where puzzle pieces are left from post to post out of order but by the end we have the tapestry completed overall an utterly stunning piece that had me contemplating our place as a species and thoroughly enjoying a great story
Jul 26 2023,positive,amazing oscar worthy three hour talking movie and the time just swept by raw emotion throughout five stars isnt enough
Jul 26 2023,positive,the filming and sound was terrific the bouncing around from timelines and locations made you pay attention to the film  the movie was oppenhiemer not the bomb the political play was very interesting to learn about the nude scenes were not neccessary but understandable sex is a part of life no matter what the intellect level is
Jul 26 2023,positive,may be the best biopicture i have ever seen  it brought oppenheimer to life excellent acting by all  cillian murphy and robert downey jr were tremendous and should receive awards for their performances
Jul 26 2023,positive,can feel long or tiresome to those completely uninterested in history or the drama of this specific history amazing visuals sounds and story line makes for an exciting way to learn about history and feel what many may have felt back then
Jul 26 2023,positive,hard to follow movie jumps between scenes timelines stories way too much i have a decent understanding of the manhattan project mccarthyism and wwii and still found it difficult to follow to me this movie was more about the director than the story line
Jul 26 2023,positive,great acting and visually very good however there was a significant flaw the ending we were building up to see the end result of the bomb failure to complete the movie was like having a delicious meal but no dessert a big disappointment and obviously they were being politically correct im sick of movies catering to the minority population 
Jul 26 2023,positive,fairly enjoyable biopic that hit the high notes acting was solid allaround and cinematography was good i feel some of the drag was due to dramatic scenes added to make it a good movie
Jul 26 2023,negative,a hollywood over artsy trying to be 3 movies  confused bore rami malek was the only actor not mumbling
Jul 26 2023,positive,great movie that tells an unbelievable story
Jul 26 2023,positive,christopher nolan not only are entertaining but also look better than other movies
Jul 26 2023,neutral,it was ok if you like history and drama it felt too long didnt keep my attention
Jul 26 2023,neutral,one of the most boring movies ive ever been to and as a teacher of history that says a lot
Jul 26 2023,positive,a better than average movie  the main characters were well defined and easily recognized  however the minor characters entered and exited the story line with little definition especially the team of scientists  i easily lost track of who they were and how they fit into the plot  of course the movie was a little long and had several scenes that were completely unnecessary specifically the sex scene with murphy and pugh  not that i object to seeing pugh naked but i did not think it added much to the plot
Jul 26 2023,positive,this movie really caught me
Jul 26 2023,positive,low action smart acting one flaw is that the background music is often too loud it often drowns out the dialog
Jul 26 2023,neutral,it was slow hard to track which time period as it was constantly moving back and forth and really not what i was hoping i would not want to watch it again which imo is what makes a great moviewanting to see multiple times
Jul 26 2023,positive,40 of this movie is riveting showing the smartest people in the world building the most important device in the world the acting is topnotch and the cinematography is stunning the other 60 of the movie is boring as we are subjected to endless scenes of bureaucrats arguing in conference rooms as the movie drags on the boring overwhelms the riveting and you just want it to be over
Jul 26 2023,positive,k went to see oppenheimer   definitely not for fidgety kids unless their favorite hobbies are thermonuclear quantum physics and politics full 3 hours long slightly different take on past fliks and documentaries about the first nuke bombs and oppenheimer it deals with losing his q clearance that divorced him from any usa government associations he was castigated and blacklisted during our mccarthyism era focus is on his friends from communist countries and any intelligence secrets that might have leaked out of los alamos good acting could not salvage the toll taken by slow and sometimes droll developments of the unremarkable third act i felt a couple loose strings were left dangling with no closure other than googling to see outcome   wait for it to reach your home and you can stream at no additional cost at least 3 times you will put it on hold and finish chores the outstanding actors cillian murphy matt damon and emily blunt couldnt perk it up to the point it didnt feel like a drudgery commitment and obligation to stick it out after buying a ticket  the reading during sex controversy was free advertisement gratuitous with no redeeming value but to establish that oppenheimer could read sanskrit
Jul 26 2023,positive,this movie was amazing  strong acting from cilian murphy robert downey jr and emily blunt in particular  the movie i think will be up for a number of awards come oscars season  also the movie is a bit unsettling  it does a great job of handling the moral dilemmas  first the dilemma of dropping the bomb in the firstplace  second the dilemma of bringing it into existence  an excellent movie
Jul 26 2023,positive,very powerful on many levels
Jul 26 2023,positive,this was an epic film with lots of drama and history it was indeed long but there was a lot of territory to cover in dr oppenheimers life cillian murphy should be considered on the short list when it comes to best actor nominations at oscar time and robert downey jr for best supporting actor
Jul 26 2023,positive,very well done  so glad i had seen the manhattan project first
Jul 26 2023,positive,it wasnt action packed but i love history and the acting was great
Jul 26 2023,positive,slightly boring but that is the whole reason this movie is also incredible to see the amazing performances from all throughout the movie
Jul 26 2023,positive,it was perfect perfect down to the last minor detail homelander
Jul 26 2023,positive,good movie   they missed a few things but it is good
Jul 26 2023,positive,the best movie ive ever seen the script catches you and makes you remember every detail you can see it without knowing the story and youll understand it the ending is a great reflection
Jul 26 2023,positive,beautiful use of imagery sound and explosions the movie kept me on the edge of my seat with the depth of the drama and characters    its one of the top two nolan films and in my opinion it isnt number two
Jul 26 2023,positive,wonderfully written film definitely my favorite film of 2023 so far
Jul 26 2023,positive,amazing film shot beautifully and sound design outside of some conversations being hard to hear is amazing really pulls you in to how intense and important dealing with that must have been ending is probably my favorite scene
Jul 26 2023,negative,over indulgent over acted and boringthe entire washington losing security clearance is a complete wastenobody cares  stick to the main ptthe us murdered 200000 innocent people
Jul 26 2023,positive,nolan has finally found his groove he usually has a tendency to not edit with his past movies ie unnecessary side plots but with this amazing historical biopic its hard to do that  the acting is superb by all  cillian murphy did an excellent job as oppenheimer and robert downey jr is sure to get the oscar for supporting and nolan is due for best picture  gary oldman had one of the best shortest scenes ever as truman  my only complaint is the hearings on oppenheimer went on a little long and i was hoping for more experiments on testing the bomb which they did in real life many times over without success  other than that very moving and finally a well done movie that weve been missing for many years now  bravo
Jul 26 2023,positive,excellent documentary by all accounts factually accurate despite its length it moved well never boring insightful
Jul 26 2023,positive,i havent seen such a good movie in a long time actors creations scenery effects atmosphere idea and execution i thought we wouldnt be able to enjoy good cinema these days fortunately i was wrong in a world full of crappy writers and directors be christofer nolan to create meaningful things for generations
Jul 26 2023,positive,truly a good watch but wasnt for me it was too long and some scenes were not necessary it was different than other movies ive watched the feeling coming out of the theatre was different
Jul 26 2023,positive,amazing changed my life theory only goes so far
Jul 26 2023,positive,it was great to see the back story of this historic period
Jul 26 2023,positive,great film dont go in expecting an action film its a biopic one of nolans best but not on his top 3 for me
Jul 26 2023,positive,i liked it good story good acting but too long too much back story too many scenes of florence pugh topless not enough impact on the most important scene the first explosion of the bomb should have blown our minds but it fell kind of flat i almost felt that there was some procommunist story line as well but it was subtle and not too much was it great not really it was good the fact that more people by far are going to see the anti male propaganda movie barbie says a lot about our society and oppenheimer may be excluded from the academy award because they didnt replace half of the characters with the wrong ethnicity or gender or with homosexuals or trans characters truth
Jul 26 2023,positive,too many moving pieces
Jul 26 2023,positive,there were alot of characters to keep track of  nude sceens were not necessary and seemd awkward
Jul 26 2023,positive,the best nolan has to offer in terms of writing directing and style all of it complemented with a beautiful and haunting score
Jul 26 2023,positive,slow start but engrossing characters  shows that even the most brilliant people are deeply flawed and struggle with lifes issues also shows that a weakminded person can be vindictive when confronted by a perceived by insult  human nature is flawed and we are still dealing with the perceived insults of deeply flawed people the parallels are scary
Jul 26 2023,positive,the movie masterfully portrayed oppenheimers complex character but it is too long and the audio isnt great a lot of times you cant hear the dialogues properly it makes an already complicated story even harder to understand
Jul 26 2023,negative,the pornography was wholly unwarranted as it always is really disappointed to see nolan behind filth like this
Jul 26 2023,positive,amazing movie and visuals masterpiece
Jul 26 2023,negative,was the movie good part of it was but it was 90 minutes too long and i was bored to death some people left but i could see that most people appeared bored like me nolan really needs someone to keep him focused
Jul 26 2023,positive,outstanding they dont make movies like this any more
Jul 26 2023,positive,fantastic cast and the best performance ive seen in quite some time cillian murphy showcased his phenomenal talent and christopher nolan proved to us once again that he is one of the greatest directors of our time would i watch it at home on tv probably not but personally i think its the type of film that should only be seen in a cinema setting just from a visual and audio perspective
Jul 26 2023,positive,this movie was awesome  it didnt feel like three hours and it was always captivating  amazing visuals just a great movie  my only criticism is that some of the female characters couldve had more development especially oppenheimers wife kitty
Jul 26 2023,positive,great movie even though it was a 3h long movie i didnt feel it was slow at any point
Jul 26 2023,positive,nolan with this cast didnt let the audiences  down superb
Jul 26 2023,negative,70mm totally sucked imax wlaser far better in sound an picture quality the sex scenes were totally uncalled for and completely unnecessary and nix that fuckin trailers with the exorcist i dont need that hollywood crap thrown in my face
Jul 26 2023,positive,wonderful movie superb directing and acting
Jul 26 2023,positive,wow a beautifully horrific biopic must see in imax doesnt feel like 3 hours
Jul 26 2023,positive,the acting and the screenplay are excellent  the use of volume to express the story such as the booms from the bomb which reoccur through flashbacks were powerful but too extended  as was the entire movie  it would have benefited from shortening  3 hours is too long  the story is powerful and well presented
Jul 26 2023,positive,it is in my opinion one of the most important movies ever made it is a brilliant piece by nolan made the best he has ever done it is a must see for everybody all actors especially murphy played their best saw it in imax and this is much recommended going to see it for a second time monday ps the last scene is most probably the best movie scene i have ever seen
Jul 26 2023,positive,mind blowing experience
Jul 26 2023,positive,after a seemingly neverending parade of marvelstar warsetc cgi vomitfests these past years my faith in the transformative power of cinema is fully restored after seeing oppenheimer this is what the talkies were made for entertaining for certain but much more than that a heartpounding edgeofyourseat thriller without a single car chase gun battle or silly superpower anywhere in sight
Jul 26 2023,positive,must see movie visually stunning and great sound track
Jul 26 2023,positive,extraordinary cillian murphy did an incredible job as dr oppenheimer bringing all the drama involving a brilliant mind and a death machine christopher nolan outdid himself with this masterpiece
Jul 26 2023,positive,excellent directing and acting visually stunning
Jul 26 2023,positive,a must see but very intense the leadup to the trinity test tests ones nerves
Jul 26 2023,positive,its too long some of the visuals are unnecessary movie was great but didnt learn about oppenheimer as much as i thought i would for a movie of this length
Jul 26 2023,negative,this movie is about oppenheimers life under mccarthyism  this is more of a political propaganda than the real achievements of dr op
Jul 26 2023,positive,the movie was a visual artistic masterpiece along with great storytelling i thought it was extremely well done
Jul 26 2023,negative,convoluted frenetic constant parade of characters introduced briefly you have no clue who they are then never to be seen again absolutely no sense of setting ie wwii erafeeling of wartime no depiction of the bombs themselves being dropped and the devastation wrought just a boring mess of a film that could have been such a fascinating story
Jul 26 2023,neutral,i bought into all the hype for oppenheimer and for b  and i knew i was going to love oppenheimer and like b  man was i ever more wrong not that i remember  sure opp has a great director great actors it should have 3 best acting awards blunt murphy and downey in that order  and yet i got bored its a good thing i saw it in the theater cause id have never gotten through it at home im not sure how they made nudity sex and the most dangerous gamble mankind has ever known  so tedious but they did and matt damon i cant believe you signed up for that in fact the next time i see any of you in a movie at the theater again please lean a smidge more b  its expensive for the poor working class to see a movie with popcorn and a drink  the audience bubbled out of b  dont be b but do get in some movies the audience bubbles out of the theater after its over   just cause youre stars and you can
Jul 26 2023,positive,interesting movie but way too long especially the first half
Jul 26 2023,positive,great movie could have left out the nudity and done that more tastefully
Jul 26 2023,positive,visually stunning and elegant adaptation an incredibly pougnant and powerful story
Jul 26 2023,positive,movie about the end of the world maybe not the exact intention of the film but i enjoyed it through that lens
Jul 26 2023,negative,sorry to disagree with everyone but honestly  it was 3 hours of my life ill never get back dont get me wrong i knew the subject matter is not cheerful and it was very well done im sure and it will win lots of awards at one point i turned to my partner at the end of the first hour to ask him is it me or is this as boring as old boots and he was fast asleep
Jul 26 2023,positive,current history based on mostly true facts are my favorite movies
Jul 26 2023,positive,fantastic drama intense  dont let the 3 hour running time scare you it went by so fast
Jul 26 2023,positive,its amazing and stunning
Jul 26 2023,positive,pros the movie was great outstanding visuals   cons extremely loud and garbled sound ruined the entire experience
Jul 26 2023,positive,this movie was soo good i loved every moment and considering watching it again in the cinema
Jul 26 2023,positive,finally a true film this is 100 worth the watch
Jul 26 2023,positive,great movie it was the quickest 3 hour movie that i have attended keeps you interested to the end recommended it to all my friends
Jul 26 2023,positive,the story of oppenheimers life mainly concerning the creation of the bomb was interesting to watch on the screen great visuals of what might be going on in his mind
Jul 26 2023,positive,slow burn at the start but does get better i did notice a few bits of misinformation but nothing major and did learn a few things i didnt know about seen barbie too but i feel oppenheimer was better to each his own
Jul 26 2023,positive,a straightforward biopic told it a notsostraightforward way that keeps you interested and engaged even though the movie is three hours long murphy and downey jr are incredible in their performances
Jul 26 2023,positive,is a beautifully shot movie with great acting and a very relevant story to be honest im not so sure it needs to be 3 hours long but still a very enjoyable film
Jul 26 2023,positive,it was good just long
Jul 26 2023,positive,it was a little slow at first but got better later in the movie
Jul 26 2023,positive,history in a movie without too much stretching of the truth  great acting but see it on the big screen
Jul 26 2023,neutral,the story they wanted to show was a great one but they didnt do a good job of making it into film to begin youll be whipped back and forth between scenes unexpectedly and feel like they are racing to finish the film there was no need to race through the story so fast but include long scenes about oppenheimers deposition and a random nude conversation that went on longer than most other scenes that were significantly more important the whole movie felt like they sacrificed quality for quantity while youre being thrown around the whole movie you also have to try drown out the overthetop symphony music that never ceases to end thats not to say the music itself was bad just totally unnecessary for about 70 of the time and highly distracting finally this all summed up to a generally hard movie to connect with and i felt nothing towards any of the characters i never felt emotionally engaged whatsoever     i was so excited to see this movie but i left the cinema utterly disappointed  255
Jul 26 2023,positive,gripping from beginning to end go now
Jul 26 2023,positive,i was absolutely surprised by how well done in this movie was the actors seemed like they were actually the actual person of the time i would recommend this to anyone interested in seeing something spectacular
Jul 26 2023,positive,this was an ok movie  it was slow at first then became a little more interesting i am glad i saw it but i would recommend waiting to see it at home where you can be more comfortable for 3 hours
Jul 26 2023,positive,by far one of the best films in a long time murphy and downey jr were in thier best form and nolans film delivered a film that both satisfied and forewarned i am not much of one to spend the extra to see a film in imax but this one really is a true 3d experience where the feel in the enhanced theatre absolutely adds
Jul 26 2023,negative,incredibly disappointed   im not sure that all the people raving about this movie saw the same film that i did im also suspicious that they are bots purchased by hollywood in the hopes of hyping up this movie to generate more revenue honestly it is three hours of a mediocre biopic that tries to make intense drama out of the questions of oppenheimers true political affiliations his choices in selecting personnel for the manhattan project whether or not he passed on information to the soviets and the tarnishing of his reputation following the war in the mccarthy era  as for the bomb scene i probably couldve done a better job in my backyard throwing some gasoline on a bonfire and combining it with a really loud boom through the audio system of the theater did you know on a clear night the brightness of atomic bomb could cause temporary blindness if you look directly at it within 53 miles however this movie has some dipshit looking at it through the glass of his car and hes completely unaffected the entire movie also gratuitously uses dramatic music in background in the hopes of keeping the viewer engaged  there was a real opportunity here to inform people about the raw power of these weapons in order to spur us to action to have them removed from the face of the earth and it was completely missed the amount of information conveyed in this movie about the devastation of the bombs on the people of japan seem to be delivered as throwaway lines in the movie that we honestly could summarize in about four or five sentences  im not looking for gratuitous violence but the average person doesnt fully understand how prevalent and terrifyingly powerful these weapons are watching the plan a simulation on what a nuclear war would look like is much more powerful than the three hours that i wasted on this movie
Jul 26 2023,positive,not quite what i expected truely its a drama about his life the atom bomb project was only a side note and main note was his history so the movie oppenheimer is strictly about him and not the bomb
Jul 26 2023,positive,it was a bit disjointed but that aside it was a profound story of not just a man but the entire process of the making of the atom bomb and so well done with an incredible cast  it was indeed three hours long but it didnt seem like it
Jul 26 2023,positive,the best movie i have ever seen but if your expecting it to be just about to nuke i wouldnt recommend it and if you love history your gonna absolutely love this movie like me even if your not into history its still a good movie and can teach you a lot and you may get into it
Jul 26 2023,positive,the performances all around were absolutely stunning and the visuals were an absolute masterpiece specifically the detonation of the atomic bomb was one of the greatest sequences i have ever seen in movies my entire life its an intellectually engaging and very complex narrative but very rewarding as a result some of the dialogue felt a bit drab in multiple places especially near the end of the film when oppenheimer is giving his statement but i felt that this was massively overshadowed by the phenomenal cast overall a fantastic movie that i cannot recommend enough
Jul 26 2023,positive,so far i believe this to be one of the best and most important films of the century even though the film is 3 hours long it flies by like butter the editing the music and cinematography pushes you to the next scene clean and fast the film feels intense and scary demanding your attention with every second  i cant get over the governments treatment of oppenheimer and the films haunting ending out of my head the theme and purpose of the film commands discussion and debate about our future with what lies ahead for us please watch this film then create some discourse and action
Jul 26 2023,positive,the movie was not as graphic sexually as the media led me to believe  there was little to no vulgar language  the movie had great acting and portrayed the mans life as far as i know accurately
Jul 26 2023,positive,next best picture acting writing and effects are all amazing 
Jul 26 2023,positive,con really long  pros it was awesome great documentary showing just how corrupt our government truly is and the sacrifices he had to go thru for making something that would forever change history
Jul 26 2023,negative,too much emphasis on post war anticommunism politics  would have been more interested in the difficulties in the development of the nuclear bomb in a relatively short amount of time
Jul 26 2023,positive,this movie was fascinating to ushaving grew up near the secret city and having so mamybfakily members who worked at the plants i am very interested in talk things relatedinteresting story about oppenheimer s involvement
Jul 26 2023,positive,epic movie i was drawn in by every word and scene incredible history lesson amazing acting and editing loved it 
Jul 26 2023,negative,this movie is fuckn horrible an immense waste of time and money
Jul 26 2023,positive,the visual effects were remarkable while devoid of cgi reliance robert downey jr did an amazing performance his dramatic abilities even made ironman believable i would have liked this film to have given more time to the science behind the atomic bomb and less time to the politics behind its development
Jul 26 2023,positive,oppenheimer is a captivating drama helmed by acclaimed director christopher nolan and showcasing cillian murphy in the role of oppenheimer as the renowned physicist overseeing the manhattan projectan undercover initiative during world war ii to develop the atomic bomb this thoughtprovoking film delves into oppenheimers dilemmas ethical conflicts and personal battles while shedding light on the political backdrop against which their groundbreaking work unfolded    nolans mastery of storytelling shines through in this gem skilfully intertwining timelines flashbacks and perspectives to present a multifaceted portrayal of oppenheimera brilliant mind with his fair share of imperfections murphy delivers an enthralling performance as the scientist haunted by his past tormented by his circumstances and uncertain about what lies ahead with subtlety and intensity murphy brings forth oppenheimers struggleshis passion ambition guilt fear and doubtall laid bare for viewers to ponder    the film boasts an excellent supporting cast matt damon embodies general leslie grovesthe leader overseeing the projectwith finesse florence pugh portrays jean tatlockoppenheimers lover with communist sympathiesin a compelling manner that adds complexity to their relationship kenneth branagh beautifully captures niels bohrs essencea mentor and friend to oppenheimer emily blunt embodies kitty oppenheimer robert oppenheimers wife robert downey jrportraying lewis strauss the villain who tried to frame oppenheimer as a communist the list goes on the actors bring a sense of depth and authenticity to their roles making the characters truly memorable and believable    this film goes beyond being a character study it also enters thriller territory it showcases the challenges obstacles and dangers that the project faced ranging from espionage to sabotage to almost insurmountable challenges as the film progresses towards the moment of new mexicos atomic test known as trinity the director skilfully builds up suspense and tension oppenheimer also explores the aftermath of the hiroshima and nagasaki bombings shedding light on their consequences for oppenheimer and the world    visually speaking this film is stunning nolan creates realistic and immersive scenes the brilliant cinematography by hoyte van hoytema captures the contrast between barren desert landscapes and claustrophobic laboratory settings with finesse the score composed by chris fogel adds a haunting touch that enhances the films overall mood and emotional impact the soundtrack is the usual loud one characteristic of nolans movies and its occasionally difficult to hear what is said but overall the movies sound and music intensifies the experience colour is cleverly used to represent different perspectives according to christopher nolan black and white are used for the perspective of lewis strauss colour is used for robert oppenheimers perspective this approach helps us as viewers to keep track of the complex interplay between the two characters    ill mention a couple of drawbacks its length three hours may test some viewers patience due to its occasionally slowpaced nature the film assumes familiarity with physics and history and might isolate some viewers but my advice is to sit back and allow the movie as a whole to wash over you understanding the details of physics is not necessary to appreciate the story the film doesnt extensively explore the ramifications of the bomb and provide the perspectives of its victims which could leave some audience members disappointed or offended there is some treatment of this but it is fleeting compared to the rest of the material in the movie given that the story is a biography of oppenheimer this was probably appropriate but viewers can decide about this    oppenheimer is a movie that offers a captivating glimpse into one of the most influential and controversial individuals of the 20th century it showcases nolans skills and murphys impressive acting abilities its engaging complex and powerful
Jul 26 2023,positive,cillian murphy is great but i found the imposition of loud music by the director a distraction didnt nolan trust his actors to create tension     i also found the plot difficult to follow perhaps because the music made it difficult to hear the dialogue at times
Jul 26 2023,positive,deep and mindful movie which leaves you with a clear awareness of the genius of the cinematography it sharpens all the senses and places the viewer not in the role of judge but in the role of appreciator of christopher nolans genius
Jul 26 2023,positive,a complete cinematic masterpiece with a great cast of actors and a very compelling and captivating storytelling in every detail   nolan you outdid yourself again man 
Jul 26 2023,positive,the movie was a visceral visual experience of a genius flawed man impactful stunning and thought provoking
Jul 26 2023,positive,an immensely absorbing transformative and haunting film about the father of the nuclear bomb that in spite of some things that could have been more accounted for is packed with authentic humanity and a remarkable level of depth that envelops the technical brilliance astoundng performances particularly murphy and downey jr and the truly sensational script and direction by christopher nolan
Jul 26 2023,positive,good plot but very long with 180 minutes
Jul 26 2023,positive,absolute masterpierce doesnt feel like 3 hours keeps you on the edge of your seat all the time must see
Jul 26 2023,positive,amazing movie must recommend with imax
Jul 26 2023,positive,greatest movie i ever watched so far 
Jul 26 2023,positive,graphic nudity ruined it for me totally unneeded for the story i also left movie with more questions than answers overall i was disappointed trailers were better than movie
Jul 26 2023,positive,it was ok but i think my suspicions are confirmed that its being pushed hard to draw attention away from sound of freedom fat man  little boy was a better more informative and far more entertaining movie i realize this movie is supposed to be more about the man and the aftermath rather than the project but i was underwhelmed   i hate the modern the mtv video directing style of short sequences hard cuts and in this case the constant time frame jumping with no referencing i had to constantly refocus my brain from sequence to sequence trying to maintain continuity making it feel like work rather than entertainment its fine for action movies where the story line is secondary to the visual action but not for a drama especially a historical one and of such importance knowing what year it was in any given scene was confusing and annoying   i didnt feel that i got to know the characters or develop sympathy for them  as they say in critic vernacular the characters were not fleshed out  everyone is gushing over cillian murphy but he gave me the notion oppenheimer never knew if he was coming or going maybe they were trying to make him human and relatable while oppenheimer was anything but so they should have gave us that he comes across as fragile shallow and incapable of standing up for himself which we know oppenheimer was not and though i like matt damon he was totally miscast and gave us zero insight into leslie groves but i will say robert downey jr did a good job stepping out of his standard charming rogue routine   the thing that nearly drove me crazy was the incessant and overly loud back ground score that was distracting often making the dialog hard to hear and was not in character with the story or era  movie music is supposed to enhance the scene creating mood and tension not just be there for no reason again mtv  for a viewer that has no historical knowledge of the era oppenheimer the manhattan project and his subsequent black listing i think they would come away saying wtf did i just watch    i didnt hate the movie but i wish i had just waited for prime or netflix especially since i took the reviews advice and paid the extra for imax that didnt warrant the extra price i paid almost 40 for two tickets when i could have seen it for 850 per on a regular screen and much more comfortable seats
Jul 26 2023,positive,a masterpiece i loved it
Jul 26 2023,positive,compared to other nolan films its not great but compared to the drivel other writers are putting out these days its pretty good your mom will not be able to follow the time jumps the acting is fantastic and the agingdeaging is perfectly unnoticeable shots of pughs tatas are gratuitous and disappointing blunts disappointment and disdain in the movie mirror mine for pugh   i wholeheartedly felt that they cut off 90 of the frame when showing the explosion because it was a digital theater instead of imax i dont plan to rewatch it in genuine imax
Jul 26 2023,positive,to be honest even though i regard christopher nolan as one of my favourite when i first heard that oppenheimer was his next film i was a bit skeptical oppenheimer is a dramabiography is a genre nolan has not tackled before so i was not sure how this one would come out and was cautious to jump on the hype of the barbenheimer craze but    after watching the film i realise my doubt was misplaced and i have grown significantly more respect and appreciation for nolans work oppenheimer was an amazing film despite it being nearly three hours long i was really impressed how they managed to give the film a fast pace the film never really felt like it slowed down the intensity was constant throughout in a weird way it felt like the ticking of a time bomb always progressing to something bigger
Jul 26 2023,positive,emotional powerful movie historically accurate i need watch again to catch the subtleties in the beginning of the movie
Jul 26 2023,positive,has to be watched in imax to be truly appreciated christopher nolan has chiseled his masterpiece this film isnt for everyone though its about theoretical nuclear physics and its true to its source material this movie has locked down at least four oscars already best picture christopher nolan best director christopher nolan best actor cillian murphy and best supporting actor robert downey jr
Jul 26 2023,positive,oppenheimer ls on of christopher nolans best films ever with the all star cast makes this film one of the best films of 2023 by miles this awesome film will be in the films of the year by miles and miles oppenhelmer has one of the best all star cast you must see this film only mission lmpossble dead reckoning part one and indiana jones and the dial of destiny are both awesome films you must see theres 3 films on the big screen if you see all 3 films you will be in the cinema for about 9 hours
Jul 26 2023,positive,while it is a little lengthy oppenheimer is a great film with a star studded cast can get a bit confusing at times with all the names that are thrown around the overall plot is terrific with some scenes that will definitely leave a lasting impression this film is very heavy on dialogue and can probably do without some scenes nonetheless it is an amazing movie that i highly recommend
Jul 26 2023,positive,based on the trailer i was expecting something like dunkirk but got something more like the prestige so at first i was a bit surprised but when i accepted this is something different i enjoyed it immensely it is a bit like the prestige and the social network had a love child cillian murphys performance one of the best ive ever seen it was his charisma that connected the whole build of short flashes into different phases of oppenheimers life and absolutely no bad performances in this film at all
Jul 26 2023,positive,the editing is so unique and fast paced the sound design and score are tense and hauntingly beautiful acting is top notch by the ensemble and murphy shines in his first leading role watch on the biggest screen possible this is truly an experience of a film
Jul 26 2023,positive,outstanding a very interesting insight into abomb development highlighting political issues which i wasnt aware of yet remarkably the story is extremely fast paced with tension and intensity maintained throughout in typical nolan style a powerful and emotional movie with excellent audio to drive home the intensity so you feel every scene imax experience recommended
Jul 26 2023,positive,best movie i have seen in over 20 years dont miss this one in imax
Jul 26 2023,negative,didnt pass the bechdel test and didnt credit their artist
Jul 26 2023,positive,a great movie done fantastically
Jul 26 2023,neutral,the overall story as how its told on this historical figure is intense fast paced and interesting however to summarize youre looking at a 3 hour talking back to back different time scenes kind of movie that was just boring in general i even heard an audience member snore in the background haha
Jul 26 2023,positive,what a masterpiece kept me completely engaged for 3 full hours pacing acting writing cinematography soundtrack all fantastic only a few flaws that are too insignificant to mention
Jul 26 2023,positive,oppenheimer keeps an entertaining pace despite the length of this massive tale but somehow i didnt connect with any character very emotionally maybe thats the price paid with a film where the real focus is not on the protagonist but on the story a vital cautionary appeal as we step off this cliff into the age of ai just as oppenheimer led us off the cliff into the atomic age
Jul 26 2023,positive,instant classic   an intimate film that rests on the interpretive capacity of firstrate actors
Jul 26 2023,positive,fantastic even with a bare bone understanding of physics and just the history behind the great minds of physics it was great to understand how oppenheimer was able to build and create a bomb that has the capabilities of just destroying the world the visuals are also spectacular as with any nolan movie and although the audiomixing could have been better the soundtrack is fantastic and it really brings you into the world of oppenheimers mind and what he is going through
Jul 26 2023,positive,awesome movie michael
Jul 26 2023,positive,and the oscar goes to      this is not an imax movie there is no reason whatsoever to see this film in that format perfectly fine to see it at your local cinema
Jul 26 2023,positive,top rate acting directing and cinematography
Jul 26 2023,positive,absolutely recommend for any science and politics geek personally the best work of nolan
Jul 26 2023,positive,the movie was good but for 3 hours i wanted more history even science i would have liked to have seen something about the aftermath of the bomb and the consequences i didnt need as much backstory of his relationships the acting was fantastic i didnt need the biology parts i would have liked more history of his life after the hearings the movie was well done and should win awards the imax theater was terrible and the seats were uncomfortable 
Jul 26 2023,positive,oppenheimer itself is a great movie as always it has the markings of a christopher nolan epic great cinematography interesting shots a story that unfolds before you and a cast of characters that every viewer can appreciate however where oppenheimer succeeds in storytelling provocative thought and the study of its characters  it lacks variability there are plenty of great moments but at times the dialogue between characters dominates the screen leaving some breathing room to be desired for those looking for a more thrilling experience
Jul 26 2023,positive,one of my favorite movies of all time
Jul 26 2023,positive,absolutely intense a masterpiece rollercoaster of emotion cillian murphy the goat
Jul 26 2023,positive,id say this movie could have been about 30 minutes shorter i get the detail had to be shown in the build up to the bomb but there was so many characters to have to try and remember to deal with but none the less the visuals and acting is very very impressive id choose to watch this again over barbie
Jul 26 2023,positive,wasnt sure what to expect but ended up absolutely glued to my seat loved it
Jul 26 2023,positive,i would called this a cinematic masterpiece except for the terrible soundmixing choice very questionable decision to muffle the voices  i felt like i was under water throughout most of the movie  i would have questioned the theaters speakers if i hadnt just watched mission impossible there just a week before with crystal clear audio  i had hard time understanding the lines despite knowing the whole story  christopher nolans movies are progressively getting worse and worse in terms of vocal comprehension     heres what i loved   acting performances  transcendental performance by cillian murphy  oscar nod should be in the bag  magnificent ensemble cast the moral dilemma was captured from a mans perspective and also his suffering from being turning into a villain for the very creating he was tasked to do in order to reduce casualties of an endless war  creators of this film know how to capture the pain and suffering pretty well as nolan is the master of dramatizing those moments for the big screen
Jul 26 2023,positive,one of the best movies ive seen so far  it is a masterpiece by nolan with a perfect cast where cillian murphy and robert downey jr extraordinarily highlight his talent surprising me a little more robert with his acting quality at the height that this film deserves     it is possible to combine science and politics with a very deep and catastrophic story a very rigid and complex protagonist and a very rich and enjoyable middle and end despite the number of important and historical names and characters in that context to understand and not miss any detail     what surprises me the most is the naturalness of the interpretations  in addition being able to put yourself in oppenheimers place makes you feel how important that moment was in the history of humanity and you realize the many atrocities that human beings can become or do     it is a spectacular movie  a film with a very strong and dramatic context  nolan gets almost everything right here
Jul 26 2023,positive,great acting captivating movie draws you in
Jul 26 2023,positive,amazing performances all the way around great tragic story stunning visuals long but kept my interest
Jul 26 2023,negative,i am shredding my scalp in an effort to understand why i was in no way nourished or entertained by this film  perhaps the complexity of the subject matter proved too much for nolan  you have the physics  and you have the war  and you have all those relationships  those within the community of physicists and those that involved a government that would have to depend on an academic who was not only eccentric and esoteric but also left leaning throughout our governments ambivalent relationship with a communist ally we expected to take on once fascism was overcome  the ingredients were there  discovery  war  relationships  and yet     not even an imax theatre could save this film  nolan had the rudiments of a story  he had the moviemaking and movieshowing technology  he had the money and the support of hollywoods a list  its safe to say anyone in the film was his first choice   he just didnt have the writing  he neglected to bring it all together through the magic of a good script  everything about this slice of history is existential whether you are talking about the survival of the earth the free world or a few careers marriages and reputations  i had no feel for the stakes or the risks  it seemed nolan was never quite finished introducing new characters and by the time we were introduced to the bomb itself  spoiler alert  ho hum  there was nothing to invest in  nothing to root for  yeah i know  how could that be  we were fighting fascists  we were fighting communists  and we were fighting overzealous anticommunist politicians and bureaucrats who destroyed lives and livelihoods in the tradition of mccarthy   so   why was this generously financed 3hour hollywood production that much less effective at moving me than pbs documentaries on each of the principal antagonists above  why was i moved more by ford v ferrari  i am a trained scientist with interests that include physics cosmology and mass hysteria  that include the history philosophy and politicization of science  i dont give a redacted about racing cars   i expected to learn a lot more from this film than i did  i expected to experience a scale  an atmosphere  a vista  but this film had no aesthetic  no heart  no rhythm  no soul  this movie does not rock  despite the musical score and the late spate of urgent dramatic cuts and edits
Jul 26 2023,positive,insanely good would recommend to anyone with even a slight interest past and present events through the film add a level of tension to every moment the pace was slightly slow but the details in each shot and dialogue made it an amazing movie
Jul 26 2023,positive,cillian murphy deserves an oscar phenomenal performance from him absolute must watch
Jul 26 2023,positive,this is one of the best movies ive seen in recent times this is art 
Jul 26 2023,negative,it was absolutely horrible literally had no idea what was happening why was it suddenly black and white at times and then colored why were they in court literally didnt clarify anything also it was soooo long 3 hours  thats absolutely absurd disappointed i dont know who the director is but i have the worst impression of him or her and i fail to understand how this movie was even successful
Jul 26 2023,positive,absolute brilliance with every scene the dialogue music score and overall filmmaking deserving of every oscar
Jul 26 2023,positive,so intriguing and incredible a little longer than i would perfer but 1010 film
Jul 26 2023,positive,i was excited and pleased about nearly every aspect of oppenheimer and felt no negativity regarding historical content and visual presentation including the movies clarity color and contrast but while i have general familiarity of the manhattan project thanks to skimming through general grovess now it can be told the story of the manhattan projectavailable at us dot archive dot orgit would have been very helpful for all main characters in the story to have their names and official position titles shown as subtitles  aside from that minor quibble the movie itself was outstanding  length was acceptable for a complex issue like this  one warning i would give to imax 70mm viewersvolume seemed excessive  yes i realize everyone wants to hear the atomic bomb detonate but honestly is 125 db really necessary  granted its imax and the theater is anxious to showcase the technology to its customers but my ears rang for hours after the movie  i have had a bit of preexisting tinnitus before seeing oppenheimer in imax but here it is two days later and i still have the incessant ringing louder than normal  please pleaselower the volume to 110 db five rows from the back center seat  that is plenty loud even for nuclear weapons  great movierecommended
Jul 26 2023,positive,so many words to describe this movie but the ones that come to mind are amazing gripping eye opening and horrific truly a must see and must know so many genres woven together to tell a complex story cillian murphy as oppenheimer truly delivers a performance that is magnetizing christopher nolan and his team continue to raise the bar with exceptional and top notch filmmaking
Jul 26 2023,positive,beautifully done movie for such a hard and humbling story
Jul 26 2023,positive,wonderful show great cast probably award material
Jul 26 2023,negative,wanted to like it more
Jul 26 2023,positive,the writing directing and acting was excellent this movie will be a contender for many oscar nominations
Jul 26 2023,positive,cinematography and score are amazing  writing leaves a lot to be desired  oppenheimerstrauss dynamic is not worthy of being the crux of the movie
Jul 26 2023,positive,oscars guaranteed when i say is worth is definitely worth it all the actors and effects and everything about this film was wonderful done as professionally coming from nalon himself watch with imax is definitely worth it
Jul 26 2023,positive,great movie but at times moved a little slow  really no need for 3hrs could have cut 25 minutes easily  but excellent acting
Jul 26 2023,positive,christopher nolan produces his greatest film to date the film shows the audience the story of the manhattan project during ww2 including the internal conflicts on the characters how the bomb was made the outcome of the bomb you get to see famous historical characters such as truman and einstein christopher nolan is telling the story of a man who had genuine intentions from his work and yet had the more dire of consequences on humanity the fact that this story is completely true makes it all the more scary a must watch
Jul 26 2023,positive,with as much hype as this film has gotten i had very high expectations before seeing it in imax as far as the 70mmimax landscapes and closeups of faces i wasnt as impressed as i was with hateful 8 the nm dessert while huge and vast seemed overcast and monotone brown the rumbling and shaking gag to show his inner turmoil gets old after the first three times nolan should have left that for his scifi films the score and sound rumbling running throughout made the actors inaudible at times this might be better at home     as for the arguments and questions here i would have liked to have seen an argument against the use of those two bombs rather than an argument against unregulated applied science there is still a rhetoric and common mythologypropaganda in the us that the us had to drop them or worse that the is should have done worse to japan a film like this can start a conversation to deal with those issues the chopped up narrative long hearing and confusing dialog dont help     critics seem to be focusing on superficial fun facts about oppenheimer that are lazily written here in a few info dumps forgets to eat slept around didnt follow news interested in old religious texts and so on it seems like a quick outline from american promethius overall this should be better with these actors and budget it doesnt live up to the hype but there is some great acting here from a few actors
Jul 26 2023,positive,oscars left right and center very well made movie
Jul 26 2023,positive,one of the best movies i have ever watched
Jul 26 2023,positive,this movie is based more on fact than on dramatic liberties the film does run a bit long but it covers a lot of oppenheimers life and the trials he faced before during and after the creation of the bomb this is another nolan masterpiece
Jul 26 2023,positive,this movie was absolutely amazing i have lately been bored and unexited by any media tv shows movies etc but this was a breath of fresh air the movie is as the title implies about oppenheimer and not the bomb it is from his point of view not a documentary about the bomb i really loved seeing some of the most famous scientists of the 20th century like richard feynman enrico fermi neils bohr etc even if it was only for brief moments i recommend knowing some context of his life before watching the movie but it can still be quite well understood without it the 3 hours do not feel boring at all i was a little disappointed with the explosion since you could tell that it was a smaller recreation which i feel could have been avoided by using a bit of cgi but the tension leading upto it and the silence during the explosion made up for it but i get it its not for all audiences since it you have to immersed into the story to like it this is a movie that can only be truly enjoyed in a movie theatre
Jul 26 2023,positive,wow just wow this movie is an absolute masterpiece from the start to the end with brilliant performances from the likes of cillian murphy robert downey jr and emily blunt this movies deep dive into the emotions and actions of j robert oppenheimer is one of the greatest representations of history to ever glance the big screen with every second that passed i became more and more intrigued by the strange events of oppenheimers life the sights sounds and rumblings of the film only added to this feeling of fascination many may drag this movie due to its 3hour runtime but the sheer beauty of this film makes it only feel like half of that nolans brilliance is the driving factor that made oppenheimer the smash hit it is i fully expect to see gold statues in the hands of many involved in this project come march
Jul 26 2023,positive,great acting great story the scenes with nudity were absolutely unnecessary detracted from the movie rather than enhancing it
Jul 26 2023,positive,let me begin by stating that i am currently rating the film as very good because it has an interesting concept and had a compelling execution however this rating comes with an asterisk as i want to rewatch it in order to get a better feeling for it and give my final rating because of the complexity of the story at the start of the film i had a bit of a hard time following everything that was going on the story wasnt linear and so much was going on all at once nonetheless i would like to praise the cast especially oppenheimer himself cillian murphy for such a great job and compelling acting in this role he truly made you want to root for him in the times of his success but also feel for him at his lowest moments even more so when you see him facing the moral dilemma and consequences of what he helped creiate the other cast member that i want to spotlight for his role is the man himself robert downey jr i went into the film thinking he would get a scene or two but to my surprise and delight rdj is the second most important character in this story he commanded each and every scene he was in and showed why he is a star i would also like to recognize the films score and wonderful visuals all throughout the film
Jul 26 2023,positive,this powerful movie needs to be seen in a theatre the sound visuals and bigger than life affect make it worth the price of a ticket it is a powerful movie with all the politics of the day in play dont miss this it is that good and important in understanding  how the most development in human history came together it is a great movie
Jul 26 2023,negative,there is a war that have been going on between ukraine and russia  nato is not able to do anything in fact a lot of people have died due to the fact that there are way too many political issues  it has been a year  and now this movie appears  i have not seen it   i will not see it due to my principles  chirstopher bland  decided to bring up something historical  taking advantage of a very terrifying conjuncture  yet money takes over life  how many people have died since the beginning of this war  yet money is more important than dying  money is more important that buildings being totally destroyed  it has to do with the fact of taking advantage of current horrible things  bringing up the fact of an atomic bomb it is ever so cynic  i will never see this movie  i believe the fact of bringing it out it is a horrible phenomenon that needs to be understood  why oppenheimer was never brought before in this way  terrible propanga  i think this is a terrible mistake  very wrong  and i will share my thoughts in the media  i think people without principles always want to make money  i am denouncing it a hundred per cent
Jul 26 2023,positive,extremely good loved cinematography but it was a lot of info to take in and got lost but still fire
Jul 26 2023,positive,this was a very  ntense  authentic to the best of my knowledge historically accurate  movieaward winning actorswriteri etcmusic score by ludvig goranson very intense  however supportive of the movie narrative the biggest problem i had was the blasted spanish inquisition joseph macarthy style witch hunt style and i must add kangaroo court inquiry during the last section of the movievery tedious very much intense dark and disturbing depiction it was never the less historically accurate to the very best of my knowledge i must say i really do not believe in the slightest way that dr robert j oppenheimer was in any way a traitor to his country ok so he may have had communist affiations as a younger manbig deal and or so the buttons on your shirt for heavens sake  my point here is that dr oppenheimer did so much for his country and the world by creating the atomic bomb so much good and bad came out of  the insanty of the arms race yes howevernuclear power plants and the atomic energy commission also came out of the development of the nuclear bomb as well i very adamantly insist and demand this out weighs or trivializes any fear mongering or hysteria towards dr oppenheimers communist affiliations in the 1930s prewar period and during the 1940s war period as welli hope you enjoyed my feed back
Jul 26 2023,positive,so i had very high expectations going into this movie while i mostly agree with this reviews take on it being a bit bloated or lengthy stuffed etc murphy and downey jrs performances overshadow that by a mile not one of my favorite christopher nolan movies although i will always love his scores 45 stars
Jul 26 2023,positive,solid movie good to see a biopic about a person who has revolutionized the way war is done no other format can do justice the way imax does for this movie
Jul 26 2023,negative,boring and slow fell asleep and would not recommend this one
Jul 26 2023,negative,it feels like since interstellar and dunkirk nolan has lost his touch that once had me mesmerized they should have showed footage of hitler and behind enemy lines footages of the race to make the bomb or at least the bomb dropping on hiroshima way too much dialogue and hard to follow for me 
Jul 26 2023,positive,one of the best movies ive ever seen how they managed to simultaneously capture unearthly dread and unparalleled excitement into singular scenes was absolutely magnificent to behold cinematography was good acting was good sound design was good i have many critiques but i do admit most of them are nitpicks and largely trivial an absolute mustsee
Jul 26 2023,positive,excellent acting all around loved every minute of the movie
Jul 26 2023,positive,very intense kept me so focused i loved the actors they did a fantastic job
Jul 26 2023,positive,best movie ive seen in a long time
Jul 26 2023,positive,i liked the way it looked the issues that were touched on and the acting i disliked how long it was and how the movies story line went back and forth in flashbacks i felt that was very distracting and confusing for covering such a long and detailed story also would have liked seeing more of the human tragedy during and after the atomic bomb was used overall a good movie but i wouldnt pay to see it twice
Jul 26 2023,positive,christopher nolan uses all of hes knowledge to build this movie about such a complex man
Jul 26 2023,positive,a masterpiece from beginning to end
Jul 26 2023,positive,the movie was fantastic and it didnt feel like it was 3 hours at all i was on the edge of my seer for like 90 of the movie
Jul 26 2023,positive,his life was so fascinating  some of the going back and forth was hard to follow but all in all i loved it
Jul 26 2023,negative,way way too long would have been better as a 35 part docu series good acting slow plot line
Jul 26 2023,positive,its nice to see a movie thats long enough to tell an entire story without feeling like parts were left out because the director felt he had to rush to fit it into a twohour time constraint people can sit through a welldone threehour movie     oppenheimer starts out a bit slow but the story eventually picks up pace there are places when the plot is a bit confusing as the years of the story are switching back and forth between pre and postbomb development in my mind this makes it a movie that needs to be seen a second time knowing a bit of history always helps in following historical movies watching a few videos about the development of the bomb and oppenheimer would help before seeing the movie    the acting was really good many of the actors are quite like the people they portray id be reluctant about taking kids younger than 15 to the movie due to some scenes of sexual intercourse and nudity     i think the discussions of moral and scientific issues regarding the destructive capabilities of the weapon they were designing were handled in a wellbalanced manner ive had a conversation with a friend who had known einstein and talked about how he and other scientists formed a group after the bombings and wrote to future presidents advocating that all atom bombs be destroyed and never used again     the only criticism i had was in the theatre we were in the sound was so loud that all the music and background sound overwhelmed the dialog and made it really hard to hear any spoken words im getting old
Jul 26 2023,positive,incredible story and well acted
Jul 26 2023,positive,absolutely loved it i am a huge cillian murphy fan and he was amazing in this movie top notch acting all around i do love movies directed by c nolan well done
Jul 26 2023,positive,oppenheimer is an amazing movie and its very interesting to see this historic event by the hands of nolan
Jul 26 2023,negative,long boring first two hours snoring in audience dont believe the hype poor script overdone soundmusic good acting and last hour was interesting but lots of nodding off throughout the film and not worth the ticket price imo
Jul 26 2023,positive,oppenheimer is an important movie for our age  i believe it complicates current and past notions of the bombs dropped on japan  and i appreciated these historical revision but oppenheimer also simplifies the role of many historical figures  particularly women  who are represented as shallow simple players in his story until the end when his wife finds a voice   i was concerned with the interactions oppenheimer has with his personal relationships in the film and left very unconvinced why did he even need to disclose to his first girl that he got someone else pregnant  were they even seriously seeing each other   another thing that was jarring was that the moral implications of working on the bomb were only realized after we dropped them did he have no sense of destruction they would cause  i would probably never watch the film again unfortunately it was not convincing from a historical perspective nor was it convincing from a regular entertainment perspective
Jul 26 2023,neutral,too much time was spent dealing with his political battles  i was expecting more time spent on showing his prowess in being the person who successfully proved that nuclear fission was not just a theory but could be a source of energy as well a weapon of war
Jul 26 2023,positive,fabulous i was engrossed from beginning to end
Jul 26 2023,positive,great movie full of a lot of history that i must have slept through in high school it was well acted riveting and i was on the edge of my seat for a lot of the move a bit long but i was never bored academy award winners for sure
Jul 26 2023,positive,it didnt seem like 3 hours wonderfully acted by every character on the screen downey murphy and damon are excellent yes there are those small flags on a stick that were 50 stars while the larger more official flags had 48 but thats okay tom conti as einstein was a nice cherry on top of everything else rated r for a reason barelyand worth the ticket and time to invest in
Jul 26 2023,negative,the acting in this movie is phenomenal and the ending scene ties everything up in a nice bow the movie itself though was probably the most boring thing ive ever seen in my life its soooooo longgggggg the last 45 minutes are so unnecessary and all over the place  anyone who says that they liked this movie are just pretending to its right up there with once upon a time in hollywood in the extreamly overrated category solid 25
Jul 26 2023,positive,amazing great movie edge of your seats and that explosion wow made me jump
Jul 26 2023,neutral,too much mind numbing information not nearly enough action or suspense
Jul 26 2023,positive,amazing film paced extremely well with outstanding writing and acting most absorbing film i have seen the most impactful movie ending of all time perfecting from christopher nolan
Jul 26 2023,positive,easily one of the greatest biopics put to film and some of the greatest performances ever murphy and downey are sensational
Jul 26 2023,positive,i never knew the ppl behind the manhattan project not even oppenheimer himself the movie brought that out for me very interesting and well made ill watch it again
Jul 26 2023,positive,this review is going to be extremely controversial but i have very mixed feelings on oppenheimer on one hand the film is made beautifully and its an amazing biopic on one of the most if not the most important physicists in history on the other hand in terms of entertainment i found it hard to get into the film as i am not someone who typically enjoys history and was just waiting for the movie to end after a certain point probably around the 2 hour mark i would not consider oppenheimer to be a bad or even mediocre movie by any stretch of the imagination in fact i would even recommend it but i dont see myself revisiting it anytime soon if ever
Jul 26 2023,positive,fastest 3 hours of my life what an experience
Jul 26 2023,positive,simply amazing the intro to the film was super hooking the music creates an insane amount of suspense and the ending was very well made
Jul 26 2023,positive,exciting and very gripping  excellent story line and a lot of famous scientists are portrayed very well
Jul 26 2023,positive,detailed and intense great imagery not counting the explosions themselves
Jul 26 2023,positive,excellent movie  i highly reccomend it
Jul 26 2023,positive,a powerful well acted character study with tight direction an intelligent script breathing taking visuals and a cast for the ages
Jul 26 2023,positive,excellent film it gives us insight into the weight on their shoulders with such a devastating weapon while simulatenously showing us their brilliance
Jul 26 2023,positive,i was 100 in to a three hour movie it started off slowly and then pulled me in the characters were unbelievably well cast and i ended up loving every minute the story was a lot more than i thought going in i will definitely rent when available sometime in the future its good enough to watch again 
Jul 26 2023,positive,this movie was amazing it was a little heavy but it perfectly encapsulates the turmoil of oppenheimers life and is one of the greatest movies of the year
Jul 26 2023,positive,great moviethe three hours went by quickly  i did put the information together better after watching the movie about j robert oppenheimer for the second time
Jul 26 2023,positive,while the movie was well acted and told an interesting story i gave oppenheimer just an average review the movie is 3 hours long and tries to tell to many side stories that dont hold the audience interest there are too many characters which makes it hard to follow at times definitely interesting from a historical perspective but the length and diverse story telling took away from the enjoyment of the movie
Jul 26 2023,positive,first hour was completely confusing as it jumped between characters and time periods
Jul 26 2023,positive,visually riveting  accurate portrayal of an era which most young people do not know  historically accurate  the director and screen writers take us into oppenheimers mind
Jul 26 2023,positive,yet again nolan fails to disappoint oppenheimer was a daunting grim biopic about one of the most controversial events in all human history phenomenal performances minute details and pure peakcinematography amalgamate to retell the real life story of dr jr oppenheimer and the manhattan project the film does not force its viewers to choose but rather ponder on the ethics behind the creation and utilization of weapons of mass destructiona relatively novel idea that will surely continue to haunt the world and make its inhabitants consider the morality of having such power however oppenheimer although undoubtedly a masterpiece is not a movie for everyone with its fairly long running time and dialogueheavy context some audiences may not be able to understand the story and appreciate the cinematic artistry in their entirety the second world war and its key players are long gone but the lessons they teach are embedded in the political cultural and social contributions we have seen throughout the decades pastoppenheimer being one of them additionally to further commemorate the performances give cillian murphy his oscar already
Jul 26 2023,positive,definitely one of the top films from nolan the visuals were stunning and the sound design was even more mind blowing especially in imax and a ending the left me silent
Jul 26 2023,positive,oppenheimer is a powerful and thoughtprovoking film that is sure to stay with you long after youve seen it i highly recommend it
Jul 26 2023,positive,this deserves best picture and cillian deserves best actor for this would be a shame if they both didnt win
Jul 26 2023,positive,for what it was it was absolutely beautiful true art
Jul 26 2023,positive,great film unnecessary sex and the loudest volume in any movie ive ever seenbut an excellent film
Jul 26 2023,positive,usually the trailers contain the best parts of a movie but i was thrilled that the film was so much more interesting than could be shown in a three minute clip it was fascinating to see brilliant people work to create something from nothing on a personal level it was also satisfying to see the emotional fall out that can happen when dealing with the should we do things just because we can     cillian murphy did a magnificent job of portraying oppenheimer and i didnt even recognize robert downey jr until he spoke i liked an older matt damon as well though its less easy to forget youre watching him act great 3 hour movie an easy way to learn a bit about history too
Jul 26 2023,positive,powerful story skillfully told by excellent actors and director
Jul 26 2023,positive,i loved the actors and actress the story was good great acting it seemed real there will definitely be awards given for this it had a smooth flow to it it was about quantum physics and i like that einstein was in it my favorite scientist
Jul 26 2023,positive,this movie was a very interesting story beautifully shot with great acting especially by robert downey jr emily blunt i guess the actor who played oppenheimer was good he was just so weird although his emotional struggles were very heart wrenching and welldone brad pitt was good at firstthen i thought he overacted and became almost comical to me the last hour was spellbinding and chilling  however the movie itself was an hour too long and lagged in the middle each of the four of us nodded off at times three stars because serious editing was needed
Jul 26 2023,negative,totally unnecessary nude scenes all the names and flashbacks flashforward scenes were hard to follow
Jul 26 2023,positive,the movie was interesting but overall too long there were some nice moments in the film but the film took too long to get to the main plot events the shifter between the past and present which was distracting but not difficult to follow
Jul 26 2023,positive,amazing movie one of the best sight and sound films of the decade one of nolans best the performances were exceptional watched in imax and the cinematopgraphy and the sound was amazing has some really creative visuals especially when the bomb goes off
Jul 26 2023,positive,a lot of huge releases this summer this being one of the huge due to its critics following directed by one of hollywoods high class directors mr christopher nolan firstly the biography of the scientist is very well portrayed with factual history in my opinion there could have been more entertainment factors added to engage the audience more the movie is 3 hours long in length which does make it seem very slow half the audience were asleep the beauty of nolan is he doesnt make it seem that there are any unnecessary scenes in the movie it feels required the acting performances are excellent main lead by cillian murphy he has also appeared in mr nolans previous hits in smaller roles but now i feel he got the deserving role his body language and expressions as oppeheimer are fantastic living the character following other big names too like r d j with a good performance too as an antagonist now the best part about the movie is the sparkling cinematography which lead the audience eyes shining i watched this in imax 70 mm on the best screen possible so i cant talk about the regular but im sure it still shows its worth taking 70 mm from what i saw the other good thing was the sound design also exceptional makes you feel your in the movie every time there is a bomb the audience gets a jumps care the whole audience in my theatre didnt say a word for the whole movie even though it was a full house no seats available even though it was a weekday overall a slow but sparkling watch for the fans slow but sparkling
Jul 26 2023,positive,fantastic movie one of nolans best
Jul 26 2023,positive,im a history buff  just shows how some sleazy politicians tried to take credit
Jul 26 2023,positive,as with a lot of movies some props were wrong example a receiver used as a test set for the initiators
Jul 26 2023,positive,imagery dialogue actors film perfection this film will be sweeping the oscars next year
Jul 26 2023,positive,very very interesting   amazing and shocking i highly recommend this movie going back and forth in time made some facts confusing interesting approach to telling the story
Jul 26 2023,positive,wonderful movie of a  true tragedy  very real and factual great actors
Jul 26 2023,positive,mixed feelings storyline was at times good and at times boring character development was similarthe length did not help
Jul 26 2023,positive,excellent movie  there was nothing i disliked in the movie
Jul 26 2023,positive,would have been a great twohour movie unfortunately it was three
Jul 26 2023,positive,excellent good time line and source of history
Jul 26 2023,positive,great movie with some really powerful quotes throughout one of the best ending and opening lines ever however a little slow paced all in all a very good movie with lots of insane visuals and powerful scenes
Jul 26 2023,positive,great story and amazing score
Jul 26 2023,positive,an absolute masterpiece well done this is how you get people to come out to the movies 
Jul 26 2023,positive,oppenheimer is the by far of of the best biopic put into the big screen in a long time the film details oppenheimers life from the building of the atomic bomb and the court trails that nearly ruined oppenheimers public image the acting is phenomenal i took me quite a while to figure out that i was looking at robert downey jr the film itself is well researched and gives an accurate display of the events that unfolded in real life the bw filters seemed odd and randomly placed on the first viewing but upon finding out that the bw was supposed to represent events that were objectively proven to happen and color was speculation of events i found the movie even more enjoyable the bomb i would like to note is also very accurate to real life when real atomic bombs go off its more like lightning the light and mushroom cloud will reach the observer long before the sound does so extra points for accuracy one problem the movie suffered from was the unnecessary sex scene surly they could have shot that scene without the boobs right overall great movie i would recommend this movie to people how are mature do not take a kids to this film obviously i feel it needs to be said because im positive some people dont listen to ratings
Jul 26 2023,positive,an absolute cenimatic achievement incredibly acted and directed
Jul 26 2023,positive,this movie was beautifully done with an exceptional cast it told of the push of us government to assemble world reknown scientists  oppenheimer fermi to develop an atomic weapon before nazi germany the weight of this fete and the moral implication of introducing the world to weapons of mass   destruction was accurately portrayed 5 star movie it made 3 hours fly by and gave me a greater appreciation of  the serious times we faced
Jul 26 2023,positive,need to watch it with subtitles and rewatch it again to catch everything but it was fantastic
Jul 26 2023,negative,from exploiting florence pugh to the bomb having all but 3 minutes of screen time from horrific editing to absolutely unnecessary nudity unbelievably bad story telling and film editing
Jul 26 2023,positive,oppenheimer is one of the best films ive seen in years  gripping performances and excellent story  the writing makes each character come alive  cant help but believe every part of it
Jul 26 2023,positive,the visuals were enthralling but the story telling really brings you into the personalities and the heavy nature of the conflicts and issues at hand outstanding definitely would recommend watching it on imax 70mm
Jul 26 2023,positive,misleading trailer i was under the impression of watching a classy action movie on big screen but the movie turns out to be more of a drama suitable for home screen
Jul 26 2023,positive,nolan delivers again in his grand nolan fashion great story characters story cinematography music score i can write all day about the positives 
Jul 26 2023,positive,it was a great movie giving it four stars cause it was too long
Jul 26 2023,positive,the movie makes you wrestle with the idea of having such great power did we use such great judgement  there are no words for the people who died because of those choices  even to this day with so much inconsistent truths and such  we are thankful for the one true truth who keeps us on the way
Jul 26 2023,positive,one of the best films ive ever seen a masterclass in film making
Jul 26 2023,positive,one of the best movies that i have ever seen  i highly recommend this movie just amazing from the first second to the last
Jul 26 2023,positive,this film is a biopic of the life of j robert oppenheimer a nuclear physicist during the period of time he spearheaded the development of the atomic bomb it deals with not only the project and its impact on the lives of robert and others but also with the time period after when the government trials him     i have to give credit to nolan i was seriously expecting to be antsy and feel this run time given the minimal to no action but i was compelled for the three hour runtime the script is written in masterful fashion jumping between time periods leaving key clues and context unanswered until later and giving a real weight and importance to every conversation the manner in which the story unfolds is unconventional and polished  nolans ability to tell a riveting and intelligent story stays unrivalled apart from the script i loved the little stylistic touches that embellish the entire film during close ups of oppenheimer we often see intentional focus racking breathing really showing us his unstable and conflicted mental state like he is ready to collapse due to the pressure apart from this almost every scene where a face is involved there is a subtle zoom happening drawing me in making it feel interesting the sound design is superb with its jarringly loud explosions beautiful score and a plethora of subjective expressive sounds which really add to scenes every single scene oppenheimer is in there is light contrast on his face one side brighter one darker the lighting is never flattering making him appear troubled weathered and rugged     i really wish i did some mild research beforehand i am extremely ignorant on this man and even this section of history so i found some sections a bit confusing i was trying to take in the general scene composition but also piece together what is happening and why im specifically talking about the last section of the movie where the court and interrogations take centre stage my mind was constantly running in the background because i didnt understand why oppenheimer was being tried and by who exactly if i had a bit of context beforehand i would have appreciated this section so much more     that isnt really a complaint as i could have easily missed a piece of dialogue or detail so here are my complaints the film felt a little convoluted it throws enough minor characters at you to fill a warehouse and i was constantly taken out of the movie trying to remind myself who a character is what their importance is and where wed last seen them the final 30 mins or so where we constantly jump from downys black and white scenes to oppenheimers interrogation room  it lost me the issue is with a film this dense where every single line and detail matters is becoming confused snowballs extremely quickly as events and conversations carry on or maybe its just me i felt like the los alamos section of the film was the pinnacle with tightly paced scenes and conversations high intensity and intrigue and an explosion that was technically and stylistically executed to what id consider perfection the last hour of the movie i felt dragged and it sort of felt like a slow death of my interest until the credits rolled     overall oppenheimer is a layered character piece where nolan weaves an intelligent story of inward and outer destruction burden and government deceit its visuals and sound compliment the script exceptionally but some sections feel like they drag behind others
Jul 26 2023,positive,best movie ive seen in a very long time i got to see it in 70mm  its totally worth the extra cost
Jul 26 2023,positive,the cinematography acting and the overall historical accuracy of the plot made this film absolutely stunning and entertaining perfect cinematic project in my opinion
Jul 26 2023,positive,its not worth the imax price you will not get the same devastation feelings with nuclear films like hbos chernobyl its really only a biography of oppenheimer they advertised it like a nuclear fallout film due to being screened on imax there is nothing nuclear in it completely biographical and nothing more
Jul 26 2023,positive,truly a masterpiece this is not a dopamine film if you want that seek elsewhere this is a thinking mans film yet i urge everyone to see it thinking man or not
Jul 26 2023,positive,another nolan masterpiece the cinematography was amazing ludwig goranssons score was amazing and the casts performances were amazing just an exceptional film overall 1010 movie thats easily a best picture frontrunner go see it in imax 70mm if you can

Jul 26 2023,positive,absolutely phenomenal brilliantly executed incredible acting poignant effects incredible music
Jul 26 2023,positive,i liked the complex and nonjudgemental portrayal of an extremely controversial issue at a terrible time in history    i believe special effects were overused to dramatize certain aspects that were not as significant as the overwhelming issues involved
Jul 26 2023,positive,entertaining eye opening i highly recommend
Jul 26 2023,positive,well acted  sent a strong thought provoking message
Jul 26 2023,positive,visually amazing the acting was so fantasticcillian and rdj killed it
Jul 26 2023,positive,excellent all around  directing acting locations sound
Jul 26 2023,positive,very well written wonderful acting and directing
Jul 26 2023,positive,riveting a reminder of quality acting across the board and kept me engaged for all 3 hours highly recommend
Jul 26 2023,positive,people will say this is the best nolan film of all time it is not its a good bio pic i didnt love the film and probably wont be interested in seeing it again it was not incredibly entertaining or enjoyable frankly i liked the story and the performances but thats about it way too long and drawn out
Jul 26 2023,negative,very boring and long and it def needs subtitles
Jul 26 2023,positive,epic beautiful worth the wait
Jul 26 2023,positive,great movie very interesting story about oppenheimer
Jul 26 2023,positive,epic great acting a must see movie
Jul 26 2023,positive,casting direction scriptwriting all extraordinary   i cannot recall a film of this level and completeness for some years
Jul 26 2023,positive,im gonna start with the obvious this movie is absolutely gorgeous pretty sure you already knew that but it gets even better when you watch the whole thing the fact that they replicated an atomic bomb with no cgi is freaking fantastic and why christopher nolan is a master at what he does i saw other comments complaining about how the explosion was silent at first but i loved it it made both parts more stunning all the performances are soooo good and with such a fantastical cast the score works so well with everything with the distorting violins and the loud drums and even the moments of silence you feel the run time on occasions but not enough to make me bored if you havent seen this yet please do
Jul 26 2023,negative,historical dramas are one of my favorite genres of film although the music was phenomenal it somehow clashed with the scenes and overpowered them i felt like the film dragged on for way too long and half of the audience fell asleep by the time it was over the only saving grace of this film was the acting
Jul 26 2023,negative,so boring no excitement in a 3 hr snooze fest
Jul 26 2023,positive,long but well worth it
Jul 26 2023,positive,it has been a long wait but oppenheimer is finally in theatres and it is magnificent christoper nolan delivers what many can make the argument is his best film ever made considering his track record that is not a simple feat but he accomplished this in many ways by building on what make nolan films so special beautiful visuals impeccable acting an engaging story and a stellar score from the incredibly talented ludwig goransson it has all of the ingredients you want in what will arguably be the movie of the year     oppenheimer is nolans most grounded film which makes sense since it is a biopic that recounts a major moment in human history but that does not mean it lacks any nolan flair       this film does not celebrate the creation of the atomic bomb as this achievement that they thought it was during its inception in fact it does the complete opposite by focusing almost one third of the film on the repercussions and the weight oppenheimer must bear with the creation of humanities most destructive weapon     oppenheimer recounts the life of julius robert oppenheimer from his early years in physics to well after the creation of the atomic bomb the events of oppenheimers life are recounted to us through the trials that take place after the creation of the atomic bomb with nolans signature styleof nonlinear storytelling at least three different time periods in oppenheimers life are used to tell the whole story the story is also told from multiple perspectives black and white scenes are told from the perspective of robert downey jrs character strauss and coloured scenes are told from the perspective of oppenheimer   i left the film feeling like i watched a documentary on oppenheimers life because nolan crafted a story that felt unbiased by capturing different perspectives on oppenheimers life having been accused of treason to the usa for associating himself with known communists oppenheimers whole life was meticulously probed by forming the story around the trials we were given the unique opportunity for cillian to give us a complete breakdown on how oppenheimers mind worked     nolan films have always been known for having big name actors in all of his films but oppenheimer is a rarity as it boasts a large ensemble of actors and puts the spotlight on many actors that i genuinely felt happy to see on screen in such dramatic roles josh peck and josh zuckerman just to name a few josh hartnett and alden ehrenreich also deserve to be mentioned after having each had their drought in large feature films the main cast of stars are all phoniminal especially cillian murphy and robery downey jr many cillian murphy fans have known for a long time that he has the capability of being a leading man as is evident with peaky blinders but it is wonderful to not only see him lead a big summer blockbuster but go beyond everyones expectations in a role so well done it will likely land him an oscar nom      nolan is one of hollywoods most consistent directors but oppenheimer truly demonstrates his ability to craft a truly beautiful film that deserves to be watched in imax at least once to experience the gorgeous visuals and hairraising sounds
Jul 26 2023,positive,movie was terrific but didnt need the nude scenes it didnt add to the story
Jul 26 2023,positive,too long plot lines too convoluted gratuitous sex and nakedness 3scenes   outstanding cinematography high quality filmmaking and score mixed bag  not typical nolan definitely not his best
Jul 26 2023,positive,quite long but captivating story
Jul 26 2023,positive,another nolans masterpiece
Jul 26 2023,positive,good story holds your attention  good acting
Jul 26 2023,negative,whats most disappointing about this movie is that it had all the elements it needed to be a masterpiece  a stellar cast an extremely interesting plot  character yet christopher nolan fails to deliver an interesting character study but instead delivers a pointless nonlinear mismatch of scenes
Jul 26 2023,positive,i thought it was a fascinating window into the lives and world of scientists and in particular oppenheimer  the complexity of his character and his passion for science made the movie suspenseful  all actors performances were excellent and i appreciate how it seems the creator of the movie seemed to stick to the truth about oppenheimers life
Jul 26 2023,positive,great movie but they should have left out the nudity and sex scene at least they could have covered them up made it discreet no need to see that it did nothing that added to the movie only made it look like pornography isnt christopher nolan above all that i hope so those scenes could have very easily been left out and should have been
Jul 26 2023,positive,even though this was a long movie it finished too soon  i absolutely loved it
Jul 26 2023,positive,i learned a lot it was also very entertaining
Jul 26 2023,positive,great acting however all the editing made the movie felt rushed to tell the story  the atomic bomb part of the film wasnt as exciting as i hoped it to beim gonna need to see it again when it releases on 4k dvd for another viewing maybe it will grab me then i fell asleep twice in the theatre watching this
Jul 26 2023,positive,greatest cinematic experience of my life
Jul 26 2023,positive,not at all boring and yet its a serious movie touching on this central message can we truly trust mankind with such power sure the genie is out of the box but the movie is hammering home the point we need to remember that at all beginnings and end its us humans who pay the consequences
Jul 26 2023,negative,acting was great  movie to long was confusing with the back and forth in history
Jul 26 2023,positive,very interesting to see how certain events played out over time and how oppenheimer was perceived and treated
Jul 26 2023,positive,a wellmade wellacted movie it was worth the 3hours of watching
Jul 26 2023,positive,viewer needs to be able to pay close attention   jumping to different points in time is confusing

Jul 26 2023,positive,great show but disturbing story
Jul 26 2023,positive,the movie was longer than i thought it would be but i liked it
Jul 26 2023,positive,one of the greatest movies ever
Jul 26 2023,neutral,the acting was superbbut the same story could have been told in 15 hours vs 4 the ending was extremely disappointingthe whole movie was about the bombin the end  when everyones feeling remorse about what  actually happened in hiroshima  all the devastation  horror  with over 200000 people dying overtime at the very least the closing scene should have been a black  white film  segment of the actual bombingcut  go to credits
Jul 26 2023,positive,there wasnt one thing to dislike about the movie chris nolan and the all star cast he has brough along is nothing short of phenomenal the whole 3 hours is worth it and i plan to see it again how did we not know that just 20 years after the turn of the century from horse and buggies to a nuclear bomb now the whole world has the technology that was built right in los alamos
Jul 26 2023,positive,over hyped 30 minutes too long performances ere substandard atomic explosion was silent come on
Jul 26 2023,positive,fantastic acting  good history lesson  prompted me to do more research into oppenheimer and the manhattan project
Jul 26 2023,positive,great historical history
Jul 26 2023,positive,the movie lived up to the hype
Jul 26 2023,positive,insightful movie about the super smart the massive undertaking to get the bomb before the nazis and how yet again our government cast aside people when theyve gotten what they want from them   awesome movie

Jul 26 2023,positive,great story cinematically different than any other film i have watched

Jul 26 2023,positive,touting impressive visualsspectacular performancesexceptional musicand a riveting and tense true story that takes full advantage of its epicalbeit occasionally long3hour runtimechristopher nolans oppenheimer is a remarkable achievement among his many works and has to be seen on the biggest screen possible to be believedprepare to be wowed
Jul 26 2023,positive,a powerful karmic drama speculating the verge of need invention and humanistic turmoil of great scientist the darkest introspective work in director filmography and  powerfully performance  cillian murphy
Jul 26 2023,positive,amazing cillian murphy is very talented
Jul 26 2023,positive,all the characters and flipflopping of time and events was a little confusing robert downey jr did a fantastic job needs a short intermission midway
Jul 26 2023,positive,cracking film 3 hours flew past in no time amazing performances and great score which is the usual nolan deafening levels in the cinema a great watch which i should have gone home after instead of watching the god awful insufferable feminist tirade that was barbie
Jul 26 2023,positive,loved everything about the movie
Jul 26 2023,positive,i really enjoyed the acting as well as the narrative special effects
Jul 26 2023,positive,exceptional acting breathtaking story very educating
Jul 26 2023,positive,loved how the story was told the unique editing style and constant intensity of the soundtrack
Jul 26 2023,positive,a cinematic masterpeice visually stunning and thouroughly engaging exploration of the inner struggles of a misunderstood and highly intelligent man a true gift to both the audience and oppenheimer in sharing his story
Jul 26 2023,positive,ill be brief  oppenheimer is a unique work it encompasses everything history philosophy physics chemistry science in general  with 3 hours of film it doesnt get tiring its amazing how c nolan keeps you on screen at the same time the dialogues with complex subjects make it easy to understand about the film there is an instigating and paranoid political plot of betrayal with that air of distrust typical of a cold war  thats all i can say without giving spoilers  finally the cast is oscar worthy and will definitely take at least 5 figurines
Jul 26 2023,positive,so well done    the acting directing and cinematography were exceptional
Jul 26 2023,positive,meticulously crafted brilliantly acted and moving at a swift paceoppenheimer may be overly long but also does justice to its important and interesting story
Jul 26 2023,positive,loved it  kept your interested for the three hours it ran  have seen other films and tv series on the manhattan project but this one really got into the politics and planning  great job
Jul 26 2023,positive,astonishing  a gripping and enlightening film
Jul 26 2023,positive,it was a little long
Jul 26 2023,negative,fist hour was brutal i thought it was muddy and not well edited   beautiful to look at  however choppy direction
Jul 26 2023,positive,such a good movie cillian murphy was phenomenal the only thing i didnt care for were the gratuitous nude scenes with florence pugh they were unnecessary and did nothing to advance the plot aside from that 1010 would recommend 100
Jul 26 2023,positive,this movie was a spectacle
Jul 26 2023,positive,very interesting movie i had dreaded sitting through a 3 hour movie but it was time well spent it grabs the viewer from the beginning
Jul 26 2023,positive,great movie and expected scenario how you can be beaten by the government for the things you do
Jul 26 2023,positive,need to do homework beforehand which i didnt
Jul 26 2023,positive,it was a really good movie very well done and entertaining all the way through
Jul 26 2023,neutral,it was decent but nothing great  no deep political messages  just a few minor ones that could easily be brushed aside as for the story i was expecting so much more  the cast looked so compelling however the story was oddly flat  i love the history behind the manhattan project and was super eager to see it  however the story just didnt make it   for example i freaking love robert downey jr but his character was shockingly bland  cillian murphy was very solid in the lead   emily blunt was surprisingly really good   matt damon was good but not great   also i didnt like the disjointed way that they told the story  it starts at a senate hearing in the future and they tell the story backward  just dont like that style   christopher nolan used some cool special effects and really infused the story with energy but it just fell flat   since covid there have been very few good movies  this movie isnt bad but its just sorta good
Jul 26 2023,positive,great story and acting  insights into the behind the scenes personalities of this effort
Jul 26 2023,positive,this is an audio visual masterpiece the whole movie has such a great pacing that you never feel bored i will think about this movie for a long time its a must see in a theater
Jul 26 2023,positive,great acting cilliam murphy holds the screen amazing visuals and scenery but put off by black and white screen time and mixture of earlier and later events
Jul 26 2023,positive,perfection  sometimes you get to see a movie that you know will be great and it didnt fail my expectations at all
Jul 26 2023,positive,oppenheimer might be christopher nolans best film yet i found the whole film mesmerizing and well constructed i did not feel like i had just watched a three hour film when i left the theater
Jul 26 2023,positive,impressed with oppenheimer were talking about nuclear warheads you got to remember this was about world war 2 and japan it would be a mistake to skip over this movie
Jul 26 2023,positive,really enjoyed the history leaning up tp making the bombit was a little slow at times but the acting was done very well
Jul 26 2023,positive,it was good but extremely long was the length necessary to accurately tell the story
Jul 26 2023,positive,could have done without the nudity
Jul 25 2023,positive,spellbinding  tragic story
Jul 25 2023,positive,95 talking with loud suspenseful sounds in the background two big bombs blowing up towards the end 
Jul 25 2023,positive,wow just wow christopher nolan came back to film with one of the greatest examples of storytelling ever even though oppenheimer is a biopic nolan still manages to deliver a beautifully crafted story about a complex and morally gray genius though i believe this was a little too dense and could have been shortened up or made into two different movies it still manages to keep your attention throughout your viewing nolans style is at its absolute peak and creatively intelligent along with beautiful writing comes an expertly assembled cast cillian murphy absolutely brought everything he had to this role and it shows robert downey jr finally gets to show his immense talent and range emily blunt and florence pugh give convincing emotional performances and really embody their characters every actor is absolutely spectacular and it enhances the movie so much cinematography has always been a key part of nolans films but this movies visuals are utterly stunning the camera work and practical effects leave you with a sense of dread and fear of what oppenheimer created but thats also thanks to the intense audio mixing all in all nolan has made the film of the year he has shown that a movie doesnt tell just a situation but an actual story oscar worthy is an understatement
Jul 25 2023,positive,outstanding performances and very well done   excellent  oscar worthy
Jul 25 2023,positive,excellent movie a piece of history that i am ashamed to say i was not aware of so i learned something today all of the actors were great and the time just flew by
Jul 25 2023,positive,could be shorter too long
Jul 25 2023,positive,simply amazing its a movie that leaves you speechless and makes you think about it for days after watching it
Jul 25 2023,positive,i learned a lot about all the challenges it took to make the atom bomb and the same terrible politics that we still have today
Jul 25 2023,positive,i cant think of anything bad about it so engrossing the three hours flew by
Jul 25 2023,positive,great but oddly paced and a wee bit too long that being said im not sure how they could shorten it without losing some important story elements
Jul 25 2023,positive,for a movie that consisted of dialogue for 3 straight hours i was on the edge of my seat every single actor  actress were brilliant in nolan we trust
Jul 25 2023,positive,i thought the cast was amazing and so was the story i didnt know about the man except for that he was responsible for developing the atomic bomb so learning more about him was very interesting
Jul 25 2023,positive,most significant hollywood movie since schindlers list  fantastic  we loved it
Jul 25 2023,positive,incredible story visuals and sound must see on imaxdolbyetc probably a bit out there  for most viewers who cant hang with the intense fast moving plot multiple timelines scientific content and overall abstract presentation for the right viewer its a 1010
Jul 25 2023,positive,this movie is incredible the actors are good and scenes are epic
Jul 25 2023,positive,i loved everything about it
Jul 25 2023,positive,nudity was not needed  music so loud you could hear the dialog movie jumps around to much  actors were very good
Jul 25 2023,positive,it was slow in a few spots but besides that great movie great information  large band of big name actors  great movie
Jul 25 2023,positive,epic film fascinating take on a very controversial man
Jul 25 2023,positive,loved the acting history photography and message was a bit too long and some scenes could have been edited without distracting from the story
Jul 25 2023,positive,intense dramatic acting was great on all levels
Jul 25 2023,positive,oppenheimer was a genius and an american hero he created the atom bomb used defeat japan in wwii
Jul 25 2023,negative,i dislike that they sprang a lot of sex scenes on us with no hint in the trailers had i known i would have avoided this movie
Jul 25 2023,negative,no mention of pearl harbor  what a total farcea hollywoke movie script at best  and such a waste of incredibly talented actors and artists painting a portrait of history without all the colors and hues of the time period and the incredible horrors experienced by americans that lost their lives their loved ones and everything they had this movie focused myopically on what  some script writers attempt to manipulate the reality of what really happened without looking at the cause of the effects
Jul 25 2023,positive,excellent and enthralling i couldnt look away because it was that good   kids nope  the nudity and a could graphic sex scenes are in appropriate
Jul 25 2023,positive,amazing storytelling loved it
Jul 25 2023,positive,fabulous storytelling of the most important mans life great cast
Jul 25 2023,positive,very educational and informative
Jul 25 2023,positive,brilliant storyline and cinematography always fun seeing an ensemble cast in war movies
Jul 25 2023,positive,great movie and close to the truth so interesting and kept  me engaged that it did not seem like a  a three hour movie
Jul 25 2023,positive,saw the film at an imax theater and thoroughly enjoyed it the story was very compelling the acting stupendous and nolans cinematography and sound were top notch    so many performers stand out in this film but cillian murphy and robert downey jr deserve special acknowledgment for their performances  kudos to the entire cast    the moral dilemma of building the bomb had to weigh heavily on many but greatest on oppenheimer  to know you are creating something that could kill tens of thousands but also save american lives must have been quite the stressful weight to carry  the film did a wonderful job of showing oppenheimer the man flaws included but especially showed his mental stress both during development of the bomb and after it was used  fantastic film
Jul 25 2023,positive,realistic moral complexity petty jealousies affecting peoples lives scary demagogues interfering with science just like now great acting interesting characters it was time for a movie that is thoughtful but also accessible
Jul 25 2023,positive,story was good sex scenes did not add a thing to the story the scenes where he appeared to be hallucinating were useless the movie would have been better as a 2 hour documentary
Jul 25 2023,positive,in todays theatrical landscape im glad nolan is still making art
Jul 25 2023,positive,one of christopher nolans best
Jul 25 2023,positive,learned a lot about the characters  this made the movie very interesting  also all the hardships this scientist went through  couldnt believe the security staff treated him that way after he saved so many lives
Jul 25 2023,positive,terrific film  i never knew the whole story beyond what you learn in school
Jul 25 2023,positive,fastest 3 hours  excellent cast and storyline
Jul 25 2023,positive,long as hell but great movie if you dont like flashbacks dont go
Jul 25 2023,positive,movie was nonstop from start to finish  such great acting robert downy je was great  really takes you through the process of how the atom bomb was built  all the problems involved  go watch it you wont regret it
Jul 25 2023,positive,absolutely superb a very deep and emotional take on a moral and ethical dilemma one faces when becoming the destroyer of the worlds
Jul 25 2023,positive,amazing best film ive seen in years the story telling is phenomenal
Jul 25 2023,positive,sper actings photography cinematography direction  visual effects story
Jul 25 2023,positive,an important look at americas shameful history  good for those who like the challenge of managing multiple characters and locales  a big pass for those who dont
Jul 25 2023,negative,the movie could have been made in a much interactive way there was no need of those unexpected awkward nude scenes either overall a great story killed by poor execution
Jul 25 2023,positive,downey jr and blunt standout in an allround faultless cast performance a truly amazing score also faultless    i have marked 455 as it felt like the story could of been told just as well with 3040 minutes shaved off the run time it was like two films back to back probably due to the climax of the bomb making feeling like the end of the film with still an hour plus of feature left     i find nolans films on the whole very interesting interstellar being my personal favourite i also find them a little frustrating and i normally come away feeling a bit stupid that i havent been able to absorb as much as id like to
Jul 25 2023,positive,great acting a little long
Jul 25 2023,positive,loved the movie a bit long especially the first 45 minutes but very compelling and detailed acting performances are all top notch nude scenes were unexpected and completely unnecessaryand do nothing that a filmmaker of nolans capability couldnt accomplish otherwise i would have recommended it with five stars but its tough to recommend friends or coworkers see it without warning them
Jul 25 2023,positive,a must see extraordinary from beginning to end amazing story and cast
Jul 25 2023,positive,great movie stunning great acting i didnt expect the nudity im not against it i just didnt expect it
Jul 25 2023,positive,best movie in a very long time
Jul 25 2023,positive,moving acting and score
Jul 25 2023,positive,need a playlist to keep all the names straight and follow the storyline too long
Jul 25 2023,positive,very wellorchestrated movie from beginning to end       the cast was superb  best movie i have seen for a long time   well portrayed life of  oppenheimer    historical knowledge was eye opening
Jul 25 2023,positive,loved it a riveting movie based on science and history welldelivered by nolan and quintessential actors
Jul 25 2023,positive,great story great acting interesting story  i had to read up on the characters before and after the film to totally understand the story
Jul 25 2023,positive,one of the best biopics ive ever seen phenomenal acting by murphyacademy award winning for sure downey and damon also did a fantastic job as did florence pugh and others  for a three hour film time passed quickly and i felt a very important story had been recounted for a new generation
Jul 25 2023,positive,stayed pretty close to the true story great casting and well acted i truly hated rdjr and i loved him as iron man
Jul 25 2023,positive,the best historical movie ive ever seen christopher and cillian murphy did a great job in portraying emotional sensation and the expression when thinking it drags audience into the flow along with the actor each actors is polished and storyline is excellent with its flowiness
Jul 25 2023,positive,great movie  nicely done
Jul 25 2023,positive,unless you were already somewhat familiar with his life and associated history you may have a hard time understanding everything because the movie jumps around in time a great deal otherwise it was one of the greatest movies of all time i especially appreciate how the movie sets the record straight and honors oppenheimer my father would have been one of our soldiers who invaded japan had that become necessary but the bomb ended the war
Jul 25 2023,positive,well done storytelling from the perspective of the scientific community during the manhattan project era well casted and dramatized shows you just how much the american government despised leftleaning academics who they needed for nuclear weapons research this needs to be seen in the theater for the sound dont miss seeing it
Jul 25 2023,positive,i liked in indepth plunge into the stresses and challenges of coordinating the best minds on the planet into a single unit that created the atomic bomb
Jul 25 2023,positive,this movie is in my opinion amazing saw it in imax and im so glad i didnt sell myself short i left and thought too myself that i just saw an oscar laden film best actor actresses support sound cinematography and film
Jul 25 2023,positive,one of nolans best
Jul 25 2023,positive,this is an epic film deserving of top awards   oppenheimer was a complex brilliant man  the film depicts the collaborative work headed up by oppenheimer to create the worlds most destructive weapon and change the course of history   it was both frightening and exhilarating  for a 3 hour movie it kept our attention throughout
Jul 25 2023,positive,excellent  cillian is outstanding  robert excellent emily and matt very good as usual
Jul 25 2023,negative,beautiful visuals but very clunky in which it seemed to embrace the tik toc nature of never ending short bursts of dialogue and scenes strangely lacking  in dialogue its hard to explain how this movie said a lot without telling a story not his his best like everyone says
Jul 25 2023,positive,an intriguing court room drama about oppenheimers life before and after the event of atom bomb explosion
Jul 25 2023,positive,epic breathtaking beatiful poetic sequence masterpice
Jul 25 2023,positive,doesnt feel like a 3 hour movie  i liked how they told the story   nice bounce back from tenet
Jul 25 2023,positive,stunning the script is great the acting is exceptional  a stunning motion picture at first the 3 hour run time worried me but as the film progressed into the third act it was necessary i am telling everyone i know planning to see it be patient it all comes together with a final curtail that is a must this is a storydepiction of a mans life not to be rushed but savored and pondered
Jul 25 2023,positive,great movie would recommend to anyone it is a 3 hour long movie which isnt bad for me but maybe for others however i felt the movie got better and better as it went on
Jul 25 2023,positive,excellent cast and film  i liked the way the story was toldnot chronologically but in flashbacks and through different time periods  while it was a threehour filmed it flowed smoothly and did not seem that long  highly recommended
Jul 25 2023,negative,the length of the film is ridiculous story is okay acting was okay not for me though
Jul 25 2023,positive,powerhouse performances and a movie that definitely does not talk down to its audience  christopher nolan is definitely the best director of his generation
Jul 25 2023,positive,it was complicated history   you really have to pay attention to the details   i may have to watch again to absorb what i missed the first time    it was a long movie i saw at imax which is not necessary    i had to plug my ears because it was too loud in some parts   story was mostly factual  the actors looked similar to the actual historical figure   would not recommend for children because of sex scenes and complicated topic
Jul 25 2023,negative,biggest disappointment ever love nolan but this movie is so boring and the visuals are nothing compared to interstellar inception dark knight dunkirk etc how is this so popular everyone leaving the showing thought is was a snooze
Jul 25 2023,positive,movie of the year for sure the way they use the colors and the jump cuts to tell the story is perfect dont even get me started on the music
Jul 25 2023,positive,excellent film acton was phenomenal
Jul 25 2023,positive,brilliant film about a brilliant mind and a worldaltering decision  at times early in the film there is a bit too much emphasis on the inner workings and conflicts of the young oppenheimer  a little too hitchcockian for me  it doesnt give the audience enough credit for appreciating the scope of his mind  about 1015 minutes of the film could have been scrapped and no meaning or intent would have been lost  music was fabulous if a bit overbearing at times  that overbearance was appropriate
Jul 25 2023,positive,kind of boring good performances but i wouldnt call it entertaining at all
Jul 25 2023,positive,oppenheimer was a very thought provoking movie it was brilliantly shot and perfectly casted
Jul 25 2023,positive,great cast and story
Jul 25 2023,positive,35 hr movie but still good 
Jul 25 2023,positive,totally immersed in the story i knew some but this filled in a lot of blanks  made him very human
Jul 25 2023,positive,this film will be remembered as a classic film the film is an excellent and memorable portrayal of the life and work of j robert oppenheimer who was an important person in an important event in human history j robert oppenheimer was an important person in the development of the atomic bomb
Jul 25 2023,positive,loved the movie as my wife did as well great acting and the movie flew by even though it was 3 hours i think it certainly should be up for multiple oscars
Jul 25 2023,positive,it was somewhat difficult to put the pieces together in the beginning portion of the movie  while an interesting device to slide back and forth between different times and scenarios it for me took away from the real message and power of the movie which eventually became more clear as it progressed  aside from that it was an amazing treatise of a complicated man who saved us from one apocalypse by frontrunning it with another  the intensity and uncertainty of the times coupled with the sense of urgency created a tension hard to replicate but so well done by nolan and company  solid movie should be on most folks must see list
Jul 25 2023,positive,it was ok  i learned a lot if the movie was true to history i didnt do any fact checking  but much of the movie was a bit slow moving and at 3 hours it was way too long
Jul 25 2023,negative,very pretentious made film no cgi hurt the film it is a good story but bad movie rdj was actually good at acting though
Jul 25 2023,positive,fantastic movie all around the cast the music the storyline the structure it was near perfect there were some parts of the movie which were not necessary and i question why they needed to include it which brings me to my next point i would definitely not bring any children under the age of eighteen as there is some nudity and actual sexual acts that occur there is a specific scene that showed an act happening and i do believe it would have had the same impact if they removed the sexual exchange
Jul 25 2023,positive,it was overhyped the story didnt have much of any ahha or wow moment though it should be said for a director to keep me watching for 3 hours without feeling bored is a compliment to the director overall i think the story was forgettable everyone likes different christopher nolan movies this one wasnt the best for me
Jul 25 2023,positive,amazing movie with fantastic cast
Jul 25 2023,positive,saw it in 70mm imax and wow the movie was very beautiful and interesting there were some points where i was lost a bit but overall great movie
Jul 25 2023,positive,oppenheimer is undoubtedly one of the most unique films i have ever seen after three viewings i can confidently say that this film has just as many layers to the nolan onion as his previous pieces its directorship is fantastic the acting is superb and the audiovisual experience is like no other especially for a biopic watching in imax 70mm if available near you is an absolute must     if you like myself struggled to get a grasp of oppenheimers story or with the pacing on first viewing i highly recommend reading up on his life and the other characters involved and rewatching although it is 3 hours long both the manhattan project and oppenheimers life are too nuanced to fully grasp and appreciate within such a short time frame     finally i could not think of a more suitable lead actor than cillian murphy to portray jro especially when rdj may have seemed the shinier option given his resume his eyes alone deserve oscars for their performance
Jul 25 2023,positive,christopher nolan created an amazing movie direction acting with such a talented team wow emily blunt as kitty blew it out of the sky more than that we all know oppenheimer was the man behind the atomic bomb that ended the korean war but in all my years i didnt know the story of his life i learned so much as well as being entertained bravo
Jul 25 2023,positive,it was a good movie intense and serious  there were a couple of gratuitous sexnudity scenes that could have just as easily been presented in a less salacious way and still make the point of the relationship between him and his on again off again mistress  i dont know if this was the fault of the movie makers or the equipment at the imax theater where we saw the film but too often the soundtrack was loud enough to stop the audience from understanding all the dialogue i heard multiple comments as people were exiting about how loud the movie was  it is worth seeing but i almost wish i had wjaited to watch it at home on one of the streaming services rather than spend so much money for a ticket and then not be able to understand everything the actors are saying  at home i could at least turn on the subtitles
Jul 25 2023,positive,love the history but it was a bit confusing  def made me want to research more it was a little hard to keep some of the characters straight and it goes from 0  100 pretty fast  so much developed in a short amount of time worth seeing though
Jul 25 2023,neutral,the acting in this film was good but man they could have edited out the entire first hour with the weird love triangle story honestly it was extremely boring i was expecting more plot on creating the bomb and testing so much boring dialogue in the film it was not an enjoyable watch
Jul 25 2023,positive,with oppenheimer christopher nolan proves once again why he is one of the best directorsscreenwriters not only of his generation but of all time this is what cinema is supposed to be so entertaining and well crafted that you have no choice but to look at the screen even if you dont like or know the subject matter     this type of movie isnt for everyone and if you dont know much about historyhistorical figures the flood of constant information might be too much for you but that isnt really a downside as a i think movies should also encourage viewers to do further research  please pay to see it not only everyone did a great job but we need movies like this to continue to be made
Jul 25 2023,positive,great acting telling a fascinating true story
Jul 25 2023,positive,oppenheimer is christopher nolans best film to date and the best movie of the year hands down
Jul 25 2023,neutral,it was good but way overrated
Jul 25 2023,positive,very informative and takes you back during that time our country can relate to what oppenheimer went through during those times the trinity test sequence was not glorified but still very satisfied with the practical effects  overall a very engaging experience  bravo mr nolan and cast and crew
Jul 25 2023,positive,woauh nolan being nolan perfect
Jul 25 2023,positive,well done interesting informative  could have been an hour shorter too long  a bit confusing at times  glad i saw it but not one of my favorites
Jul 25 2023,positive,the historical significance and the acting we need to learn from our past and what a better way then from entertainment great story
Jul 25 2023,positive,nothing in depth at all everything was very surface level deep and vague although long it was long for no reason    no real information or discoveries provided on anything in the movie
Jul 25 2023,positive,oppenheimer is the most intellectually stimulating movie that i have ever seen  the moral ambiguities were more than any single human should ever face
Jul 25 2023,positive,could have done with out the porn scenes but other than that superb  in an important film based
Jul 25 2023,neutral,the first half was interesting  i liked watching the creation of los alamos and the bomb the second half  the trial  was drawn out and boring
Jul 25 2023,positive,fantastic story line of an important difficult time in our in our nations history the actors did a wonderful job bringing it to life
Jul 25 2023,positive,all politics aside nuclear weaponry and corruption in our government since the 1930s are the elephants in the roomworld  this movie is a must see to get the picture punintended  is the us doomed via karmic justice for the nuclear arms race  its all about political and personal powerthe nuke brought about out of genius and insanity  did we really need a nuke to win the war  i dont believe somy father was with macarthur upon his return to the philippines and the japanese were imploding long before hiroshima and nagasaki  they were running out of planes and parts for repair  as a junior senator from mass jfk voted against confirmation of strauss for us sec of commerce strauss a key role in development of hbomb in 1959 who desperately wanted the nuke for big defense strausss appointment was not confirmed  could this possibly be the work of strauss the deep stateestablishment and cia to take kennedy out for numerous reasons  strauss was deeply connected to big defense which eventually lead the way to big pharma and eventually big tech lobbyiststhe biggest problem in us government today imho  in my military career i had first hand experience with nuclear weapons and readiness spending half of it on alert with nukes ready to go during the first cold war  many of the ptsd scenes remind me of my own ptsdladen dreams about the big one happening  after some relatively peaceful years we find ourselves right in the middle of cold war iiand with mad men such as putin and xi their ostensible alliance and the proliferation of nukes among nine countries my ptsd nuclear dreams have returned  and the va flat denies that i could have ptsd from being prepared on a daily basis to blow up the world im fighting and winning that battle with the corrupt va systemor ill die trying  i have distinguished military and corporate resumesplus my suicide attempt due to unresolved nuke ptsd faulty coping mechanisms  we need more movies like oppenheimer to raise awareness in our countryand the worldof a plethora of issues regarding the human factors regarding weapons of such mass destructionnot to mention the potential disaster of impending ai factors  btwit makes me nauseous to have this movie even associated with barbiemaybe our world is just sick enough to need a fresh start  not that i disagree at all with the content in barbie  but barbenheimer  maybe hollywood represents the same genius and insanity it took to develop these weapons of mass destructionadd political corruption and voila barbenheimer
Jul 25 2023,positive,excellent suspense levels historically accurate and overall very well made film  large format screen also a plus  thanks
Jul 25 2023,positive,gave me some history i didnt know
Jul 25 2023,positive,strong performances all around
Jul 25 2023,positive,tells a story which needs to be told
Jul 25 2023,positive,great movie best actor candidate here
Jul 25 2023,positive,well developed story seemed fairly accurate good pace
Jul 25 2023,positive,this movie needs your full concentration but it deliveres simply a work of genius everything goes perfectly together and on point highly recommended
Jul 25 2023,positive,a beautifully crafty adult subject movie with terrific acting and sound so nice to see a current movie thats not a sequel a comic book movie or one with the inevitable preachy message about how you should conform to the new world
Jul 25 2023,positive,engaging acting powerful cinematography and thought provoking themes
Jul 25 2023,positive,brilliant not perfect of course but truly a brilliant movie
Jul 25 2023,negative,the truth 3 hrs of fast cuts of endless conversations that leave you empty of understanding the plot is dramaless and dry the acting is fantastic but the editing of the movies does not move you to feel any emotion a shame for something that is really an important topic
Jul 25 2023,positive,great story great acting  3 hours passed so quickly  first movie for me in a long time
Jul 25 2023,positive,sucha a fantastic film this music explosions wow i can say that it was the best film i ever seen i theater
Jul 25 2023,positive,i just want to say you need to see this movie its one of the most impressive movies that i ever see
Jul 25 2023,positive,extraordinary and rivetinga must see movie
Jul 25 2023,positive,this might be the best movie i have ever seen  the powerful story was told in a powerful way  the script photography and editing was outstanding  direction was outstanding  acting was outstanding  the academy awards will be little more than an oppenheimer advertisement with all the awards it will receive    the socalled sex scenes were actually very mild but the intense message perhaps warranted an r rating anyway  this movie is not for everyone    this movie shows how intellectual dialogue can displace all the action competition    recommend seeing the movie in imax  5 stars for sure
Jul 25 2023,positive,simply outstanding and innovative
Jul 25 2023,positive,it was a bit long but a good movie  i like the way they put you inside of his head all the actors played their parts beautifully and i found the story very interesting i dont know if ill ever watch it again but it was totally worth seeing it at least once
Jul 25 2023,positive,the movie is very well made and a great true history story i always like true story movies christoper nolan and his cast did a fabulous job great cast and acting absolute love it
Jul 25 2023,positive,as a huge nolan fan very overrated movie
Jul 25 2023,positive,it was a masterpiece of story telling  i see oscars in this movies future
Jul 25 2023,positive,robert downey jr is agenius
Jul 25 2023,positive,best movie of the year so far  i highly recommend this one a must watch  christopher nolan did an awesome job directing this movie based around the manhattan project and dr oppenheimer the father of the atom bomb did a great job illustrating dr oppenheimers personal life struggles and moral dilemmas with developing the atom bomb with a group of the greatest science professionals to end world war ii having to except that thousands of innocent people will die in the efforts to end the war with imperialist japan
Jul 25 2023,negative,too many jumps in time too long and boring not a masterpiece a snooze fest if i watched at home i would have switched it off after 20 minutes
Jul 25 2023,positive,i loved seeing this movie in imax
Jul 25 2023,positive,an absolute riveting spectacle nolan does it again with a star studded cast and a banger score by ludwig g√∂ransson cillian murphy robert downey jr and emily blunt could all take home awards in the next oscars
Jul 25 2023,negative,it was a very long movie i dont like movies over 2 hours    i was hoping to see more effects of the detonation of the nuclear bomb and the science behind it but that was just brushed over the movies about the weaknesses of a man and ive seen enough of that in real life   i wanted to see the science and the effects of that
Jul 25 2023,positive,a character study without peer
Jul 25 2023,positive,absolutely amazing movie would recommend coming in with a little bit of knowledge on the manhattan project but the movie does a really good job of telling its story
Jul 25 2023,positive,great movie great story telling imax is definitely worth a watch
Jul 25 2023,positive,the most monumental aweinspiring film ive ever seen and ill be going back for a second time soon
Jul 25 2023,positive,perfect performances from downey  murphy  blunt long movie but oh so engaging
Jul 25 2023,positive,great story great acting great cinematography
Jul 25 2023,positive,good movie that flowed well some scenes were a bit strange but overall the movie was very good
Jul 25 2023,positive,very good movie it is a little slow and long but overall is very well done great director too
Jul 25 2023,positive,the acting was superb
Jul 25 2023,positive,it showed some important moments in history but the last hour or so felt like an unnecessary twist of tone that made it feel dragged out still worth seeing once for the acting
Jul 25 2023,positive,i think if you are a baby bomber you should see this movie it is complex however it comes together  it was an excellent film and very thought provoking
Jul 25 2023,positive,it was a fabulous film i have no doubt this movie will win many awards
Jul 25 2023,positive,very intense true and you have to pay attention
Jul 25 2023,positive,the big question is how many academy awards will this picture win    a lot
Jul 25 2023,neutral,the movie was good if you like that kind of movie  i enjoyed it but wish i would have chosen a more comfortable theater or waited to see it at home  i think the review by matt zoller seitz on rogerebertcom covered the film very well  i would suggest reading it before seeing the movie         for all the prerelease speculation about how analog epicmaker christopher nolans oppenheimer would recreate the explosion of the first atomic bomb the films most spectacular attraction turns out to be something else the human face     this threeplus hour biography of j robert oppenheimer cillian murphy is a film about faces they talk a lot they listen they react to good and bad news and sometimes they get lost in their own headsnone more so than the title character the supervisor of the nuclear weapons team at los alamos
Jul 25 2023,positive,enjoyed it immensely
Jul 25 2023,positive,this might be nolans magnum opus a tremendously profound film thoughtprovoking and engrossing from the start if you pay attention it wont lose you till the end at first i felt it was edited too much like a long movie trailer and wouldve been better off as a series but after finishing it i understand why the feature film format was chosen for this masterpiece i had to sit and digest for a moment after the credits had started rolling
Jul 25 2023,positive,not sure the millennials can appreciate this movie
Jul 25 2023,positive,heavy intensive yet great n perfect 3 hours movie you never feel bored with the magnificent scenario dialog editing super music score spectacular effects
Jul 25 2023,negative,too long really two stories
Jul 25 2023,positive,truly a cinematic masterpiece you will be left with haunting thoughts after this film
Jul 25 2023,positive,brilliant and beautiful  cillian murphy and robert downey jr should both take home oscars  and every other award  the must see movie this summer  three hours flew by
Jul 25 2023,positive,for a movie just about talking it held my attention better than most but lots of talking and a quick explosion done well for such a topic some cool atomic scenes but not looking to rewatch it anytime soon
Jul 25 2023,positive,the beginning of the film is very fastpaced almost montagestyle scenes to lay the groundwork for his early life and how he landed in his position in the manhattan project if you arent familiar with the story of oppenheimer you may find yourself getting lost otherwise excellent the only complaint being that it wasnt quite long enough
Jul 25 2023,positive,one of my favorite movies ever
Jul 25 2023,negative,definitely not worth going to see the 1st 45mins1 hour was so boring the marketing team did an excellent job promoting this movie nothing was said or shown in the previews what this movie was actually about oppenheimer being on trial for connections to russia   save your  youll thank me
Jul 25 2023,positive,this movie checked all the boxes  kept it pretty accurate historically
Jul 25 2023,positive,too much political intrigue and not enough about what he did and the challenges he faced doing it  didnt need the raw sex scenes  covered too many angles
Jul 25 2023,negative,too much chatter discombobulated dialogue slow star started but lacked substance
Jul 25 2023,positive,this was an amazing movie stellar cast superior direction and writing im familiar with much of the history but this brought out the motives the reason behind the madness a very engaging tale
Jul 25 2023,positive,very well done an important movie to see
Jul 25 2023,positive,great movie  theater was so quiet you could hear a pin drop
Jul 25 2023,negative,just saw oppenheimer    what a mess that film is editing is just all over the place     i get what christopher nolan was trying to make but it really did need another editing pass not because of length instead mainly due to more than 75 of the film being scattershot random moments in time during the initial and later phases of the creation of the atomic bomb     intercut with 2 different debriefing sessions one in the grey room and the other in congress the story is shredded into parts that never quite connect     certainly trying to fit 5 years worth of history involving 10 of the most influential people during that era into a film less than 4 hours long is quite the challenge but we never get a sense of connection to any single individual in the film before we are ripped away to see something completely unrelated out of context and confusing in relation to what was shown up to that point    its an okay film the effects are nice but the imax filming process makes every single performer in the film look 1020 years older than they are the ultimate in hidef exposes each crevice of wrinkle  intentional or concealed beneath makeup the makeup is awful as well with some people being nonstop sweaty redfaced and others pasty chalky faced    i do appreciate the intent the overall narrative but its a shattered mirror on our history that is both missing quite a few shards as well as lacking anything of dire consequence what little drama exists is brushed off before we can feel any gravitas to the situation    if you go see it dont listen to nolans advice about seeing it on the biggest screen possible its far from worth the cost of such extravagance both narratively and in the overall presentation
Jul 25 2023,positive,its more like a documentary long interesting but kind of boring great acting dialogue was decent but i was expecting a ford v ferrari style of film i would not recommend seeing it in theaters its not a movie i would really want to watch again
Jul 25 2023,positive,i found oppenheimer to be very informative  i had no idea of the backstory of j robert oppenheimer  the personal side of the film was very interesting  great performance by robert downey jr
Jul 25 2023,negative,i really like the filmmaking but the movie was really boring
Jul 25 2023,positive,fantastic movie  actors were superb film was beautifully done
Jul 25 2023,negative,the cinematography and acting were great    however  the movie is structurally a mess the pacing is jarring there is never enough time for any scene to breathe it feels like an endless montage     the editing is atrocious constant fast cuts on mundane bits of dialogue and cuts of 23 frames that look like they were left in by mistake absolutely dizzying and nauseainducing     the frustrating and constant time jumps serve no purpose other than to force a nonlinear story where it wasnt necessary it truly felt like you had to read the book american prometheus ahead of time to be able to keep up i came into the film with what i thought to be enough surface knowledge of ww2 the manhattan project mccarthyism and the cold war despite that i had a miserable time keeping up with what was going on     in the 3rd act they shoehorn in a main antagonist like an afterthought and the movie becomes such a slog at that point that i couldnt care less about the reveal of the villain     the trinity test explosion was extremely underwhelming im not complaining about it not looking cool my criticism is that it failed to accurately show the unsettling immensity of its scale the literal harnessing of the power of the universe to cause mass destruction in the film it simply looked like a gas fire filmed up close to fill up the screen      the soundtrack is egregiously smothered all over the place including mundane scenes of extended dialogue making it difficult to hear whats being said     i really disliked the film truly a failed exercise in cinematic craftsmanship its all the bad things about nolan that id normally turn a blind eye to but heightened to the extreme im confoundedly perplexed as to how its receiving so much universal praise its easily one of nolans worsts
Jul 25 2023,positive,incredible movie very good plot and good acting
Jul 25 2023,positive,incredible nolan at his finest i cried at the end
Jul 25 2023,positive,nolan knows how to stir your emotions with a story that you obviously know the ending
Jul 25 2023,negative,one star is too many for oppenheimer and i was reminded as to why i rarely go to movies anymore this movie is a giant yawn and could have been told in two hours instead of three if you find yourself falling asleep a couple of strategically placed explosions will jolt you out of your seat if hollywood decides to throw in unnecessary nudity and sex to titillate the masses they should at least use an actor with some muscle i dont pay good money to see naked skinny men on the big screen im obviously in the minority but this was the worst movie ive ever seen reading a book on quantum physics would be more exciting thank you harkins for the refund
Jul 25 2023,positive,im not to found of movies going back and forth to then and now  it can get confusion  however  part of the film being in black and white made it easy to follow    great movie great acting
Jul 25 2023,positive,do not wait to watch this at home the best film ive seen in a very long time christopher nolan is a genius
Jul 25 2023,positive,excellent acting and cinematography it was tense and welldirected the movie captured much of the intensity of this tragic time in history
Jul 25 2023,positive,interesting to see the politics with this stuff
Jul 25 2023,positive,this movie was too long and spent so much time focusing on everything except the creation of the atomic bomb the length would have been justified if it would have spent more time on that but instead it spent the whole time dwelling on what happened before and after that said the part that did talk about the creation of the bomb was good and overall was an ok movie
Jul 25 2023,positive,this movie tells the story of an incredible man plagued by not only his success with the manhattan project but the complexities of relationships both intimate and professional
Jul 25 2023,positive,the movie is everything you wanted it to be and more suspenseful thrilling edge of your seat scenes that keep you locked into what it is you are watching the metaphors that nolan sets up at the start that come full circle towards the perfect ending of this perfect movie 1110 must watch you wont be disappointed
Jul 25 2023,positive,overall the movie was good not great the first 13 is spent explaining the relationships between all the key players and the love interests which would be ok if it was done well it jumped around too much making it difficult and boring to follow however once oppenheimer is offered the manhattan project the movie takes off and is very good
Jul 25 2023,positive,acting was amazing in this film the lead actor did a phenomenal job and was in every scene definitely recommend to see this movie
Jul 25 2023,positive,i only had a high level knowledge of the man and his work during ww2 as an analytical thinker i resonated with the character anglo g with my own daily plight wrestling with theory and logic
Jul 25 2023,positive,a truly surreal experience felt more like a vision than a movie
Jul 25 2023,positive,on oppenheimer    as filmmakers it is our duty to use the attention of our audiences to bring to their minds moral and social questions and problems in a way that impacts them as oppenheimer said they will only fear it if they understand it and they will only understand it if they see it now this moral question focused on in oppenheimer is one that has been focused on in many ways for many decades but as is our nature will have more impact on us and gives us greater understanding through the use of our empathy and the impact of the moving image as a medium combined with the no lesser impact of storytelling narrative and music which factors have been a center of human nature from the very beginning of our existence humans have always been storytellers and have been so for a reason it is what has the most impact on our minds our hearts and our souls and thus it is the great privilege and responsibility of a filmmaker to not deal with this impact lightly   christopher nolan has with this film given a prime example of how to do so
Jul 25 2023,positive,what was that     sound perfect   visuals perfect   acting perfect   direction perfect     i though i got tense watching top gun maverick and christopher nolan comes and makes this masterpiece
Jul 25 2023,positive,movie of the decade
Jul 25 2023,positive,i cannot rate this movie high enough i loved everything about it from the exceptional character portrayal and development to the cinematography and the score having read the book many years ago i had hoped that the film would be true to it   and it is the actors  every one of them  deserve awards i highly recommend this movie
Jul 25 2023,positive,outstanding movie and christopher nolans use of sound was especially compelling
Jul 25 2023,positive,the sex scenes were un necessary  added nothing to the storyit was covered in fat man  little boy elegantly    more of manhattan work should have been includeinteresting there was no mention of fdrs death  or we missed it    the scene with truman seemed manufactured to us   we doubt truman called him cs    video  sound was outstanding 45 stars
Jul 25 2023,positive,excellent representation of a traumatic history nolan hit it out of the park
Jul 25 2023,positive,visually beautiful vulnerable story told well seeing in imax is recommended where available
Jul 25 2023,positive,this movie was amazing i see a lot of oscars nominations
Jul 25 2023,positive,so good i am still getting revelations about the content and the performances as i continue to think about it
Jul 25 2023,positive,fairly accurate based on historical facts
Jul 25 2023,positive,the cinematography made this a treat to watch in imax very informative film on steam and power wow
Jul 25 2023,positive,i loved the entire movie except for matt damon  as much as i like him he didnt fit the role as a senior military officer i got the feeling that he was going to break out laughing cillian murphy was great as was robert downey jr  everyone was a good fit except for matt sorry
Jul 25 2023,positive,riveting account of the making of the first atomic bomb and the toll it would take on all involved with the project christopher nolan never disappoints
Jul 25 2023,positive,absolutely perfection nolan murphy and downey jr deserve massive credit for this marvelous piece of cinema
Jul 25 2023,positive,greatest movie of all time
Jul 25 2023,positive,i liked it directed by christopher nolan the three hour film leans on dialogue not action but is nevertheless well paced    the good cillian murphy robert downey jr and emily blunt will be oscar nominees for best leading actor and best supporting actors respectively i like their odds especially murphy murphy in his spoton portrayal of oppenheimer is really brilliant in the role so often his posture and facial expressions the eyes in particular carry the scene much as the photograph of oppenheimer ive posted here blunt as oppenheimers tested but loyal wife shines best in the last hour downey is outstanding as the key antagonist nolans movie tackles the challenging technical and moral questions of the manhattan project that divided both the scientific and political communities eg should the bomb be built will it work what might it do should it be used what pandora have we let out of the box and shouldcan we put it back the impact of anticommunism and huac aka red scare on honest friendships and patriotic careers the script adaptation of the book is well written its a movie that leaves you thinking not a bad thing in this day and age    the neutral given the way the film is edited  focus on oppenheimers point of view in color and lewis strauss point of view black and white  it requires the viewer pay attention throughout the film like a good british crime mystery everything that seems a bit confused through 23rds of the film gets recalled and tied together nicely in the last third pay close attention to oppenheimers first brief encounter with albert einstein it plays large at the end of the film     the bad not much some scenes that seem on the brink of revealing character and relationships are abbreviated leaving the viewer to piece them together through flashback snippets it is not a chronologically linear film i didnt think the jean tatlock affair added much to the story other than reinforcing kitty oppenheimers devotion to her husband not much affection is shown in either relationship it is also challenging to keep track of the various scientists names who come and go throughout the sound editing makes hearing some subtle or hushed lines difficult to understand while not mandatory to enjoyment it helps if the viewer goes in with some history of the project this wont be a hit for many but its a very good film
Jul 25 2023,positive,liked the movie would have liked to have seen a bit more of the science and physics mentioned
Jul 25 2023,positive,fantastic cast great storytelling a little long but great cinematography saw it at an imax
Jul 25 2023,negative,boring too slow fell asleep 3 times
Jul 25 2023,negative,how can you take a scientific achievement during a world war with important ethical and moral questions and reduce it to a senate confirmation hearing a dozen years later it could not be more boring if it tried
Jul 25 2023,positive,amazingit showed a realistic view of the situation in the us during the time the first atomic bombs were being developed there was a lot of information about the factions involved in the government and other political activists who were both pro and con about the whole situation the actors who were chosen for the major roles in the film did an excellent job of portraying the characters it kept us involved and interested from beginning to end and there were surprises as the storyline progressed
Jul 25 2023,positive,i saw this as the second half of my barbieheimer weekend i feel proud of myself for sitting through it it is very much a film vs a movie it had a tight script especially the ending and some parts were phenomenal especially at los alamos but the beginning dragged and the framing around the q clearance revocation got boring and confusing basically this movie failed to consistently entertain me like i said glad i saw it i can feel smart at parties talking about it but i never need to see it again and it annoys me when things are so obvious about aiming for prestige
Jul 25 2023,positive,excellent all the way  am intermission would have been nice
Jul 25 2023,positive,best movie released so far this year  a must watch
Jul 25 2023,positive,pounding background sounds were overdone visuals dizzying to indicate his ideas in grad school were odd suggested he was a bit crazy rather than just creative and brilliant the jumping back and forth from his being accused of communism and unfaithfulness to the us to various stages in his life wax a bit overloading
Jul 25 2023,negative,after reading many great reviews i went to see this tonight this has to be the worst 3 hours of my life i love great films and was expecting so much this was so boring from start to finish no great effects weak stroy   i think the normal person in the street will hate this as much as i did   go watch barbie instead 
Jul 25 2023,positive,a visually stunning film that delves deeply into the process and outcomes of creating the atomic bomb the acting was truly amazing with tons of name actors stepping into often small roles that could almost be considered cameos some of the dialog was really inspired too it was long but didnt feel long i enjoyed it
Jul 25 2023,positive,lots of details and a little too much politics
Jul 25 2023,positive,brilliant amazing cast sound cinematography
Jul 25 2023,positive,amazing movie one of the best ever soundtracks and the most visually stunning movies i have ever seen however one small critique is the movie doesnt give all the necessary historical context so some might walk out of it very confused definitely a top 10 movie of all time for me
Jul 25 2023,positive,absolute masterpiece visually stunning but he adapted oppies story perfectly changing only what was necessary
Jul 25 2023,positive,this was a great film amazingly portrayed the characters with intense emotion the information density gives for great rewatch ability but without being too hard to follow
Jul 25 2023,positive,one of the most compelling riveting and powerful movies that i have ever seen  its a film masterpiece its a threehour movie thats well paced and moves quickly  its an important film to see given the historical accuracy of what took place during ww2  i encourage everyone to see it  its a character study of a brilliant flawed man who changed the course of our country during war  i havent been in a movie theater in four years and it was definitely worth seeing in a movie theater
Jul 25 2023,positive,was a thrill ride of a movie from the start it was intriguing and captivating
Jul 25 2023,positive,enjoyed the information
Jul 25 2023,positive,all i can say is wow
Jul 25 2023,positive,it was a good movie just keeping up with it was tiring with all the flashbacks i do recommend others seeing it
Jul 25 2023,negative,sorry this movie was bad long and boring and lazy editing barely understand the actors and story jumped around way too much if you didnt at least have some kind of knowledge of the history you were totally lost
Jul 25 2023,positive,excellent movie only wish i had a 70mm projection to watch
Jul 25 2023,positive,brilliant movie storytelling and optics were amazing
Jul 25 2023,positive,outstanding film about a very complex individual
Jul 25 2023,positive,the story is of course gripping  pulling together the right people to create a nuclear bomb and build a city in which to do it  but the underlying discrediting of oppenheimer is tedious and painful  we left the theatre after 2 hours  perhaps the movie wasnt 2 hours but published start time until we left was  history tells how it ended
Jul 25 2023,positive,good film and presentation
Jul 25 2023,positive,great movie with great cast
Jul 25 2023,positive,the detail in truth and the sound in the theater
Jul 25 2023,positive,i enjoyed oppenheimer being a story of events that actually took place in the history of the united states good directing and not overly dramatized in my opinion
Jul 25 2023,positive,it was a beautiful movie that captured the politics and drama behind the making of the atomic bomb as well as wwii
Jul 25 2023,positive,great acting great history  the music is wonderful
Jul 25 2023,positive,for me it didnt live up to the hype i was expecting one of the best movies i have ever seen and it was just a good movie great acting great cinematography story was not as compelling as i had anticipated
Jul 25 2023,positive,it was fantastic the whole cast was great maybe could have been a little shorter run time or have an intermission
Jul 25 2023,positive,nude scenes were from left field unnecessary and inappropriate too much made of the drama i would have preferred for information about the bomb itself and the other scientists which many were more capable than opie also too long could have been done in 2 hours
Jul 25 2023,positive,quite a saga superb acting all around and a compelling story about a heroic but clearly fallible lead character
Jul 25 2023,positive,i would watch twice in a row if i could it was really great and watching it on 70mm not imax unfortunately was also an experience
Jul 25 2023,positive,very interesting it helped fill in a lot of history for me even if not 100 accurate
Jul 25 2023,positive,it was an outstanding film
Jul 25 2023,positive,overall production and well crafted story line that feeds your intelligence
Jul 25 2023,positive,terrific movie  it covers oppenheimers role in the creation of the atomic bomb and his legimate concerns regarding how it would change the world
Jul 25 2023,positive,dont need imax to enjoy great movie
Jul 25 2023,positive,totally agree with rt critic and audience scores 93 and 94 really surprising incite into how the race for to invent the atomic bomb between russia us and germany in science communities the fear of and sympathy for communism is front and center really liked the pinky blinders guy as oppenheimer
Jul 25 2023,positive,its a beautiful movie with amazing music metaphors knowledge history science and impact    the atomic bomb dropped and explode is a beauty like a star    gillian murphy acting is topnotch that eyes tell everything how a character feels and see full regret that oppenheimer is now the father of mass destruction
Jul 25 2023,positive,all performances were amazing and cillian especially did an outstanding job  nothing like experiencing in imax  it was breathtaking
Jul 25 2023,positive,fantastic performances and storytelling well paced for a 3 hour movie highly recommended
Jul 25 2023,positive,execellent casting and acting director tried to tell 2 stories at same time should have been parts i and ii
Jul 25 2023,positive,brilliant absolutely brilliant christopher nolan  yet again created an incredible film cillian murphy is astonishing but the real surprise is robert downey juniord performance
Jul 25 2023,positive,the actors were superb and the documented story was a must see
Jul 25 2023,positive,ive been seeing the previews for this movie for months but i was skeptical that they could make this topic into a compelling story so i was very pleasantly surprised that it was the previews did not do this movie justice you need to go see it for yourself
Jul 25 2023,positive,factual representation of actual events
Jul 25 2023,positive,i liked how the time shifting allowed the story to unfold gradually although it was hard to follow sometimes  the acting was phenomenal
Jul 25 2023,positive,a bit too long  cast was really good even tho some of the known names had small parts
Jul 25 2023,negative,this was a documentary  hard to understand  no real story line just a recounting of what transpired
Jul 25 2023,positive,superb filmmaking and factually accurate plot line
Jul 25 2023,positive,interesting and lots of evil political people just like today  our deep state government throws away anyone they dont need   great acting
Jul 25 2023,positive,a masterpiece a must see in imax a master class in story telling you arent only watch oppenheimer you are feeling everything he feels
Jul 25 2023,positive,peak cinema movie of the year easily
Jul 25 2023,positive,great story great acting great cast  a bit confusing at first with the timing of events could have used some dates
Jul 25 2023,positive,a perfect film from nolan perhaps not suited to audiences who are less interested in slower paced stories which focus on character and narrative but a powerful showcase of how you can fully encapture the emotion and feeling of a film nonetheless    the acting is sublime and sure to gather numerous oscar nomination while the audio design is a masterclass in how you can fully emerse an audience within the cinema experience    nolans trademark rejection of vfx is at the top of its game and only further adds a sense of  realism and terror to the scenes    while oppenheimer may only be suited to certain audience there are deep lessons regarding morality and ethical balance which everyone could learn from the fact the film was also created in only 58 days is a testament to the entire cast and crew
Jul 25 2023,positive,excellent cast playing the roles extremely well a compelling story well told by a fantastic director
Jul 25 2023,positive,this was a sensational movie with perfect casting especially oppenheimer general groves and kitty oppenheimer it followed the book leaving much for thought
Jul 25 2023,positive,christopher nolan knocks it out of the park again
Jul 25 2023,positive,so much history packed in 3 hrs  was engrossing  this feature needs to be seen more than once to absorb it all
Jul 25 2023,positive,an extraordinary film with an equally extraordinary cast  incredible performances from every actor oppenheimer will go down as one of the greatest movies ever made and seals christopher nolans stature as one of if not the greatest director of this generation
Jul 25 2023,negative,it was too long and boring
Jul 25 2023,positive,fast paced no dull moments despite being a long movie
Jul 25 2023,positive,not sure its as magnificent as many reviews make it out to be but id give it a solid 4 12 stars  some of the characters didnt feel fully fleshed out likely because there were so many of them but disappointing when they were people critical to the story
Jul 25 2023,negative,not a bad movie just a bit long and boring for my taste
Jul 25 2023,positive,very interesting move  it was long and at times drawn out but staying for the whole movie is well worth it  i learned a lot of things that i did not know  historical
Jul 25 2023,positive,great story and action was more political than i was expecting but is never boring
Jul 25 2023,positive,its accuracy with great acting and direction
Jul 25 2023,positive,great movie really enjoyed sex scenes did nothing in my opinion for film for those in my party it detracted but otherwise excellent
Jul 25 2023,positive,one of the best films to come out this decade see it at an imax theater soon
Jul 25 2023,positive,amazing as any nolan movie
Jul 25 2023,positive,i totally enjoyed how the story unfoldedeach person was  brought to life  in a very real manor
Jul 25 2023,positive,a little over my head but fascinating wonderful actors and actresses  great supporting cast
Jul 25 2023,positive,wonderful movie must like history was rather long
Jul 25 2023,positive,it was an interesting movie and history but i wished id known it was 3 hours long and i should of read more about the 17 r rating  its sad that movie makers are slipping in unnecessary discussing pornography scenes to further groom our society  it cheapens the movie and now i wont recommend it to anyone and regret i went
Jul 25 2023,positive,well done in all ways
Jul 25 2023,negative,b o r i n g  first time in my life to have left the theatre before the end
Jul 25 2023,positive,i was amazed and impressed with the level of accuracy the movie included on not only oppenheimers life but the assembly of and the conflicts that arose during the manhatten project during my career  i have worked extensively and met many people that worked with oppenheimer     the movie was spectacular in the amc concord imax theater
Jul 25 2023,positive,filled in the rest of the story  most stories about the gadget stop at the release enjoyed hearing more about the rest of his life and his doubts great cinematography and the screenplay drew on the appropriate emotions with a little bit of humor for tension release
Jul 25 2023,positive,a deep dark and unrelentingly intense biographical thriller featuring careerbest performances from murphy and downey jr
Jul 25 2023,positive,loved the movie it was long and the acting excellent i learned a tremendous amount of history that i didnt know about definitely deserves academy awards i will definitely will watch it again
Jul 25 2023,negative,pretty boring and hard to follow also drags on way longer than it should
Jul 25 2023,positive,it was long but done very well informative disturbing that if we did that then what do we have now we do not know about   i would recommend adults only
Jul 25 2023,negative,very disappointed i fully expected to like this movie the storyline was confusingvery choppyjumped around there were too many cryptic things in it that never got explained and were too cryptic to make a reasonable guess as to what they meant weird cutin scenes that didnt enhance the story  i think they tried to use the music in scenes to get a feeling or emotion across but it was poorly done it actually took away from the scenes i cant say there was anything i liked about this movie lots of a list actors but the movie was so bad and the characters so unlikeable that i didnt even enjoy the acting  i couldnt wait for this movie to end i give this movie an f
Jul 25 2023,positive,historical and fascinating
Jul 25 2023,positive,nolan accomplished the unimaginable just like oppenheimer did 78 years before him
Jul 25 2023,positive,absolutely fantastic one of nolans best harrowing and timely a truly uncomfortable film but a monumentally important one and his most mature and complex subject yet
Jul 25 2023,positive,love the random pop ups explosion
Jul 25 2023,positive,absolutely masterpiece intriguing and engaging down to the most minute detail acting directing cinematography and score is at the peaks of each said department nolan continues to make cinema and an absolute experience
Jul 25 2023,positive,wow  i saw it on imax incredible i felt like my heart was pounding in my chest quite a bit
Jul 25 2023,positive,well done pretty accurate according to sources
Jul 25 2023,positive,very well done  fast paced  did not seem like 3 hours
Jul 25 2023,positive,i truly liked this movie i love anything based on history i feel that they couldve made this movie about 25 hours long but whats an extra half hour its definitely worth seeing the theater was packed for the midmorning showing
Jul 25 2023,positive,i read the novel that this film is based on and i think it made it easier to follow some of the storylines i would highly recommend the book american prometheus as well as 109 east palace if you really want to know more about the details of the los alamos project and the day to day living in that environment     the actors in this film are top rate and and the movie has just the right amount of spectacular special effect the acting and dialogue do not get overwhelmed by special effects which can happen too often with these blockbuster movies cillian murphy does capture the way oppenheimer was described physically emily blunt does an amazing job portraying his wife kitty there are so many details of these relationships that cannot be captured in this movie if you love the story check out the book
Jul 25 2023,positive,great history lesson entertaining as well as informative
Jul 25 2023,positive,lived up to the hype big time
Jul 25 2023,positive,liked learning about the history and biographical detailsstill it seemed too long3 hours
Jul 25 2023,positive,the acting was amazing   oscar material  very engaging
Jul 25 2023,positive,the juxtaposition of american exceptionalism of the cold war tech races era versus the recognition of creating a device of mass destruction that the world can only hope a government has the audacity to use only once was a challenge in telling both stories
Jul 25 2023,positive,wide in depth view of the activities that led to the culmination
Jul 25 2023,positive,this will win everything under the sun whether all the credit goes to cillian murphys brillance or to nolan for tapping cillian we may never know but both combine for something that will go unmatched for a long time an honest biopic about robert oppenheimer that doesnt provide any answers because there are no easy answers instead it lends to the audience a masterwork of a story worth pondering over  over this goes above nolans past best works in dunkirk and inception not only due to the refined wizardry of nolans genius but also to the nature of what the film sets out to explore  that momentous juncture in human history when we couldnt mathmatically rule out that we as humanity could destroy ourselves in the very attempt to save ourselveswith all of our human complexicites webbed throughout
Jul 25 2023,positive,what a movie amazing acting and cillian murphy is perfect 1010
Jul 25 2023,positive,films about historical events are often a hard sell regarded by some as a dry discipline that has very little to do with our current reality history is supposedly meant to be left in the classroom the film oppenheimer shows this outlook to be flawed starring cillian murphy as j robert oppenheimer a theoretical physicist who led a team of scientists that created the first atomic bomb known as the manhattan project it transpired from 1942 to 1945 with a raging world war ii and nazi germany forging its own effort to create an atomic bomb the team assembled at los alamos new mexico convened under a dire sense of urgency this urgency was conveyed in this film     in three hours oppenheimer tells the story of those involved in the manhattan project showing the politics of the early to mid1940s viewers will see how the geopolitical realities of that time dictated what the scientists could do furthermore it is shown how easily even people regarded as indispensable can be utilized and then eventually discarded this film in many ways wrestles with the ethics of using the atomic bomb towards the end of the second world war historians still debate to this day whether or not the use of two atomic bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki was necessary this is a movie that can initiate so many different discussions it is a reminder that the united states is the only nation to have ever actually used nuclear weapons in a conflict       oppenheimer shows that the atomic age that began more than 70 years ago still hangs over humanity as a threat to our very existence in the context of an escalating regional conflict and increasing international tensions it is a reason to give us all a reason to take a pause and realize what is at stake oppenheimer is a powerful movie and it is a film worth seeing
Jul 25 2023,positive,the first half of the movie was boring
Jul 25 2023,positive,another masterpiece by christopher nolan see it in imax if you can
Jul 25 2023,positive,very interesting and informative fascinated at how it all panned out felt bad for robert and his guilt scary how the government will do anything that will benefit them thought the movie was a bit too long and drug out kinda slow
Jul 25 2023,positive,this was a very powerful movie  every actor was right for hisher part and played it well  this was a great and pivotal time in history and how better to learn about it than through an entertaining movie  we enjoyed seeing oppenheimer very much
Jul 25 2023,positive,excellent movie great cast that keeps you riveted for the entire movie
Jul 25 2023,positive,actually two movies first is creating the bomb second is the dirty deeds of conservatives not much has changed  both done very well
Jul 25 2023,positive,i watched the movie at the premiere and without a doubt it is one of the best movies of the year    the film tells not only the story of robert oppenheimer but also brings physical philosophical and even political themes of the time in a very well presented and directed by christopher nolan the soundtrack visual and sound effects were amazing    the actors performance was spectacular especially cillian murphy who played the main character so that the viewer can understand in detail how oppenheimer feels about the creation of the atomic bomb and its consequences as well as certain personal problems in his life it is also worth highlighting the importance of emily blunt matt damon tom conti and robert downey jr in the cast    it is important to emphasize that the film deserves a lot of attention from the viewer to understand the historical context well and link the facts that occur in the film the story is very interesting and impactful especially for us who live today in a context after the creation of the atomic bomb and with the rapid advancement of war technology    i highly recommend this cinematic work congratulations to everyone involved in this spectacular project movie note 10 
Jul 25 2023,positive,a little confusing bouncing back and forth between years
Jul 25 2023,positive,too long  realize it was about the politics of the time but would have rather just stuck to the science  jumping back and forth was a little confusing too the kind of movie you really have to pay attention to every word and some of the dialog was low
Jul 25 2023,positive,masterpiece we already have one of the favorites for the oscars i mean one of the because so far its the favorite but hollywood always surprises us with great movies at the end of each year but i think this year it will be very difficult to overcome oppenheimer  if youre wondering why spend 3 hours watching a movie that isnt a marvel movie or a continuation of blockbusters dont worry the movie is so good that it makes you immerse yourself in the narratives and ethical and scientific issues of a world extremely shaken by a war it even seems like the present day that you wont even feel the time pass  all performances are exquisite here i speak of some statuettes for the cast with emphasis on robert downey jr in his best performance ever emily blunt and cilian murphy are fantastic in their roles and in my opinion oscar nominations for both are guaranteed  for those who dont know that moment in history its a great opportunity to learn and reflect we have several characters in the history of humanity present such as albert einstein the greatest scientist of all time and president truman who ended a war using the deadliest weapon ever used  its very worth it dont miss it
Jul 25 2023,positive,it was a great movie with riveting performances cillian murphy is terrific as is emily blunt and robert downey jr  the story was so compelling its definitely a history lesson about wwii and the aftermath
Jul 25 2023,positive,smart well balanced movie intense from start to finish
Jul 25 2023,positive,excellent cinematic masterpiece  pure genius by christopher nolan cillean murphy is amazing and so is the entire cast just well done  seeing it in imax is the best
Jul 25 2023,positive,great movie winner of best picture for 2024 oscars
Jul 25 2023,positive,being extremely familiar with the history names and events i found the story interesting but way to artsyfartsy for the cinematography and especially the very annoying music
Jul 25 2023,positive,the movie that takes you by surprise not only is cinematography is at its fullest performances sets etc 1010
Jul 25 2023,positive,important topic  learned a lot i didnt know  great actors
Jul 25 2023,positive,fabulous film expertly done a must see
Jul 25 2023,positive,the great movie 1010 nolan is a god of cine
Jul 25 2023,positive,i thought it was a bit hard to follow at first however about 3045 minutes into itbam  it hooked me and didnt feel like a 3 hour movie at all  cant wait to see it again
Jul 25 2023,positive,superb filmcast acting directing as well
Jul 25 2023,negative,the direction of this movie solely focuses on oppenheimer himself and his life under the scrunity of the us government accusing him of being a spy i would have loved for this to be closer to dunkirk and showing the war effort while working on the atomic bomb in tandem the hype surrounding the imax 70mm format also added to the disappointment since the viewer is only seeing faces for the entire 3 hour runtime and only one explosion not worth seeing in theaters in my opinion especially not worth seeing a second time
Jul 25 2023,positive,intense pressure of wartime portrayed quite well physicists  involved brought back memories of my physics classes in high school and university  cillian murphy and robert downey jr should win oscars for their roles  the jumping back and forth between pre and post bomb were confusing overall worth the time and ticket price
Jul 25 2023,positive,masterpiece nolans best movie to date
Jul 25 2023,positive,the nude sex seen did not add any value to the movie it took away from it the monas very good except for that  i will not recommend it to friends for that reason
Jul 25 2023,positive,great movie but the power went out at a super climactic scene
Jul 25 2023,negative,too long  story line not clear  jumped around to much  saw it in imax but wasnt impressed
Jul 25 2023,negative,awful i was so disappointed i waited weeks to see this my husband slept i wanted to leave but kept waiting for it to get better it didnt
Jul 25 2023,positive,a masterclass in editing and pacing probably nolans best work so far
Jul 25 2023,positive,one of the best movies i have ever seen
Jul 25 2023,positive,even better then i expected cant wait to see again
Jul 25 2023,positive,surprisingly uplifting and inspiring despite the subject matter
Jul 25 2023,positive,actors how the story was told effects how the film was shotscenesso awesome  loved it
Jul 25 2023,positive,this might be nolans best film so far it keeps you pulled in the entire 3 hour run time even though it is a historical film and you know what is going to happen it still manages to shock you great film with a score that has you holding your breathe the entire time a definite must see
Jul 25 2023,positive,absolutely brilliant
Jul 25 2023,positive,liked extremely wellacted by everyone but i thought that robert downey jr was absolutely top notch story telling was very good     dislike just a tad too long
Jul 25 2023,positive,wow what an amazing movie i highly recommend going to see it
Jul 25 2023,positive,excellent portrayal of history
Jul 25 2023,positive,christopher nolans historical drama oppenheimer is honestly the best film ive seen in years a brilliance of engaging storytelling of scientific achievement  personal guilt with stunning visuals score  ground shaking sound   even with knowledge of the trinity test the first detonation of a nuclear weapon nolan made it the most suspenseful cinematic moment i can remember   with a massive talented cast of familiar faces  strong performances none of them feel useless but its cillian murphy robert downey jr  emily blunt who are the standouts with deserving every single bit of praise
Jul 25 2023,positive,the visuals were crisp the score was amazing and made my heart race and people were literally sitting on the edges of their seats i felt like i was running a marathon in a crowded theater of bated breaths
Jul 25 2023,positive,very good movie but way too long
Jul 25 2023,positive,liked the fact that a politician can be confronted and exposed loved historical perspective no problem with nudity
Jul 25 2023,positive,it wasnt something i would go see i was asked  to go by a friend  i dont particularly have any interest in the bomb making it was good with the effects
Jul 25 2023,positive,well done movie  cillian murphy was outstanding
Jul 25 2023,positive,long great actors a bit choppy but i knew something about oppenheimer so my husband and i followed
Jul 25 2023,negative,the movie was over hyped possibly because hollywood is still trying to financially recover from the covid era  after one and a half hours of very slow pace i had to get up and walk out  i have only done that in one other movie star wars episode ii  my money might have been better spent wathing elemental  at least the popcorn and soda was great as always interstellar was greatbut unfortunately after this moviei will never elect to see a christopher nolan movie again
Jul 25 2023,positive,as someone greatly interested in the manhattan project and the decision to drop the bomb i went into the movie very excited unfortunately i left very disappointed the movie does not really do a good job of introducing the key characters if a person does not go into the movie with at least a basic knowledge of scientists like nils bohr and edward teller they will be completely lost cillian murphy does a good job playing oppenheimer as a kind of tortured genius but the rest of the cast are undermined by a weak script if a teacher were to show this movie in the classroom to try and shed some light on the decision to drop the bomb she would have to hit pause every 5 minutes to provide more context and also look for ways to keep everyone awake
Jul 25 2023,positive,probably the best movie directed by nolan i would see it again and again
Jul 25 2023,positive,it was 3 hours long and still felt a bit rushed i was so ready for more the ending was brilliant and left me speechless im going to rewatch it 100 i really hope oppenheimer was wrong
Jul 25 2023,positive,i enjoyed this movie and was not bored at all  i am much more familiar with the manhattan project as i am in illinois and was made aware of this from childhood  i will admit that there were a few occasions that i lost track of who was who but that will happen when there are so many people involved in a project such as this one
Jul 25 2023,positive,is an amazing movie it worth every minute
Jul 25 2023,negative,movie sucked it should absolutely not have been in imax they didnt even show hiroshima or nagasaki  only explosion was the test bomb and that was a disappointment compared to what it could have been and there was no reason for throwing in sex scenes but they did anyway and the girls were kind of ugly so there was no point at all really who thinks of sex when they think of oppenheimer nope that was stupido the whole thing was a complete disappointment they should have included more of the bomb the bomb getting transported the uss indianappolis enola gaye  the bombs getting dropped thats what i wanted to see in imax instead we got a loud dialogue movie consisting of boring conversations
Jul 25 2023,positive,i didnt see the reason the sex scene had to be in the movie
Jul 25 2023,positive,just an absolute master class in filmmaking a film for film buffs pure art with a story so real it shakes you to your bones with the real parallel to the ai wars about to occur in modern times this is almost a fighting foreshadowing of whats to come something inevitable thatll change the course of human history forever christopher nolan did it again
Jul 25 2023,positive,i was never interested in american history when i was young i preferred the history of great britain and europe  this movie introduced me to fascinating and brilliant individuals that my history books glossed over   dislikes  it was too short  i want more
Jul 25 2023,negative,was not what i expected at all
Jul 25 2023,positive,very good movie about american history just a very sad story line and hard to swallow  
Jul 25 2023,positive,it displayed a broad expanse of his life good and bad along with the technology and ethics of building the atomic bomb wouldve liked it to be a half hour shorter however because three hours is too long for me
Jul 25 2023,positive,the first half of the movie was a bit draggy the second half was outstanding  i am sure there will be all sorts of nominations  glad we saw it we are recommending to our friends
Jul 25 2023,positive,a little long but keeps you engrossed for 3 hours
Jul 25 2023,positive,gripping mesmerizing shocking heart breaking historic and very loud but of course its an a bomb
Jul 25 2023,positive,oppenheimer was amazing i had high expectation and it exceeded them by far the musical score was excellent and was used well to build up intense scenes this was an awesome movie
Jul 25 2023,positive,too long but interesting
Jul 25 2023,positive,great based on a true story movie about a profound and relevant issue
Jul 25 2023,positive,th very best  still thinking about it days later
Jul 25 2023,negative,soporific  nolan is overrated hes no great director
Jul 25 2023,negative,the movie is a disjointed mess that doesnt spend enough time on any part of the story to make it interesting a story about oppenheimers personal life would be great a story about the making of the bomb would be great a story about the politics around and after the bombs were made would be great a story about the tension between the scientists and military security would be great a story about discovering the spy would be great     this movie attempts to cover all of these things and as a result provides little detail about any of them     every scene has an epic swelling musical score in the background every scene has dramatic pans and zooms every utterance by every character drips with historical significance the movie pretends to be dramatic it tells you that it must be without having any substance to make it actually so no one feels real or human they are all cardboard cutouts of characters that feel very fictional its like they all know theres a camera watching them to record it for the history books its so fake    and nonlinear storytelling is not a shortcut for building a complex and interesting movie its not that you have trouble following along its just that keeping up with the constant cuts is jarring and distracting its like nolan didnt think the story was good enough to stand on its own and needed to be interjected with every other part to keep the audiences attention its about the making of the nuclear bombs there are spies and affairs and politics and explosions thats exciting enough just do that
Jul 25 2023,positive,terrific movie suspense historical acting etc
Jul 25 2023,positive,best movie of 2023 by far that ending was just chefs kiss
Jul 25 2023,positive,every part of this film was magnificent from acting to directing to writing
Jul 25 2023,positive,one of the best ensemble casts for a movie ever the cinematography was sublime and the story  while set in the 1940s and 50s still resinates today if you havent yet you should go see it at the biggest screen you can find
Jul 25 2023,negative,it was in spanish we walked out
Jul 25 2023,positive,long but captivating i learned a lot as well  also the music or should i say the sounds were both interesting and would vibrate your body to the bone
Jul 25 2023,positive,oppenheimer go    put away your cgi and wear your big person clothes  this is a movie that entertains by asking you to join the lead physicist in the development of the atomic bomb as he wrestles with the morality of nuclear weapons and later faces the full brunt of the military industrial complex for the sin of questioning whether bombs more deadly than those dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki needed to be constructed cillian murphy does an academy award job as oppenheimer and robert downey jr gets best supporting actor  if you are an intelligent adult looking for films that address significant issues in a serious but entertaining way you need to see this in theaters  please dont wait for streaming  we need good movies in movie theatres and though this is in no way a dc comics or tom cruise film it is terrific on the big screen
Jul 25 2023,positive,excellent cast  thoughtful sex scenes not sexy or particularly creative
Jul 25 2023,positive,very good script and direction by christopher nolan but about 34 of the way through i noticed the length
Jul 25 2023,positive,very well done and pretty fair in its treatment of oppy  lots of characters introduced need to watch again
Jul 25 2023,positive,excellent storytelling acting editing and effects for a biopic it comes close to perfect if not nolans best certainly in the top two while it is 3 hours it moved well without lulls great filmmaking
Jul 25 2023,positive,was a bit confused in the beginning but after i got into the movie i understood the reason for the beginning better  interesting that the movie just starts without any music or credits  now i want to more more about that time in our history  excellent actors and very well written
Jul 25 2023,positive,good historical breakdown   very informative    great acting   became a bit too artsy for me   some weird scenes    still a good movie
Jul 25 2023,positive,i very much enjoyed the history aspects the explicit nudity was way out of place in the telling of the story and detracted from the purpose of the movie
Jul 25 2023,negative,i went to the movie to learn about the creation of the atom bomb and the man who spearheaded the effort for the us      the gratuitous nudity and continuous scene cutting between two hearings makes the movie unwatchable
Jul 25 2023,positive,brilliant directing phenomenal performances deserves all the awards
Jul 25 2023,positive,i thought the first hour was really boring and the noise level  for theater was defining many times  my wife had to walk out    it got a little interesting about the history and politics of that time for the rest of movie    but for us it was a bad experience and waste of time and money besides dragging on for 3 long slow boring hours
Jul 25 2023,positive,loved the quality of the films storyline the director and entire cast  the lead actors were awesome
Jul 25 2023,positive,acting sound editing were all good i like the movie but it didnt live up to the hype was not the best movie ive ever seen not even close
Jul 25 2023,positive,the casting is great the story is great the acting is great the music not not great and too load the music was so load we could sometimes not heard the dialogue
Jul 25 2023,positive,visually spectacular and great storytelling although it has a long screen run
Jul 25 2023,positive,i loved the acting of main characters especially cillian murphy  the movie can be difficult to follow without some previous research and reading   would have liked captions of physicists as they were introduced during the movie
Jul 25 2023,positive,brilliant acting brilliant cinematography a sobering story of the world that was and what it is today
Jul 25 2023,positive,the acting was great but we didnt like how it jumped around between time periods and maybe it was the theater we were in but the music was deafening my ears were ringing when we left
Jul 25 2023,positive,too much nudity not really justified
Jul 25 2023,positive,loved the entire movie
Jul 25 2023,positive,very interesting story and excellent cast
Jul 25 2023,positive,found story about making of atomic bomb and its deployment very engrossing  however the inordinate amount of time spent on the stripping of his security clearance totally unnecessary and did not have to be a three hour movie
Jul 25 2023,positive,very good movie  opens up the normies to the introduction of the deep state  especially at the ending of the movie welcome to all those whove been on the blue pill for so damn long  time to wake up     much appreciated mr nolan  keep making fantastic movies
Jul 25 2023,positive,fair dealing of a complex person
Jul 25 2023,positive,it was okay but flawed i generally dislike biopics because there is often more fiction than fact and this was no exception the performances were wonderful but the narrative left me unmoved especially disappointing after 3 hours in the theatre i think nolan is an overrated director and critics who make the assertion that this and barbie have revived cinema dont know what real cinema is
Jul 25 2023,positive,i liked almost everything about the movie it is a stunning cinematic achievement  that said it is a long one clocking in at 3 hours but it is also wellpaced and my interest never lagged honestly i feel like oppenheimer is a shoein for best picture i cant imagine the film that would beat it
Jul 25 2023,positive,loved the movie  show just how corrupt the government was even in the 50s 
Jul 25 2023,positive,outstanding historial docudrama
Jul 25 2023,positive,excellent acting direction and subject  and no super heroes
Jul 25 2023,positive,this movie was long but evenly spaced it kept me intrigued with every part even when it was slower must watch and will probably be watching again
Jul 25 2023,positive,worth seeing for the acting and cinematography the length could have been cut down on a bit and it would have been nice to touch more on the science than the politics but i get that direction they were trying to go the commie sex scenes really didnt add anything to the film and felt out of place i liked that they didnt show japan getting bombed
Jul 25 2023,negative,soundtrack was loud and annoying  the storyline was disjointed and hard to follow
Jul 25 2023,positive,great overall felt like it couldve been 25 hours instead of 3 but 
Jul 25 2023,positive,oppenheimer used the best of christopher nolan style and it was beautiful i liked it because it felt natural like american beauty
Jul 25 2023,positive,one of the best movies i have seem in a long time
Jul 25 2023,neutral,much to long of a movie for me for the content i liked being out of the heat for 3 house but the storyline dragged not much feeling for his relationships i would watch it at home instead if i had a choice
Jul 25 2023,positive,movie was good  however sound in theater was so loud whole experience was more of an assault to senses than entertainment  looking forward to film being released on streaming so can watch at home in more controlled environment  disappointing since going to movies is favorite weekend night entertainment option
Jul 25 2023,positive,unbelievable movie i like how the script was factual
Jul 25 2023,positive,a fantastic film a bit hard to follow as it jumps from early life to present life and back again but it all fits in id need to see again as im sure i missed things
Jul 25 2023,positive,this movie was well made and intense it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time highly recommend anyone to see it they will not be disappointed
Jul 25 2023,positive,this was a movie i was looking forward to however the nonlinear storytelling could have been tightened up a bit
Jul 25 2023,positive,the actors gave great perfomances especially cillian murphy  the story was compelling and provided insights into manhattan project and the injustice to dr oppenheimer after the war
Jul 25 2023,positive,christopher nolan is a masterful film maker  the film weaves past and present threads of oppenheimers life  it helps to know a bit about the history that underlies the films story and how the politics of wwii drove this mans life  both good and bad    one thing  while the women in oppennheimers life were strong and learned the portrayal of them was less than realflattering  more time should be spent in developing their stories which were integral to oppenheimers life
Jul 25 2023,positive,jumping back and forth in time  it was a little hard to follow at times
Jul 25 2023,positive,excellent depiction of how government works an eye opener for all to see
Jul 25 2023,positive,the first two hours lead you into the captivating last hour definitely an excellent movie character performances are top notch
Jul 25 2023,positive,a bit slow for moments
Jul 25 2023,positive,id actually give it 412 stars closest analogue in film biographies would probably be lawrence of arabia nolans actors are uniformly excellent and cillian murphy is the physical incarnation of oppenheimer robert downey jr gives the performance of his career as lewis strauss minor quibbles would be murphy occassionally struggling with the accent and a musical score which felt a bit haphazard and at points drowned out the dialogue the story was told in a highly original and unique fashion bouncing around in time and switching between color and black and white rewards the viewer whos willing to give it their full attention and intellectual engagement not for the kids multiple academy award nominations are forthcoming highly recommended
Jul 25 2023,positive,if youre looking for pure entertainment go see barbie  this was very educational very well written and meaningful  the quality of the sound was not very good for the first bit of the movie  it was very hard to hear and figure out what they were saying therefore much was missed  cillian murphy was great and robert downey jr deserves an oscar nomination
Jul 25 2023,positive,it was outstanding cast photography
Jul 25 2023,negative,we never saw the movie the theatres air conditioning went out is there a refund we can expect
Jul 25 2023,positive,great movie throughout cannot leave your seat its so good
Jul 25 2023,positive,it was fine mid level nolan movie that couldve been 3045 mins shorter
Jul 25 2023,positive,one of the best movies ive seen in a long time  robert downey jrs performance was his best ever
Jul 25 2023,positive,excellent movie it was long but we were so focused that it went by quickly
Jul 25 2023,positive,loved the way it looked cillian murphy was perfect as oppenheimer the sets looked so perfect compared to old photos  i saw it on the smaller screen but will go again to see it on the imax  ive already told so many people to see it  fantastic
Jul 25 2023,positive,fantastic movie  it was great wonderful acting great plot fascinating characters superb in every way  i sure hope murphy wins an oscar
Jul 25 2023,positive,the movie was extremely well done robert downey jr was fantastic as was the man who played oppenheimer the acting throughout the movie was superb and the movie moved along quickly never a dull moment it made me wish i had more of a history background and i read about oppenheimer online to better understand the quibble between oppenheimer and strauss loved the entire movie must see
Jul 25 2023,positive,i dont think this movie is for everyone im very interested all events surrounding ww2   so i enjoyed it my only complaint is i feel the movie was about 30 minutes to long
Jul 25 2023,positive,knowing the history of what happened to him
Jul 25 2023,positive,i liked the movie but i felt it ran a little too long i did not feel the nudity scenes added anything and were just thrown in to change the rating they were not needed
Jul 25 2023,positive,cinematic masterpiece everyone delivered
Jul 25 2023,positive,the acting was phenomenal as well as the story and style this was the best movie ive seen all year
Jul 25 2023,positive,the acting was incredible and the story was well told  i thought the part when the actual bombs were released was slightly underwhelming but overall one of the best movies of the year for sure  id expect a ton of awards
Jul 25 2023,positive,acting was great  cillian murphy was amazing as was robert downey jr  the story telling was superb didnt feel like a 3 hour movie must see
Jul 25 2023,positive,superbly written and acted murphy and downey deserve oscars for their performances  the only problem i had was the dialogue was sometimes drowned out by the soundtrack  it may have been the theater acoustics though  i want to watch again with subtitles on because im sure i missed some important dialogue
Jul 25 2023,negative,informative but boring my son went with us and said all it was was people talking the whole movie we should have done our research before agreeing to let them person who picked the movie have final say
Jul 25 2023,positive,i enjoyed the movie very much  robert downey was excellent  i had a bit of a hard time not thinking of cillian murphy as peaky blinders  he became that character and it was hard to see him as someone else
Jul 25 2023,positive,the story is stellar kudos to christopher nolans for his vision to translate the story into a visual and an emotional piece of art the acting the cinematography the music score the songs all worked magnificently together to bring this long overdue tale to 8 worldwide audience thank you christopher nolan for making this movie
Jul 25 2023,positive,fantastic movie its a christopher nolan movie so of course we all knew it would be great
Jul 25 2023,positive,an absolute masterpiece great direction as well as fabulous sets plus the acting was fantastic
Jul 25 2023,positive,the actors were stellar the plot was intriguing
Jul 25 2023,positive,fabulous gripping superbly written directed and acted and true to the history an amazing film that well see again
Jul 25 2023,positive,director nolan made what could have been a long boring documentary into a fast paced eye opening beautifully artistic movie the actors performed exceptionally off each other i only wished they would have more insight on the building of the bomb
Jul 25 2023,neutral,way too many flashbacks that were very confusing and the audio in the theater made it extremely hard to hear the dialogue  id pass and wait until it starts streaming
Jul 25 2023,positive,excellent and historical flick will see it a 2nd time
Jul 25 2023,positive,movie of the year cillian murphy and rdj deliver some of the greatest performances of their career also wow that costuming department was onpoint
Jul 25 2023,positive,too long not a prude but didnt need sex scenes otherwise the movie showed it like it was at that time  i enjoyed the telling of what happened back then
Jul 25 2023,positive,it was as far as i could determine a  historically accurate account of a historically important individual told in a way that kept you engaged for every moment of its 3hour length acting dialogue and storyline were all first rate ill include this on my alltime list of movie classics  gene st onge
Jul 25 2023,positive,engrossing wellstructured great pacing highly recommend
Jul 25 2023,positive,liked the story line
Jul 25 2023,positive,in depth history of the man and the project excellent acting
Jul 25 2023,positive,such a good cast  it was a bit too long but it was worth the viewing 
Jul 25 2023,positive,outstanding performance from cillian murphy and robert downey jr its a typical nolans storytelling revealing the american prometheus complicated characteristics and complex life brilliance in plot development and intertwining of characters leaving the audience to contemplate even after the movie ends requiring multiple thoughts and reflections to fully appreciate them
Jul 25 2023,positive,i love historical movies and books in this one fits the bill lots of detail
Jul 25 2023,positive,an amazing film christopher nolan has done it again cillian murphy also just had the best performance of his career with this he and rdj should be taking home oscars was worried the 3 hour runtime would drain this movie down but it did not
Jul 25 2023,positive,saw this on 70mm film incredible imagine very detailed oriented film with tons of substance
Jul 25 2023,positive,this movie was 3 hours of me thanking god that i didnt choose to study physics in college pointing at screen saying where i knew each actor from and laughing out loud every time someone said oppy unironically
Jul 25 2023,positive,a tremendous collection of historical facts presented in a very entertaining and compelling fashion after we saw the movie i found myself reading a great deal more about dr oppenheimer and his life i recommend everyone see this movie
Jul 25 2023,positive,interesting story  excellent cast  movie did not need to be 3 hours long  well worth time and money though
Jul 25 2023,positive,the switching back and forth from year to year was very smooth and relevant   great job
Jul 25 2023,positive,the additional sex scene at the conference was not necessary otherwise this movie offered a lot of information regarding the making of this weapon  it was necessary at that time but so sad to see so many innocent people killed
Jul 25 2023,positive,fascinating history told through great acting and script to keep you interested all the way to the end
Jul 25 2023,positive,dont think it deserves5 start 4 might be a stretch entertaining but too long the acting was very good ive always thought that the length of a movie doesnt mean anything if the time goes by quickly which means that youre enjoying it this movie seemed to go on and on had me looking at my watch
Jul 25 2023,positive,remarkable achievement  one of the years best
Jul 25 2023,positive,outstanding film only thing that i would say is that it could have been shorter otherwise excellent
Jul 25 2023,positive,cinematography was great robert downey jr and matt damon did their usual tour de force acting and i enjoyed the 70mm imax format  that said the film ran an hour too long everyone elses acting was adequate though i thought cillian murphy was miscast and ultimately the finale was a letdown  the one specialeffect scene at trinity site was impressive but not worth the time sitting in the theater i had to spend to get to it  the takehome message we wanted a bomb to prevent world fascism the war in europe ended before it could be used the war in the pacific was on the downswing we were winning it but we finally had two working bombs so why not use them against japan save ourselves a few americans and show the world it shouldnt mess with us cowboystyle  and start a nuclear arms race just for kicks  i am so proud to be an american
Jul 25 2023,positive,one of the best movies of all time
Jul 25 2023,positive,the acting was great  so many well known names  the story was good but probably 12 hour longer than needed
Jul 25 2023,positive,this movie was a good movie but it didnt hit all the marks for me i was expecting it to be more related to the actual building of the bomb but was disappointed that it was more about the struggles of the actual dr oppenheimer throughout his career i now know more about his career struggles then the actual most important event in the atomic bomb history of america
Jul 25 2023,positive,acting story well directed all around great flick
Jul 25 2023,positive,this movie is way overblown  it was good but not great  it was too long and way too selfimportant  that said it is worth watching
Jul 25 2023,positive,too long   hard time to keep track of the characters
Jul 25 2023,positive,the acting and story line are superb
Jul 25 2023,positive,interesting  great acting
Jul 25 2023,positive,story was fascinating the acting superb by all but why in the world would nolan put in those two sex scenes one very creepy it added nothing to the story and could have had the movie rated pg for a wider audience     i saw people walk out after the first scene makes no sense
Jul 25 2023,positive,phenom for a long theater movie it moved quickly through a complicated storyline
Jul 25 2023,positive,visually stunning with excellent acting at all levels
Jul 25 2023,positive,good movie and cast but too long
Jul 25 2023,positive,this had to be one of the best films i have seen i liked the cinematography the landscape and the way the story went together very realistic and the use of film libraries was also very effective nothing bad i can say about this film the time flew by i also thought that the historical accuracy of the film was mostly spot on  thank you
Jul 25 2023,positive,this would be a 45 star movie if it was condensed into a 90100min film 3 hours was too long and many scenes added little to no value on the story line the use of imax cameras throughout the whole film appeared to be a marketing stunt as a majority of the scenes took place in an office classroom or court setting the director also tried to compensate for the drawn out conversational scenes by adding suspenseful music but after 2 hours it is too much if this film werent on imax it would make for a decent limited series on the history channel
Jul 25 2023,positive,well done but perhaps a little more than i wanted to know about oppies psych or chaotic social life
Jul 25 2023,positive,very intense great effects
Jul 25 2023,positive,this is a must see movie it well written and shows a lot on how government handled people who do what they are asked to
Jul 25 2023,positive,love christopher nolan but he gets a little lost in the effects here and doesnt really convey the actual story of the development of the bomb  i think a stronger narrative would have helped and a lot less jumping back and forth in time  after the movie i watched a documentary to flesh out the actual events in sequence
Jul 25 2023,positive,i have add inattentive type so 3 hour movies are usually hard for me this one flew by  it never felt long or drawn out no filler material at all cillian murphy deserves every award there is along with some that havent even been invented yet the rest of the cast is also great but he was outstanding the movie is dialogueheavy so you need to pay attention unless you are super familiar with the story i had read the book the movie is based on american prometheus so i was familiar with the story but my husband was not as familiar with it and he had no trouble following along there are two perspectives shown  color for oppenheimers perspective and blackwhite for strauss perspective robert downey jrs character the differences are not for timelines only perspectives so maybe its helpful to know that going into it the cinematography was fantastic  nolan deserves best director for this as well as best picture its an incredible story told incredibly well
Jul 25 2023,negative,very slow 1st hour  the next 2 hours were not much better
Jul 25 2023,positive,great movie and superb performance of the actors i thought it was a little too long
Jul 25 2023,positive,great script music actors cinematography etc      i wish the translation to storylines were smoother
Jul 25 2023,positive,absolutely amazing cast great story and well done  a little hard to follow at times and a bit long but exceptional nonetheless
Jul 25 2023,positive,nolan has done it again exceeded expectations
Jul 25 2023,positive,good actors who actually saved the movie but it is too long and  visual part is poorly done the plot is not exciting there are a lot of dramatic stories linked to abomb development not just tests and 6  and 9 august bombings which are completely ignored from the story with regards to visual effects the immediate and later consequences of the bombing the reaction of the society the end of war which saved about million american lives and probably much more of japanese  russian spies in oppies team  all of it are either just mentioned or ignored instead we see the bureaucratic intrigue and boring endless talks overall it is not clear why oppie was so upset by not developing hbomb if he was so against it and feel having blood on his hands not convincing long  not visual
Jul 25 2023,positive,great story gripping i learned things that i didnt know the acting was wonderful too didnt notice that it was a long movie held my attention throughout
Jul 25 2023,negative,completely and utterly disappointing the story and back story of the man are disinteresting and drawn out i found the the storyline difficult to follow  it focused more on oppenheimers conflict with a politician  much of the movie is conversational which is completely up to the discretion of the movie maker i almost left the theater twice it was so boring visually it was lacking anything engaging  i cannot recommend this movie
Jul 25 2023,positive,for me this goes down as one of the best movies ive ever seen  i was so invested in this from the very beginning of the film and it did not disappoint   the three hours flew by  it was thought provoking emotionally charged  brilliant performances and expert direction  i learned something  how many times can you say that after sitting in  a theatre
Jul 25 2023,positive,i believe this movie will be up for oscar awards cillian murphy was awesome and deserves an oscar the story kept me captivated throughout it got a little long for me but i didnt mind due to being a great movie i would highly recommend seeing on the big screen
Jul 25 2023,positive,very detailed in all aspects  learned a lot that we didnt know about the history of the  great acting
Jul 25 2023,positive,one of the best movies ive ever seen  plan on watching it multiple times to fully capture what is happening
Jul 25 2023,positive,a very wellpaced movie did not feel like 3 hours the cast was amazing highly recommended
Jul 25 2023,positive,anything i say will just seem superficial  i dont usually gush but this time i feel i must  i have read the book and was prepared to be disappointed in the film but it exceeded my expectations  the film was great  the performances were exceptional  i was emotionally wrung out by the end  but i was very glad we went to see it
Jul 25 2023,positive,history that changed the world a bit disjointed but easy to follow
Jul 25 2023,positive,one of the top 3 best nolan films
Jul 25 2023,positive,the acting was very good and believable the special effects and the audio were outstanding as well what i disliked was the length of time it took to tell the story the sexual nudity wasnt necessary in my opinion
Jul 25 2023,positive,the movie could have been reduced by 45 minutes however excellent film i believe they missed the trick regarding not showing the magnitude of the disaster of the japan bombings    i wouldnt rush to watch this again
Jul 25 2023,positive,i thought it would go more into the science and research of the manhattan project but it was more about the people and trials it was decent though 3 hours long and you probably need to watch it more than once to understand everything
Jul 25 2023,positive,complex fascinating and captivating well told story of oppenheimer phenomenal performances by the cast
Jul 25 2023,positive,i liked it all it was very interesting
Jul 25 2023,positive,great cast and some memorable lines captivating for a dialogueheavy three hour movie good job cillian and christopher
Jul 25 2023,positive,loved it  i was worried about the 3 hour run time but i never got bored  highly recommend
Jul 25 2023,positive,outstandingthey started hawking this movie last summer and it was well worth the wait great acting almost wish it went longer   the only thing i was disappointed in was that may be i expected more from the imaxdolby presentation
Jul 25 2023,positive,great acting directing settings and editing helped put together different story lines in different time periods to make a cohesive whole and paint a larger picture of the titular character
Jul 25 2023,positive,perfect you dont realize its 3 horus long it goes fast you dont get bored it generates intrigue the sound track is simply amazing and comparable to hanz zimmer in interstellar
Jul 25 2023,positive,i didnt mind viewing oppenheimer and recounting events that led to the invention of atomic bomb of the 1940s but the posteffects of the film lingered on with doubts about such undertaking  it seems inventing such a devastating bomb was only justified by an intellectualcomplex of political competitiveness ie whoever invents the abomb first is the one who controls it  only certain types of humans have the stuff it takes to handle the introduction of a powerful weapon such as those who view the pursuit of the highermind amidst an ongoing condition of turmoil and conflict  the rest of us perhaps do not know how to take it  we are not the same as the socalled higherminded political warriors      who is really right is hard to say  it is better that powerful weapons always get into the right hands  but then was it needed at all   did it really justify itself   nuclear energy was never mentioned in the movie only the abomb and to this day it is difficult to determine the success of nuclear energy  if there is yet another purpose for nuclear detonation such as planetary defense of a major asteroid it is yet to be known
Jul 25 2023,positive,i really did like the movie unfortunately the theater i went to lost power just over 30 minutes to the end
Jul 25 2023,positive,absolutely flawless a true masterpiece oppenheimer is 3 hours long but will have you begging for 4 never once lost interest or my attention
Jul 25 2023,positive,the movie is great in nearly all respects except the sound track which was irrelevant much of the time and so loud that it repeatedly overwhelmed the simultaneous dialogue  this made it ridiculous difficult to follow much of the story  this may have resulted from the fact that i saw the film in an imax theater that plays everything at full volume
Jul 25 2023,positive,learned so much  great story acting and cinematography   gave 4 stars because can do without the nudity
Jul 25 2023,positive,i enjoyed the movie because im a big history nerd and the combination of science and military history was right up my alley the way everything was explained and shown really helped liven up what most folks wouldnt normally be interested in     i knocked a star off for the last thirty minutes or so after the bomb testing because of how boring that last section was i really feel like it could have been shortened down as it felt like it dragged on to pad out the length of the movie i also didnt like the fact that there was no intermission i had a friend who missed part of the movie due to a bathroom break and i myself had to pee something fierce afterwards i highly recommend you dont go for the large drink at your theater to watch this movie haha
Jul 25 2023,positive,great movie long but well worth it a must see
Jul 25 2023,positive,i thought the film was well made the actors were great in their roles and the story well written it was very impactful to me personally
Jul 25 2023,negative,too much dialog not enough suspenseboring
Jul 25 2023,positive,best movie ive seen in a long time
Jul 25 2023,positive,this movie conveys a fascinating and significant era through the life of one man and those connected with him
Jul 25 2023,positive,oppenheimer is a great intense movie that  takes you on a journey  thoughtful well written well acted a must see on the big screen
Jul 25 2023,positive,loved the acting and the story
Jul 25 2023,positive,perfectly executed from start to finish
Jul 25 2023,positive,dont worry about the lenght the movie flows fast  history is always fun to learn about its origins  recommend going to see this movie
Jul 25 2023,positive,longer movie than it needed to be  the sex scenes were seemingly included to get a r rating because they didnt fit the storyline at all  oppenheimers guilt was overplayed  obvious he was not the only one capable of creating a nuclear bomb
Jul 25 2023,positive,this is the greatest movie ever created
Jul 25 2023,positive,great historical movie
Jul 25 2023,negative,to complicated jumped around too much hard to follow waste of 3 hours
Jul 25 2023,positive,dense epic personal and above all scary murphy nolan and hoytema have created a magnum opus that will be unmatched for years to come the trinity test is the best edited sequence in years
Jul 25 2023,positive,well acted historically relevant engaging   would not choose to see in imax again  too loud seats dont recline crowded theater
Jul 25 2023,positive,very well done excellent casting this 3 hour movie felt mor like an hour and a half highly recommended
Jul 25 2023,positive,another great film from nolan  a tad too long  tough to make the physics a cinematic experience
Jul 25 2023,negative,too long too complicated the characters are not introduced to the public
Jul 25 2023,positive,incredible performances by the whole cast especially cillian murphy who is absolutely magnificent thrilling story perfect sound one suggestion read up on the subject before seeing the movie it will help you understand it better and appreciate it even more
Jul 25 2023,positive,good movie but a little difficult to follow the movie focused more on oppenheimer after the bomb than the actual making and the on screen explosion left me somewhat disappointed 
Jul 25 2023,positive,this was an amazing movie it was never slow and completely amazing to watch
Jul 25 2023,positive,this is a great movie
Jul 25 2023,positive,a stark reminder of the past with a poetic postnuclear overtone
Jul 25 2023,neutral,i was not expecting to see oppenheimer sitting in a chair naked with the girl friend doing the same suddenly all i can think about was how neither of them were sitting on towels   too many scenes of him being interrogated by politicians   emily blunt was shockingly under used mostly she just glowered at him  informative but dryly drawn out
Jul 25 2023,positive,action  photography  story line
Jul 25 2023,positive,its a story about oppenheimer masquerading as a summer blockbuster
Jul 25 2023,positive,i liked the premise of the movie but it was too long in the middle i actually dozed off a bit i thought there was going to be more action lol the acting was good i liked the different actors that i havent seen for a while the story was very interesting though it is worth seeing get a big bucket of popcorn and a big soda
Jul 25 2023,positive,nice movie there could have been some start or end description of the scientists and people
Jul 25 2023,positive,the movie was exciting in the build up to inventing the a bomb  the history of his life was very detailed and   went into the early history of his life  it was not an action thriller but interesting inin the po perfecting the a bomb  it was necessary to end the war with japan  it seems like he got a bad deal in the post a bomb era
Jul 25 2023,negative,im giving the movie one star only because either fandango or the citadel mall theater charlestonsc doubled booked the ticket we were settled in our seats and a movie usher asked to see them i showed him the tickets and he said sorry they were double booked and we had to move or we couldnt see the movie he was very rude and made us feel like we had done something wrong  bad experience and i cant get anyone from fandango to respond i dont know if ill get tickets at this site again id like the movies worker to apologize for poor treatment of a customer
Jul 25 2023,positive,a little long but very informative
Jul 25 2023,positive,since he made the widely acclaimed dark knight trilogy christopher nolans films have gone from being mere movies to being events each one seems to grow in magnitude and complexity in anticipation and prestige and thats most certainly where oppenheimer comes in  nolan gives us an account of both the creation of the nuclear bomb and its consequences not just for oppenheimer himself but for the world and society as a whole ive heard some describe this as a horror film and in many ways i would agree its scary to consider the manhattan project which was designed specifically to create a weapon that could destroy entire cities and wipe out tens of thousands of lives in an instant the film acknowledges this and constantly reminds of us of how the closer the bomb was to being completed the closer it was to being used and when its tested in one of the most talked about scenes in the film i was actually gripping the arms of my chair the story demonstrates the vastly different reactions people had to the success of the detonation from shock to surprise to elation to despair to confusion the success of the film as a whole rests largely on the shoulders of cillian murphy a veteran supporting actor being given the chance to shine in a leading role and he absolutely nails it oppenheimer was a complex character and murphys performance perfectly captures this he was a man of a paradoxes a gifted teacher and intelligent academic that jeopardised his position for political reasons he never fully understood an upright family man who neglects wife and child hes constantly conflicted about his role in developing the bomb reasoning that its essential to secure victory in the war but itll come at the expense of countless innocent lives and hes working under government officials who see the weapon as a means to an end regardless of the human cost it contains a few problems that are somewhat common in nolans work some of the dialogue is very on the nose with characters speaking in movie trailer lines rather than how an actual human being would talk and the sound balance is all over the place the score by ludwig g√∂ransson adds a lot of emotion to the story and tension to the pivotal scenes but it also drowns out countless lines of dialogue and in a film with this much talking i dont understand how that can be deemed acceptable the film is 3 hours long and the first 2 acts are the most compelling when we get into the section where robert downey jnr takes centre stage as the aec chairman trying to revoke oppenheimers security clearance things begin to drag it feels like the same argument is being had and the same point being made again and again it dampens the film but doesnt ruin it this is christopher nolan doing what he does best big ideas a grand scale stunning visuals and a powerful score its a film that was made for the big screen its not perfect by any means but if youve been wanting to get out to the cinema again oppenheimer is the kind of movie thatll make the effort worthwhile
Jul 25 2023,positive,saw it twice so far
Jul 25 2023,positive,good movie  a little bit long but it kept my attention and others it will motivate you to see how the movie differed from facts the movie is pretty close to the actual facts it is a little confusing in the beginning because movie goes back and forth between present and past not in chronological order
Jul 25 2023,positive,gave great insight to all decisions around making the bomb
Jul 25 2023,positive,fast paced didnt feel like a 3 hr movie  helped me that i knew some of oppenheimers history  plot was not entirely linear  well acted  i recommend it
Jul 25 2023,positive,i thought that the movie showed a part of history that should never be forgotten  cillian murphy did an excellent job as dr oppenheimer
Jul 25 2023,positive,a complex depiction of a complex man  there are moments during the three hour runtime where i honestly questioned why we were being shown a particular character since it seemed a waste of time  by the end those nonessential characters in nonessential scenes ended up defining the movie christopher nolan does like to play with time and here it serves him well
Jul 25 2023,positive,very long but could have been more condensed
Jul 25 2023,positive,best movie of the year
Jul 25 2023,positive,christopher nolans epic biography oppenheimer is getting the same royal treatment as joy ride pretty much and its bit of a problem for me but for a different reason its a spectacularly well made movie yet if i were to state what the purpose of the movie was other than making a profit i would have to say its to push the idea that the united nations is capable of solving all the worlds problems and to absolve oppenheimer of all the baggage of his communist associations the pre and post world war ii periods were politically confusing and complex times and many people mostly intellectuals who flirted with communism back then were being driven by  their great fear of hitler and the nazis yet to leave out the equably sinister and deadly accomplishments of the soviet union and communist china and their communist leaders out of the discussion is to not tell more than  half of the story nothing in this movie gives the audience any idea of how evil murderous and cunning the communists were its all very well and good to talk about the threat to civilization that hitler represented but stalins absence is very telling considering the influential role he played in the history of the times and the events portrayed in this movie          cillian murphy should win an academyaward hands down for his portrayal of the troubled physicist yet the accuracy of the characterization is very much open to debate one of oppenheimers biographers  has written that for all intents and purposes oppenheimer was a communist oppenheimers insistence on turning over nuclear secrets to the two greatest mass murderers in history stalin and mao seems a remarkably naive assessment of the problems of dealing with the threat of a nuclear arms race robert downey jr was also stunning in the role of the allegedly evil and manipulative lewis strauss who becomes the antagonist of the movie strauss was known to be staunchly conservative and deeply religious and there is more than enough room to question how deserving strauss was of being characterized in such fashion         its a well made well written and well acted movie though the best ive seen this year by far it is however about twenty minutes too long it goes overboard in trying to prove oppenheimers innocence and stress strausss culpability in the scientists fall from grace i think that robert downey jr was given just about twenty minutes too much screen time in the effort to get him an oscar nomination some will say that time was needed in order for to complete the characterization of strauss but its obvious that they had already done that in spades during the scenes at the hearing it uses a lot of assumptions behind close door scenes about the motives of strauss yet casually dismisses a lot of what was well known about oppenheimer that time could have been more honestly used to place a disclaimer of sorts and maybe to alert the audience to how the huge ghostly evil presence of joseph stalin complicated american political thought in those dark days and continues to baffle our politics today the decision not to do that makes this seemingly flawless movie a great deal less than perfect
Jul 25 2023,neutral,too long and i wasnt sure what to expect but i really thought they would be a little bit more action in conspiracy it was pretty boring and i actually love history
Jul 25 2023,positive,great movie although could be confusing for audience who are not familiar with the actual timeline and events
Jul 25 2023,positive,cillian murphy as j robert oppenheimer seemed like he smoked about three packs of cigarettes during this film what i really loved was the powerful performance of emily blunt as katherine kitty oppenheimer  im not sure if kitty was truly that strong willed but her testimony while being badgered by a government prosecutor was awesome
Jul 25 2023,positive,it was compelling and entertaining my only criticism is that it was nothing like the preview universal might have filled more seats by stating that the movie wasnt so much about the bomb as it was about a the actual people that made the bomb
Jul 25 2023,positive,nice movie i really felt like i was inside of that history christopher nolan and everyone made a good job
Jul 25 2023,positive,oppenheimer is a poem on a mans life a long drawnout one but then of course thatd make it an epic
Jul 25 2023,positive,truly amazing film with a great story cast cinematography direction and of course another perfect score by ludwig gransson
Jul 25 2023,positive,very interesting always interested in history
Jul 25 2023,positive,excellent movie  didnt notice the running time at all it was so engaging  will see again
Jul 25 2023,positive,very accurate depiction of jro definitely oscar contender i thought robert downey jr portrayal will win him an oscar
Jul 25 2023,positive,loved it i expect oscar nominations for the entire cast i will be seeing this again
Jul 25 2023,positive,excellent presentation of a man torn between theoretical and military applications of atomic energy
Jul 25 2023,positive,fabulous gripping and well acted movie cast was excellent effects were amazing i thoroughly enjoyed the film shows what a terrible thing we have wrought
Jul 25 2023,positive,its amazing film the quality of the movie is amazing the writing it amazing everything about it is amazing it also talks about points that people nowadays dont really think about
Jul 25 2023,positive,level of acting is oscarworthy casting director nailed characters compelling story
Jul 25 2023,positive,great story acting editing sound the 3 hours flew by
Jul 25 2023,positive,very good sorry but i was hoping for a little more depth on the actual development of the atomic bomb that was really glossed over
Jul 25 2023,positive,it is slow in parts and does become boring overall still a good movie
Jul 25 2023,positive,excellent cast and acting great storytelling
Jul 25 2023,positive,this movie is excellent doesnt get much better than this
Jul 25 2023,positive,the actors played their roles beautifully especially the lead who played oppenheimer loved the character development seeing it on the premium large screen is a must
Jul 25 2023,positive,great acting by all i knew some of oppenheimers history but not all of it great movie 
Jul 25 2023,positive,my wife did not care for the portrayal of the lead actor who played oppenheimer  she also commented that the actress who played his wife was excellent in her view  we both agreed to rate it as an overall 3 star  my main criticism is the way the writersdirector took artistic license in some of those nude scenes  also the portrayal of all of those fireworks looking scenes which i suppose were intended to show what was going on inside oppenheimers head as he grew as a physicist  the guy who played einstein was way too fat  einstein was not that fat according to historical photos weve seen  i suppose having seen many actual documentaries in the past about the manhattan project and robert oppenheimer affected my view of this film
Jul 25 2023,positive,an excellent job of telling the whole story of how the atomic bomb came to be  great acting
Jul 25 2023,positive,both entertaining  educational
Jul 25 2023,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed this film  the acting was fabulous  it kept my interest for the whole 3 hours  i highly recommend this movie to all adults  the older ones will enjoy it more  in my opinion
Jul 25 2023,positive,great cast and interesting topic but too long
Jul 25 2023,negative,too long too much detail too much skin i went to sleep
Jul 25 2023,positive,great and action packed kept me on my toes and the score was amazing
Jul 25 2023,positive,great acting interesting but 3 hours is too long could have cut out about 121 hr and would have been better id reduce the amount of dialogue about technical discussions between characters and inner thought process of main character
Jul 25 2023,positive,this movie was interesting for the historical aspect of it but i couldnt hear or understand much of it because of all loud sometimes deadening background music why does all the back noise have to be soooooooooooo loud i love to go to the movies but so many have such loud music its impossible to hear the words i would not recommend nor will i go to an action movie again  also why are the previews soo loud  there is no point to it in my opinion when i have to plug my ears
Jul 25 2023,positive,engaging movie very enjoyable my only complaint is the background music that is played during the entire movie is too loud  made it difficult to hear the dialogue
Jul 25 2023,positive,great story and amazing performances
Jul 25 2023,positive,incredible movie casting story scenes all amazing
Jul 25 2023,negative,can you say the word boring fell asleep about 60 time i dont know why people are saying the movie dialogue mckesson confusion stories all over the place i dont know what i just watched a good movie 1three hours of my lifeyuk 
Jul 25 2023,positive,powerful outstanding acting a must see movie
Jul 25 2023,positive,outstanding in every way
Jul 25 2023,positive,very interesting historical perspective  great acting
Jul 25 2023,positive,great movie and very close to actual facts a three hour movie and not one person got up to leave the entire movie
Jul 25 2023,positive,i love historical dramas and this was an exceptional one  the acting was superb the story filled in some gaps in my knowledge of the history and the film inspired me to pick up the book american prometheus to learn more  great visuals and sound  my perfect theater experience  that could not be replicated by watching at home on tv  the nudity and sex were a bit gratuitous for me and didnt improve the storyline but thats par for a modern movie
Jul 25 2023,positive,words cant describe it
Jul 25 2023,positive,the movie was definitely of the caliber of sounds of freedom which we recently viewed at the regal theatre in gilbert az  the look venue is terrible  the food service which is what they are supposed to be known for was absolutely terrible  we tried ordering before the movie started from our seats using the app on our mobile phone  the look guest wifi was no better than verizon  i had to go back to the lobby to place our order  the drinks finally came about 30 minutes into the movie  the food not for another 30 minutes  this was a once only attendance at the look theatre
Jul 25 2023,positive,good historical film demonstrating the cultural conflicts surrounding such an important invention thoughtprovoking
Jul 25 2023,positive,i am a fan of christopher nolan  he wrote and directed an excellent movie with a great cast
Jul 25 2023,positive,great movie  so much going on but incredibly well told and thoughtprovoking
Jul 25 2023,positive,excellent acting and cinematography some undertones of revisionist history claiming the bomb was dropped unnecessarily but otherwise stayed close to the true storyline this threehour movie did not drag on but kept the audience engaged
Jul 25 2023,positive,outstanding motion picture i enjoyed it throughly
Jul 25 2023,positive,well written and the acting especially by cillian murphy is superb  did it need to be 3 hours  thats why it didnt get 5 stars too long to sit in a theatre seat
Jul 25 2023,positive,this is one of the best movies i have ever seen
Jul 25 2023,negative,too long too verbose not engaging no connection with any of the characters
Jul 25 2023,positive,really well done film telling a pivotal part of history
Jul 25 2023,positive,engrossing stunning didnt feel like 3 hours     hollywood more like this bring back films
Jul 25 2023,negative,pointless  poor character development and movie jumped around a lot  too long and did a poor job of story telling
Jul 25 2023,positive,excellent movie not fun i wont pull up again for giggles but im glad i watched it very well acted i cant think of a single character that i would try to change i learned something about the period these are the types of biopics i wish were more common    nolan is a singular talent
Jul 25 2023,positive,as a scientist myself i found it rivetingbut others who are not scientists also were tuned in to the movie   very nice balance of the necessities of war and the human moral feelings the bomb produced
Jul 25 2023,positive,fabulous movie and a part of our history
Jul 25 2023,positive,excellent movie just in time a step to a possible nuclear war   fantastic truth about the political war in scientists world     why was barbies release synchronized with oppenheimer there is an acceptable level of gab between their audiences but is overlap political
Jul 25 2023,positive,the character study through oppenheimer point of view is incredible the movie can seem like you want more action from the bomb itself but i think the movie always staying in the first person of oppenheimer of his understanding of the bomb makes the plot true to itself from beginning to the end remember the movie is called oppenheimer not the abomb
Jul 25 2023,negative,the only good scenes were trinity and the ending actors were good production was not
Jul 25 2023,positive,fantastic film  brilliant writing directing and the cast was spot on  a film for the ages
Jul 25 2023,negative,very drawn out and confusing  difficult to follow because it has many back flashes it would have been a much better movie if it started at the beginning and followed a normal sequence  i would have to watch the movie 5 times to understand all of the characters  oppenheimer had a cigarette in his mouth the entire movie   totally unnecessary  c minus at best
Jul 25 2023,positive,great visuals and story script so so too long at times
Jul 25 2023,positive,the real story revealed including the unfair way he was treated by aec and congress
Jul 25 2023,positive,it was an incredible story with amazing visual and auditory effects christopher nolan knocked it our if the park
Jul 25 2023,positive,it was the bomb could even say it was quite explosive
Jul 25 2023,negative,long boring movie it was a chore to stay through the entire movie like others have said would rather watch paint dry
Jul 25 2023,positive,this movie tells an interesting piece of history of the atomic bomb and the impact of science and politics
Jul 25 2023,positive,great movie a break in the middle would have been nice
Jul 25 2023,positive,incredible casting and acting fascinating and frightening time in our countrys history this movie piqued my interest in wanting to learn more about how oppenheimer and the political climate of the time i enjoyed seeing a film that made me think without telling me how to think
Jul 25 2023,positive,acting was great and the story was told right
Jul 25 2023,positive,seemed to have thoroughly researched the life and mind of oppenheimer this mans genius occasioned the atomic age from which there is no turning back the world can never be the same after his research and development of the first nuclear weapons the characters were all strong and in spite of the 3 hour length i was never bored wish we could have more movies made of this caliber
Jul 25 2023,negative,way too slow  1st two hours attempted to build characters but didnt get deep  unnecessary sex scenes that insulted my intelligence  i was there to have an intellectual experience learning about one of the most important events in human history  squandered opportunity
Jul 25 2023,positive,outstanding movie interesting well acted overall just a great movie  a tad long but otherwise great
Jul 25 2023,negative,this wasnt the actionpacked perioddrama i was hoping for no plot just building a bomb yawn
Jul 25 2023,positive,this movie was very well done and in my opinion tells the historical story in a way that the younger generation can comprehend the horrific reality of weapons of destruction
Jul 25 2023,positive,riveting  nolan really shows the nuance of a celebrated achievement with grave repercussions  the styles of the arcs dovetail wonderfully at the end  deserves a best picture award  compared to the past winners of the last few years decade
Jul 25 2023,positive,its a little long in length
Jul 25 2023,positive,i like that i learned something about a man who had a conscience in the end what i dislike is that his sexual life which had nothing to do with the predicament he brought upon the world was for some reason highlighted
Jul 25 2023,positive,the first two hours of this film were superb  the third hour focused on kangaroo courts politics and more was far too long short sighted in what could have been brought forward regarding new mexico and more    superb acting but again too long and not tight enough in the third hour  i walked out of the movie with lost interest
Jul 25 2023,positive,excellent cinematography  am engagingly presented story made the movie a pleasure to watch i would and have recommended it to people
Jul 25 2023,positive,thought it would get more into the upside and downs of making the bomb wanted to see a spectacle in terms of its use on japan
Jul 25 2023,positive,a moviemaybe the moviefor our times
Jul 25 2023,negative,the entire movie was just not well put together the climax hit around the 1 hour mark with 2 hours left to go  we left the theater with 45 minutes left there was no way they could make up 4 stars in 45 minutes  there were more boobs than bombs in this movie and when they bombed japan it was a phone call  i understand this was about oppenheimer but the pulp fiction type of scene cuts just didnt work for this film
Jul 25 2023,positive,amazing movie oscars winner for sure murphys best performance ever
Jul 25 2023,negative,very boring went straight to sleep movie was too long no action whatsoever
Jul 25 2023,positive,i enjoyed the movie very much it was very informative
Jul 25 2023,positive,arguably one of the best depiction of historical events i have watched in forever cillian murphy was masterful at conveying the seemingly overwhelming dichotomy that was jrobert oppenheimer the cast in its entirety was superb rdj florence pugh emily blunt matt damon and josh hartnett were magnificent not be overshadow by their brilliance supporting roles performed by  rami malek tom continue david dastmalchian casey affleck gustafson skarsgard kenneth brangh to name a few were just as memorable worthy of praises by all
Jul 25 2023,positive,very well made quality movie on a heavy duty topic superb acting especially cillian murphy and robert downing jr
Jul 25 2023,positive,the acting cinematography and total production was superb
Jul 25 2023,positive,amazing movie with some surprises flags with 50 stars were out of age with the period movie but easy to overlook by anyone cillian murphy was amazing and florence pugh was a surprise all in all a gorgeous movie great characters and acting
Jul 25 2023,positive,best film in years will win oscars
Jul 25 2023,positive,beautiful cinematography along with a gripping storyline equals intensely compelling must watch movie
Jul 25 2023,positive,missed much of the conversations couldnt make out all of what they were saying  maybe im too used to closed captioning  would give it 5 stars if i understood more of the dialogue acting was excellent and i applaud movies based on factual data
Jul 25 2023,positive,incredible storytelling powerful symbolism and stellar performances   our only negative was that the dialogue was often obscured by the background music
Jul 25 2023,positive,awesome historical piece  really great movie
Jul 25 2023,positive,great film making my own complaint is that for purposes of the narrative the character of miss tatlock and jro relationship to her was kind of two dimensional but given the script florence pugh does an amazing job with the character   also i thought the speech by remi maliks character was nnecessary  all the leads and supporting actors are d serving of awards as is the cinematographer and the director
Jul 25 2023,positive,very well done oscar worthy
Jul 25 2023,positive,even with the 50 star flags  what a movie  what a story
Jul 25 2023,positive,amazing effects the acting was superb 
Jul 25 2023,positive,excellent movie truly deserves an oscar for the film cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey and matt damon
Jul 25 2023,negative,this movie is probably for those that have casual passing knowledge of oppenheimer visual the different styles are well integrated and bored at times on spectacular however if youre heavily into military historyoppenheimer the script lacks depth to a certain degree
Jul 25 2023,negative,horrible long boring tried to tell too many stories at once  was hoping for more interesting story telling around how the bomb was made but wasnt at all that
Jul 25 2023,positive,i was born after this event and did not know anything about the development of the bomb only what the aftermath was in hiroshima and nagasaki  very eyeopening
Jul 25 2023,positive,too long too much unnecessary detail robert downey jr did a fantastic job as did cillian murphy i found myself becoming bored and checking my watch quite often fat man and little boy had a lot more detail in the design manufacturing and testing of the bomb than this movie
Jul 25 2023,positive,it was too long and too much time getting to its core

Jul 25 2023,positive,oppenheimer is an extremely well done film the performances are spectacular and of course it is an important story    what makes it difficult is that it is so complex and the intersection of the personal political and scientific stories and timelines are difficult to follow and keep straight i suspect the book is clearer

Jul 25 2023,positive,this movie could have been rated pg13 and all the sex scenes left out as they didnt seem relevant to the main premise of the movie  it was quite hard to follow going between past middle and present timelines  overall it was a good movie and helped to fill in history gaps that i never knew about dropping the atomic bomb
