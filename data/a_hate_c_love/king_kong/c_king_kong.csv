Sep 27 2023,positive, peter jackson draws on the original 1933 classic in his 2005 remake of king kong and the film is every bit the epic that one would expect the 1933 classic is iconic for its pioneering use of stopmotion technology it would also go onto inspire peter jackson to go into special effects lo and behold the oscarwinning filmmaker would tackle a remake after finishing up the lord of the rings trilogy after all the filmmaker knew he was going to make a remake when he was 12 years old the road got bumpy throughout the years but in 1995 universal pictures gave jackson an opportunity to remake the film as with any filmmaker he said no at first before coming around to it king kong was in the public domain at this point anyway the plan to film in 1997 is what would become a roadblock due to other remakes coming out production was delayed and jackson focused on the middleearth trilogy things would resume in 2003 jacksons films contain the same or similar set pieces but with modern technology allowing the filmmaker to do so much more instead of stopmotion technology andy serkis utilizes motion performance capture to depict the giant gorilla ill touch on the visual effects in a moment but i cannot say enough good things about them despite the modern technology this is a period film through and through jackson goes as far as paying homage to the vaudeville performances of the era ann darrow naomi watts a struggling vaudeville performer is hired by carl denham jack black for his new movie shes all set to decline before learning that jack driscoll adrien brody is the screenwriter denham is filming on ss venture which is captained captain englehorn thomas kretschmann what denham doesnt mention is that theyre really going to skull island not singapore its a recipe for disaster but not even a warrant for carls arrest is going to stop them before you know it the crew finds itself on skull island this goes as anyone would expectthe natives take ann as an offering to kong and they both flee into the jungle this was my first rewatch since seeing the epic film in theaters when it was released upon its release i felt that they could have cut out a half hour but that it would probably win an oscar for best visual effects lo and behold they won oscars for sound editing sound mixing and yes visual effects its only other nomination was for art direction which we now refer to as production design the thing with peter jackson movies is that there is a lot of care and attention that goes into the technical categories king kong missed out on a best picture nomination in an era before the category expansion i do not know if the film would get a best picture nomination under with the expanded field it just might but back to the films visual effects you cannot say enough good things about them when a filmmaker of peter jacksons caliber is directing a film you know that the visual effects are going to be topnotch there are a few scenes that draw back to the very iconic scenes that inspired them hell the work that went into building cgi new york is just astounding the first sequence in question is the fight between kong and the three t rexes the second sequence is the climactic ending with the empire state building of course both scenes go above and beyond what we see in the 1933 classic it helps that animators had the ability to work off of the previz animatics in designing the sequence for the big screen recreating the eighth wonder the making of king kong is a documentary that offers a substantial amount of insight into the film for instance peter jackson took naomi watts up to the 86th and 102nd observatories and even went up into the cone of the empire state building there were a number of years where the 102nd observatory had been closed but it more or less looks like it did in 1933 regardless their 2004 tour would inspire the interior design in the film watts and jackson also met fay wray in early march danielle solzman is native of louisville ky and holds a ba in public relations from northern kentucky university and a ma in media communications from webster university she roots for her beloved kentucky wildcats st louis cardinals indianapolis colts and boston celtics living less than a mile away from wrigley field in chicago she is an active reader sportsentertainmenthistorybiographiesselect fiction and involved with the chicago improv scene she also sees many movies and reviews them she has previously written for redbird rants wildcat blue nation and hidden remoteflicksided from april 2016 through may 2017 her film reviews can be found on creators
May 7 2023,positive,the visual effects are glorious  a circus of cliffhanging suspense sequences that go on and on and on but rather than just padding the story with gummy exposition and silly action jackson delves deeply into the psychology of the characters
Jan 7 2023,positive, king kong 2005 is an oldfashioned monster moviejungle thriller pushed to the limits with new technology by a filmmaker with both the skill and the heart to recapture the thrills of his adolescent moviehouse dreams its a remake of a 1930s classic via the wondrous creatures and primeval world of jurassic park and the devilmaycare cliffhanger spirit of raiders of the lost ark jackson sets it in the same era as the original 1933 filmthe depths of the depression in the early 1930swith naomi watts as aspiring actress ann darrow a young woman so desperate that she takes a job on a mysterious movie safari for director and adventurer carl denham jack black where denham was a reckless visionary in the original film jackson recasts him as a morally ambivalent entrepreneur who lies manipulates kidnaps and risks the lives of everyone around him first to get his picture and then to capture the mighty ape and get his prize discovery back to america in fact its a little too much of a good thing running almost twice as long as the original and filled with unnecessary side characters and spectacular scenes of man versus monster and ape versus everyone that go on long past the moment youd think he could sustain them jackson makes it all work with his showman instinct and his unconditional love of movies he fills all of those extraneous scenes and charactersespecially those involving the cabin boy jamie bell and the african american first mate evan parke his big brotherfather figurewith a love and respect that gives the film an emotional grounding and when jackson is at his best as an action craftsman you overlook the cgi overkill to marvel at the scenes especially the signature scene where kong takes on not one but three trex beasties while juggling lady love from hand to foot its astounding and fierce and as impressive as any spectacle of its era and of course there is the performance of pioneering motion capture actor andy serkis whose superb body language performance brings the completely animated kong to life he gives the creature an astounding personality a playful spirit and a sense of humor the interlude on the frozen lake in central park is joyous as he explores the ice and slides across it like a little kid and the chemistry between serkis beast and watts beauty much of it communicated through their eyes gives the adventure its love story adrien brody is our human hero jack driscoll andy serkis gets a flesh and blood role as the crotchety cook lumpy and in the process lands both of the films best death scenes and thomas kretschmann colin hanks and kyle chandler costar dont miss a single recommendation subscribe to the stream on demand weekly newsletter your email address will not be shared and follow us on facebook and twitter sean axmaker is a seattle film critic and writer he writes the weekly newspaper column stream on demand and the companion website and his work appears at rogerebertcom turner classic movies online the film noir foundation and parallax view
Mar 26 2021,positive, back in 2017 the heavily hyped kong skull island wasnt the first time that year that movie audiences saw king kong thundering across the screen after all a more diminutive  and blockier  version of the character made a cameo appearance in the lego batman movie and now the great ape is returning yet again roaring into theaters and onto hbo max march 31 in godzilla vs kong clearly a constant presence on the popculture scene is expected with a figure as iconic as this one since king kong first appeared in 1933 theres been no small measure of greatape movies seeking to either honor or pillage his legacy from a pair of longlost japanese films from the 1930s to a bangladeshi musical in 2010 numerous filmmakers have sought to usurp the kings throne through usually unauthorized versions there have been animated television series straighttovideo features and even movies starring a professional wrestler named king kong then there are the following 16 theatrical releases all of which were either officially licensed kong productions or imitators hoping to snag a share of the box office pie here then is every giant ape movie ranked from worst to first it might seem unfair placing 1986s king kong lives at the bottom of this list considering that  unlike several other greatape movies  it at least boasts of a decentsized budget slick production values and linda hamilton but the hint of talent is actually what drives home its utter worthlessness  theres simply no reason for this movie to be this abysmal producer dino de laurentiis 1976 king kong may have received a mixed reception from critics but it proved to be a hit with audiences clearly not understanding the adage of striking while the iron is hot de laurentiis waited an entire decade before getting around to making the sequel that delay plays into the plot as the film reveals that kong survived his plunge off the empire state building and has since been in a coma to revive kong on the 10th anniversary of his fall the attendant doctor hamilton states that he needs both a heart transplant and a blood transfusion the former comes courtesy of a gigantic artificial heart installed during a sequence that stands among the most risible in all kong flicks the latter comes courtesy of an oversized female gorilla that conveniently has just been discovered by an adventurer brian kerwin more ratso rizzo than indiana jones in borneo kong is revived the great apes fall in love and once baby makes three ms kong finally gets to put to use the most unconvincing animal boobs since the ones showcased earlier that same year in howard the duck the crosseyed gorilla isnt the worst element of 1969s unspeakably awful the mighty gorga admittedly its a distraction wondering why no one took a couple of minutes to fix the wayward peepers on the unfortunate ape costume borrowed for this picture but even this seemingly simpleminded simian looks genuine when compared to the dinosaur that eventually pops up apparently made out of discarded popsicle sticks and chunks of cheap plastic this just might be the most laughable prehistoric puppet to ever appear in a movie then again thats right in line with the rest of this amateurish slop which finds a circus owner anthony eisley journeying to africa to locate the giant gorilla that can save his business its hard to ascertain whats more ludicrous the spectacle of actors constantly flubbing or heck even remembering their lines or the parade of california beach bums hired to play african natives best worst of all is the witch doctor gleefully sacrificing virgins to kong  as played by bruce kimball he possesses the countenance of a disreputable lodges grand poobah while delivering his lines like a bad borscht belt comedian incidentally another creature appears later in the movie and its far superior to the dinosaur spotted earlier lest anyone think the filmmakers were suddenly infused with a modicum of minute talent be aware that this monster was actually borrowed via stock footage wholesale from another film  1960s goliath and the dragon for those keeping score an inept italian production that appears to have been made for a buck fifty the film was known as eve the wild woman in its homeland thats certainly a more fitting moniker since the plot does involve a woman named eve and she is indeed wild played by esmeralda barros she comes along late in the game to help hunky mercenary burt dawson brad harris exact his revenge against albert muller marc lawrence a fellow merc who once betrayed him muller is now spending his days toiling as a mad scientist  hidden away in his jungle lair hes busy planting tiny radio receivers inside the heads of gorillas thus enabling him to control all their actions its up to eve a female version of tarzan to help dawson locate mullers hideaway and save his damsel in distress ursula davis obviously theres no king and no kong in king of kong island  heck theres not even an island the story unfolds in kenya but american audiences werent the only ones to get konged  excuse me conned  by false advertising in west germany the film played under the title king kong and the tan goddess while in greece the picture was known as the runaways of king kong the opening credits for 1976s ape signal the level of quality that defines this korean production as the word transportation as in transportation provided by  is misspelled as transporation following this alphabetchallenged intro the action begins with a dangerous 36foot ape being sent to disneyland for a promotional tour the creature breaks free from the ships cargo hold and proceeds to destroy the vessel which actually looks like a toy boat bobbing around in presumably the producers swimming pool the primate then battles a rubber shark or as the spielbergattentive ads plugged see ape defy the jaws of giant shark before heading to terra firma to watch kids frolic on a playground demolish several buildings and  because every kongsize contract requires it  halfheartedly make off with a blonde the heroine in this case is an actress joanna devarona later joanna kerns of growing pains fame who terrifyingly shrieks like one of the victims in the last house on the left before inexplicably turning into mae west and purring at the great ape be gentle big fella rarely in the annals of cinema have so much plywood and lighter fluid been expended in the service of visual effects magic  be sure to also check out the falling rocks that flake off styrofoam pieces as they hit the ground ape incidentally stands for attacking primate monster although the movie also made the rounds under the great counterattack of kong kong hideous mutant and attack of the giant horny gorilla like ape 1976s queen kong was a king kong ripoff produced to profit off the hype surrounding the dino de laurentiis version making its way into theaters unlike the korean flick this british spoof barely saw the inside of theaters as a lawsuit hurled by de laurentiis successfully blocked its release in most of the world and certainly in the us and england as the title suggests the film is basically a genderswitch king kong with a giant female gorilla mixing it up with a slacker named ray fay robin askwith drowning in kitschy excess queen kong strains hard for laughs that simply dont materialize  the opening song sets the tacky tone with such lyrics as  shes a genie who aint teeny shes the queenie queenie for my weenie when im feeling mighty spunky i wanna do it with my hunky monkey yet whats interesting about the movie is how it predates pictures like airplane and the kentucky fried movie as a spoof of all trades with timely zingers aimed at such hits as jaws the exorcist and airport 1975 even more intriguingly queen kong positions itself as a feminist flick with ray fay delivering a climactic speech about how the oppressed ape represents all women attempting to assert their independence in a patriarchal society everybody loves the monkey producer dino de laurentiis would frequently chirp explaining why he decided to remake a classic that had long been hailed as one of cinemas finest achievements but 1976s king kong turned out to be a hamfisted version of the venerable yarn replacing the excitement and gravitas of the 1933 original with a jokey attitude that bordered on camp the only area in which it improved upon its predecessor was in delineating the relationship between the ape and the woman he loves and even this was subsequently handled better in peter jacksons 2005 update jeff bridges appearing almost as hirsute as kong gamely tries to lift the proceedings as a paleontologist with charles grodin doing his part as a greedy oil company executive but in the central role of dwan newcomer jessica lange fights a losing battle against a script that transforms her into a new age ninny when first encountering kong she inquires about his zodiac sign  her performance led to withering reviews that kept her off the screen for three years incredulously king kong earned an oscar for its visual effects sharing that years honor with the far more accomplished logans run considering the shoddiness of the visuals  especially in the closeup shots when kong unconvincingly leers at dwan as if he were auditioning for a benny hill skit  there might be some truth to the longstanding rumor that some academy members resigned in disgust after their colleagues voted for this unearned distinction today rankinbass is best known for such animated tv specials as 1964s rudolph the rednosed reindeer and 1970s santa claus is comin to town but among the companys prolific output during its heyday was 1966s the king kong show which aired as part of abcs saturday morning lineup for a couple of seasons the 1967 feature film king kong escapes a liveaction collaboration between rankinbass and japans toho studios was directly inspired by the series which explains why it seems mainly geared toward children its certainly perky enough to maintain adolescent interest as kong squares off against mechanikong a robotic replicant created by the nefarious dr who  no not that dr who though he does bear a passing resemblance to dr no in fact much of king kong escapes plays like a romper room version of a james bond adventure even borrowing mie hama kissy suzuki in the 007 outing you only live twice to portray the slinky villainess madame x as for kong his dance card is filled with battles against mechanikong the dinosaur gorosaurus a sizable sea serpent and a rather raggedy monkey costume it almost feels as if 1962s king kong vs godzilla deserves two spots on this list considering the vast differences between the original japanese cut and the radically reworked american version the genesis of the film began with appropriately enough willis obrien the visual effects genius behind the original 1933 king kong obrien had long envisioned making king kong vs frankenstein but when no american studio jumped at the opportunity to finance such an awesomesounding movie other hands got involved and king kong eventually ended up much to obriens displeasure at toho the outfit behind the godzilla flicks king kong vs godzilla was a smash in its homeland but for us consumption many of the more satiric moments were axed and replaced with tedious scenes of a united nations broadcaster michael keith and a stuffy scientist harry holcombe alternately providing deadening exposition still the most colossal conflict the screen has ever known per the posters was the sole reason global audiences packed theaters and viewers of either version got their moneys worth while the kong costume itself was particularly woeful the thrill of seeing these mighty monsters rumble kept customers content  and convinced toho to fully throw its muscle behind godzilla via countless movies merchandise and more herman cohen met with success by producing and under pseudonyms writing the 1957 features i was a teenage werewolf and i was a teenage frankenstein so why not go for the hattrick by unleashing i was a teenage gorilla onto an unsuspecting world alas a rash of similarly titled cheapies from other filmmakers teenage caveman teenage zombies teenagers from outer space etc led to understandable audience burnout  by the time cohen was ready to release his monkey movie in 1961 he opted instead to go with konga set in england the titular gorilla only grows to kongsize proportions at films end  before that he begins life as a harmless chimpanzee brought back from africa by dr charles decker michael gough a scientist whos obsessed with perfecting his growth serum testing the formula on the chimp he quickly learns that it turns the little fellow into a hulking gorilla ready to carry out his murderous bidding a standard entry in the mad scientist genre konga is elevated by the suitably intense turn by longtime horror veteran gough perhaps best known for playing alfred to michael keatons bruce waynebatman but once the monkey gets supersized the terrible visual effects take over with the climactic sequences centered around a guy in an ape suit standing listlessly next to a big ben model while the brits blast away disneys 1998 mighty joe young a remake of the popular 1949 version is at its best when it  pardon the pun  apes its predecessor and falters when it attempts to strike out on its own as before the movie details the loving relationship between a young woman charlize theron growing up in africa and the oversized gorilla she hopes to protect from civilization theron brings enormous warmth to her role and effects guru rick baker uses animatronics and a dash of cgi to fashion a central creature that looks absolutely believable from first frame to last unfortunately the majority of the film proves to be even more hokey than its forebear thanks chiefly to the addition of onedimensional villains poachers and black marketeers seeking to make life miserable for our hirsute hero still its hard to resist a film in which bill paxton as an affable conservationist addresses mighty joe as ya big palooka the 1933 king kong was such a smashing success that the studio excitedly demanded that a followup hit theaters in the same calendar year nine months later son of kong was released but despite reassembling most of the key personnel from the previous picture it was merely a pale  if likable  shadow of its predecessor filmed on a much smaller budget it brings back king kong costar robert armstrong as carl denham here returning to skull island to search for treasure and running across kongs cuddly albino kid little kong is almost incidental to the story and doesnt even show up until well past the halfway point  primarily this is about denhams crisis of conscience regarding his treatment of kong in the first film in that respect its an interesting piece but its far too short at 70 minutes and it ends with an alltooconvenient earthquake making short work of the various storylines originally released in the us as goliathon 1977s the mighty peking man is arguably the best of the countless kong ripoffs that have glutted the marketplace its easy to see why both roger ebert and quentin tarantino were enthusiastic fans the plot borrows from both king kong and mighty joe young as an explorer named johnny danny lee later of john woos the killer stumbles across not only an oversized apeman known as utam but also the lovely blonde whos been his companion over the years shes samantha evelyne kraft who survived the plane crash that killed her parents and has since been running around the jungle clad only in skimpy tarzanapproved duds she and johnny fall in love and together with utam they head to hong kong where all hell breaks loose the mighty peking man doesnt flow as much as lurch forward and cheesy interludes such as samantha frolicking with leopards in slow motion are the norm during the films first half but because the project was generously financed by the shaw brothers those purveyors of classic kung fu flicks over the decades the model work is far more polished if still not always convincing than that seen in other similar efforts yet whats most notable about the mighty peking man is the utter nihilism that rears its head during the final act the king kong template is one that naturally lends itself to tragedy but the consequences here are downright startling the second film in the upandrunning monsterverse 2017s kong skull island is a definite improvement over 2014s godzilla  its also frequently clever occasionally inane and always exciting certainly the human players matter less than ever with all but one character painted in the broadest strokes possible the glorious exception is hank marlow played with the right mix of cheer and fear by john c reilly a fighter pilot whos been stranded on skull island since world war ii the film itself is set in 1973 marlow proves to be the most sympathetic character in the film the goto figure for audience involvement the others are the usual stock assemblage of hunky adventurer tom hiddleston feisty pacifist brie larson gungho military man samuel l jackson government wonk john goodman whiny company suit john ortiz and various expendables in the form of scientists and soldiers all are part of an expedition that arrives on skull island and proceeds to get ambushed not only by kong but by other oversized inhabitants the script cobbled together by several sets of hands isnt nearly as impressive as the direction by jordan vogtroberts  love the visual shoutouts to apocalypse now  although its as a creature feature that kong skull island works best the visual effects are truly dazzling particularly when employed to bring the movies towering star to roaring rattling life presented by no less than the legendary john ford 1949s delightful mighty joe young reunited the key players from 1933s king kong  director ernest b schoedsack writerproducer merian c cooper coscripter ruth rose and special effects wizard willis obrien  for another story about an ape run amok comparatively more benign than kong but still a dangerous oversized animal joe lives in africa with his human companion jill young terry moore who has raised the gorilla since infancy jill gets talked into bringing joe to america by garrulous showman max ohara who wants to use him as the main attraction in his junglethemed nightclub to play max the filmmakers once again turned to robert armstrong whos basically asked to essay the same type of role he tackled in king kong and son of kong mighty joe young climaxes with a devastating fire at an orphanage interestingly this lengthy segment was filmed in sepia tone rather than blackandwhite in creating the pictures stopmotion effects obrien was assisted by a young ray harryhausen  the film earned the best special effects oscar but its lackluster box office performance led to the cancellation of a proposed sequel joe meets tarzan whereas the 1976 version of king kong was made by profiteers the 2005 remake was handled by a filmmaker with a genuine affinity for the 1933 original fresh from his success with the tolkien trilogy peter jackson turned his attention toward honoring one of his favorite films with an expensive homage jacksons king kong was a box office hit earned a trio of oscars for its sound and visual effects and showcased a superb turn by naomi watts as ann darrow its chief drawback is its length since jackson took the template of the 103minute original and stretched it to 190 minutes this hefty running time aids the first act with filmmaker carl denham jack black preparing to head out into uncharted waters to make his epic and the third act which places the action back in new york in time for kongs fateful encounter with the empire state building but the middle section set on skull island is where the film lags due to jacksons insistence on steering the story away from kong and focusing on the territorys dinosaurs and other beastly inhabitants its as if jackson wanted to make his own jurassic park  a waste of time since steven spielberg had already done it perfectly still kong himself is a visual marvel with an expressive range of emotions sweeping across his face as usual andy serkis handles motioncapture duties and fans of jacksons dead alive will chuckle at the sign in the ships cargo hold that reads sumatra rat monkey a gargantuan hit upon its original release and subsequent reissues 1933s king kong goes beyond being a mere staple of film history in much the same manner as the wizard of oz and its a wonderful life this masterpiece about the eighth wonder of the world long ago entered into the national consciousness as an enduring part of our heritage as ann darrow the beauty who captures the beasts oversized heart fay wray became an overnight star although equally memorable is robert armstrong as carl denham the boisterous filmmaker who sets the story in motion with his plan to shoot his next exotic picture on the uncharted skull island under the auspices of producerdirectors merian c cooper and ernest b schoedsack willis obrien with a major assist from marcel delgado contributed extraordinary stopmotion effects that brought to life many classic sequences including kongs destruction of a native village his battles with prehistoric beasts and his tragic last stand atop the empire state building obriens effects were both innovative and influential  the same goes for max steiners excellent music credited not only as the first featurelength movie score but also one of the earliest to employ a full symphony
Oct 9 2020,positive, audeville performer ann darrow naomi watts suffers alongside everyone else during the great depression struggling to earn enough to eat  particularly after her revue is shuttered shes nevertheless hopeful that if she can just get an audition with legendary playwright jack driscoll adrien brody shell find her way to stardom but the competition is dishearteningly tough and the easiest fix is to resort to a disreputable burlesque show meanwhile hotheaded producerdirector carl denham jack black is in the middle of getting his latest picture shut down when he decides to flee to the waiting ship that hes paid to sail to a shoot at a mysterious destination hes obtained a map to a most exotic virtually undiscovered locale and hes intent on going  before the studio bigwigs can put a stop to the departure of the vessel the ss venture when his leading lady drops out carl is forced to snag the first size4 dame he can find  preferably one with a pretty face as luck would have it he crosses paths with ann in time to sucker her into joining the expedition carl is also silvertongued enough to trick driscoll who happens to be in a cabin aboard the venture to hand over the first 15 pages of a script  and to then get shanghaied for the journey from here the venture stumbles upon a craggy seemingly deserted landmass with a sizable wall that was surely designed to keep something very large out as the captain thomas krestschmann hustles to repair his ship carl and a few of his filmmaking crew wander onto the island where theyre attacked by natives in an eerie deviation from the former tone for the first time momentary horror movie notes creep into the picture which starts to resemble the chills of cannibal movies though the poor editing once again ensures that its a temporary ghoulishness in another pointless subplot first mate hayes evan parke and his young protege jimmy jamie bell trade observations about heart of darkness  made more insincere via histrionic voiceover moments these two are  by far  the worst pieces of the project with a ceaseless flair for the overdramatic director peter jackson does everything with largerthanlife characters exaggerated wideeyed enactments and intense stares swelling music rousing or ominous speeches in closeup and plenty of intricate details his details however are so overwrought and exhaustive that the end result is a whopping threehour production in jacksons world there are no bitparts the overabundance of players all receive so much screentime that the pacing suffers considerably the actors and actress are amusing but even when audiences get to know them all intimately it doesnt much alter the impact or emotions as they succumb to the horrors of skull island here the editing is correspondingly overthetop using visual gimmickry to generate false thrills  excessive manipulations that absolutely didnt need to be utilized jackson sticks with the great depressionera setting for this third major theatrical adaptation but he goes to much greater lengths to set the stage than in the 1933 version the introduction spends many minutes building up its characters and locations and financial hardships as if the roles needed some added sympathy to humanize them for their inevitable confrontation with the monstrously inhuman curiously the sexual undertones  or overtones  of the previous two iterations has all but vanished as a film enthusiast jackson does incorporate numerous nods to the blackandwhite classic borrowing exact lines or mimicking specific scenes but on a few occasions he duplicates a couple of the faults from the 1976 take which is one of the worst choices  or accidents  he could possibly make the love story between ann and jack is one such problem as its built upon an unconvincing montage that is as fleeting and insignificant as the running time is long monsters belong in bmovies to its credit jacksons update finally gives its title role the hitech cg makeover for which fans have been waiting some sequences are less convincing than others but the technology has improved to such a degree that its undeniably impressive to see kong during his most famous routines a bit of this is ruined as well however as the animators have attempted to duplicate primate movements so authentically that kong has lost some of his beastly identity mostly hes just a gargantuan gorilla  a rather predictable animal even if significantly overgrown in the end the adventure is ambitious to match the graphics but it isnt always effective in its extremeness especially during an unintentionally comical brontosaurus stampede in which the lumbering dinosaurs manage to sidestep all the tiny humans scampering beneath their enormous feet a later trex fight is far better as well as the aerial finale atop the empire state building though the choreography still favors explicit fantasy over muchneeded realism wherever it could get believable imagery it definitely should have gone for it yet this notion is sadly infrequent for all of its polish and spectacle and grandiosity the faults still drastically counteract the accomplishments designed by mike massie   20062024

Nov 19 2019,positive, with the success of 8220the lord of the rings trilogy clearly peter jackson had a tough act to follow yet jacksons followup another remake of the epic adventure 8220king kong proves to be the right project for a director who clearly understands the art of the action genre 8220kong does trudge along at times with a threehour running time but it still works thanks to the final twothirds in which each action sequence trumps the previous one 8220king kong follows a film crew to a remote island in the 1930s the films director carl denham jack black is desperate to finish his work and convinced that shooting on location in this remote land will be just what he needs to secure the pictures shaky financial backing among the people joining denham on this journey are ann darrow naomi watts a downonherluck actress and jack driscoll adrien brody a writer and friend of denhams once the group gets to the island they get more than they bargained for with a land full of prehistoric creatures and a 25foot ape which happens to develop an affection for darrow jackson takes a slow and methodical approach to the story with kong not appearing until over an hour into the film but like that first climb on a rollercoaster once the action picks up steam it is nonstop jackson fills the screen with one fabulous chase after another its like watching 8220jurassic park on amphetamines there are dinosaurs bats mansized insects  enough danger to fill three action movies but 8220king kong has more going for it than the action sequences at its core the film is a love story between woman and beast their love has a sense of credibility that gives 8220kong a touch of tenderness and jackson and especially watts deserve praise for making that relationship work this remake is sure to be compared to its two predecessors its been a while since ive seen the original and honestly my only memory of the 1976 version centers around me sneaking into a theater to watch the last half of the film a long story best saved for another day with that in mind i dont think im the one who can accurately compare the three films but i do know one thing  i enjoy a good action film just like the next person and this isnt just a good action film 8220kong is a very good one  sportswritermovie reviewer micheal compton now has reviews available on the web just go to  and click on the comptons critiques link for a quick hit of movies now playing in the area micheal can also be reached via email at mcomptonbgdailynewscom
Nov 6 2019,positive, once upon a time there was a 9 year old boy with an amazing imagination and on one fine day he saw a movie that would impact him forever  king kong directed by merion c cooper and ernest shoedsack shot in black and white and released by universal studios in 1933 king kong was such a success on its release that it saved the studio from going under years later when this little boy saw the mighty kong he was so taken with the movie and the concept of movie making that he fashioned himself his own cardboard king kong model used his mothers furcollar coat cutting the collar into fine threads and gluing strands of fur one by one on his model and then grabbed a movie camera to make his own version of king kong okay so that version wasnt a huge commercial success beyond his own living room but fast forward to the present what that 1933 king kong did do was create a love and desire in a young peter jackson that inspired him to become one of the consummate filmmakers of our time having helmed one of the true epics in movie history the lord of the rings trilogy jackson now had the means to do the film he had always held close to his heart  a big screen version of king kong and let me tell you right now  this is no remake or reinvention of a classic this film is a loving recreation of a timeless tale clearly a labor of love the memories held all these years by that 9 year old leap from the screen with every shot every effect every nuance every word every creature creation every beat of kongs heart true to the original film and story but with the added polish that is offered by todays technology peter jacksons king kong is a visual masterpiece the time is 1933 america faces the great depression ann darrow is a struggling vaudeville actress without income and without wanting to lower herself to performing burlesque ann has little in the way of prospects  that is until she steals an apple from a street vendor and finds herself rescued by carl denham a man with a slightly nutso streak in him denham can relate to anns little theft  especially since he just heisted his unfinished adventuretravelogue from the studio after execs threatened to pull the plug and funds some things never change rushing to get his cast and crew aboard a singapore bound steamer denham has another little problem his star has pulled out of the picture second problem  shes a size 4 and all costumes have been made luckily for him he met ann not only is she desperate for work shes a size 4 convincing her to sign on to the project is a bit tougher though like she has many options that is until she finds out that up and coming playwright jack driscoll has written the screenplay and is going along for the ride with all on board the ss venture sets sail from new york harbor but what no one realizes is that denahm doesnt plan on going to singapore always with an eye on his ego denhams true plan is to head for skull island and a mythical beast of mighty proportion with a slow build to the arrival on skull island jackson uses the time wisely to establish time place motive and characters but the fun really starts once man steps into this lost world paying great homage to the original film but with a cgi twist we are met with prehistoric dinosaurs carnivorous sea slugs a lost race of man that are more savage than anything ever depicted in a national geographic a brontosaurus stampede and tyrannosaurus triplets and of course king kong  all of which are used to establish the love story between kong and ann notable is jacksons use of the spiderpit sequence which was cut from the original but given new life here with some of the creepiest and crawliest arachnids ever seen despite the grandeur of the special effects it is the story of kong and ann that still touches the heart and is the essence of the movie be it ann using her song and dance talents to sooth the savage breast so as not to be eaten or crushed or waggling a finger at a tantrum throwing kong or kong tearing up trees tossing boulders and beating his chest in a huff over his frustration with ann be it man or ape the male species just dont get us females the story of true life is timeless and endearing and let me tell you kong is more a gentleman more gallant and more loveable than almost any man on the planet but leave it to the call of fame and fortune and ones man ego though to spoil everything and here that falls to carl denham seeing gold at the end of the rainbow denham has kong and his sweetie broadway bound with what we all know have terrifying results although the human performances are not as compelling as that of kong they are nevertheless not to be overlooked  and especially when it comes to jack black with his portrayal of carl denham black can finally be described as a movie star stepping out of type yet so in type blacks denham is an overthetop egomaniac that only adds to the underlying social commentary of the story dont be surprised to hear blacks name called out on january 31 2006 for a best supporting actor nomination oscar winner adrien brody takes on the role of jack driscoll with a performance that is weak wimpy and weepy one can easily see why ann would prefer to be with a great protectorate like kong and as for ann darrow this is one of the finest examples of perfect casting i have seen in many a day naomi watts is enchanting idyllic and golden clearly born to play in period pieces her range of emotion and adaptability in either a green jungle or concrete one is exciting to watch but it is her heart that radiates with her performance here simply magical  but the real star here is not the human actors nope that honor goes to the mighty kong himself great pains were taken to develop kong with such exacting detail so as to create a great ape that has weathered the ages but who really is an old softie inside complete with battle scars a droopy eye from a prior battle and even a broken jaw not to mention some pretty bad cavities kongs humanness is both touching and enlightening much of the success of kong goes to andy serkis himself filmed and then digitized with konglike fur who provides the fluidity and personality that create the most layered and emotionally fulfilling character of the film from the blink of an eye to a raucous laugh to a gentle touch of his finger to a darwinian ferocity it is serkis work that brings believability to the forefront for the first time in kong history we see kong moving on all fours  leaping jumping running it is kongs actions that set the pace for the film once on skull island and serkis is the one behind it  and of course what about those cgi guys calling on a good portion of his team from lotr they all outdo themselves here  and never more so than a pivotal battle sequence involving kong trying to save ann while suspended over a gorge battling the tyrannasaurus three and falling from tree to tree threatening to plummet all the way down before our very eyes mesmerizing dizzying heartstopping but just when you think youve seen it all they break out the climactic ending with airplanes kong kong and the empire state building whew  from set design to costuming of 1933 manhattan to the imaginative artisans responsible for skull island there is not a deficiency anywhere in this film even jackson and his cowriters fran walsh and phillipa boyens give the story a social conscience without becoming preachy or detracting from the original tale or the love at its very core  under the guiding and loving hand of peter jackson king kong proves to be mightier than any that have gone before and surely any that will come after from start to finish this is an extravaganza a classic and a love story that you will long hold in the palm of your hand as kong holds us in his
Jun 5 2019,positive,who would have thought a remake of one of the greatest films ever could rival if not surpass the original in jacksons capable hands thats just what king kong does
Feb 4 2019,positive,from dinosaur stampedes to toothandclaw fights with tyrannosaurs to the titular apes inevitable doomed climb up the empire state building kong version 30 is the very definition of spectacle cinema
Sep 18 2017,positive,its a pity that the film is such a miserable slog to start off because the second that it arrives on skull island it suddenly explodes into life
May 29 2011,positive, peter jacksons gripping 2005 remake rethinks the characters from the 1933 original turning its stark jungian fantasy into a soulless but skillful set of kinetic and emotional effects carl denham jack blackoriginally a selfportrait of codirector merian c cooperis now a comic villain personifying and thereby displacing the movies own cynical contrivances and hypocritical exploitation ann darrow naomi watts has lost most of her hysteria and gained an electra complex the putative hero adrien brody is now improbably a playwright a black sailor evan parke has been added to offset the jungle stereotypes and kong is anthropomorphized to the point of becoming first an audience standin for whom watts performs a few vaudeville turns then a christ figure
May 29 2011,positive,as it is a remake it doesnt have the shock lord of the rings possessed upon its release but this is a beautiful beast of a bmovie thrilling and touching

original  and mondello says its worth nearly every minute      melissa block host      lord of the rings director peter jackson has said that the 1933      blackandwhite king kong is the film that made him want to be a      moviemaker dino de laurentiis had already revisited the story in 1976      but jackson wanted to look at it again  and our critic bob mondello says      his 200 million

know  and there are brandnew characters      too  a preening matinee idol a pair of shipboard heart of darkness      fans who look like huck finn and his buddy jim and a lovesick      screenwriter

it without turning kong into the tale of a girl and      her 25foottall puppy  in fact at the screening i attended there were      lots of tearyeyed adults as the lights came up after the credits      this could have been the running time of course at three hours and      seven minutes the film is undeniably longer than it really needs to be      i estimate that if jackson had taken an ax to all

Oct 18 2008,positive,kong is not without its flaws but sometimes you just have to throw your hands up in the air wave them like you just dont care scream at the top of your lungs and just go with the rollercoaster ride thats what this film is
Feb 28 2008,negative,overlong by half hedonistically animated and decadently selfindulgent king kong is beastly to be sure but there is little beauty here
Jan 15 2008,positive, theres an old joke about a 500pound gorilla sitting anywhere he wants to that suitably applies to the leading monkey of king kong and i aint talking its titular star having successfully transferred legendary literature epic the lord of the rings into one of the biggest cinematic franchises in history director peter jackson has decided to follow that up with a threehour remake of the classic that made him fall in love with films with jackson now in the position of being one of the few directors thats a household name who can do what he wants the syndrome has begun where people seem unable to stand up to him and question his decisions around the middle of 2005 it was announced that universal had originally asked jackson to deliver a cut of the film at around the two and a bit hours but he wanted to go with his three hour version and they acquiessed theres always a tough line to draw between keeping a filmmakers vision intact and delivering a product that will do business  too much one way and a film becomes a lifeless soulless vehicle robbed of any emotional core too much the other and it can become a bloated selfindulgent mess that only a small handful of film enthusiasts will ever really warm to maybe they shouldve put their foot down in this case kong is an entertaining adventureaction film that certainly looks like the 200 million it cost has some pretty intense action and popcorn thrills for all audiences and thankfully understands that effects should be used to enhance the emotion and narrative of a story rather than be a crux for it to fall back on indeed at times whether it be the great opening shot in new york zoo to the drawn out reveal of kong himself it actually reaches points of great filmmaking yet too often it falls into traps  action sequences drag out way too long setups range from clunky to great and back again characters change behaviours and attitudes on a dime whilst others never change at all dialogue is clunky humour is scant to nonexistent and pacing veers wildly the net result is our level of interest often swamps between compelled and bored the product too schizophrenic and unpolished to be of real interest or rewatch value jackson obviously has put a lot of love into the product and it shows but unlike say lord of the rings in which he had so much background material that a three hour film barely covered it here he only has merian c coopers 1933 original story  one that was a cinematic classic in its time and certainly a big leap forward in terms of visual effects but much like the similar star wars forty years later wasnt exactly a movie notable for its inventive narrative taking that familiar albeit thin story and stretching it over twice its original length means that jackson has had to reinvent some key parts of it and does so with mixed success never quite overcoming the inherit flaws that come with both the original story and stretching out said material to its current length the first and weakest act sets up the characters and situation but takes over an hour to do it the logic here seems to be that the filmmakers are given time to develop most of these characters so that when they get killed well feel empathy for them trouble with that thinking is that we have to like or at least feel for all these characters and we dont watts and to a lesser extent black are the only ones of any interest as in that whole time theyre the only ones that get any development aside from that all weve got a bunch of onedimensional forgettable gruff sailing crew including an utterly vain actor a feral kid a stern first mate who loves lecturing the feral kid a geeky personal assistant pudgy film crew members and a sawyeresque captain who only seems to complain and look brooding andy serkis at least realises his human character of the ships cook is merely a caricature and plays up his cameo yet others eg brody try their best with some clunky setup for their character and ultimately end up a waste of space despite some impressive background matte shots the opening spends a bit too long on the ground of new york showing us watts and black having a run of bum luck and how fate brings them together still these scenes are necessary setup so are understandably inserted in and the two actors make the trite developments endurable they also play better than some of the early scenes onboard the ship where we get to see the aforementioned dull as dishwater crew what does work well in this first act is the suspense elements  jackson delivering a handful of really well done scenes the talk of the castaway pickup the first entrance into the fog the native attack and capture of ann that are appropriately foreboding and eerie despite one clunky misfire with the mate giving a long winded monologue that bluntly draws to clueless jimmy an analogy between their present situation and joseph conrads literary classic heart of darkness this leads into the second act within skull island itself which essentially plays out like jacksons attempt to do an entry in the jurassic park series most of the films action is concentrated here in a bunch of quite thrilling action sequences that suffer from the stephen sommers syndrome of trying too hard  sacrificing credibility in favour of making its sequences bigger and wilder a brontosaurus stampede is visually cool but goes on for far too long is truly stupid in terms of how the human characters are involved and contains some surprisingly slipshot effects a vampire bat attack serves only as filler in an already too long film a lot better is the bug pit scene which is suitably icky and at least one of the few bits of the film that feels slightly fresh theres also a cool action sequence between ann kong and some trexes which starts out well then turns into a overblown vine swinging affair before coming to a bonecrunching great ending where this act works is the establishment of kong and anns relationship easily the films strongest aspect jacksons languid pacing works to his advantage here giving us a little time to get to know kong as a character and understand him  such as a cute sequence in which ann performs her vaudeville routine for him and he responds with fun babylike tantrums and glee or the very sad scene of his capture the third act is back in new york and the famous climax which pretty much everyone is familiar with before it gets to that comes the theatre breakout brody looking soppy and watts tearing up over going back into showbusiness before being snatched by kong again like the second act theres many sequences that drag out most notably here kongs long rampage through new york and then transport of darrow to the empire state however once it reaches the building it becomes pretty thrilling with some great shots and visuals of the biplane attack performances are a mixed bag naomi watts is a great actress and delivers as always with a quality job that whilst not up with some of her other work nevertheless shows her commitment and really engages us as an audience  especially in some of the quieter moments jack black like will ferrell always seems to do the same old overblown schtick to me which i never particularly like yet here jackson has him playing against his usual grain more understated and serious than were used to seeing and it shows off a decent actor with potential underneath that could really shine not so well played is brody a man of obvious talent but a character so vapid and useless that brodys dour presence inhabiting it sucks the life off the screen especially in the nonaction scenes the rest of the cast ranging from bell to hanks all do serviceable jobs but none of them are given decent roles so dont get to do anything with their limited screen time visual effects are sometimes too rushed but work well for the most part the score is a little too bombastic but again works well for the material for the most part pacing veers wildly at times it drags on at other points its almost skips too fast over some  watts and brody share a moment talking in the corridor on the ship then suddenly it cuts to a very pretty scene with naomi on the stern of the ship crying against the sunset during a film shoot in that scene she spots brody and gets emotional and the next scene after that they make out in one of the cabins  the pair suddenly went from her insulting him to falling in love what did i miss with such a long voyage to the island the film also quickly jumps from kongs capture to his return to new york yet once there it takes an age before it hits the famous empire state building sequence when kong was announced one wonders why did they need to remake it and the final product offers no real answer to that question short of more impressive effects good remakes should improve upon their originals in every way not just in flash bang but in the core substance as well  with the exception of the konganne relationship aspect this fails to do that if you have a love for the original story or film then most certainly youll see the fun andor love this if you dont then while you probably will enjoy it the assorted flaws in its structure will stand out like sore thumbs and ultimately take away from it ultimately kong is a good film  its not a soulless endeavour like many a tentpole blockbuster its one obviously crafted with love and care and attention to detail yet its not a particularly memorable or even interesting one either certainly not when compared too some of the other remakesequel blockbusters of late which are more entertaining and emotionally engaging because they were tight and handled their familiar characters and plot elements far better a bit more time in the editing room couldve lifted it into great blockbuster territory  instead weve got a sporadically entertaining escapade that never captures our hearts like it so desperately wants too
Nov 1 2007,positive, i gave my heart to peter jacksons gargantuan king kong at the moment when the grizzled giant gorilla gave his heart to naomi wattss ann darrow as the scene opens theyre on a high ledge over skull island where the terrified wannabe actress realizes the big galoot who carried her off in the palm of his hand is her protector not her enemy a vaudeville veteran she tries to communicate by entertaining him with old routines kong is enchanted a spark of understanding passes between beast and beauty and lo the cinemas most venerable interspecies love story is born again theres a similar moment of crossspecies magic in the chronicles of narnia the lion the witch and the wardrobe directed by jacksons fellow new zealander andrew adamson it occurs early when lucy georgie henley the youngest of the pevensie children first emerges from the wardrobe into the enchanted land of narnia there she encounters a faun james mcavoy with hooves for feet an umbrella in his hands and a diffident english charm rather than pound his chest and roar he invites her for tea the two most eagerly anticipated hollywood entertainments of the holiday season are packed to the brim with all manner of digitally enhanced beasts mutants and slimy creatures centaurs and minotaurs talking beavers and the lion king aslan populate narnia a faithful politely rousing adaptation of c s lewiss beloved tale dinosaurs giant centipedes and the vilest and most phallic maneating slugs youll ever encounter pop up in the spectacular king kong its zoology that draws us into the theaterjust ask carl denham jack black the flimflam moviemaker who exhibits kong as the eighth wonder of the world but in both epics its the intimate moments that keep us there narnia brightly lit and kidfriendly has an appealingly oldfashioned feel to it adamson codirector of shrek wisely doesnt try to hipify the tale leaving its curious blend of medieval pageantry christian fable and childrens bedtime story intact lucy and her siblings have been packed off to the country to escape the blitz but encounter greater perils in narnia which has been turned into an eternal winter under the cruel reign of the white witch tilda swinton narnias greatest concession to contemporary movie fashion is in its elaborate battle which owes a debt to jacksons lord of the rings but thats fitting without the success of that movie narnia would never have been made and without rings on jacksons resume no one in his right mind would have given him three hours and 205 million for a king kong remake the gamble has paid off kong is a showy stateoftheart popcorn movie faithful to the spirit of the 1933 original but generously adrenalized with the best effects money can buy it takes more than an hour to get to kongs entrance the real fun doesnt begin until denham his screenwriter jack driscoll adrien brody and the ships crew crash on the island that time forgot where the natives are beyond unfriendly and the smallest bug is the size of an overfed housecat from here the movie goes into a delirious hourlong free fall of nonstop action highlighted by a marauding herd of brontosauri many battles later just as youre feeling enough is enough  jackson moves on to the famous third act kong in chains in new york kong on the loose kong on the empire state building his beloved blonde trying to ward off the lethal biplanes the remarkable thing is how deeply you believe in their emotional bond aside from blacks and brodys characters most of the supporting roles are forgettable or worse but you couldnt ask for a better ape credit goes not just to weta digital but to actor andy serkis who as he did with gollum in rings provided the physical moves that are the template of kongs character but its the look in wattss eyes that seals the deal actionmovie performances dont get much respect but what watts brings to this role is extraordinarya daredevils physicality a wistful melancholia an ironyfree emotional investment and needless to say a scream that could shatter glass
Aug 4 2007,positive, peter jacksons king kong is a massive fetish object  his christmas gift to himself for bringing home the bacon and the oscars with his lord of the rings trilogy hes unquestionably a master and this is unquestionably a piece of work  an impassioned act of tribute to jacksons favorite movie the hoary old 1933 original  but i cant really call it a masterpiece i found it diverting yet exhausting a nineteencourse meal from a chef who insists on feeding you long after youve unbuckled your belt and called it quits this kong rumbles on for three hours and seven minutes twice as long as the 33 version and also twice as long as jacksons previous and i continue to think his best ode to starcrossed love heavenly creatures yet the movies length isnt really the issue aside from a few flabby spots it flies by the problem is jacksons eagerness to wow you hes like a little kid making you sit through an epic reenactment of his fantasies using his toy dinosaurs and gorillas and not just one or two toys but dozens of them when the tramp steamer venture finally arrives at the desolate skull island after about an hour of screen time the heroes  including struggling actress ann darrow naomi watts obsessed moviemaker carl denham jack black and playwright jack driscoll adrien brody  spend lots of time running away from dinos bats large and disgusting bugs and a director with a serious case of overindulgence after a while the spectacle becomes like a blunt object grinding into your forehead in all versions of this tale the beasts tragic error is to fall for a blonde jackson has blithely retained the materials sexist and racist elements in some schools of thought the story is a warning to black men to stay away from white women naomi watts ann darrow is a comedienne who wins kongs heart by doing vaudeville routines the erotic subtext of the 1933 version who can forget kong pulling off fay wrays clothes and sniffing his fingertips and also the 1976 version is gone replaced by a sort of teddybear affection that goes both ways ann and kong think of each other as lovable pets she also asserts herself with kong but not nearly as much  or as amusingly  as jessica lange in the muchcriticized 76 remake king kong is curiously humorless for a movie about a 25foot simian going mooshy over a dame even at its sprawling length it scarcely has room to breathe jackson is always rushing along to the next thing and even the sporadic attempts at beauty like the overtly hallmarkcard moment when ann and kong enjoy a sunset and she teaches him the word beautiful a moment sappily reprised at the end are banal happily lost inside his weta kingdom in new zealand jackson appears to have forgotten what people are about he gets a terrible performance from adrien brody who seems restless  hes not a greenscreen actor by temperament jack black does orson welles lite cranking his damn camera when all hell is breaking loose jackson clearly identifies with carl denhams relentless showmans instinct but all we see is an arrogant twit willing to get everyone killed just to make a name for himself some of king kong is entertaining if oversold a fight between kong and one trex would be fine and was fine in the original but jackson has kong fend off three of them at once until we can finally enjoy a showdown between the big ape and the toughest of the dinos the new york of the 1930s is to use a cliché lovingly recaptured though its a new york known only in movies king kong is far from a failure of energy or imagination  jacksons enthusiasm is often infectious and the critical rhapsodies probably refer to the sheer big thick moviemovieness of the thing i succumbed more than once its good parts are enough to recommend it with serious reservations but dear god i wish jackson would shake off his addiction to gigantism his apparent need to punch everything up three times as much as it needs to be as the creators of another bigmonster remake a few years ago found out size isnt everything
Jul 14 2007,positive,mr jackson not only improves on the original he somehow seems to create the film that king kong was always meant to be
Jul 10 2007,positive, not just the ape but the budget cowriterdirector peter jackson forked out millions of his own dosh to finish this film the way he wanted it has that labouroflove look about it you could pitch the story from the back of a fag packet hollywood director accompanies skeleton crew plus a couple of actors to an island off sumatra where they discover a giant gorilla that takes a shine to the lead actress by means never entirely believable they bring the beast to new york where it is exhibited in chains at a theatre on broadway ape escapes finds girl and climbs the empire state building cue army and air force much screaming this latest version no 3 is so well made that discrepancies in the script and holes in the plot dont make any difference because you sit there with your jaw on the floor amazed by the bare brilliance of it jackson takes his time to set the scene gather his characters find the boat the director carl denham jack black has been grounded by his producers for wasting their money on footling safari pictures he grabs a camera and legs it out of there picking up an unemployed vaudeville clown called ann darrow naomi watts from outside a burlesque theatre and tricking playwright jack driscoll adrien brody into staying on board by the time they are at sea there is a warrant out for denhams arrest and ann is finding driscolls advances anything but unwelcome they reach skull island in a fog and immediately are faced by natives who live in caves protected from the rest of the island by a high wall and a gaping chasm they are not the topless patronisemyethnicpurity types who can be bribed with hershey bars they are vicious savage and superstitious the first thing they do after subduing the white invaders is string ann up in a wooden contraption that carries her across the chasm as a sacrifice to the great kong that part of the island where the natives never go is like conan doyles the lost world only scarier because the animals and insects have been supersized which makes you wonder about mrs kong and the kong kiddies where are they are they if not why not resistance becomes futile at this point anns ability to create a kind of rapport with this wild creature is neither sentimental nor beyond belief kong saves her many times from the carnivorous dinosaurs and she repays him with her trust it is unspoken unexplored and due to watts performance and kongs empathy the centre holds for this is the heart and blood of the film  beauty and the beast king kong is a bmovie dressed up to look like the real thing the story  edgar wallace had a hand in it which explains a lot  is pure pulp the romance between a starlet and a big monkey is on a par with those daft scifi flicks about blobs taking over midwestern small towns and yet jackson treats it with the utmost respect and makes you believe not by throwing money at the cgi bods okay he does but by caring so much its contagious like spielberg he is a film fan neither arty farty nor a snob he understands that genres have rules and you break them at your peril michael cimino broke them in heavens gate james cameron didnt in titanic jacksons king kong works on several levels as a monster movie a love story a boys own adventure a thriller a period piece and if looks could kill wed all be dead because every scene and every location has been immaculately prepared it is not difficult to think of half a dozen plot defects  whats ann doing walking about the streets of new york at night in a white satin dress with snow on the ground in mid winter  but they really dont matter the centre holds when you walk out of the cinema at the end something has changed is it the world is it you did the earth move ann teaches kong a sign word he uses it tentatively as they sit together at the top of the empire state building with the sun coming up over the hudson and the biplanes circling the word is beautiful
Feb 22 2007,positive,a phenomenal popcorn movie that eclipses the original in several respects but inevitably owes a huge debt to the powerful imagery and innovation of the 1930s landmark
Jan 25 2007,negative,this lackluster cure for insomnia might have been more palatable without so many distracting digressions and pared down to a manageable ninety minutes or so zzzz zzzz zzzz

Sep 25 2006,positive,naomi watts distinguishes herself in a luminous starmaking turn as ann  warm funny charismatic and far more than youd expect from the damsel in distress
Sep 10 2006,positive,jackson puts his passion for epics to good use and creates film magic
Jul 1 2006,positive, at one point in king kong naomi wattss ann darrow is desperately trying to read the mind of the giant gorilla which has claimed her as his new toy she fears that hes already bored with her and is about to hurl her off a cliff so she tries to entertain him with the moves shes learnt from her career in vaudeville she bounces through a soft shoe shuffle segues into an egyptian dance tosses in a handstand and somersault and finishes with a little juggling but at the end of the routine he looks more bored than ever he could be one of the jaded moguls who ruled the hollywood jungle in 1933 the year in which the film is set  harry cohn say whose nickname happened to be king cohn but as his gaze softens and he turns towards the horizon ann realises that all he really wants is somebody to appreciate the sunset with him kong is no king cohn after all hes an aesthete this doesnt mean that writerdirector peter jacksons highly anticipated kong remake is skimping on the schlockier attractions of merian c cooper and ernest b schoedsacks venerable creature feature kongs home skull island is jurassic parkonsea teeming with an array of land sea air and swamp monsters bent on demolishing all living things as grotesquely as possible and they really are experts in the art you laugh you shudder in oldfashioned bpicture style without ever losing sight of the fact that what youre watching is anything but bgrade its the most playful film of the year  as well as one of the most serious loss of innocence is one of its themes humankinds disconnectedness from the natural world is another but its also about the evil that can lurk behind the old hollywood mantra the show must go on or as the films quasivillain the movie director carl denham puts it when he conceives the idea of trapping kong and exhibiting him as a freak of nature  we can all have a piece of it for the price of an admission ticket admittedly theres nothing new in that line the carl denham character in the original film was prompted by the same sentiment but jacksons version adds edge and ambivalence played with beadyeyed zest by the comic jack black whos been given all the best lines this denham is not just a huckster hes a passionate huckster who fancies himself as an artist this injects a faustian note  as if jackson is sending up his own obsession with moviemaking by floating the suggestion that he too could be tempted into selling his soul in return for putting something as remarkable as kong up on screen the film begins in depression manhattan where the animals in central park zoo are only marginally more miserable than the new yorkers forced to find shelter in the shantytown next door yet the citys glories are there as well in the shimmering scenes of lights and skyline although its largely a digital creation augmented by sets built in new zealand the films new york has a wonderful solidity the tone of the script lightly pitched between satire and schmalz also carries you over the flimflam involved in getting denham and his film crew aboard a tramp steamer bound for the island with him are his stars bruce baxter played by kyle chandler having fun as a preening wannabe matinee idol and ann darrow who finds herself falling in love with the screenwriter jack driscoll adrien brody later when shes kidnapped by the islanders and given to kong as a present its driscoll who leads the rescue party as for kong himself although the computer has played a large part in his creation he could never be considered as anything less than real jackson has again drawn on the talents of andy serkis gollum from the lord of the rings and short of wearing a gorilla suit serkis has done everything possible to slip inside kongs skin as before his facial movements were recorded by the computer but this time they have been adapted to the bone and muscle structure of a silverback gorilla while the result avoids disneyfied anthropomorphism it leaves you in no doubt of what kong is thinking and feeling and what he feels for ann is something pretty complex the script wisely rejects all sexual innuendoes along with the idea of love at first sight its only after saving her from the islands other horrors and after shes adopted him as her protector that he responds to her charms hitching her on to his shoulder with the gruff insouciance of john wayne yet its a relationship that never loses its innocence later in manhattan we get a marvellously lyrical king kong on ice moment when the two of them venture on to a frozen lake in central park and slide around like children and in the climactic sequence atop the empire state building they reprise their first meeting by watching a sunrise together  the last kong will see for out of that sunrise comes a swarm of biplanes out to shoot him down as he tries to fend them off its as if hes making a lastditch stand against the future not surprisingly the script keeps the 1933 films famous concluding line  beauty killed the beast but this time it has a poignant new resonance as i said this kong is an aesthete  as is peter jackson

Feb 25 2006,positive,on the upside however that first hour is followed by a twohour roller coaster ride that climaxes with a breathtaking finale atop the empire state building in new york city
Feb 11 2006,positive,  watching peter jacksons version of king kong it is abundantly clear that the man feels as strongly about the original 1933 film as he did about tolkeins lord of the rings books one can really feel how earnestly he guided this film paying homage to the original while expanding on it more than just a little bit unfortunately the expansion is one of the problems with the movie but ill get to that in a bit   i dont suppose i really need to go into the story itself but there are a few changes from and additions to this version when compared to the 1933 film here ann darrow naomi watts is shown to be a stage performer at the outset of the film basically doing vaudeville shows during the great depression in order to make a living time is spent up front showing the state of things in new york city in regards to the struggle to survive in that devastating economic downturn to great effect we meet her coperfomers a tightknight little family including an elderly gentleman who passes for a father figure for her and we get to know at least ann and this gentleman well enough in the few early minutes of the film to really feel for them when the theater where they perform is unceremoniously closed down   cut to carl denham played by an unusually subdued jack black in a meeting with money men trying to pitch his movieinprogress and get more money to go shoot on location at the mysterious island indicated on a map which has just come into his possession he is portrayed as a man with a vision throwing his cinematic pearls before monied but ignorant swine the financiers have already sunk 40000 into his picture big bucks back then and decide to cut their losses and sell off what jack has filmed so far as stock footage   he talks his way onto the ship despite the captain not trusting him and also wrangles playwright jack driscoll adrien brody into coming along in order to finish the only partially done screenplay it turns out that the only reason ann decided to come along was because driscoll was writing the film and she was a big fan of his plays so one major difference is that instead of a lowly sailor driscoll is a well known and sophisticated playwright were also introduced to hayes evan parke who seems to play a role closer to that of the original driscoll and jimmy jamie bell as a young former stowaway out to prove himself   finally we find ourselves out to sea and on the way to the island it took a very long time to get to this point and we also spend what seemed to me to be an inordinate amount of time getting to skull island peter jackson took a while developing the relationship between jack and ann in order to make it more real for the audience the problem is that a lot of that effort went to support nothing more than jacks determination to not leave ann behind the real relationship in this movie is between ann and kong some of you reading this dont even go there   fortunately while a lot of time is spent showing the development of the kongann relationship it is time wellspent andy serkis the actor whose expressionsmovement is behind the cgi kong did a phenomenal job as did the animators of making kong real much like the original filmmakers the idea here was that the more fearsome kong was at the beginning of the film the more we would feel upon his death king kong and naomi watts really stole the show here no question   the time spent on screen showing the both of them was a joy to watch the process of the relationship changing from fear and curiousity to geniune caring and concern was completely believable however when the action shifted to the rest of the crew things did start to drag although the effects were spectacular there did come times where i found myself thinking isnt this scene over yet with a remake of such an iconic film one cannot help but make comparisons and many times throughout the film i asked myself why this one took three hours to tell the same story the original did so effectively in half that time   strangely the one character that i thought was going to be closest to the original was carl denham and he really wasnt i actually would have preferred to see jack black tap into some of his over the top energy to portray denham more like the barely supressed carnival barker that robert armstrong played in 1933 jack just never worked for me but not for the reasons i had expected going in i think it was more due to peter jacksons take on the character than the acting itself this denham was more human yes but he didnt strike me as the kind of man that would have the sheer force of will required to bring back the great king kong   towards the end of the film the scene where kong is introduced to the paying audience was quite well done and effective right through to where he escapes his bonds and rampages in times square there is a new sequence in this film showing how kong calms down once he finds ann and how they go off and reconnect like old friends until their peace is shattered by the military coming after kong   of course they eventually end up at the top of the empire state building but here again things seem to go on longer than they need to just for the sake of more screen time with kong and special effects when it does come down to the end and jackson focuses in once more on the characters it does all come together once more except for two things the weakly delivered it was beauty done killed the beast by jack black and the final scene between kong and naomi watts which looked like it was lifted straight from the end of titanic   final notes cgi effects especially for kong were flawless i did not for a second think i was looking at a cgi creation the scenes on the island with the natives might be too intense for the 7 and under crowd some of them looking really creepy and in extreme close ups that even creeped me out a bit   all in all a really good movie that could have been a great movie if it had 30 minutes or so trimmed from it of course the dvd version will probably be 4 hours long and will no doubt suffer for it  vic holtreman founded the popular movie news site screenrantcom back in

Feb 7 2006,positive,king kong sets a new standard for action movies and maybe for movie romances too you feel almost privileged to be in the presence of such an awesomely accomplished and exhilarating picture
Jan 26 2006,positive,why make a king kongfilm now since it has been recycled several times trotting out a new version exposes the story to how it still uses black and white tropes

Jan 19 2006,positive,the only slipup is a forgivable one jackson continues to be reluctant to leave a world he has so magnificently created at a little over three hours king kong is a bit of a bumnumber
Jan 15 2006,positive,again jackson proves himself an unbeatable showman with the soul of a poet he crafts and composes his action sequences like symphonies with the most eyepopping crescendos

Jan 1 2006,positive,jacksons king kong is a throwback film depending on you to approach it with a sort of wideeyed innocence you mightve forgotten you had its loud and unbelievable its supposed to be there arent any 25foottall gorillas in this world
Jan 1 2006,positive,three hours of magnificent escapist entertainment
Jan 1 2006,positive,i watched the last hour of the film with a knot in my stomach the result of a combination of the love story and the brilliant special effects
Jan 1 2006,negative,   if theres a common theme to movies released in 2005 it has to be an overly long running time in my opinion the perfect running time for movies is 90 minutes for a comedy and 2 hours for a drama far too often this year though especially in these last months running up to award season weve seen far far too many 2 and a half to three hour length movies king kong at a full three hours is at least an hour too long like a meal of good cooking it all tastes great theres simply too much of it and youll be fully sated long before it is over   the set up to the movie which isnt that complicated but takes a way too long to get going involves a down on her luck vaudeville actress ann darrow watts in 1930s new york who runs into an even more down on his luck movie director carl denham black whos about to sail off to an uncharted island to film what he hopes will be his masterpiece when his star actress quits he hires ann and along with a film crew the script writer jack driscoll brody and the ships crew of seedy adventurers set off in a tramp steamer for their destination on skull island and with their destiny   an hour into the movie and they finally arrive on the island where they are greeted by the not very friendly natives who kill several of the crew and kidnap ann so that they can offer her to the giant ape kong whom they seem to revere as a god by the time the gargantuan gorilla makes his appearance to swoop ann off into the jungle over an hour of the movie has already elapsed   the middle and longest portion of the film involves the misfit crews attempts to rescue ann this mainly involves them alternately running from and fighting a variety of cgi monsters ranging from dinosaurs to giant insects most surprisingly to me was the fact that some of the special effects are obviously quite phony particularly when they are running from the brontosauruses and the cliff is crumbling beneath them other scenes however are both exciting and well put together   while the crew is blindly crashing through the jungle ann in the arms of kong is being forced to contend with tyrannosaurus rexes and other creepier denizens of the island in the movies best action scene kong does battle with three of the rexes in a knock down drag out fight scene   by the time ann is rescued and kong is captured you are left feeling completely glutted on cgi action scenes and i was also left wondering just how in the hell did all of these monsters manage to live for so long on one god damn island i mean just how big is the fricking place the final climatic scene in new york is very well done with the exception of the silliest moment in the movie when kong and ann share a romantic moment in central park coming as it does during one of the tensest scenes in the movie makes it particularly annoying which brings up another confusing aspect of the film is the relationship between kong and ann supposed to be romantic or that of father and daughter either way its a little disturbing   as an action film kong would have worked superbly if only it had about an hour of its running time trimmed from the final release obviously however no one was prepared to tell peter jackson this coming as he was so hot off of the success of lord of the rings because of this the final result for king kong is that of a bloated and severely flawed movie  the lord of the rings movies were based on a series of long winded books it made sense that the movies were three hours plus king kong is based on a movie that ran just over an hour and a half there is no reason for it to be so long   peter jackson did the impossible with the lotr movies he turned an impossibly long complicated story into film masterpieces with all of the success from that series jackson may have become too full of himself king kong is just the story of a bored giant ape who likes hanging out with an actress   as scott wrote the action scenes seem to go on forever whereas they are the meat and potatoes to the movie they do not come until after an hour of screen time at that point in the movie you are almost ready for the climax of the film while the main characters battle for their lives on the island my 10 year old asked if the movie was almost over he was not bored with the movie in fact he has a stuffed king kong because he liked the movie so much it just seemed at that point in the movie that is should be about over   i actually enjoyed the first hour of the film where kong is no where to be seen however it almost feels like a different movie for this movie it should have been edited ann is an out of work vaudeville actress we see her perform and talk backstage to fellow thespians early on she shares a couple of emotional scenes with an older gentleman and then says goodbye to him he is never seen in the movie again she gets turned down for a role and referred to a burlesque theater all of that could have been cut start the movie with carl looking for an actress he finds her like he does in the movie   the biggest problem with king kong is that kong is just an overgrown ape how can the audience really invest any emotion into a movie about a monster okay so he is a lonely monster who saves ann a bunch of times but kong starts the whole thing by grabbing her in the first place so he does have what is coming to him   is there some messages in the film about leave nature alone or we can all learn to understand each other no matter what our species i have no idea i just saw an action packed special effects loaded film that went by fairly quickly for its running time but still could have been trimmed for better results   the original king kong in comparison to the new one had cheesy special effects and corny dialogue peter jacksons expensive new version is visually amazing 99 of the time but as both my brothers pointed out 2005 kong is bloated and slowly paced especially when contrasted with the 1933 original   i agree with eric the movie should have started with the search for the actress like the 1933 version which opens with a shot of the tramp steamer getting ready to leave port this is followed by a short scene where denham meets ann darrow and convinces her to join his adventure   also most of the journey to skull island should have been cut we really dont need to get to know all the crew members most of them will die or at the very least be gone from the picture by the time the action switches to new york city and to be perfectly honest none of the three main human characters are all that interesting anyway the ape has always been the star of the story   the cgi action is fun but it crosses the line of believability too often for example during the brontosaurus stampede you have denham and driscoll running around and between the feet of huge dinosaurs this goes on for quite a while but of course neither one is trampled when main characters can so easily escape dangers in this impossible manner it lessens any real tension sure some of the smaller characters die gruesome deaths but there has to be a logical reason for the main stars to live beyond just the fact that they are the stars know what i mean   the new york city scenes are very exciting and they do manage a bit of an emotional punch the climax on the empire state building is beautifully shot still i had stopped caring long before that   in all honesty im glad this version has failed to surpass the original cheesy special effects and corny dialogue notwithstanding the 1933 version is still a superior movie
Dec 31 2005,positive,peter jackson knows what it takes to make an exciting film
Dec 31 2005,positive,king kong ushers in a subtext  via a path of spectacular epic adventure  that we should preserve endangered species at all costs
Dec 30 2005,positive,the best thing about peter jacksons king kong may be that his attachment to the project likely kept anybody else from getting the job
Dec 29 2005,negative,peter jackson  overindulges his childlike wonder and the result is a monster movie on steroids
Dec 28 2005,positive,jacksons ape is so fully realized as a specific realistic character that he lacks the metaphorical resonance of the 1933 kong who seemed a creature captured from a nightmare rather than from nature
Dec 28 2005,positive, peter jacksons 500pound vision exceeds his 207million budgetary grasp occasionally in his epic take on king kong  mostly whenever the great apes not around kongs isolation as the dominant animal on skull island leads to insecurity boredom disdain anger  all soothed by the unlikely understanding of ann darrow naomi watts an actress who knows a thing or two about the bum hand of fate sure its impressive to watch a big angry monkey upend foliage like a tennessee williams character would furniture but kong is a fighter with unquestionable issues emotions and power hes identifiably human but also frighteningly animal this computergenerated creation is an exceptionally expressive effect that grabs both the throat and the heart actor andy serkis provided the same actorly basis for kong as he did for gollum in jacksons the lord of the rings films their work here along with the visualeffects crew sets an unmatchable standard for the medium that demands to be seen on the largest screen possible its unmatchable because the movie trots out a parade of other computer creatures that pale in comparison  dinosaurs gigantic beetles and nasty slimy sharptoothed worms that like to suck on their prey that last monster though does provide a horrific unsettling end to one of the films supporting characters a brontosaurus stampede is filled with toofrantic editing and digital clutter as is kongs display of physical prowess when taking on not one not two but three trexes at once the action is leaner crisper and more brutish when kong fights one antagonist  such as he does toward the end of the trex sequence as the brawl continues on a set of vines giving kong a smackdownstyle card of villains seems even more unnecessary given the films last act  the beasts majestic mindblowing and flawless solo rampage through new york city whether apocalyptically destroying a theater discovering snow for the first time or making his perilous climb atop the empire state building kongs final hour also is the films finest at an unnecessary three hours the takes a while to find its sea legs trying to drum up the same hardscrabble beats of depressionera squalor as cinderella man it doesnt quite get there not surprisingly the movie is more in tune with the passion and madness of filmmaking embodied by hearty helpings of heart of darkness symbolism and a surprisingly dark turn by jack black as director carl denham think paul reisers character from aliens always trying to turn a profit threatened with a cutoff of studio funds for his latest creature feature and without a leading lady denham hijacks his footage and hightails it for the new york docks there a crusty crew awaits to sail him and his filmmakers to what theyve been told is a singaporean film shoot along the way denham picks up downonherluck vaudevillian ann to play the lead and hijacks harried playwright jack driscoll adrien brody kicking digital butt brendan fraser style to provide him a suitable script ann and jack fall in love perhaps as convincingly as is possible in a threehour movie about a gorilla midvoyage denham reveals to everyone that theyre really headed for the mysterious skull island  a location on a treasure map source never revealed that jackson films the first mention of so as to suggest its the scariest place ever a foggy run aground tunes the violins for the symphony of destruction that is to come surviving the truly grotesque demonic cult of deadeyed skull island natives is but the first of the film and boat crews problems when they kidnap ann and offer her as a sacrifice to the mighty kong jack battles the islands creepy crawlies to save her and denham gets the idea that live theater might trump movies after all  especially if kong could be the star of the show if jack and ann arent quite the convincing couple ann and kong certainly are when all escape attempts fail she entertains it turns out that kong is a sucker for slapstick in a sensible scene showing a human appeasing the ape in a nonmeal manner ann and kongs communication with one hand gesture sets up a particularly heartbreaking moment in a transfixing climax that balances spectacle with intimacy and violence with restraint its a stupendous close to a breathlessly paced film that could have been an alltime great had jackson and company kept their focus more squarely on the title character
Dec 28 2005,positive, a technical achievement that lacks the soul of something really good
Dec 26 2005,positive,spectacle filmmaking at its peak
Dec 24 2005,positive,fancy outweighs the ferocious but the films also brazen enough to be unmissable
Dec 23 2005,positive,lost is the depression era fear of exploitation and now it is only beauty to fear
Dec 22 2005,positive,an action adventure with heart its the kind of movie experience you want to see on the big screen
Dec 22 2005,positive,for all the technical wizardry on display in director peter jacksons king kong there are overtones of insecurity here and there
Dec 21 2005,positive, a movie that proves the old adage a fool and his monkey are soon parted king kong is every bit as big as youve heard  and filled in with something like equal parts inspiration and cinematic hot air its 187minute running time is undeniably too much and really does seem born more of peter jacksons desire to attain the scope of his lord of the rings films than out of any dictates of the story lets face it this is a pretty simple tale overzealous filmmaker goes to uncharted island to make a movie finds giant ape brings ape back to new york ape then breaks loose causing death and destruction climbs empire state building and gets shot to death by airplanes everything else is incidental and while the incidentals are fun theres a limit without thinking about it too hard i could name at least three things that could be trimmed or cut out entirely that wouldnt hurt this film these things are just overkill  and not jacksonian overkill either they feel more in the realm of spielberg or lucas in a kind of simplistic more is better manner in other words if the 1933 kong fought one t rex the 2005 model will take on at least three of them if the sailors ran from a brontosaurus in the original theyll be imperiled by a veritable stampedes worth here if our old simian buddy picked up one woman saw it wasnt fay wray and blithely dropped her to her doom jacksons big monkey will do it in his search for naomi watts four times  to a point where you almost expect the venerable ape to grumble sure are a lot of blondes in this town that said king kong is a pretty remarkable film and one that was made by someone who is quite obviously nuts about the original evident even from the beginning when the opening credits  er  ape the design of the ones from 1933 jacksons kong is as much homage as remake  and that may well be its strength and its weakness in one package the director clearly intended to honor the 1933 film and for the most part he has the problem is that hes honoring not just what the movie was in 1933 but what it has become since then in our collective popculture consciousness when king kong came out in 1933 it was a somewhat different experience than it seems from the vantage point of 70plus years later thats in part because movies that were frightening years ago have become cozily familiar old friends now but its also because of changes made to the film in subsequent releases it used to be a common practice to rerelease popular titles to theaters  a practice that posed a problem for films made in the early 1930s what was permissible in the early years of sound was often not so after 1934 when the production code came into being to reissue a film after that point the movie had to be made to conform to those later censorship standards meaning that the films were often recut to remove offensive material as a result later releases of king kong were shorn of scenes of violence and sexuality footage of kong undressing ann darrow fay wray and subjecting her to some rather indelicate scrutiny were taken out as were scenes of kong chomping on natives and grinding them underfoot ironically no one caught the fact that fay wrays top comes off when she emerges from the water at one point meaning we actually see more of her anatomy than we do of naomi watts in these lesscensorious times  if you see the movie today you see it as it was originally released since the censored footage was cut back into it in the early 70s but the film attained much of its legendary status in its truncated form which made king kong less threatening less horrific and more sympathetic than he had been when the film was made kong was always as much victim as monster but he was a monster  something thats largely absent in jacksons version which plays up the sympathy angle moreover jacksons film buys into the fantastic notion put forth by several essayists over the years that theres a bond between the big fellow and ann darrow  a nonsensical notion since the original ann darrow spends the entire film screaming her head off whenever she deals with kong the one comment she makes about him is i dont like to look at him jack it reminds me of that horrible day on the island  hardly an expression of simian devotion jacksons ann watts is a different proposition one grounded in the bonding idea that change is understandable since the days of selling a mere damsel in distress are long over making darrow a more active participant in the proceedings is only reasonable the problem is that this not only robs kong of even more menace but  as with so much of the film  jackson takes it too far by the time the new darrow puts herself in harms way a second time and after kong has taken pains to try to keep her safe the film topples over into absurdity again you expect the ape himself to utter a complaint good lord woman wont you please stay put i wont even get into the gentle breeze atop the empire state building that merely ruffles darrows skirt in a decorous manner setting the new film in 1933 was smart the story works better in that time period not in the least because disposing of an overgrown gorilla posed a considerably greater problem then than it would now and jacksons film brilliantly captures the era though one might rightly question the choice of the late1940s decca recording of al jolsons im sitting on top of the world on the soundtrack to set the mood rather than the 1925 brunswick version theres an even more debatable use of a 1950s peggy lee recording of bye bye blackbird elsewhere in the film many of jacksons expansions are welljudged in the original it was never clear how filmmaker carl denham robert armstrong planned to give his latest documentary a love interest and a plot by simply dragging along an actress and a trunk of costumes turning seaman jack driscoll bruce cabot into playwright jack driscoll adrien brody whos along to write the script and throwing in a leading man bruce baxter tv actor kyle chandler makes more sense its also a bit cheeky on two levels making anns romantic interest a writer is almost certainly a nod to fay wrays reallife penchant for marrying writers john monk saunders robert riskin or becoming involved with them clifford odets the inclusion of a preening leading man named bruce no less suggests a casual distaste for bruce cabot as the hero in the original  a suspicion aggravated by cabot being the only star of the original not included in the films dedication theres room for criticizing the changes to the character of carl denham now played by jack black who is much more an unsympathetic egomaniacal opportunist here than in the original blacks denham has more in common with other unregenerate characters of the era  think of turning newspaper editor walter burns in the front page into a filmmaker  than he does with armstrongs characterization if it is wrongheaded its nonetheless deliberate this denham is actually given a line originally assigned to a newspaper photographer  let him roar it makes a great picture  that helps to fuel kongs fury to the point that he breaks loose and runs riot in new york making denham even more culpable that this denham sometimes resembles jackson himself is another point to ponder on a selfawareness level the addition of a subplot involving a sailor evan parke kiss kiss bang bang and his young protege jamie bell billy elliot is a strange case of the film wanting to stretch its fantasyadventure quality and imbue it with some deeper meaning the protege is reading conrads heart of darkness and finally realizes its not really an adventure story at all but this doesnt really go anywhere the screen time devoted to this subplot would have been better used explaining the rift between darrow and driscoll that exists by the time they get back to new york and it would have certainly helped to have incorporated denham into the films last act as it stands he simply vanishes once kong escapes and then wanders back into the film to deliver the famous last line  and it feels sloppy as if someone remembered he needed to return for that purpose at the last minute fans of the original should be delighted by the choice of recreating the original films sacrifice of darrow as the bride of kong as part of the stage show denham puts on with the ape in new york but this is a doubleedged sword since the use of the original max steiner score on the soundtrack for these scenes calls attention to the fact that james newton howards new score is rarely more than serviceable in fairness to the composer he was called in at the last minute to score the film after a falling out between jackson and composer howard shore fans of jackson will get a kick out of a crate labeled sumatran rat monkey a reference to jacksons zombie movie dead alive aka braindead of course its a simple matter to pick the movie apart you can do the same with the original  starting with questioning why youd build a wall to keep a giant ape out and then include a door big enough for him to come through not to mention how you kept from becoming monkey chow while the wall was being built im inclined to cut the movie some slack in a lot of areas because it does have a cumulative mythic power regardless of any missteps king kong is however a flawed work  sometimes in surprising ways while the new kong himself is a marvel i never felt i was looking at an effect but at a living creature the dinosaurs are another matter they come across as something less than believable  more like escapees from jurassic park than anything to do with king kong  and the effects in the frankly preposterous stampede are wanting still jacksons king kong is overall a pretty impressive show that definitely deserves to be seen in its theatrical incarnation this is not a movie to wait for on dvd rated pg13 for frightening adventure violence and some disturbing images the

Dec 18 2005,positive, carl denham black has a vision  okay well leonard cohen would call it a scheme  hes known for going and making safari movies but now his backers want more  so hes lined up a name actor kyle chandler and a name actressoops shes dropped out of the project  denham has to find a replacement actress watts get his screenwriter brody to finish his work and somehow convince everyone that theyre filming in singapore when in fact theyre headed to a place called skull island with nothing but a strange map of how to get there and a load of bad checks  once there however theyre going to get much more than they bargained for  much more indeed  mooha okay its nearly pointless to worry about spoilers for a film at least for major plot points  the only thing more ridiculous would be being concerned about the end of hamlet or something  we know where this is going  so the trick with this film is to make the ride to get there an enjoyable one  with jackson on board to make the film hes been wanting to make since before lord of the rings can the ride be worthwhile  adlongpostthe answer is of course an infuriating yes and no  first lets talk about what works  the action sequences on skull island are some of the most ridiculous things you will see in your life  just when you think things cant get more insane they do  again  and again  and youre wrong so many times you just give up and understand youre in the grips of a director whos absolutely out of his freaking mind  they are amazing  imagine jurassic park with a touch of starship troopers on some serious acidand youre close  and the effects are mindblowing  i had to continually remind myself that they did not in fact build a twentyfive foot tall ape for the movie  just like gollum theres no problem accepting kong as a fullblown character  im not sure if it was the sound that they used or what but everything felt like it had weight  impacts had real impact  when kong lays a smackdown he lays a smackdown and youre wincing because its just so damn real of course the effects amazing as they are are only part of the equation  andy serkis who also is unrecognizable as the cook brings kong to life like he did with gollum and his performance is impressive as well  i cant wait to delve into the behindthescenes stuff and see the split screen where they show him doing his thing before and after  serkis is just gifted thats all there is to it  the standout amongst the human cast is jack black because hes just got a lot to work with  and hes perfect for the part of the slightly sleazier carl denham we have here  watts and brody are good for what theyre there to do but watts gets to fall in love with a monkey and brody gets to lose out to a monkey  so theyre limited in material this brings us to some of the problems  first up the film is over three hours long and most assuredly did not need to be  it takes a while to get started and doesnt really start to flow until you get to the island  if you had chopped some stuff out of the beginning and maybe cut in half the number of times the planes would fly by without anything happening later on you might could lose thirty minutes easy  also jackson wants to make it crystal clear that this is a love story  i was under the impression he was beating the audience about the head and shoulders with it at times because during those sections it would work then slow then crawl to a dead stop  i get the feeling that jacksons love of the material led to him becoming a bit too enthralled to cut anything out of his baby  and either his enthusiasm was too infectious to be denied by others or everybody was ready to write him a blank check after lotr  dunno  and worse some bits in the film just dont make sense  peter i was with you until the sequence with the bats  thatsall i can say without spoiling some details  but after that i just couldnt recover  and once my ass fell asleep the ending just lost some of its punch  again some editing here and there would have been nice because of the problems what could have been a tentpole film that actually had to be seen to be believed is an overlong mess where the best bits are when kong is laying out the kicksplode  the moment the giant monkey isnt in frame you know that theres a good chance youre going to find yourself devoid of any tension and praying for some more action to take place  jackson has proven that he can outspielberg spielberg when it comes to overthetop action but anytime the fur isnt flying he really needs an editor  no i mean really  see it on the big screen for maximum carnage but see it in the afternoon to save coin and pack a lunch actually pj thought he had a 215 long movietil he started cutting it actually he had about 45 hours of material and the first thing the execs asked him to do when they saw it was add in more scenes i do agree though that the airplane sequence lost a bit of its zing still very very good movie with oscar written all over it
Dec 18 2005,positive,kong whips naomi about with enough fury to induce whiplash said brody ive heard of shaken baby syndrome but this babys head is about to fly off like a pebble in a slingshot
Dec 18 2005,positive, to begin with its a love story the oldfashioned hollywood kind that is rarely if ever attempted these days without first injecting enough winking snarky irony to justify this whole suddenly silly idea that love conquers all well to hell with that it does peter jacksons threehourplus remake of merian c coopers 1933 cinematic godhead is more than the sum of its gargantuan parts big budget bigger stars biggest simian ever its also a sweetnatured romantic fable albeit one that packs in carnivorous cockroaches rampaging brontosaurs and the everfreudian empire state building among its requisite emotional baggage and too its a corker of an actionmonster movie part rko serial natch part squarejawed testosterone infused manly romp and part classic journey into the unknown that recalls and references surprisingly and splendidly joseph conrads heart of darkness  mistah kong  he dead jacksons film is littered with canny references to coopers original  the director knows that film is untoppable a touchstone of dreams and dreamers the world over  but never fails to be its own unique hybrid much of that uniqueness which makes the whole familiar story fresh again comes from advances in specialeffects technology andy serkis lord of the rings gollum played kong for the motioncontrol cameras and then had his image animated into the final furry product resulting in an inspired and heartbreaking tour de force of acting and gimmickry thats hands down the single finest piece of specialeffects wizardry yet achieved its an oscarworthy performance that contains enough subtle nuance and emotional resonance to give technophobes serious pause this halfhuman halfcgi creation will make you reach for your hanky so bring one and snuffle with abandon the story by jackson philippa boyens and fran walsh is an expansion of coopers original filmmaker carl denham black unscrupulous unpolished and very much of his time and ours sets out aboard tramp steamer the venture to the uncharted skull island with watts starving vaudeville hoofer ann darrow and the clifford odetslike playwright jack driscoll brody in tow the sea voyage encompasses the first third of the movie and while it takes a bit too long to get going full ahead jackson luxuriates in it dropping a handful of coopers own shots into the mix while introducing the main characters their back stories and plausibly setting up the dread ahead skull island of course is the main attraction rife with flora and fauna both bewildering and beautiful and here kong is truly king the interplay between watts melancholy blond and the great ape is almost too real to be believed its touching and heartfelt in a way even modernistic noneffectsdriven films cant manage the films climactic act  the return to new york city all depressionera halffinished skyscrapers and hooverville encampments bordering the moneyed splendor of the great white way  is pure soulful hollywood filmmaking at its finest although the film was made almost entirely at jacksons new zealandbased weta studio its enough to make you weep not only for the displaced and doomed kong but for the nearly lost art of cinematic panache embodied here by the reckless denham and in our own reality by the genius of peter jackson and precious few others only jackson would have the presence of imagination to include a thirdact pas de deux in the frozen wonderland of central park the sequence borders on the cornball but rises above it by sheer oldfashioned hollywood chutzpah watching it you want to laugh but the awful lump already forming in your throat wont let you you know how it all ends a note to readers bold and uncensored the austin chronicle has been austins independent news source for over 40 years expressing the communitys political and environmental concerns and supporting its active cultural scene now more than ever we need your support to continue supplying austin with independent free press if real news is important to you please consider making a donation of 5 10 or whatever you can afford to help keep our journalism on stands
Dec 18 2005,positive,with king kong 2005 jackson has made a film that if you dont like it you might just hate movies
Dec 17 2005,positive,peter jacksons king kong provides a good stirring heroicsized motionpicture event without ever quite moving one the way his lord of the rings epics did
Dec 17 2005,positive, summary its a great movie made by the best director in the business who just wanted to honour the film that started his love affairs with cinema ok were both busy people so ill keep this brief king kong kicks the proverbial bottom yes at 3 hours its bumnumbingly long with too much exposition at the beginning and a slightlydissappointing ending and for some people who wont admit that black and white films are generally boring and only say they like them to look cool a remake of the 1933 classic might be considered a little pointless but this doesnt negate the fact that for pure abundant cinematic joyfulness peter jacksons latest magnum opus rocks out like several large boulders at a led zeppelin concert the film is a game of three halves the first bit is very well made but somewhat surplus to requirements as we follow ann darrow naomi watts looking like a healthy nicole kidman picked from the squalor of 1920s new york to be the lead female role in carl denhams jack black and his amazing acting eyebrows latest film which is set in some deserted island near sumatra as ann chugs along in the boat that will take her to meet her gorillashaped destiny she falls in love with the films writer jack driscoll adrien brody whose nostrils compete with kong as being the biggest thing in the film and theres a whole load of other interesting but pointless bits with young billy elliott gollum as a lardy chef and some scandinavian skipper after an hour of this lovingly created exposition we finally get to kongs island where ann gets kidnapped by native pole vaulters who look like they run a few stalls down camden market and is offered to the mighty beast as a nice juicy sacrifice we then get to the middle part of the film which is worth the admission price of the movie several times over for king kong is the best damn celluloid monkey since king louis suggested he wanted to be a bit more like youoooo he is by turns terrifying cute funny sad sarcastic and extremely large his relationship with ann is the cornerstone of the movie and its more believable than most modern hollywood couplings and as well as adding pathos to the film kong also manages to mash up a couple of freaking dinosaurs which is pretty damn cool the middle section of the movie is an unrelenting hour of action as a seemingly neverending number of the ships crew get chewed crushed ripped or sucked to death by the plethora of nasty beasties that plague kongs island its just bloody fantastic once kong gets captured and taken back to new york exactly how is never quite explained maybe he watered skied off the back of the ship the pace of the films dips a bit and by now your screaming buttocks might be asking why old peter spent so much of the films first hour not focusing on kong anyway denham makes the huge mistake of turning kong into a public spectacle and after a disagreement over a share of gross profits or something the monkey throws a bit of a moody and starts mashing up new york with a joyful abandon the only person who can calm this raging id is ann and the two of them spend a few brief and peaceful moments messing around on a frozen lake in central park in one of the most romantic scenes ive seen in a very long time and then some spoilsport yankee soldiers start trying to put an end to all of this monkey business by blowing the crap out of the big ol gorilla you probably already know the films ending which involves the empire state building and a bungee jump without the elastic so i wont go into it suffice to say kong and ann dont settle down whilst he gets a desk job and she raises their monkey man babies be prepared for a few tears before bed time so go see king kong its a great movie made by the best director in the business who just wanted to honour the film that started his love affairs with cinema but if you do go make sure you go to an early performance in a comfortable cinema and dont take the kids because theyll be asking wheres the monkey so many times in the first hour of the film youll be forced to send them back to the car with only a couple of jelly babies to keep them going king kongs long you dont get to see his schlong itll win a few gongs buy it on dvd and you cant go wrong but if you think your ass can take the punishment do yourself a favour and watch this one on the big screen you wont be disappointed
Dec 17 2005,positive,with a superb cast terrific special effects and stunning action sequences this is one of the best films of the year  thrilling aweinspiring and genuinely moving
Dec 17 2005,positive, eter jacksons king kong is spectacular but spectacularly flawed filled with several awe inspiring moments but ultimately undone by a director who is so in love with his subject that he is too blind to see when enough is enough universal was in a tricky position here after all jackson swept the 2004 academy awards with the epic lord of the rings return of the king which means that no one was going to tell him that he cant make a threehour king kong movie pity because someone should have grown a pair and put jackson in his place man wheres harvey scissorhands weinstein when you need him  set in new york during the great depression naomi watts is ann darrow a vaudeville performer who finds herself out of work when the show in which she performs is shut down she has a chance encounter with carl denham jack black a movie producer  con artist whos trying to keep his latest movie afloat even if it means stealing the footage hes already shot before his benefactors can sell it carl has plans of taking his cast whether they know it or not to the presumably uninhabited skull island and even tricks his screenwriter playwright jack driscoll adrien brody into staying on board just long enough to not be able to swim back to shore jack curses carl for his trick and tells him that he would rather write for the theater if you loved the theater that much you would have jumped carl replies  once they arrive on the island the crew encounters a most primitive race of humans who offer ann up for sacrifice to kong a gigantic ape kong takes ann but unlike his other sacrifices he doesnt kill her rather he seems enchanted by this exotic beauty and defends her honor against all sorts of suitors who would like to have her for lunch from dinosaurs to the biggest nastiest bugs youve ever seen carl of course has far greater plans than his movie once he sets his sights on kong and hatches a plan to subdue him and bring him to new york creating the most incredible show new york has ever seen  it seems simple enough on paper right take a stop motion classic from the 30s dress it up in some modern day special effects and everyone will be happy right well sure provided that the modern day action has some basis in modern day reality for example there is no way that ann is getting through the jungles of skull island at a dead run in bare feet likewise there is no way that the crew only loses one or two members under the feet of a stampede of brontosauruses in a ravine with velociraptors nipping at their heels theyre all dead simple as that also is it possible to have an island with so many predators and so little prey ann and her crew run into nasties both big and small from t rexes to the largest bugs you can imagine fans of stephen sommers only good movie deep rising will enjoy one scene in particular what were all of these baddies feeding on before the crew arrived perhaps its unfair to focus on what jackson got wrong before talking about the many things he got right for all of the times where jackson pulls a stunt that is nothing short of improbable watts should have been torn to ribbons in the finale the movie strums all of the right emotional chords at the right time we laugh at carls sleightofhand manipulation of everyone around him black was an inspired choice to make a very unlikable character likable we thrill at the sight of kong rescuing ann from three  t rexes were devastated when carl and the crew succeed in subduing kong in order to bring him to new york we laugh when kong discovers ice for the first time in central park and were devastated again when he meets his inevitable fate those emotional notes go a long way to erase the logical leaps of faith  its disturbing how few directors know this  and jackson makes these moments count still he could have told this same story in 75 of the time and it would have lost none of its emotional or visual impact if anything the impact would have been even greater king kong should absolutely be seen on the big screen jackson after all went for the brass ring the way that few directors do and despite his less than perfect results there is far more to like about kong than there is to decry the guy has balls damn it and you have to admire that however like every other guy with balls you cant help but want to kick him in the kitten every once in a while just to make sure he knows that hes not the only person on the planet who owns a pair its a philosophy that even kong would appreciate i imagine fans of universals threedisc deluxe extended edition dvd  will be disappointed to discover that the bluray release is but a shell of  that amazing set along with the extended and theatrical versions of the film  the only other extra to appear is an audio commentary with director peter  jackson and cowriterproducer philippa boyens sure some of the production  featurettes have been folded into the studios trademark ucontrol pictureinpicture  video track but even that feels rather anemic considering the deluxe   edition had more than six hours worth of bonus material including the excellent   documentary recreating the eighth wonder
